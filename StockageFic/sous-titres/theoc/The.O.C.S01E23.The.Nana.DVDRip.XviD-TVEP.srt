1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,431
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- How could he do it?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,830
- Lf Marissa found out...
- No, she cannot find out.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,399
You have sex with Julie today?

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,039
- We've got a connection.
- It's gonna end.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,474
Oh, my God. That's Hailey.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,518
- My mom's gonna freak.
- So don't tell her. Not that she'd care.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,558
- She would if she knew.
- They found Hailey working as a stripper.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,153
- So you wanna come home?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,915
You're dead! Don't ever come home.
You hear me?

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,071
- It never could've worked.
- You're breaking up with me?

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,071
I'm done having sex with Julie Cooper.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,356
- Marissa.
- I've gotta go.

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,751
Think. Where else could she be?

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,357
I don't know, man.
We've been all over town. Twice.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,875
I'm sorry, I just don't know
what to do at this point.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,713
We're not giving up.
We just gotta figure this thing out.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,598
All right, when she left she was upset.

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,513
So she probably went somewhere
she would feel safe, right?

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,513
Yeah, well, somewhere no one's even
gonna think to look for her.

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,990
- Including us, apparently.
- Well, maybe she called. Where's Cohen?

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,754
Yeah. Maybe she called,
and he went after her.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,480
Maybe he's asleep. Hey, Cohen.

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,949
- Get up.
- It's my precious. You can't have it.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,033
- Hey, what's wrong?
- You were asleep, that's what's wrong.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,555
- I was adjusting my back.
- Did Marissa call?

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,632
I would've heard the phone even
if I was sleeping, which I wasn't.

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,233
I was adjusting my back.

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,960
There's a missed call, though,
which is weird... Okay.

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,953
Meanwhile, Ryan and I are driving
around all night like idiots.

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,953
Well, none of this would've happened
if it wasn't for you, so...

31
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,599
Shut up. It was an accident.

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,275
Did you accidentally sleep with Marissa's
mom or accidentally tell Marissa?

33
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,079
- I'm in no mood.
- Keep it in your boardshorts next time.

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,958
That was her.

35
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,314
- What'd she say?
- Not much.

36
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,710
Just that she's okay.
And not to try to follow her.

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,677
Where is she?

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,673
- She's not here.
- Why don't I believe you?

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,193
Luke.

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,511
What's going on in here?

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,956
Marissa took off
when we got back from L.A.

42
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,270
- She ran away.
- Why? What did you do to her?

43
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,112
- I didn't do anything, you did.
- What?

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,111
- They know.
- Shut up, Luke.

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,034
They saw us outside the motel.

46
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,708
Marissa knows too.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,276
Will you boys excuse us, please?
Ryan and I need to have a talk.

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,073
- Whatever you think you know about me...
- I don't care about you.

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,993
I just wanna get her back home safe.

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,557
- You really don't know where she is?
- I know she's okay.

51
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,280
She left a message
saying not to look for her.

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,911
So, what am I supposed to do?
Last time she took off, she almost died.

53
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,308
I'm gonna call the police.

54
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,438
Yeah, what are you gonna tell them
when they ask why she left?

55
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,835
- I have to at least call her doctors.
- So you can have her locked up again?

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,879
If that's what it takes, yes. I will not
have her hurting herself anymore.

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,635
Maybe you should've thought of that
before you slept with her ex-boyfriend.

58
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,792
I would love to stay
and chat with you, Ryan...

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,554
...but I have to find my daughter.

60
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,192
Not if I find her first.

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,879
- So, what's the GP, RA?
- I have no idea what you just said.

62
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,268
Game plan, Ryan Atwood.

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,237
- Just using initials now?
- They save time.

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,231
- Not if you have to translate them.
- GP.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,594
- Game plan?
- Good point.

66
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,320
You gonna ride around Newport
looking for Marissa's car...

67
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,914
...while I go talk to Summer?
- You have a better idea?

68
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,878
Not yet. But maybe
after a nice, healthy...

69
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,836
...massively over-the-top breakfast.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,198
Hey, guys. We've got eggs, waffles,
three different kinds of pancakes.

71
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,557
- Wow, Hailey, what's the occasion?
- I was in rough shape last night.

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,837
I didn't get a chance to thank you guys
for convincing me to come home.

73
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,076
So, hungry?

74
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,073
- Yeah.
- Oh, my... What is going on here?

75
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,710
Mom, Hailey made three different kinds
of pancakes and waffles.

76
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,952
They're deliciously redundant.
Have a blueberry, they're good.

77
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,510
Coffee? Here, have a seat.
Let me just get this out of your way.

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,592
Hailey. The want ads already?

79
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,273
Yeah, it's mostly restaurant gigs.

80
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,398
But it's not like I have any other
marketable skills, so...

81
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,235
I know of a hostess position available.
A speakeasy I call The Balboa Lighthouse.

82
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,631
That's a good idea, except you have
to ask Sandy when he's in a good mood.

83
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,030
We have to get all the bread
out of the house.

84
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,633
Now's not really a good time.

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,155
Hailey made three different
kinds of pancakes.

86
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,392
Enjoy them now. We only have
two hours to unleaven the entire kitchen.

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,074
- What does that mean?
- My mother's plane lands at noon.

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,199
If she sees us eating pancakes on the
first day of Passover, she'll <i>plotz</i>.

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,477
I love when the nana comes,
and Dad's all Jewish again. I have to go.

90
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,076
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, I should probably get dressed.

91
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,196
Honey, do we have any brisket?

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,273
The Ackermans are looking after the
food for the Seder. We're bringing wine.

93
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,749
Right. Except we're not going
to the Ackermans'.

94
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,798
- Since when?
- Since I told Ma we're having Seder here.

95
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,712
- You what?
- Which, if she asks...

96
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,350
...is something we do every year.
I also told her you converted.

97
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,034
I'm kidding.
About the conversion part.

98
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,114
Honey, you're not gonna have
to lift a finger. I'll shop.

99
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,070
She'll cook. The kids will help. Hailey and
Jimmy'll be here. Ryan can invite Marissa.

100
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,196
- Seth can invite Summer.
- What am I gonna do?

101
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,920
Sit back and let your mother
take over the entire house?

102
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,868
She was gonna do it anyway. At least
this way, we get a decent meal out of...

103
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,758
- Are you done with these?
- Sandy, don't.

104
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,718
We don't know where she is,
but she called to say she's okay.

105
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,313
I know, she called me too.

106
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,233
- What? Summer, why didn't you tell me?
- She told me not to.

107
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,119
- Summer, if you know where she is...
- I don't. I swear.

108
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,191
She's gonna be fine.
She just needs time.

109
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,238
Me and Ryan don't have time.
My nana gets into town in an hour.

110
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,437
Wait, your nana? That is so sweet.
I wanna meet the nana.

111
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,830
- You really don't, believe me.
- I love old people.

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,673
- They're so cute.
- Yeah, well, the nana, not so cute.

113
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,876
- Really, she's ugly?
- No, she's just scary.

114
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,157
- I can be scary too. I think I can take it.
- Yeah, I don't think I can.

115
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,790
The nana's very judgmental,
and she's political and opinionated.

116
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,475
Right. And I'm dumb and shallow
and have no opinion whatsoever.

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,437
- I didn't say that.
- Not out loud.

118
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,433
- You're ashamed of me.
- That's not true. Okay?

119
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,636
I'm not ashamed of you, Summer.
I'm protective.

120
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,791
You're gonna thank me for this,
I promise.

121
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,678
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

122
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,751
I have to pick up some stuff
for the Seder.

123
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,514
- The what, now?
- The Seder, for Passover.

124
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,676
Yeah, you're not meeting the nana.

125
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,635
Sandy, what are you doing?
Rosa just put those on.

126
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,917
Yeah, I know. But I thought maybe
these sheets were a little too fancy.

127
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,719
They are fancy.
They're 700 thread-count Pratesi sheets.

128
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,030
- I don't want her to know that.
- How would she know?

129
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,038
- She might check.
- Why would she care?

130
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,351
She's a social worker in the Bronx
and has been for 40 years.

131
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,353
Whatever little bit of extra money
she can scrape together...

132
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,318
...she gives it to the ACLU
or Franklin Armory Women's Shelter.

133
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,552
- She's not out buying fancy sheets.
- Technically, I bought the sheets.

134
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,871
You with your sheets, and me,
I've left the public defender's office...

135
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,112
...so I can make a ton of money
and open my own restaurant.

136
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,316
- I think they call that success.
- No.

137
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,914
Not according to Sophie Cohen
and not even Sandy Cohen.

138
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,709
You know why she's coming out here.
It's not for a visit, not for a holiday. No.

139
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,757
She's staging an intervention.

140
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,831
To put me back on the path
to righteousness.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,912
- Or, in Mother's case, self-righteousness.
- That's not true.

142
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,150
- No?
- Your mother just wants you to be happy.

143
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,912
No, she doesn't believe in happy.

144
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,753
If you're happy,
you're not working hard enough.

145
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,549
I know where Rosa keeps the sheets
that don't feel so fancy.

146
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,960
- Hey.
- Hey. I was headed to the restaurant...

147
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,954
...and I thought I'd visit, see how you're
doing after our big adventure last night.

148
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,271
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just embarrassed mostly.

149
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,397
Embarrassed? Why? Come on.

150
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,993
You found me at a strip club.

151
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,755
Hey, there is nothing wrong
with a good strip club.

152
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,112
Not that I would know or anything,
because I, you know, just...

153
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,633
- I wouldn't know.
- No, right, of course not.

154
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,116
So, what are you gonna do? You gonna
go back to L.A.? You gonna stay here?

155
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,472
What do you think I should do?

156
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,596
Well, it's not my decision...

157
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,675
...but you've got family and a place
to stay and people who care about you.

158
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,833
Yeah?

159
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,954
Yeah.

160
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,713
So if I were to stay...

161
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,236
...would that mean that...?
- Hailey.

162
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,548
Be right there.

163
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,869
- You wanna come in?
- No, I gotta go back to work.

164
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,800
- Will I see you later?
- Well...

165
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,428
- You gonna be around?
- Sure.

166
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,797
- Well, then I'll see you later.
- All right, then.

167
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,716
Hi. You guys want some help?

168
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,189
- Thanks, Ryan.
- No, they're fine, man. Have a seat.

169
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,918
Any luck?

170
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,920
I looked everywhere.
The house, the restaurant, the beach.

171
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,672
- Yeah? We'll find her.
- All right.

172
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,275
Who's coming with me to the airport?

173
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,593
Come on. Seth.

174
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,995
Ryan, come on.

175
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,874
Anybody?

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,037
You're not ready for the nana?
No one's ever ready for the nana.

177
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,553
That woman is scary.

178
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,073
Hello?

179
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,716
- It couldn't be.
- The front door's wide open.

180
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,678
A person could walk in here,
take everything and kill us all.

181
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,637
It is. It's the nana.

182
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,956
Ma, what are you doing here?
I was just coming to get you.

183
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,680
Well, you would've been very late.
I'm kidding.

184
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,354
The plane was early.
I took a taxi to surprise you.

185
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,511
Are you surprised? You look surprised.

186
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,398
- I'm surprised.
- Sweetheart.

187
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,269
Hello, Kirsten. Look at you.

188
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,389
So beautiful with the hair and the nails.
Those classic features.

189
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,556
And there's my grandson.

190
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,119
Who never writes, never calls...

191
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,670
...because he's too busy
being chased by the California girls.

192
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,875
- How are you, Setheleh?
- How are you, Nana?

193
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,600
You must be Ryan.
I'm very happy to meet you.

194
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,792
- Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

195
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,791
- Thank you.
- You, I don't know.

196
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,828
Sophie, you remember my sister, Hailey.

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,116
Oh, right. The bad seed.

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,390
I always liked you best.
Don't tell the others.

199
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,589
Look at this house.

200
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,195
And this yard.

201
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,275
And that view of the ocean.

202
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,516
I'm sorry, but I just gotta say it.

203
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,073
- Here it comes.
- California.

204
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,188
Not so terrible.

205
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,958
All right. Where else could she be?

206
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,190
I don't know exactly
who that woman was, Ryan...

207
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,316
...but that was not the nana.
- She was nice.

208
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,471
She was nice, Ryan.
That's the problem, okay?

209
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,790
The nana's not nice.
I love her, but she's not.

210
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,430
- Who haven't we thought of?
- I hate to say it, but what about Oliver?

211
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,716
I talked to the hotel.
He's in the hospital.

212
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,350
She was even nice to my mom, Ryan.

213
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,590
The nana has never
exactly cared for the Kirsten.

214
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,432
- Really?
- Yeah. Are you kidding me?

215
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,716
She's the Green Arrow
to my mom's Hawkman.

216
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,752
The Wolverine to her Cyclops, dude.

217
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,357
Two people who have nothing in common
suddenly getting along. It's not right.

218
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,158
It's just not natural.

219
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,518
I know where she is.

220
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,071
- Took you long enough.
- Is she here?

221
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,958
Yeah. She won't be happy to see you.

222
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,078
How is she? Is she okay?
I can't believe she came here.

223
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,151
- I was surprised too.
- You should've called.

224
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,880
- I couldn't. She asked me not to.
- Her mom's freaking out.

225
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,759
She's about to call the cops,
so I better just get her and go.

226
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,037
What the hell is he doing here?
Did you call him?

227
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,872
- No.
- This is unbelievable.

228
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,110
So he just shows up on the day of?

229
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,999
You just stay the hell away
from me, okay?

230
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,793
Excuse me.

231
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,554
Day of? Day of what?

232
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,237
Our engagement party.

233
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,517
- Everybody finished?
- Thanks.

234
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,275
Sophie, is there something special
that you'd like Hailey to pick up for you?

235
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,319
No, sweetheart, I'm sure that whatever
you kids do every year will be just perfect.

236
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,597
We were kind of hoping we could
talk you into the Sophie Cohen special.

237
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,354
- The brisket, the macaroons.
- I don't do macaroons anymore.

238
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,239
- Come on, Ma. It's Ryan's first Seder.
- How do you know that?

239
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,597
They have Jews in Chino. Why do you
think they want a P.F. Chang's?

240
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,832
I like that he goes back to the old
neighborhood. Speaking of which...

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,434
...guess who asked about you recently.
Sean Sullivan.

242
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,160
- Sully.
- He and your dad were in a gang together.

243
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,709
- Did you know that?
- Yeah? Bloods or Crips, Father?

244
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,110
- It was a youth group.
- After his father left us...

245
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,114
...I had to work so much, he was pretty
much raised by the entire neighborhood.

246
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,231
Yeah, well, somebody had to do it.

247
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,669
Well, when am I gonna see
your new restaurant?

248
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,877
- You want to?
- What did I just say?

249
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,033
I'll just go freshen up
and then we can go, huh?

250
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,192
- Who is that woman?
- Not the nana.

251
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,112
Come on, guys.

252
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,999
Maybe she's changed.
Maybe she's mellowed.

253
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,958
Maybe she's genuinely happy to be here.

254
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,475
- Yeah, something's up.
- I'm gonna find out what it is.

255
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,837
Sandy, don't.
Whatever that woman is, I love her.

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,230
She's sweet, she's kind, she's helpful.

257
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,476
I'll get it.

258
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,438
I'm begging you, leave it alone.

259
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,799
- Hello. May I help you, dear?
- Hi.

260
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,474
You must be the nana.
I'm Summer. Shalom.

261
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,915
Oh, well, hello.
Are you a friend of Seth's?

262
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,116
- Well, as a matter of fact, I'm his...
- Summer.

263
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,236
Hey. What are you doing here, buddy?

264
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,873
I was in the neighborhood and
thought I'd bring macaroons by...

265
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,508
...for the Seder tonight.
- Oh, how sweet, Summer.

266
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,797
- You shouldn't have.
- Really, you shouldn't have. Okay.

267
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,269
- So are you two...?
- Yes, we are.

268
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,271
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

269
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,796
Wonderful. Then you'll be here tonight,
yes? You can ask the Four Questions.

270
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,598
Thank you, nana, I'd love to.

271
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,149
I was just getting my Haggadah
to get copies made.

272
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,312
Oh, no, I can do that for you.
I love a good Haggadah.

273
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,836
You know, it's the prayer book
containing the Seder ritual.

274
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,834
Somebody knows her stuff, huh?
Seth Cohen, you're a very lucky man.

275
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,272
Thanks.

276
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,429
- Listen. Wow.
- She's not scary. You're the scary one.

277
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,477
You're scary with the hitting
and cookies.

278
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,518
Are you afraid I'll embarrass you
in front of the nana? I'm not.

279
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,672
I'm gonna study this thing so hard,
I'm even gonna out-Jew you.

280
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,270
You're reading it backwards.

281
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,117
Thanks for the cookies.

282
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,993
Wow.

283
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,117
So when's the wedding?

284
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,559
June.

285
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,072
- I wanted to call you and tell you.
- Yeah?

286
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,472
- I thought you didn't want this.
- He really loves me, Ryan.

287
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,319
How do you feel about him?

288
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,711
You don't get to show up the day of
my party and ask questions like this.

289
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,677
It's not like I knew this was happening.

290
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,432
- I knew you'd be this way.
- What way?

291
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,795
You ran away to Newport
to get away from him.

292
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,996
Yeah, like when you left Chino?

293
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,276
Ryan, you made it.
You see, Theresa?

294
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,113
I told you he'd come if we invited him.

295
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,874
- Yeah, Mom, he didn't come for the party.
- No?

296
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,678
He came for me.

297
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,513
- Hey.
- You promised you wouldn't call him.

298
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,591
- She didn't.
- Then why are you here?

299
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,830
I'm here to make sure you're okay.
Get you home.

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,356
Then you wasted your time,
because I'm not going anywhere.

301
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,989
Hey. What's all this?

302
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,472
Pasta, cookies, cupcakes,
in all their leavened goodness.

303
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,553
And an invitation to Seder dinner
tonight. All courtesy of...

304
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,631
...the Nana Cohen.
- Wow.

305
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,917
- Today is my lucky day.
- You have no idea.

306
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,036
Look, Hailey, we can't...
We can't do this.

307
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,513
But I thought when you showed up
at the house this morning...

308
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,797
...when you came to L. A to find me...
- I was worried about you...

309
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,316
...and wanted to be sure you were okay.
- I can't believe this.

310
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,436
Kirsten's my best friend.
Sandy's my partner.

311
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,909
- This restaurant is all I have.
- What are you doing?

312
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,196
Showing up at the house?
Showing up in L.A.?

313
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,670
Telling me how much you care
about me? You don't care about me.

314
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,432
- Of course I care about you.
- Right.

315
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,478
Just not as much as
Sandy and Kirsten and the restaurant.

316
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,074
- Wait.
- For what?

317
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,831
I'll see you, Jimmy.

318
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,074
Marissa, come on.
Everybody's worried about you.

319
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,595
- Who? Luke? My mom?
- That's over now.

320
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,673
Maybe for them, but I still have to live
with it. I just don't have to live there.

321
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,310
- You can't hide out in Chino forever.
- Maybe not, but I can for right now.

322
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,310
Theresa said I can stay in Arturo's room,
and that she'd help me find a job...

323
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,109
...until I can save enough money...
- To what? Run away?

324
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,710
Your mom's already threatening
to call the cops.

325
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,189
- And your doctors...
- So, what am I supposed to do?

326
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,828
- I can't go back there.
- I'm not going back without you.

327
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,956
Then I guess you're not going back.

328
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,395
I wish the floors had been finished
before you saw the place.

329
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,757
- The floors were fine.
- How was the restaurant tour?

330
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,673
- It was nice.
- It was nice? That's all I get? It was nice?

331
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,478
It was very nice.

332
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,712
- What? What do you want me to say?
- Ma, what do you wanna say, really?

333
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,749
Come on, this Jewish Mary Poppins act,
I'm not buying it.

334
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,796
- What are you doing here, really?
- You invited me.

335
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,916
I've invited you every year
since Seth was 13.

336
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,514
I've been working.
You know what my caseload is like.

337
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,116
That's why I left the PD's office.
So I could spend more time at home.

338
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,759
That's not why you left, Sandy.

339
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,117
And I have more time and resources
to help the people in the community.

340
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,316
You're not helping,
you're opening restaurants.

341
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,436
- That's not true.
- Who's talking to you?

342
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,556
Do not speak to her like that
in this house.

343
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,073
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,518
But you know what?

345
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,315
You won't have to
put up with it much longer.

346
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,790
There she is. She's coming back.
The Sophie Cohen we all know and love.

347
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,036
Think it's funny? You'll see
how funny it is when I'm dead.

348
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,556
You're kidding.
You're gonna outlive us all, out of spite.

349
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,678
Well, Dr. Talley disagrees with you.

350
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,071
He gives me four to six months, tops.

351
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,076
He says I have advanced lung cancer.

352
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,670
You wanna know why I came?

353
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,635
I came to say goodbye.

354
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,951
- Why are you still here?
- Look, man...

355
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,588
I ask Theresa to marry me,
and she goes and finds you.

356
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,116
We work everything out and on the day
of our engagement party, you show up.

357
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,271
- I'm here for Marissa.
- She doesn't want you here.

358
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,671
And I sure as hell don't want you here.
You understand?

359
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,990
Look, it's my engagement party, okay?

360
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,072
I'm going to get a drink,
when I come back, don't be here.

361
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,151
- I'm not leaving without her.
- Yes, you are.

362
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,515
- Look, you don't wanna do this.
- No, you don't wanna.

363
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,318
He told you to go. Now, go.

364
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,430
- Hello?
- Did you just call me?

365
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,511
- <i>Yeah, but</i>...
- Well, where is she?

366
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,433
- I'm not telling you that.
- Don't make me call the police.

367
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,433
I would hate to tell them
you're holding her against her will.

368
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,672
- You wouldn't do that.
- Just get her home, now.

369
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,277
Ma, please, come on. Sit down.
We have to talk about this.

370
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,432
No, we don't. What we have to do
is put this brisket in the oven...

371
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,479
...or we'll be eating at midnight.
- I'll get that for you.

372
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,029
Thank you, doll. Sandy said
you were a lox in the kitchen.

373
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,760
- Don't change the subject.
- There is no subject.

374
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,798
- I'm not talking, I'm cooking.
- You can't drop a bomb like that...

375
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,916
...and not talk about it.
Why tell me then?

376
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,072
I didn't want to. You kept hocking me.
It slipped out.

377
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,518
- Have you told anybody else?
- No.

378
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,309
Not your sister. Not your brother. And
don't tell anyone either, especially Seth.

379
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,358
- Why not? He deserves to know.
- Because it's my business.

380
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,919
I will tell him when I'm ready.

381
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,038
Now, he's coming back here
with Summer any minute, so...

382
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,192
Well, what about the treatment?
What did Dr. Talley recommend?

383
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,035
- The surgery? The chemo? What?
- Sure, but what's the point?

384
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,113
By the time I saw Talley,
it had already spread...

385
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,111
...so that's that.

386
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,235
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna make dinner.

387
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,437
I'm gonna enjoy what's left of my life,
and I hope you'll do the same.

388
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,956
- I want you to see a doctor out here.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

389
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,318
We have an incredible oncologist.
When my mother had ovarian cancer...

390
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,630
She had the treatment? The chemo?

391
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,355
With the hair loss and the nausea?

392
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,958
- Did it work?
- No.

393
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,356
But we had a chance
to spend more time with her.

394
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,636
- You wanna spend more time with me?
- Yeah.

395
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,872
You left home when you were 16
and moved clear across the country.

396
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,838
I had a scholarship and a chance
to make something of myself.

397
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,991
You married a woman
whose father represents...

398
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,674
...everything I have fought against
my entire life.

399
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,718
I didn't marry her because of
her father's politics or principles.

400
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,395
Oh, what politics? What principles?
Oh, God, what am I doing here?!

401
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,279
I hate this state! I hate the sunshine!
I hate the ocean!

402
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,510
I hate Schwarzenegger!

403
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,036
- Come in.
- Hey.

404
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,791
- You look...
- It's Theresa's.

405
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,392
- What happened to your arm?
- It's just a scratch.

406
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,596
Eddie and his guys
don't really want me around.

407
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,355
- I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.
- It's okay. We just need to leave.

408
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,556
We need to get some alcohol
and clean this arm.

409
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,188
No, look, it's fine.
We can just deal with this later.

410
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,397
We're not going anywhere.
So just get the phone. I'll talk to Eddie.

411
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,592
No, look, I...
You don't wanna...

412
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,598
- Hello?
- Hey. Come home right now.

413
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,354
- What's going on?
- I don't know. The nana's scary again.

414
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,478
Mom and Dad keep asking when
you're coming home, and I'm at a loss.

415
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,471
- Is Marissa okay?
- How's Marissa doing?

416
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,313
She won't leave. So now
Eddie's threatening to kick my ass...

417
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,311
...and Julie's threatening
to have me arrested.

418
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,189
Why is this night different
from all other nights?

419
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,952
Okay, just come home, man.

420
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,475
You said it yourself,
Marissa's fine, all right?

421
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,870
<i>There's nothing more to do.</i>
<i>It's her mom's problem.</i>

422
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,873
- I can't just leave her here.
- You can't stay, either. Please.

423
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,554
- We have the nana happening.
- For on all other nights...

424
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,469
...we eat either "chamitz" or "matzah."
- Chametz or matzo.

425
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,392
- Look, I'll try, but...
- <i>No. No trying.</i>

426
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,438
Come home. Now. I have to go.
Summer's having a Hebrew hernia.

427
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,999
<i>Cohen.</i>

428
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,752
Luke.

429
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,635
You can't be here.
Kaitlin's in the kitchen.

430
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,916
I know, I know.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

431
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,877
It is not your fault, okay?
I'm the grownup here.

432
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,396
I'm the one who should know better.
I'm the one who's lost her daughter.

433
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,516
You're not really gonna
lock her up, are you?

434
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,552
Honestly, I don't know what else to do.

435
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,911
She's a kid, Luke.
She's run away again.

436
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,150
And if she doesn't come back
on her own...

437
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,229
...what other choice do I have?

438
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,436
I need her to be safe.

439
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,556
You gotta be kidding me.

440
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,317
Darling, the only nice thing about having
cancer is that I can smoke all I want.

441
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,835
Try not to ruin it for me.

442
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,471
I called Dr. Talley.

443
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,551
Please tell me you did not do that.

444
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,913
- He says you haven't returned his calls.
- Well, I've been busy.

445
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,719
And while he says there's no cure,
you can slow it down...

446
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,872
...if you take the chemo and radiation.
- And slow me down too.

447
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,349
- Might not be such a bad thing.
- Sandy.

448
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,795
I have kids in the Bronx
who are counting on me.

449
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,793
You got kids of your own who
are counting on you. And grandkids.

450
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,110
Oh, please.
Counting on me for what?

451
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,840
To be there. That's all.

452
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,675
- That's all I ever wanted.
- You're gonna start with me again?

453
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,957
When I left home at 16,
I was surprised you noticed.

454
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,795
That's nice. That's what a mother wants
to hear. Especially when she's dying.

455
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,708
Please, continue.

456
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,270
You were never home.
You were working all the time.

457
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,955
You were taking care of other
people's kids, or marching for causes...

458
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,476
...or circulating petitions,
or picketing city hall.

459
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,993
Look...

460
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,910
...it felt like you had no time for us.
- It was your father who ran away, Sandy.

461
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,754
- Not me.
- Well...

462
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,474
...now who's running away?

463
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,150
Enjoy your cigarette.

464
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,480
- He's pretty great, isn't he?
- Yeah, he is.

465
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,153
You both are.

466
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,279
And I can't thank you enough
for putting me up last night, but...

467
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,589
- What?
- Are you sure it's okay for me to stay?

468
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,548
I mean, now that Ryan's here too, I know
you guys have this history together...

469
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,757
Ryan's my oldest friend, but that's it.
Really.

470
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,514
- I thought when you came to Newport...
- That was a mistake.

471
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,399
I was afraid, so I ran to Ryan
because he's safe.

472
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,996
But it wasn't till I came home and was
honest with Eddie about everything...

473
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,913
...that I realized that I have
nothing to be afraid of.

474
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,794
Neither do you.

475
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,912
As for Ryan, like you said...

476
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,191
...he didn't come here for me.

477
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,271
He came here for you.

478
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,876
Let's go. Come on.

479
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,190
- You still here?
- Not by choice, believe me.

480
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,357
Yeah, well...

481
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,717
...that's too bad.

482
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,079
I've been thinking about it. How
your brother and Arturo are both in jail.

483
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,955
You and I are the only ones
from the old crew left.

484
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,310
I thought you didn't want me here, man.

485
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,555
I thought you came here
for Theresa, okay? It freaked me out.

486
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,553
But I talked to Marissa, you know?
And...

487
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,551
I don't think Marissa
wants me here either.

488
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,073
Come on. Of all the places she
could've picked to go, she chose Chino.

489
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,398
Dude, she picked the one place
she knew only you could find her.

490
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,437
- Setheleh? You in there?
- Yeah, I am.

491
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,751
I'm just gonna be down
in a second, though, okay?

492
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,754
Or I could save you the schlep.

493
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,550
- Can a person come in?
- Yeah, of course.

494
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,199
Come in.

495
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,430
- Where's Summer?
- She went to change for dinner.

496
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,639
- So were you just not gonna tell me?
- Not if I could help it.

497
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,190
- Did you think I couldn't handle it?
- No, doll, I knew you could handle it.

498
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,430
Me, on the other hand...

499
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,160
...I wanted to spend this time...

500
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,755
...getting to know you.

501
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,718
Not be the dying nana, where every
conversation could possibly be the last.

502
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,712
- Yeah, but it could, right?
- Yeah, sure, that's always true though.

503
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,155
Cancer or no cancer.

504
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,629
We could all be dead tomorrow.
You never know.

505
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,236
- That's really comforting, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

506
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,875
So tell me about Seth Cohen.
You like comic books? Music? Videos?

507
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,316
Yeah, it all seems pretty trivial
right now, though, compared to...

508
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,436
...oh, I don't know, cancer.

509
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,511
See, that's why I didn't want to tell you.

510
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,035
You don't wanna do the chemo?
You're not interested?

511
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,668
Wait. Listen.

512
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,671
It's very complicated.

513
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,117
Are you scared?

514
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,836
What do you think?

515
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,479
I don't know.

516
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,198
Dad said you're not afraid of anything.

517
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,752
Your dad doesn't know me as well
as he thinks he does.

518
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,834
Yeah, well, you're the one
who doesn't wanna stick around...

519
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,596
...so whose fault is that?

520
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,750
- Hi.
- Hey.

521
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,717
- What do you think of Chino?
- Actually...

522
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,678
...I think I can get in more trouble
where I'm from.

523
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,790
I'm sorry about everything.

524
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,635
The trip to L.A., your mom.
But we have to get back.

525
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,308
- The longer we stay, the worse it will get.
- How can it?

526
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,993
- She can put you away.
- Let her try.

527
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,039
- She tried it before, it almost worked.
- This time she'll have to find me first.

528
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,153
- What are you doing?
- Getting out of here.

529
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,276
- To go where?
- I don't know, okay?

530
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,158
I don't know where.
I don't know what I'm doing.

531
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,993
I don't know anything,
except that I can't go back there.

532
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,357
- Well, I can't keep chasing after you.
- Who asked you to?

533
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,794
I don't know why you're here.

534
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,235
Maybe you should think
about it instead of yourself.

535
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,392
- Out of my way
- I'm not going anywhere.

536
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,073
- I mean it!
- I'm not going anywhere.

537
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,434
Get out of my way!

538
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,360
Move. Move.

539
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,039
Get out of my way!

540
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,989
I can't go back there.

541
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,392
Okay.

542
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,673
You're okay.

543
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,078
Okay. It's okay.

544
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,189
Ryan? You in there?

545
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,952
Yeah, just a second.

546
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,236
There's someone here to see you.

547
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,879
Okay.

548
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,111
Hey. Seth told me you were in Chino.

549
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,999
- You can't be here. Why are you here?
- I'm here for Marissa.

550
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,117
- Look, you can't be here now, okay?
- Julie's gonna call the cops if...

551
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,670
You think she's going back with you?
You're the last person she wants to see.

552
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,990
- Well, she's gonna.
- You need to get out of here.

553
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,151
- You need to get out of my way.
- Look, guys...

554
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,357
...this is my engagement party.
Just calm down, okay?

555
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,715
Ryan, get away from him.

556
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,397
Marissa, hey. I just...

557
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,229
Get out of here, Luke.

558
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,313
- It's not what you think.
- She told you to tell me that?

559
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,516
That it's all in my head? That I'm crazy?

560
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,352
- It's not her fault.
- Get out of here.

561
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,637
- Marissa, if you'd just come with me...
- Just go, now.

562
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,232
I'm sorry.

563
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,479
Oh, it smells so good in here. Is it true
we can't eat for another six hours?

564
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,712
The nana's Seder won't take that long,
will it?

565
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,155
Have you seen her Haggadah?

566
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,788
- You're reading it backwards.
- Don't tell anyone.

567
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,350
- Hey, it's okay. Being Jewish is hard.
- You have no idea.

568
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,911
So do you know what happened
to make the nana scary again?

569
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,152
Actually...

570
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,676
What? What's going on in here?

571
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,434
Nothing. I'm gonna go study.

572
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,397
I'll see you at dinner...
Seder. Sorry.

573
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,670
- You told her, didn't you?
- I would never do that.

574
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,229
Then what were you talking about?

575
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,552
How scary you are.

576
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,676
I am scary.

577
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,519
I'd be scary too if I was sick and
suddenly I had to depend on my kids.

578
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,638
Well, see the difference is
I'm not gonna be dependent on my kids.

579
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,519
- No, you would rather die.
- Oh, that's good, Kirsten.

580
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,830
With the honesty.
I didn't know you had it in you.

581
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,514
That's because you don't know me.
You never wanted to.

582
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,278
- And it pretty much cost you your son.
- My son made a choice.

583
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,318
Maybe. But now you can make one.

584
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,472
You can get the best treatment,
you can get to know your grandson...

585
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,596
...and you can have Sandy
back in your life.

586
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,071
But, that's not important to you.

587
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,835
Oh, guilt now, huh?
That's very impressive.

588
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,230
You sure you're not Jewish?

589
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,954
How's she doing?

590
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,919
She's great.
Luke's the one I feel sorry for.

591
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,436
He's gonna have a handprint
on his face for, like, a week.

592
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,192
Sorry about that.

593
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,636
- Showing up, ruining your party.
- Hey, does it look ruined to you?

594
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,748
Besides, it's my engagement party.

595
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,639
If you'd have missed it,
I would've kicked your ass.

596
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,194
I should've invited you.

597
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,113
So invite me to the wedding.

598
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,679
Yeah. You'll bring Marissa.

599
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,670
All right, who wants cake?

600
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,115
Actually, I can't. I gotta get back.

601
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,154
Dinner at the Cohens'.
Seth's grandma's in town.

602
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,958
Can't miss it.

603
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,197
Yeah, well, you two are welcome to stay
as long as you want.

604
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,510
Come on, Eddie, my mom needs
help in the kitchen.

605
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,559
- I'm eating cake.
- No, you're not.

606
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,673
Oh, okay. I got it. See?

607
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,559
Not even married yet,
she's already bossing me around.

608
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,712
- I don't wanna go back.
- I know.

609
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,316
But you didn't do anything wrong.
They did. They know that.

610
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,675
Your mom's freaking out.
She's afraid you'll tell.

611
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,910
Why would I tell?

612
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,152
I don't wanna see them ever again,
and I don't wanna go back.

613
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,197
Yeah, but what about your dad?

614
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,390
Kaitlin? Summer?

615
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,153
What about me?
What am I supposed to do without you?

616
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,633
I mean, I'd get over you eventually,
but it'd take a while.

617
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,593
I couldn't find an actual Seder plate,
so I'm using this one.

618
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,672
Well, that's because we don't have
an actual Seder plate, Ma.

619
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,435
This is the first actual Seder we've ever
had. We usually go to the Ackermans'.

620
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,592
But you're here this year, and Ryan.

621
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,676
I've been finding homes
for kids like Ryan...

622
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,831
...for over 40 years.
- I know, Ma.

623
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,673
Yeah, but I never once thought
to bring one home with me.

624
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,790
- Had to show up your own mother?
- He's a good kid.

625
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,315
You should spend some time with him.

626
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,039
I can't.

627
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,433
I'm flying home early tomorrow.

628
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,876
Well, you don't want me to miss
my first treatment, do you?

629
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,156
Oh, Ma, thanks.

630
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,398
Hey, you know, you could
have it out here, if you want.

631
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,518
No, honey, thanks, but I like Dr. Talley.

632
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,353
And your sister's there
and your brother.

633
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,557
- And, you know, I hate California.
- So maybe I could come visit.

634
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,951
Please, your mother's
gonna be having chemo.

635
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,314
It's the least you can do.

636
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,229
- You sure you wanna do this now?
- I have to. My clothes are inside.

637
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,958
Maybe she won't be home.

638
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,639
- Oh, thank God you're back.
- I'm not.

639
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,360
- I just came to get my stuff and go.
- The hell you are.

640
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,033
You are not leaving this house.

641
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,432
Or what? You're gonna call the police or
Dr. Milano? You know what? Go ahead.

642
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,751
In fact, why don't you call up
Dad while you're at it, and Caleb too?

643
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,876
I'd really love to tell them
why I ran away.

644
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,834
Get your stuff and leave.

645
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,038
Gladly.

646
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,352
Hey. You're here.

647
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,829
Yeah. Is that okay? I wasn't sure.

648
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,797
No, of course. Come on in.

649
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,038
Here's a little...

650
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,395
...holiday-appropriate bouquet.
- Thanks.

651
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,438
So, listen, I was thinking
about what you said today...

652
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,273
...as I ate most of those cupcakes
and, like...

653
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,476
...that whole box of cookies
you brought by...

654
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,076
...and you're right.
You're right about everything.

655
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,629
No, you were right. I'm sorry.

656
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,473
I was? Are you sure?
Because that's rarely the case.

657
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,558
No, I mean, Kirsten and I
are finally getting along.

658
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,757
And I have a second chance
with my dad.

659
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,673
So why risk all of that?

660
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,508
Because it'll be fun
and because I'm self-destructive...

661
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,832
...and because you're incredible,
and I can't help myself.

662
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,473
Really?

663
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,390
- Are we really gonna do this?
- I think we already are.

664
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,915
But I think the real question...

665
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,435
...is how are we gonna tell Kirsten...

666
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,319
...without sustaining bodily injuries?

667
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,959
Well...

668
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,276
...she doesn't have to know
right away, does she?

669
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,950
For on all other nights,
we do not dip our food into salt water.

670
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:51,148
But tonight we dip karpas into salt water
and maror into charoses.

671
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,396
Did you just do that all by heart?

672
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,479
- Was it okay?
- It was perfect.

673
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,596
You can use the book.
Didn't I tell you that?

674
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,672
- No! Cohen!
- You're good, you're my little <i>chachem</i>.

675
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,399
- Hey, sorry we're late.
- Hey.

676
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,479
- I'm so sorry, Coop.
- It's okay. Really, we're fine.

677
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,392
- You see Luke?
- We won't see him for a while.

678
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,677
- How'd you manage that?
- I didn't. Marissa smacked him.

679
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,753
- Nice, Coop!
- She's hangs out with you too much.

680
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,031
- Hey, you guys ready to eat?
- Yes!

681
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,158
Well, that's too bad, because
the Seder's about to begin. Come on.

682
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,915
- How was everything at home?
- You tell me. I was in Chino.

683
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,752
"Tonight we celebrate
the first night of Passover.

684
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,435
A celebration of rebirth,
of new beginnings...

685
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,477
...and of freedom.

686
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,313
Freedom from the constraints
that have bound us.

687
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,393
And freedom to join together
to take responsibility for ourselves...

688
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,836
...for our families, for our community...

689
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,718
...and for the world."

690
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,598
Do we eat now?

691
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,556
Ryan, we've got, like, six more hours.

692
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,631
Yeah, strap in.

693
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,275
Let's all raise our glasses.
