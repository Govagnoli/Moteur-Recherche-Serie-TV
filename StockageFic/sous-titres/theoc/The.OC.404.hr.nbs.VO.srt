1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,366
Previously on the O.C.

2
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:03,133
ll get used to it.'

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,267
You got married?
I'm just too afraid to tell
my mom now.

4
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:06,567
You're the one who walked away,
Neil.

5
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:07,767
You had the affair, remember?

6
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:09,367
Nothing happened with Gloria.

7
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:10,968
When I get back,
I want you out of this house.
It's my house.

8
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:12,867
Where's my dad?
Gone.

9
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:15,034
All I would do was hang
out with my best friend

10
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,701
and go tanning with
her and go shopping...

11
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:17,801
Let's be honest for a sec.

12
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:18,968
That's what this is all about.

13
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:20,233
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

14
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,300
It's just... I miss my friend.

15
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:29,267
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

16
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:30,968
MAN:
I'm glad you came.

17
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:34,601
What brings you in?

18
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:40,068
Well, I've changed a lot
since I got to college.

19
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:44,334
New friends, new interests,
new clothes.

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,968
Well, that's
perfectly normal.

21
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,400
I know.

22
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:52,001
But... I think throwing myself
into all these new things

23
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:53,701
is just a way of avoiding

24
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:57,133
dealing with
what happened to my friend...

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,167
who, um... who died.

26
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:07,167
Well, grief often comes
in five stages.

27
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,867
Yeah, but I haven't
really been grieving.

28
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,534
Why is this happening?

29
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:20,001
Life is so unfair!

30
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,567
I'd do anything
to change things.

31
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:29,467
Please, just name it,
and I'll do it.

32
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:40,300
(sobbing):
Nothing matters anyway.

33
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:54,901
(loud sobs)

34
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:57,233
But this is so not fair!

35
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:06,434
I'm sorry, I have rage issues.

36
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:11,068
I think she would want me
to move on.

37
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:13,467
So that's what I'm going
to try to do.

38
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,367
I'm proud
of you, Summer.

39
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:22,434
You've made astounding
progress, and all in one week.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,100
It's kind of a relief in a way.

41
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:26,400
Now I can go back to being me.

42
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,500
What do you mean
by that?

43
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:31,767
Well, this whole save the planet
thing, it was a crutch, right?

44
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:34,968
And nothing against handicapped
people, but crutches? Ew.

45
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:37,767
A lot of people do change
when they go to college.

46
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,367
Well, not me.

47
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:41,267
I love shopping, tanning
and celebrity gossip,

48
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:43,934
always have, always will.

49
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:47,634
But I think I have to.

50
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,901
If I ever want things to be good
with my boyfriend again.

51
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:54,500
Summer, just promise
you'll take it slow.

52
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,634
Totally.

53
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,534
RYAN:
Hey, man.

54
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,667
Hey, dude,

55
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,334
I know, three hour time
difference,

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,601
but, Ryan, she's going
to dump me.

57
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,634
It's okay, I'm awake.

58
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:08,634
Oh, good.

59
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:09,701
Ryan, she's going to dump me.

60
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,233
No one believes that, all right?

61
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,267
Summer loves you.

62
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:13,667
The old Summer loved me.

63
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,167
But new Summer is upon us,

64
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:17,001
and Providence is the place
that spawned her.

65
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:19,701
Summer is just dealing with what
we're all dealing with, okay?

66
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:20,968
She'll come around.

67
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,334
What if she doesn't?
This is my last shot.

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,500
Otherwise, the girl with the
violent temper and good hygiene

69
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,167
is nothing
but a childhood memory.

70
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:45,867
Careful, lady, my girlfriend's
going to be here any second.

71
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,567
Shut up, Cohen.

72
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:49,400
Hey, you just punched me.

73
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,834
My baby's back.

74

(chuckling):
Thanks.

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,767
I got to get you
on a surfboard.

84
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:10,801
Not a chance.

85
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:12,200
How about some breakfast?

86
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:15,133
I could use some intel
on Seth and Summer.

87
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,167
You know what, I
can't, but, uh, I think
they're doing all right.

88
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,434
You know? Doing the
long distance thing.

89
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:19,534
How about you?

90
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:20,734
How are you doing?

91
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:22,434
Good, good.
Better, once I get

92
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,367
my first day of work
under my belt.

93
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:26,534
Well, Pavo Guapo is lucky
to have you working there.

94
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:27,834
Me, too.

95
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:30,234
Now I got an excuse to come
by for your shrimp tacos.

96
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,968
Yeah, Kirsten warned me
about that.

97
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,434
You're limited
to two a week.

98
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,501
Oh! I knew I should have
divorced that dame.

99
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:39,033
Well, it's not forever.

100
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,033
You're still accepted to
Berkeley for next year.

101
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,467
I'm just glad you're getting
back to your old self.

102
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:47,534
You know?
Back home again.

103
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:49,234
New job.

104
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,067
I'm just trying to stay busy
and earn some extra money.

105
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,968
And hook me up with
some shrimp tacos.

106
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,501
Yeah, right.
I'll work on that.

107
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,801
I'm going to walk back.
I'm kind of sweaty.

108
00:05:57,868 --> 00:06:00,667
Yeah, I wasn't offering
you a ride.

109
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:02,634
Hey, Ryan?

110
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:04,167
Hang in there.

111
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,434
Wow, that was a lot better

112
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:15,234
than what I was imagining
on the plane.

113
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,934
You were imagining it
on the plane?

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,634
Not like that.
When you called me here,

115
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:21,100
I was sure you were going
to break up with me.

116
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,033
Well, I know I'm not the one

117
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,801
that usually apologizes
in this relationship,

118
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:28,634
but I'm sorry
about everything.

119
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:30,234
I turned into a liberal zealot

120
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,267
just to distract myself
from my own grief.

121
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:33,801
I'm not even into
all this stuff.

122
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,100
So the old you is back?

123
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:38,033
In all of my artificially
tanned glory.

124
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,133
Thank God.

125
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,100
'Cause I was not sure
that the new you

126
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,367
and old me were
really working.

127
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:43,934
Yeah, the new me
kind of smelled weird.

128
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:49,133
Well, what would you have done
if I didn't go back to being me?

129
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,868
I had a plan

130
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:52,767
to coax the old Summer out.

131
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:55,367
<i>The Valley,</i> Season Three?

132
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:57,734
Awesome!

133
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,067
KIRSTEN:
<i>I checked on Ryan.</i>
<i>Did he leave already?</i>

134
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:03,501
Yeah.

135
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:04,834
He seemed to be doing okay.

136
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,901
I was hoping to hang with him
while Seth is away.

137
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,033
Poker, maybe shoot
a little pool,

138
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,834
but his new job is going
to make that tough.

139
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,634
Well, I could rack
a few balls with you.

140
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:14,033
You are so smart and sexy

141
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,133
and gorgeous.

142
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,801
But sometimes a man just needs

143
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:17,834
to hang with the guys.

144
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, that I'm not.

145
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:21,534
(timer rings)

146
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:32,167
You know, Jimmy left, Caleb
died, then Jimmy left again.

147
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:33,300
Even Neil's gone.

148
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:34,567
Look, I wasn't a
pennant winner,

149
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,467
but at least I had
a bullpen, you know?

150
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:37,734
It's baseball talk.
I got it.

151
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,367
Why don't you give Jason Spitz
a call?

152
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:40,901
You're always saying
how funny he is.

153
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:42,601
Why don't you ask him
to do something?

154
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,133
Yeah, yeah...
I don't know.

155
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,434
I mean, it's a little weird
for a guy to ask another guy

156
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,501
to do something
right out of the blue like that.

157
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:52,434
Since when is Sandy Cohen
afraid of acting weird?

158
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:54,067
Well, Spitz is pretty funny.

159
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,534
He's allegedly
a scratch golfer.

160
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:56,701
He likes the Dodgers.

161
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,834
I could live with that.

162
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:58,901
It sounds perfect for you.

163
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:00,334
Yeah, but what am I going to do?

164
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,033
I'm going to give him
a call or what?

165
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,067
Ask him out?

166
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,567
Come on.

167
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:08,467
Why don't you use some
of that Sandy Cohen charm?

168
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:10,067
I'm sure he won't be
able to resist.

169
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:13,000
It's been a long time since
I been out there, honey.

170
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,501
What if Spitzy doesn't like me?

171
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,200
Are you calling him Spitzy now?

172
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:17,901
No, not yet.

173
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:19,434
Do you think he'll
go for it?

174
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,734
JULIE:
<i>Well, that's very</i>
<i>generous of you.</i>

175
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,400
Thank you, Neil.

176
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:26,300
Bye.

177
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,834
So how's Seattle?

178
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:30,300
Is that short, sassy lady

179
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,000
still bossing Dr. Roberts
around the hospital?

180
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,067
Neil is fine.

181
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:37,334
He's going to let us stay
in the house as long as we want.

182
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,501
Well, nice work, Mom.

183
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:39,934
I wish I could take
all the credit,

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,300
but it was actually Neil's idea.

185
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:42,501
He's really very sweet.

186
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:44,200
Oh, you miss him.
Well, don't worry.

187
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:47,067
We'll find you another old dude
to pay for all your stuff

188
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,167
and cheat on you.

189
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:49,300
Is that what I'm teaching you?

190
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,567
Mm, pretty much.

191
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:51,701
Well, no more.

192
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:53,801
Now that we have our housing
situation handled,

193
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,634
I am officially giving up men.

194
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,033
Good one.

195
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,400
That'll last a week, max.

196
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:00,300
I'll take that wager,
young lady.

197
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,400
And I'll make one with you.

198
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,667
I will not so much as bat
an eyelash at a man,

199
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:05,968
and you will stay
out of trouble.

200
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,434
You cannot live without a man.

201
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,801
not even for a week.

202
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,133
TAYLOR:
Morning, roomies.

203
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,501
Anyone want a protein scramble?

204
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,234
Nice to see you're making
yourself at home, Taylor.

205
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,968
Well, thanks for making me
feel at home, Jules.

206
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:21,200
Summer's room is
just adorable.

207
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:23,634
And I don't know how I ever
lived without a home gym.

208
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,367
Oh, this came for you today.

209
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:26,534
Who's Henry Michael?

210
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:28,167
Uh...

211
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,934
(French pronunciation:
Oh, Henri Michel?

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's just, um,

213
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,267
my French husband.

214
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,968
I'm sure it's nothing.
Excuse me.

215
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,667
You see? Man drama--
who needs it?

216
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:45,567
Hey, Ernesto's
looking pretty hot.

217
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:47,300
Nice six-pack.

218
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:48,367
Where?

219
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,467
Gotcha.

220
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,133
Taylor, hey.

221
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,734
Hi, Ryan.

222
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,400
Are you working at
El Pavo Guapo?

223
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:15,934
You know, that means
a handsome turkey?

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,367
That's why I took the job.

225
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:20,968
Hey, do you know when
Seth's going to be back?

226
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,334
I really need
to talk to him.

227
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,634
Sorry, gone for the weekend.

228
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,901
(sighs)

229
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,667
You know, that shirt really
brings out your eyes.

230
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:38,767
It's black.

231
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,167
What are you doing here, Taylor?

232
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:43,067
Just in the mood for Mexican.
Mm-hmm.

233
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:46,100
Maybe the Macho Nacho Burrito
wrap with extra guac.

234
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,133
And...

235
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,334
Oh, um, a favor.

236
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,667
(laughing):
No, no, no, sorry.

237
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:54,834
With Seth gone, you're the
only one I can turn to.

238
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:56,100
Well, I'm honored.

239
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,601
Okay, so, I'm trying
to get divorced,

240
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,767
and I just found out
that Henri Michel...

241
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:00,834
Oh, that's my French husband.

242
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:02,234
Um, he's coming to Newport

243
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,701
and I know he's going
to try and talk me out of it,

244
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,868
and I could really
use you there.

245
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,234
No.

246
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,767
I'm afraid to be alone with him.

247
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,901
I'm afraid
of his sensual powers.

248
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:16,400
Ryan, the man is

249
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,667
a sexual Jedi.

250
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:20,400
Whatever he asks you to do,
you just do it.

251
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,701
It doesn't matter
how depraved...

252
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:23,667
Okay, some people
are trying to eat here,

253
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:24,901
including me someday, so...

254
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:26,234
Ryan, please.

255
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,968
If I go alone, I'll be back
in France next week.

256
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,367
You don't know
how hard it was to leave.

257
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:32,334
Seth and Summer are gone,
my mom kicked me out,

258
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,567
and... I have no one else.

259
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,868
Look, just do me this one favor,
and I'll leave you alone.

260
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:40,767
Promise?

261
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:46,133
Knock, knock.
Hey, Summer, can you

262
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,133
fact-check this flier
on solar panels?

263
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,901
It's for the
rally tomorrow.

264
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:52,901
Che, I'd like
to talk.

265
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:54,400
Sure, man.
What's up?

266
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:59,133
I haven't been completely honest
with you about who I really am.

267
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,634
This is my shoe collection.

268
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,734
There's leather, suede,

269
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:09,334
and the occasional
calfskin boot.

270
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:14,467
Whoa, my friend.

271
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,634
These are my magazines.

272
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:20,300
I know which stars
pump gas just like us,

273
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:22,334
and who's on pump watch.

274
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,567
And this is Marissa.

275
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:33,400
She was my best friend,
um, but she died

276
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:35,934
in a car accident
on graduation night.

277
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,934
Summer, I'm sorry.
That's-That's really heavy.

278
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,167
Yeah, well, it's so heavy
that I couldn't deal, so...

279
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:49,133
I put all my energy
towards being an activist,

280
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,434
but that's not who I am.

281
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:54,167
These shoes
and these magazines-- that's me,

282
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:57,000
but I hope
we can still be friends.

283
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,634
All I can do is be me,

284
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:01,801
whoever that is.

285
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,033
It's, uh... it's Dylan.

286
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,467
The guy's a genius.

287
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,467
Look, Summer,
if you've found

288
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:10,501
your place in this world, I am
nothing but happy for you.

289
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:13,200
Hey.

290
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:14,501
I put some cream
in your coffee.

291
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:15,934
I figured you'd be
back on dairy.

292
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,934
Hey, uh, Che, this is
my boyfriend, Seth.

293
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,501
Seth, this is Che.

294
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,501
Summer, you have a twin flame.

295
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,834
I wish I knew you were
coming into town.

296
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:24,901
I would have made
you a bracelet.

297
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:26,100
SETH:
Oh, hey.

298
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,167
Uh, where I come from,
we just say hey.

299
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:32,634
Well, to borrow
your native tongue, hey.

300
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:33,868
Listen, forget what I
said about the rally.

301
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:35,601
We got plenty of warriors
for the fight.

302
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:39,834
You two, just... be.

303
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:42,501
Thanks, Che.

304
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:43,667
What's that?

305
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:45,434
It's garbage.

306
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:51,033
Hi, Jason. How you doing?

307
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,734
I just had a meeting
with Kaminsky.

308
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,567
Oh, the slowest talker
in the world.

309
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,300
It took forever.
Forever.

310
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,300
(laughing)

311
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,601
Good to see you, man.

312
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,467
Hey, uh...

313
00:14:00,534 --> 00:14:02,167
you got any plans this weekend?

314
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:03,968
Sandy, I've been working
the past six Saturdays.

315
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,501
No, no, I didn't mean that.

316
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,667
I'm just saying that we could,
you know,

317
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:11,167
you and I, uh, we could do
something.

318
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:14,100
Do something?

319
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,634
Poker, pool,

320
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:18,400
you know, a little
small ball.

321
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:21,367
If you're free.
If not, no worries.

322
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:25,133
Can I get back to you on that?

323
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,968
Oh, sure, yeah.

324
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,100
Whatever.

325
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,334
WOMAN:
But I had to spend the night
with Derek.

326
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,968
He tore his ACL.

327
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,000
MAN:
Hey, it's not my fault
he'll never kickbox again.

328
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:40,200
WOMAN:
If I remember correctly,
he did kick your ass.

329
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:41,300
God, this is so disgusting.

330
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:42,634
MAN:
That was a sucker punch.

331
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:45,734
I don't know, I think you're
being too hard on April.

332
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,334
Derek's knee was...
it was really messed up.

333
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,367
No, I just... I don't
like this show anymore.

334
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:53,033
All they do is create fake
problems for fake people

335
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,133
just to distract viewers from
the real problems in the world.

336
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,234
Well, I don't think the network
would go for a sexy teen soap

337
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,567
set in the Damascus, but we
can turn it off if you want.

338
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,901
I just thought you liked it.

339
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm just distracted.

340
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,167
I haven't been keeping up

341
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:06,667
on how much blow
Lindsay Lohan's doing.

342
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,467
And did you hear
about JT and Cameron?

343
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:09,534
No, what?

344
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:11,367
I don't know.
That is the point.

345
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:13,334
I'm going to go get
one of my magazines.

346
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,133
That sounds like
the old Summer.

347
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,868
I'm going to stay here
and, uh, keep watching.

348
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:21,033
You know, I have this thing
where if I start something,

349
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,167
I have to finish.

350
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:23,868
Is that li a disease
or a condition?

351
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:25,834
Don't really know, Cohen.

352
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:27,834
I'm reading about who got lipo.

353
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,601
----You know, you might
want to relax.

354
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:54,734
Distract me.

355
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,501
Tell me about this,
um, cage fighting.

356
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,800
It's something that I've
been meaning to get into.

357
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,867
Yeah? Yeah?
Ask me another favor,

358
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:03,701
I'll be happy to show you.
Oh, Ryan Atwood with
a side of sauce.

359
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:04,933
I like it.

360
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,701
You're going to have to do
better, though,

361
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:09,467
'cause right now all I ca
think of is him, my husband,

362
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:11,301
and his arms, his smell...

363
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,467
making love in the
barn in Burgundy.

364
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:16,200
Sounds like the perfect guy.
Why would you want to divorce?

365
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,701
Well, despite being
agnostic in most things,

366
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:21,301
I do believe in true love.

367
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:23,734
And this was not it.

368
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:28,967
Well, back to you and your life.

369
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:30,601
What is your favorite fruit?

370
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,534
Peaches.

371
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:36,301
Oh, he used to say my breasts

372
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:37,900
were like two, soft...
Is that him?

373
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:40,534
No, that's...

374
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,567
his lawyer.

375
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,100
Madam.

376
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,200
(speaking French)

377
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,933
(speaking French2)

378
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:51,934
(speaking French3)

379
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,234
Is everything okay?

380
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:57,134
No, not exactly.

381
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,467
(speaking French)

382
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:00,468
(speaking French2)

383
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,469
(speaking French3)

384
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,470
(speaking French4)

385
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:13,471
(speaking French5)

386
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:15,472
(speaking French6)

387
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:17,473
(speaking French7)

388
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:24,474
(speaking French7)

389
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:32,833
What did he say?
What's wrong?

390
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,833
(speaking French)

391
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,834
(speaking French2)

392
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:37,835
(speaking French3)

393
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:40,936
(speaking French4)

394
00:17:47,937 --> 00:17:50,937
(speaking French5)

395
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:58,301
What's going on?

396
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:00,668
Oh, I just told him
you were a soccer fan.

397
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:03,134
Oh.

398
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,234
Yeah, I like soccer.

399
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,200
Sorry today was such a bust.

400
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:10,501
What are you talking about?

401
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,701
We totally cleaned out the mall.

402
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:16,367
Well, you threw your smoothie
at a lady on the street.

403
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:18,434
Hey, that fur did
not look faux.

404
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:21,334
Yeah, I just feel like your mind
is someplace else.

405
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,734
My mind is on this adorable
sweater right here.

406
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,301
m going to try it on'
with that bag we bought,

407
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:28,167
because how cute would
they look together?

408
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:29,800
Now, if you don't mind,
a little privacy.

409
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,734
Well, I enjoy watching you
take off your clothes,

410
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,867
I'm sure I'll enjoy watching
you put them on.

411
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,701
Hey, this is
a very intense process.

412
00:18:36,768 --> 00:18:38,933
All right, actually
this is perfect.

413
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,668
I wanted to head over
to Thayer Street

414
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,301
and do a walking tour
of ethnic foods.

415
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,534
I can't be moving here if
the shwarma is not up to par.

416
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:46,567
Well, bring me a kabob.

417
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,933
CHE:
Hey, Summer.

418
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,668
Che, hey, I wanted to know
how the rally went.

419
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:04,734
We marched, we chanted,
and along the way,

420
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,933
we may have even opened up
a few eyes.

421
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,034
We'll see.

422
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,200
Oh, that sounds great.

423
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:11,434
Yeah, Summer,
what are you doing?

424
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:12,833
Trying on a sweater.

425
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,501
Hey, Seth and I are going
to watch a movie here later

426
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:15,967
if you want to come by.
No, I can't.

427
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:17,100
We're prepping for tomorrow
night's debate.

428
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,234
Debate?

429
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:19,833
They agreed to grant us
an audience

430
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,367
with the dean,
present our proposal.

431
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:24,900
Only thing not powered by the
fuel of the sun is our passion.

432
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:27,401
Uh, well, tell everyone I said
hi, and good luck.

433
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,701
Yeah, thanks.

434
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,134
So do you like it?

435
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,734
Huh? Like what?

436
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,100
The new sweater.

437
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,067
No.

438
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,967
KIRSTEN:
<i>So you're really giving</i>
<i>up on men?</i>

439
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:42,501
Men are to me, what
Chardonnay is to you.

440
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,200
One sip and I'm upside down
on a chandelier.

441
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,933
Not that you've
ever done that.

442
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,167
What's your point, Julie?

443
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:50,501
I'm just trying to set
a good example for Kaitlin,

444
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:54,134
develop my own interests,
maybe my career,

445
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,967
that is, if you'd still
have me as a partner.

446
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,167
As I told you,

447
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:02,367
New Matchis there for you
whenever you want.

448
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,234
Thanks, Keeks. I was hoping
you'd say that.

449
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:08,768
Okay, so, I have so many
new ideas about expanding.

450
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,000
I went online.
I checked out some office...

451
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,768
Oh, there's Taryn.
Wow, she looks amazing.

452
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,601
Did she have
some work done?

453
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:18,334
She's had something.

454
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:22,067
Kirsten, great to see you.

455
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:24,434
Julie, I'm so sorry

456
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:25,467
about Neil.

457
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:27,134
I hope you plan to sue.

458
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,900
You know, just because
you aren't legal

459
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,768
doesn't mean you're not
entitled to some sort of...
(phone ringing)

460
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,301
Oh, it's Sandy.

461
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,534
Excuse me.

462
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,701
Hi, honey.

463
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:35,567
Hey, guess what?

464
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,833
I'm not good at guessing.

465
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,100
I'm going out.

466
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,534
I'm jealous, with who?

467
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:41,534
Spitz! Spitzy to me.

468
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:42,867
He called?

469
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:43,933
He called.

470
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,867
How about that?
How about that?

471
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:49,100
Maybe a little golf, maybe a
drink after, watch the game.

472
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,134
Golfing, game watching,
suddenly not so jealous.

473
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,534
Thanks, but I don't think

474
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:56,067
I'll be needing
a dating service anymore.
Really?

475
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:57,634
I didn't know you
were seeing anyone.

476
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:58,800
Oh, not someone...

477
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,933
someones.

478
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,967
Young ones.

479
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:05,034
Men our age are
so complicated.

480
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,501
Young guys just like
to have fun.

481
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,367
And they are so
grateful for a woman

482
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,034
who knows what she's doing.

483
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,867
Oh, so grateful, and limber.

484
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:18,167
Hey, a group of us are
going out tomorrow night.

485
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:19,367
You should come.

486
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:22,034
Uh, I'm trying to be
a role model.

487
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,167
Oh, mm-hmm.

488
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:29,567
I'll call you.

489
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:32,434
Did Taryn run off already?

490
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,301
Mm-hmm.
What's she doing?

491
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:35,401
JULIE:
Him.

492
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:40,833
Hey, Kaitlin!

493
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,234
We got a guy who can
hook us up with fake I.D.'s.

494
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,267
It's awesome.
Yeah.

495
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:45,867
I think I'll pass.

496
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:49,000
You've wanted a fake I.D.
since you were six.

497
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:50,434
Yeah, come on.

498
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:51,668
Yeah, and the guy's leaving town
next week.

499
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:53,467
Well, where is he going?
He's going to prison.

500
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:55,067
Yeah, for fraud.
Because he's awesome.

501
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:57,401
Look, you guys, I made
a bet with my mom

502
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:58,668
that I'd stay
out of trouble.

503
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,668
And this definitely
sounds like trouble.

504
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:02,734
Dude, not if we don't
get caught.

505
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,367
Dude, seriously.
Yeah, dude, seriously.

506
00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:11,933
Well, with a foolproof plan
like that, how can I say no?

507
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
<i>Garcon?</i>

508
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:20,267
Ah! Taylor.

509
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:22,933
It's been a few hours
since your last Macho Nacho.

510
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,434
You must be starving.

511
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:26,034
I was thinking of the mol\.

512
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,967
And, um, one more
tiny little favor.

513
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:31,567
Does it involve me standing
around while you speak French?

514
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:32,534
'Cause I've already done that.

515
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,601
No, no, no.

516
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:36,067
I actually just need
your signature.

517
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:38,034
You see, before I can get
divorced,

518
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,967
I have to have someone
attest to my character.

519
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:41,134
That's in French.

520
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,701
It's just the usual
boilerplate.

521
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:44,501
You know, never
been to prison--

522
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:45,734
well, me, not you.

523
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:46,534
(giggling)

524
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:47,768
Never been married before,

525
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,200
no contact with livestock,
blah, blah, blah.

526
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,668
So I think I have a pen.
Uh, you know, actually,

527
00:22:51,734 --> 00:22:53,067
can I sign that after work?
Just leave it here.

528
00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:55,967
Sure. Yes, okay.

529
00:22:56,034 --> 00:22:57,601
Thank you very much.

530
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,100
So you don't speak
French at all?

531
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:01,501
No, why?

532
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:05,134
Well, it must have been really
boring for you today.

533
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,501
Sorry.

534
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,167
Hey, Seth, man, what's up?

535
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:20,100
Hey, I got some extra
baba ghanoush.

536
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, baba ghanoush.
No thanks, man.

537
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,800
I'm all right.
Where's Summer?

538
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:25,367
I gave her a little time-out.

539
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:27,034
It's not easy
having house guests.

540
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,634
What?! I thought you guys
were having this great day,

541
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,200
purchasing luxury goods,
and eating things with faces.

542
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:33,701
Honestly, it could have gone
a little better.

543
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:36,200
I mean, you know, I support her,
whatever she's into,

544
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:37,833
but I really
need this to work 'cause...

545
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,967
SUMMER:
The people have spoken!

546
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:42,000
We are of one voice,
one mind

547
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:43,701
and one heart!

548
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:46,267
Yeah!
(applause)

549
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:49,067
I will not sleep,
I will not eat,

550
00:23:49,134 --> 00:23:51,467
I will not rest until
this hypocrisy ends.

551
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:54,701
Solar panels on all of our
dormitories, or we revolt!

552
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:55,668
Who's with Summer?

553
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,734
Yeah!
STUDENTS:
Yeah!

554
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,034
(applause, cheering)

555
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,501
Yeah!

556
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,634
Hey, man, how's your French?

557
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:15,933
Old Summer's been replaced by
the real Summer,

558
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,801
and she looks suspiciously like
the new Summer.

559
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:19,367
So she's still in her
"Go Green" phase?

560
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:20,634
I don't think it's a phase, man.

561
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:23,501
I think this is her life
now, and it's obvious

562
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:24,667
I don't fit in it.

563
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,601
Uh, sorry, gotta go.

564
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:29,367
Hey, wait, I've got to talk to
you about Taylor... what...?

565
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:32,334
Didn't mean to eavesdrop.

566
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:33,501
It's okay.

567
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:35,567
Well, I knew
you were lying last night

568
00:24:35,634 --> 00:24:37,134
when you said nothing was wrong.

569
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,234
Nothing is wrong; you're doing
what people do at college--

570
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,534
discovering who you really are.

571
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:44,234
Believe me,
I am as surprised as you are.

572
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,868
But I'm still going to shave
my legs and wash my hair,

573
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:48,601
and be the best
girlfriend that I can.

574
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,734
Well, you know, who can ask
for more than that?

575
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:52,701
Think of all the new subjects
we'll have to talk about.

576
00:24:52,768 --> 00:24:55,868
I did explain the concept of
recycling to you in tenth grade.

577
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:57,267
See, there's lots of places

578
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:59,401
where we could use
your help, Cohen.

579
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:02,000
(knocking at door)
(playing simple melody)

580
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,933
Please come in. Enter.

581
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:06,167
Hey... Oh!

582
00:25:06,234 --> 00:25:07,134
You're really nude.

583
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,234
Why don't I...
let me come back.

584
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,601
No! Wait right there.

585
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,734
I have a gift for you.

586
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:15,401
My song.

587
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:22,200
* Polar bears are dying *

588
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:23,634
* ...two, three, four *

589
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:25,900
* Good-bye. *

590
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:29,868
Wow.

591
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:32,200
Wow.

592
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:33,434
That's really, uh...

593
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:36,000
Anyways, listen,
I kind of need your help.

594
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:39,701
Yeah, bro, one second.

595
00:25:39,768 --> 00:25:41,234
Uh, I'm actually really
honored you would ask me.

596
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
Oh, hey, that's cool,
we can shake.

597
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:44,768
We can shake. We can shake.

598
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,933
And we're touching.

599
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:48,834
(cell phone ringing)

600
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,734
SANDY:
Oh!

601
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:50,667
Fore!

602
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:51,834
Yeah, hi.
Sorry!

603
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,067
Rob, what are you doing?

604
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:53,933
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

605
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:56,601
Bye.

606
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:58,601
I'm sorry about that.

607
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,033
My, my kid's got a rash.

608
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,967
I got to go to the
pharmacy after this.

609
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:02,967
Oh, sorry.

610
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:04,267
Take another one.
It was my fault.

611
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,267
No, no, no!
You're up.

612
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:06,967
I'll play it from
the parking lot.

613
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,267
I think I hit your car.
It'd be an improvement.

614
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,868
Sandy...

615
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:17,734
uh... (anxious laugh)

616
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:19,501
You know,
my kid doesn't have a rash.

617
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,167
My wife's just calling,

618
00:26:22,234 --> 00:26:23,801
making sure
I'm having a good time,

619
00:26:23,868 --> 00:26:26,234
you know, because I don't have
that many guy friends anymore.

620
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,634
Who does?
Who's got the time?

621
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:31,334
I know, it's work, family,
then more work, you know?

622
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:32,834
When did it get so hard?

623
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,100
Well, when we were kids,
all you had to do was ask,

624
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:36,300
hey, want to play
some ball?

625
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:38,000
And we didn't have
any cell phones.

626
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:39,967
I turned mine off.
I'm really sorry about that.

627
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:46,000
(cell phone ringing)

628
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:47,701
Oh!

629
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:50,134
I'm so sorry, man!
I'm so sorry.

630
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,801
It's the office.
I'm turning it off.

631
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:55,100
JASON:
I think I hit <i>your</i> car anyway.

632
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:58,534
I love this space
and I love the windows.

633
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:00,434
Plus it's by the beach,
so there'd be lots

634
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:03,467
of foot traffic and eye candy,
not that I'm looking.

635
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,234
So I'll make an appointment
for us for Monday?

636
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,067
Are you doing
anything tonight?

637
00:27:09,134 --> 00:27:11,634
No, Kaitlin's with the twins,
working on a science project,

638
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:13,434
so I have the night
all to myself.

639
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,434
Well, Sandy's out with a friend.

640
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:16,834
Do you want to do something?

641
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,534
I don't know--
takeout and a movie?

642
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,768
Two women spending Saturday
night at home together.

643
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:22,100
I love it.

644
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:24,134
How very <i>Whatever Happened To</i>
<i>Baby Jane.</i>

645
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,267
(cell phone ringing)

646
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:32,667
Go ahead, you can take it.

647
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,267
No, that's okay.

648
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:37,501
Just a sec.

649
00:27:42,134 --> 00:27:43,334
Hello?

650
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:45,300
It's Taryn.
You joining us tonight?

651
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:48,567
Uh, actually,
I'm here with Kirsten

652
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:49,967
and we were thinking about
maybe...

653
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:52,701
Order in and watch a movie?

654
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:56,567
Oh, honey, even with the wonders
of elective surgery,

655
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,868
you will only be this hot
for so long.

656
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:00,933
Have fun while you can.

657
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:03,467
Julie, you still there?

658
00:28:03,534 --> 00:28:05,033
I'll call you back.

659
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,634
Oh, I was just going
to get some takeout menus.

660
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:15,267
Do you know what
you'd like to eat?

661
00:28:15,334 --> 00:28:16,933
Kirsten, I feel like I'm coming
down with something.

662
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,434
I'm not feeling so hot.

663
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:21,067
Do you mind if I take a rain
check on our girl's night in?

664
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:23,534
Julie, did you just put on
lipstick?

665
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:27,534
What? No, uh...
I'm just a little flushed.

666
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:29,033
I'll call you.

667
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:36,100
KAITLIN:
Okay, I think that's the guy.

668
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:37,967
Kaitlin,
what if he's packing heat?

669
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:39,501
Okay, you guys just stay here.

670
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:42,667
Money.

671
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,234
Got what we talked about?

672
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,534
In here.

673
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:52,234
Great, so it's covered in lice
and grease.

674
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,067
Put your money in the hat
and try and be cool about it.

675
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,601
You think it's my first buy?

676
00:28:58,601 --> 00:28:59,601
It's been a pleasure.

677
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,701
I'm available,
by the way.

678
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:05,734
That's heinous.

679
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,768
I don't know
about this, Taryn.

680
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:16,000
It might be too soon.

681
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:18,167
Julie, I know how you feel.

682
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,834
But there's one
man who can always

683
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,334
get me out on
the dance floor.

684
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:24,167
His name is Jose.

685
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:26,167
Jose Cuervo.

686
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:54,634
Have you met my friend
Julie Cooper-- urban cougar.

687
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,933
TAYLOR:
Ryan! There you are.
You know,

688
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,667
I think there might be
something wrong with your phone.

689
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:02,667
I called you
three times today.

690
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:03,734
Six, actually.

691
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:07,933
Oh, well, um,
did you get a chance

692
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,267
to look at that silly
little document?

693
00:30:10,334 --> 00:30:11,300
Yeah! I did.

694
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,200
And I had a question for you.

695
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:14,667
Um, what does that mean?

696
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:17,234
Oh, that's just lawyer speak.

697
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,067
You know, just party
of the first part,

698
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:20,401
party of the second part.

699
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:22,200
So it doesn't say
we had sex, like, 30 times?

700
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:24,534
Took me like five hours
to translate that.

701
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:26,234
Sorry.
Yeah.

702
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,100
It's just that without
the consent of my husband,

703
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:31,234
the only way I can get a divorce
is if one of us was unfaithful.

704
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,234
I just didn't think you'd
sign if you knew the truth.

705
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah, well, I've got a lot of
half-eaten enchiladas to clear.

706
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:39,734
Ryan, I have to meet that lawyer
at the yacht club tonight,

707
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:41,100
and if I don't have this signed,

708
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,768
I'm going to have
no choice but to go with him

709
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:45,067
to France and try to work it out
with Henri Michel, face-to-face.

710
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,334
Which means you won't
be able to keep coming here,

711
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:47,467
which is a real shame.

712
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:49,467
Well, did you at least
read this part

713
00:30:49,534 --> 00:30:51,134
where I said what
a great lover you are?

714
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,167
Look, Taylor... this job,

715
00:30:54,234 --> 00:30:56,100
this is about all
I can handle right now.

716
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:58,801
You know?

717
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:06,334
I shouldn't have
dragged you in to this.

718
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:07,768
Yeah, that's what
I've been trying to say.

719
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,134
It's just that I...

720
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:13,567
...don't have anyone else.

721
00:31:13,634 --> 00:31:16,300
It's kind of why I married a
Frenchman in the first place.

722
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:17,868
I mean, my mom hates me.

723
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:19,501
I don't really
know my dad,

724
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,868
and last year was the first year
I ever had friends.

725
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:24,334
All of a sudden, I'm by myself
in a foreign country,

726
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:26,667
and I meet this guy
who says he loves me.

727
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:29,501
He wants to take care of me
and... and...

728
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:31,167
One too many bottles
of Chateau Margot

729
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:35,267
and a view from
the Eiffel Tower, and why not?

730
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:36,601
That's how Tom wooed Katie.

731
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,267
Why not me?

732
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:48,467
Well, look, I'm sorry you're
going through all this.

733
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,401
I'm just not the guy to help.

734
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:52,567
Sorry.

735
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:06,134
Here they come.

736
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,967
There you are.
CHE:
Sorry we're late.

737
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:10,134
Earlier today, a caterpillar
entered my room.

738
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,467
I'm happy to say
a butterfly emged.

739
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,033
SETH:
Did you know that the
amount of solar energy

740
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,300
that touches the Earth's
surface in 40 minutes

741
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:19,634
is greater than all the energy

742
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:22,801
required by the entire
human population in a year?

743
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,467
Yes, I did know that.

744
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:26,401
It's a thing of beauty,
isn't it?

745
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:27,768
CHE:
Come on, friends.

746
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,900
Oh, the board only allows
students in the town meeting.

747
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:37,067
Do you go here?
Uh, no...

748
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:38,734
But I made this.

749
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:41,000
Can you just make an exception?
It's for the good of the Earth.

750
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:42,601
No, I'm afraid not.

751
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,367
Well, it's cool, you go ahead.

752
00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:46,234
But it's your last night here.
You can't spend it alone.

753
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,967
Summer, everybody in there is
counting on you, okay?

754
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:51,267
I can amuse myself
for a few hours.

755
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:53,300
You're the best boyfriend ever.

756
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:55,701
Go change the world.

757
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:05,434
mp tacos.
Oh, yeah?

758
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:08,100
Looks like you're
going to get a chance
to meet one of my kids.

759
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:08,801
Hey, Ryan.

760
00:33:08,868 --> 00:33:10,100
Hey.

761
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:11,334
I'd like you to meet
Jason Spitz from work.

762
00:33:11,401 --> 00:33:12,734
What's up?
How you doing?

763
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:14,200
We're about to go in
and watch the game,

764
00:33:14,267 --> 00:33:15,401
get a bite to eat.
Can you join us?

765
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:16,868
Uh, you know, actually,
I'm kind of beat.

766
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:19,267
But you guys go ahead.
Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you.

767
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:20,300
I'll be inside.
Yeah.

768
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:22,100
Hey, hey.

769
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,768
Is everything okay?
'Cause I'm guessing
not really.

770
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,534
I didn't get fired,
I didn't punch any of
my drunken customers,

771
00:33:25,601 --> 00:33:26,868
I'd say I'm great.

772
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:29,300
One day at a time, one foot
in front of the other.

773
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:30,734
Eventually, it'll get easier.

774
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,634
Yeah, why, because I'll start
to forget about her?

775
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:35,367
No, no. You're never going
to forget about her.

776
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:37,834
But... life goes on.

777
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,300
Not the same life.

778
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:40,601
No.

779
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,701
But you're going to have
to make this life work.

780
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:43,801
Yeah, but I do, you know?

781
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:45,667
I got a job.
I go there, I go home.

782
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,334
I talk to as few people
as possible.

783
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,100
If it were only that easy.

784
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,334
Unfortunately for you,
getting mixed up in
other people's lives,

785
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:53,000
helping them out of jams,

786
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:54,801
it seems to
be what you do,

787
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,134
like it or not.

788
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,167
I'd hate to see you
turn your back on that.

789
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:01,067
It'd be like rning
your back on yourself.

790
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:02,567
Come on, join us, would you?

791
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:05,267
Get a little food, watch
the second half of the game.

792
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,134
Actually, there's something
I've got to do.

793
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,734
Uh, you guys have fun.

794
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:11,134
All right.
All right.

795
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,967
MAN:
Cover's 20 bucks,
just pay inside.

796
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:19,401
Let me do the
talking, okay?
All right.

797
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:20,734
You got an I.D.?

798
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:24,134
It's cool.

799
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,768
Cover's 20 bucks,
just pay inside.

800
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,501
Cool.

801
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:28,900
Sorry, boys,

802
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:29,834
not tonight.

803
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,801
What? Why?

804
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm sorry, is there a problem

805
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:33,000
with their I.D.'s?

806
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:34,000
Because they're with me.

807
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:35,267
There's a problem
with them.

808
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,067
See, I have the right to refuse
entry to anybody.

809
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:38,067
And tonight that includes

810
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:39,200
dorks and virgins.

811
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:41,134
So just beat it, guys.
Fine.
Whatever, man.

812
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,033
That blows.
Come on,
Kaitlin, let's go.

813
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,434
Yeah, you can't go in
there without us.

814
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,000
Who's going to protect you?

815
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,734
See you guys later.

816
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:53,933
Need you to move aside, guys.

817
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:07,167
----SANDY & JAN:
Go! Go, go, go!

818
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:08,001
Run!

819
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:09,900
groaning)

820
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,967
Man.

821
00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:14,067
This is great.

822
00:36:14,134 --> 00:36:16,234
Watching the game,
having a beer.

823
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:17,734
For five minutes,
the sky isn't falling.

824
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,201
A chance to be stupid again.

825
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:21,201
Here's to being stupid
for five minutes.

826
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:22,234
(phone ringing)

827
00:36:23,368 --> 00:36:24,700
Hey, honey.

828
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,001
How's it going?

829
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:27,434
Great. Spitz just told
me a story

830
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,334
about how his kid's walked in
on him and his wife

831
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:30,500
when they were playing
Strip Scrabble.

832
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:31,834
Strip Scrabble?

833
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,334
I'm glad things are going well.

834
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,567
Yeah.
So how are you doing?

835
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:35,700
You having fun with Julie?

836
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:38,368
Well, Julie had
a mysterious illness.

837
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:39,900
So I'm home alone.

838
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:42,567
I just finished watching a movie
and I thought I'd check in.

839
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,201
I love you.
I love you.

840
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:46,334
Bye.

841
00:36:52,434 --> 00:36:56,600
(speaking French)

842
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:59,201
I don't love him.

843
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:01,600
I never did.

844
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,401
I was just scared.

845
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:06,834
(speaking French)

846
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,201
Sorry I'm late.

847
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:23,633
You have that paper
for me to sign?

848
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:30,368
It won't be necessary.

849
00:37:30,434 --> 00:37:31,600
I may be a lawyer,

850
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,900
but I'm also a Frenchman.

851
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:35,468
I know love when
I see it.

852
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:37,134
I will inform Henri Michel.

853
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,167
Ryan, I...

854
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:42,567
Don't worry about it.

855
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:43,700
Yeah.

856
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:56,800
CHE:
We stand before you,
an organized student body.

857
00:37:56,867 --> 00:37:59,134
We have a question.

858
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:01,167
Where does this burden fall?

859
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:06,134
Hey, sleepyhead.

860
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:10,301
Hey.
Hey.

861
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:11,500
Did we win?

862
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:13,101
Not yet, but Che suggested
a filibuster,

863
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,633
so it could go on all night.

864
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,134
I think we got 'em.

865
00:38:16,201 --> 00:38:17,468
That's great.
Yeah.

866
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,834
When I showed them my cost
benefit analysis chart,

867
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,134
jaws actually dropped.

868
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:22,700
Of course they did.

869
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,368
There's all these
old people in there

870
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:25,800
that are actually
listening to me. Me!

871
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:28,067
It felt better than
when I got 70% off

872
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:29,767
that Marc Jacobs dress
with the broken zipper.

873
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:31,301
I wish I could have been there.

874
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:33,401
Instead you slept in the hallway

875
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:34,800
on your last night in
Providence.

876
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:36,234
I'm totally fine.

877
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:38,800
Listen, go back in there and
knock it out of the park.

878
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:40,001
Was that a sports reference?

879
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,134
Maybe.

880
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:43,633
See, I know people can change.

881
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:05,067
(knocking)

882
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,234
Yeah?

883
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:09,734
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you asleep?

884
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,934
No.

885
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:12,767
Oh, well, then my timing is

886
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:14,633
impeccable, as always.

887
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:17,767
So I wanted to
thank you.

888
00:39:17,834 --> 00:39:20,500
So I made you peach torte.

889
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,001
Yeah, after I got married,
Henri Michel

890
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:26,934
made me take a cooking class.

891
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:28,434
Um, I failed everything
except tortes.

892
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Tortes I rocked.

893
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,734
Uh, well, that's great,
but, um...

894
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,700
You're not a dessert guy.

895
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:32,934
Okay.

896
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:34,700
Well, um, I could make
you lunch, or... dinner.

897
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:36,468
I have to pay you back somehow.

898
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:37,767
I love dessert.

899
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,600
Okay.

900
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:44,368
Fork.

901
00:39:44,434 --> 00:39:45,767
Thanks.

902
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,301
Yeah? All right.

903
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,101
Wow.

904
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,834
Who would have thought,
six months ago,

905
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,600
you and I, sitting here,
sharing a torte.

906
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,533
Not me.

907
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,567
You know, at graduation,

908
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:01,167
in my commencement address,

909
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:03,767
I said there's no one older than
a high school senior,

910
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,834
no one younger than
a college freshman.

911
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,368
It was one of the few parts
that wasn't in Latin.

912
00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:11,633
And uh, it's true.

913
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,934
Because I feel like everything
I thought I knew,

914
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:17,667
everything that I expected,

915
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:20,001
is just kind of gone
out the window.

916
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:25,167
Yeah, life is definitely
unpredictable.

917
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:26,934
Yeah.

918
00:40:29,101 --> 00:40:31,734
But I guess I'm realizing that
that could be a good thing.

919
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,334
You know?

920
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,533
Because it's exciting not
knowing what's going to happen.

921
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,368
Taylor, this is a great torte.

922
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,034
Really good.

923
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:51,234
Can I have the next flight
to John Wayne Airport, please?

924
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:53,567
8:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

925
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,967
Come on.

926
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:02,468
(chuckles)

927
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:17,167
SETH:
Hey, Summer.
I know flying home early

928
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,034
is your move, but I stole it.

929
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:22,267
I just wanted to give you room
to keep doing

930
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:24,201
what you're doing, because
I think it's pretty amazing.

931
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:26,567
So if you don't hear from me
for a while, it's not because

932
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:29,567
<i>I don't love you,</i>
<i>it's because I do.</i>

933
