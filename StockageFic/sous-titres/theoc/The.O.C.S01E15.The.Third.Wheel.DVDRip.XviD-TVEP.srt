1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,078
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- Guess who's back.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,071
- Aunt Hailey.
- Did she say why she was here?

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,674
- She's out of money.
- You can't keep living like this.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,273
So I can grow up to be like you?

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,000
- He's really not my type.
- What's your type? Seth Cohen?

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,832
I didn't want you to be alone
on New Year's.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,150
- I'm having a party.
- We're not going.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,072
I'm not drinking.
Doesn't mean you can't.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,676
- Clean and sober, 11 months.
- Your girlfriend's at a party, alone?

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,035
- Not alone, with a guy named Oliver.
- You broke up.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,918
We're just not spending
New Year's together.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,718
I think it's just us tonight.

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,874
- She's eating us out of house and home.
- It's just a bagel.

14
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,712
No. No, no, it's never just a bagel.

15
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,917
As someone who's basically been
a shut-in for the last 17 years...

16
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,992
...I can say with great authority
that she never leaves the house.

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,118
- She's got nowhere else to go.
- Because her friends want to kick her ass.

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,114
- Sorry about the language.
- Why? I'd like to kick her ass.

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,319
- Kirsten.
- Coming.

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,040
There's no more coffee.
Will you make some?

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,159
- The French roast, not the harvest blend.
- No, no, no.

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,754
I'll talk to her.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,798
So I'll have to survive
on English muffins.

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,070
Marissa? Marissa? Hello.
She's gotta be here somewhere.

25
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,470
- Hilarious.
- Yeah. Okay. Listen to me.

26
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,518
Hailey is always in the living room.
Marissa's always here.

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,911
I'm lost. What happened to
Seth-Ryan time? That was quality time.

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,514
- Okay. I know I've been a little bit...
- Whipped?

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,352
I'm not whipped.

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,470
- I'm free to talk now. What's up?
- Squeezing me in before school? Nice.

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,473
But actually, I'll take it.
Okay, here's the thing:

32
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,154
Anna and I are gonna take it
to the next level. I need advice.

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,914
- You're gonna have sex?
- No. That's a good idea, though.

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,150
We're gonna tell Summer
that we're dating.

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,471
As much as I fear Summer hurting me,
with the rage blackouts and all...

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,790
...I'm actually more scared
about hurting her feelings.

37
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,396
We've become friends now,
and I feel like I don't want to...

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,279
- You guys ready to go?
- Yeah. We were just talking.

39
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,429
Really? About what?

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,194
Guy stuff. Hunting
and shaving and shoes.

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,510
Actually, the cleats for the sports.

42
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,633
Okay, well, come on.

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,592
Hey, later, can we finish this chat?
Put in a little Seth-Ryan time?

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,639
Yes. Absolutely,
just gotta check with...

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,593
Oh, you forgot your balls.

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,196
- You and me. Tonight.
- Come on.

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,394
- Are we one of those couples?
- Who lose all their friends?

48
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,959
And can't do anything
without each other?

49
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,111
I don't think so. You think so?

50
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,229
- That'd be good, a night apart.
- Yeah, plus, I'm kind of sick of you.

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,516
I'm sick of me too.

52
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,432
- I gotta go.
- Yeah. And I got the...

53
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,235
- Walk me?
- I'll walk you.

54
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,432
- Don't make me.
- Don't make you what?

55
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,874
- Hurt you.
- Watch this.

56
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,314
Stop it.

57
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,278
- What's up?
- Hey. What is up?

58
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,271
- I was talking to her.
- That's cool.

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,829
- Do you have plans this weekend?
- Nothing.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,515
What Anna's trying to say is, she's not
gonna do anything. We're both not.

61
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,240
That's what we're both doing.
We're doing nothing.

62
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,868
But doing that by ourselves.

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,870
Thank you, Cohen. You just reminded
me that I need my bio textbook...

64
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,553
...because we're studying monkeys.

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,797
Ouch.

66
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,953
I hate liars, and now I'm one of them.
I thought you were gonna talk to her.

67
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,634
I am gonna talk to her.
I don't know how.

68
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,791
- I'll tell her then.
- No. I have to do it.

69
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,758
Tonight me and Ryan
are gonna have a strategy meeting.

70
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,831
We're gonna figure out
the whole thing.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,673
- That makes me feel better.
- Then we'll be free to do this.

72
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,149
- Seth. I have to study.
- And this.

73
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,112
I started my own business
right out of college.

74
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,909
And now I'm a father of two
and I've got one line on my r Ásum Á.

75
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,431
- Did you ever mow your lawn as a kid?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,068
Great. "Jimmy Cooper Landscaping,"
your first job.

77
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,073
- Now you're an entrepreneur.
- I don't even have references.

78
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,356
Sure you do, your clients...

79
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,239
...whose money you stole. Right.

80
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,631
- Is that Jimmy Cooper?
- Hey, Hailey!

81
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,912
You look fantastic. How you doing?

82
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,197
She's got no jobs,
no friends and no prospects.

83
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,114
- And I say that with love.
- Sounds like we got a lot in common.

84
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,312
- So did you guys have the talk?
- Yes.

85
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,119
We almost did.

86
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,078
We were having fun.
And all we've done is fight for so long.

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,959
It was nice to just hang out
and be sisters.

88
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,998
- I'll find out if she has a plan.
- You know what her plan is.

89
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,752
She'll stay here and mooch off us...

90
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,434
...until she can make a withdrawal
from the Bank of Dad.

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,511
Then she'll take off again
for a few years.

92
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,356
- She said she wasn't gonna do that.
- She's gonna mooch off us forever?

93
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,078
- She's not mooching.
- Oh, really?

94
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,470
Then how'd she get
all those new clothes?

95
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,792
From the salary she doesn't make?
From the trust fund she drained?

96
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,996
- I bought you bagels.
- That fixes everything?

97
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,958
- Yes, it does.
- Sesame.

98
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,590
That's a start. I'm gonna hide them.

99
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,832
So yeah. Now I'm broke
and sleeping at my sister's.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,075
I'm broke and my wife is sleeping
with your father. Fantastic.

101
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,312
We've done well for ourselves.

102
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,153
Who knew back when
Kirsten and I were babysitting you...

103
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,515
...and you were watching
<i>Silver Spoons</i>...

104
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,030
...that we'd both turn out to be so...?
- Complicated.

105
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,149
- And it was <i>Golden Girls</i>.
- That's right. You loved <i>Golden Girls</i>.

106
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,711
It's impressive that I was 10 and relating
to the lives of 70-year-old women.

107
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,872
Blanche was 70? She aged really well.

108
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,191
I'd love to hang, hear how
you made such a mess of your life.

109
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,509
Same. Although I bet your story
doesn't involve a fistfight at cotillion.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,833
No. But I bet yours doesn't
contain half a pound of hash...

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,275
...and a border guard in Budapest.

112
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,509
No.

113
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,915
It's nice that you and Jimmy
are friends again.

114
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,471
I guess I can't blame a guy
for wanting to kiss my wife.

115
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,793
It feels like we never have
any time alone anymore.

116
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,157
That's not true. We have moments.

117
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,880
I want more moments.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,595
- God, they're so whipped.
- I gotta go pick up Marissa.

119
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,034
- Sandy, thank you.
- Anytime.

120
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,397
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes.

121
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,028
Jimmy and I are gonna hang out
tomorrow night, catch up.

122
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,954
- Hang out, like "out"?
- I bet you have a lot to catch up on.

123
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,079
- Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night.

124
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,155
Hey, man. How's it going?

125
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,871
Got a flat tire.

126
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,951
You ran over a nail?

127
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,429
Somebody slashed it.

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,318
Want some help?

129
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,713
Thanks. I got a spare in the back.

130
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,238
Hey, Luke, why doesn't
your dad help you with that tire?

131
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,755
I'm sure he'd like to bend over.

132
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,954
- New Year's resolution. Punch people less.
- I had the same one.

133
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,711
You think I'm getting what I deserve
after years of being a jackass?

134
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,472
Definitely.

135
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,599
Hey, why don't we just get out of here.
The tire can wait.

136
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,551
Yeah, that sounds good.

137
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,793
Go. Go, go, go. Break that tackle.
Go. Yeah!

138
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,918
Who plays PlayStation
for the sports games?

139
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,039
Listen to me. You said Seth-Ryan time.
This isn't Seth-Ryan time.

140
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,794
This is Seth-Luke-Ryan time,
and you know what? Guess what.

141
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,032
- There's no such thing.
- Maybe Luke will have some good advice.

142
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,919
What does that guy know about
juggling women? Come on.

143
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,792
Okay, quite a bit.
But he wasn't good at it.

144
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,916
He's having a bad day.

145
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,514
I'm having a bad day, okay?
I'm having a bad week.

146
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,114
Some kids at school slashed his tires.

147
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,555
Damn it. What do you think
he wants on his pizza?

148
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,190
Hey, Cohen. Check out the replay
on this tackle. I broke this bitch in half.

149
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,114
Luke has a gay dad. Luke has a gay dad.
Can't wait to see it, buddy.

150
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,078
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

151
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,036
<i>I'm at Oliver's, and he</i>
<i>just ordered way too much food.</i>

152
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,111
I know you wanted to spend
tonight apart...

153
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,918
...but he asked if you
would come by.

154
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,389
- You're at Oliver's?
- Summer had plans.

155
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,915
I saw Oliver at therapy.
He said if I wanted...

156
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,557
- <i>That's so good.</i>
- <i>It's Moroccan.</i>

157
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,870
- What's Moroccan?
- The food. Just come. Okay?

158
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,235
<i>See you soon.</i>

159
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,600
How do you guys feel about Moroccan?

160
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,829
I think I really hurt that guy.

161
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,519
- Hey, where's the silverware?
- Moroccan you eat with your hands.

162
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,194
No wonder Luke
seems to be enjoying it so much.

163
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,510
- How good is the couscous?
- Amazing.

164
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,236
- It's pretty good.
- No, that's the kefta.

165
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,311
Couscous is the other thing.

166
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,393
I can't believe you live in a penthouse.
This place is "ridonculous."

167
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,836
It's always been my fantasy
to live in a hotel. Like Eloise.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,719
Yeah, well, I guess.
But with my parents traveling so much...

169
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,438
...it can get a little Ionely.

170
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,397
- Lf you ever need any company...
- Thanks.

171
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,189
They might be gone a while,
opening a new hotel in Paris.

172
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,750
I love Paris. I could spend all day
walking the Champs Elys Áes.

173
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,150
I like Paris. I love baguettes.

174
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,118
Dude, French chicks
don't even shave their armpits.

175
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,472
- Have you ever been to Paris, Ryan?
- No, not yet.

176
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,915
- I hear the Louvre's cool.
- Do not go near it.

177
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,755
Totally overrated. The <i>Mona Lisa</i>'s
the size of a postage stamp.

178
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,912
Now, the Rodin Museum
and the Mus Áe Picasso...

179
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,909
But you know where my family's been
spending most of their time? Switzerland.

180
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,675
- Snowboarding the Alps is unreal.
- You boarded the Alps?

181
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,990
The closest I've ever come
is Whistler.

182
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,674
We have a place in Big Bear.
We should go one weekend.

183
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,355
- Could you teach Ryan to board?
- Lf you can get him on a chair lift.

184
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,637
First two days, you'll be on your ass,
but we'll get you there.

185
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,395
- I really like this song.
- You know, they're playing tomorrow.

186
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,358
- Yeah, but it's all sold out.
- Do you wanna go?

187
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,999
Yeah, but it's all sold out.

188
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,879
I'll call their manager tomorrow.
They're amazing live.

189
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,395
- You know Rooney?
- That would be awesome.

190
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,916
I've never heard of them,
but I got nothing. I'll go.

191
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,354
Ryan?

192
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,308
- Come on, we'll all get to hang out.
- It'll be fun.

193
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,790
- Cool.
- All right, then it's settled. We're going.

194
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,916
- Groovy.
- Hey, nice.

195
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,559
This is gonna be great.

196
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,638
So now you're eating with silverware?
Next thing, I'll see you at the Louvre.

197
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,519
No, you won't, because,
like Oliver said, it's lame.

198
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,757
Can we please focus on the crisis
at hand for one second? Okay?

199
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,354
Summer. The way I figure it,
I have many options.

200
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,112
Like the truth. That's a good one.

201
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,599
Hey, no argument there, buddy...

202
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,955
...but I'm talking about
my messenger of truth.

203
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,270
My delivery system of honesty.
The way I tell her.

204
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,000
- Now, listen. I could call her. That's one.
- Okay.

205
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,869
It is okay, but just okay.
It lacks any real spark or imagination.

206
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,112
But it's effective. Your voice
on one end, hers on the other.

207
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,909
- "I'm dating Anna." She'll hear you.
- But the phone is a blunt instrument, no?

208
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,038
What about text messaging?

209
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,239
I could Blackberry her. That feels very hip,
it feels edgy, it feels 21 st century.

210
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,073
- Kind of cold.
- Mittens required, yes.

211
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,398
A carrier pigeon. How cool
would that be? Think about it.

212
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,996
A little message in his cute little talons.
Summer's a pigeon fan.

213
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,479
- You're a coward.
- Am I?

214
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,677
Or am I just too sensitive
to the feelings of others?

215
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,110
Coward, definitely.

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,592
Fine, I'll tell her Monday.

217
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,199
Actually, I think Tuesday.
I might give it till Friday.

218
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,715
That way she'll have the weekend
to let it marinate...

219
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,348
- You could do it today.
- No. Today will soon be tonight.

220
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,239
And tonight will be Rooney.
And Rooney will be awesome.

221
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,075
Rooney. I saw them open
for The Vines in L.A. Last year.

222
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,312
- Big whoop. We're seeing them tonight.
- I thought it was sold out.

223
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,916
It happens they are. But I also happen
to be dialed in. I got the hookups.

224
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,878
Or at least Oliver does.
And I'm gonna ride his coattails.

225
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,239
Oliver? As in Oliver, the guy who wanted
to kiss your girlfriend on New Year's?

226
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,039
- Morning, Hailey.
- It's not like that. He's got a girlfriend.

227
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,590
Wait. If he has a girlfriend, why is he
always hanging out with yours?

228
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,713
- Couldn't tell you, but thanks.
- The guy seems cool, right?

229
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,189
I don't know. We don't seem
to have a lot in common.

230
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,399
- Besides your girlfriend.
- Keep twisting the knife. Feels good.

231
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,199
Whatever. He got us backstage passes.
Good enough for me.

232
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,831
Backstage? So now you have to worry
about your girl with Oliver and rock stars?

233
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,397
Mind if I finish cornflakes?

234
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,789
Hey, at least she asked.
It's a start.

235
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,633
Well, at least she's leaving the house.
It's a start.

236
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,270
- We'll have the place to ourselves.
- Yes. We can eat bagels.

237
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,274
- And I can wear my robe.
- Or not. I can have the remote back.

238
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,955
She's crammed that TiVo full
of every <i>E! True Hollywood</i> special.

239
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,588
- I think she's looking for tips.
- That's nice.

240
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,196
I'm just saying,
she's cluttering up the TiVo.

241
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,874
And a clear TiVo equals a clear mind.

242
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,874
Are we okay with the kids going
to that concert?

243
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,600
- Yeah.
- What if Rooney is, like...

244
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,150
...death-metal Satan-worshipping
speed freaks?

245
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,039
Honey, that went out in the late '90s.

246
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,156
I saw it on a special on E!

247
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,074
I'll run Rooney up my proverbial flagpole,
but you have got to speak to Hailey.

248
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,234
So?

249
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,758
- Yeah, it's my first time hearing it, so...
- That's why we're doing a run-through.

250
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,673
- So you'll have heard it all before tonight.
- Right.

251
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,195
- So we're going tonight?
- No. It's your first concert.

252
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,591
We have free tickets, backstage passes.
You're right, we should skip it.

253
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,150
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?

254
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,391
- Have you met Natalie?
- No, but I hear she's great.

255
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,996
- And Oliver is...? I mean...
- Is someone jealous?

256
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,874
This song is good.
Turn it up. Really, really loud.

257
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,509
Oliver will be with Natalie.
Rooney is a really good band.

258
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,592
- And tonight we're gonna have fun.
- I know.

259
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,799
- There won't be dancing, right?
- I'll dance. You can watch.

260
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,996
Works for me.

261
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,593
- I think that's enough.
- What?

262
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,194
There was almost a knee bend.
You were about to find the beat.

263
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,318
- And?
- Remember cousin Jeffery's bar mitzvah?

264
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,869
You almost wiped out a dozen kids
on the dance floor.

265
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,554
That "Y.M.C.A." song
requires a lot of movement.

266
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,713
- I'm just trying to spare casualties.
- So anyone gonna be doing drugs?

267
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,950
I hope so, otherwise
it's a lame-ass concert.

268
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,997
Anyone named Seth
gonna be doing any drugs?

269
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,628
No. Nobody named Seth Cohen.
I promise.

270
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,075
Gotta stay sharp.
It's my first date with Anna.

271
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,357
It is? So you and Summer
finally had the talk?

272
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,476
Oh, yes, almost several times.

273
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,153
- Seth.
- Father.

274
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,198
The sooner you tell her,
the better you'll feel about everything.

275
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,112
See, I don't really believe that.

276
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,671
I'm feeling like the longer I wait
to tell her, the longer I'll feel great.

277
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,751
The best advice
I can give you is this.

278
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,753
It's from Steven Seagal in
his classic film <i>Hard to Kill.</i>

279
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,150
"The anticipation of death
is far worse than death itself."

280
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,232
Great. So then we both agree
that Summer's gonna kill me.

281
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,039
Look, if you're old enough
to go to a concert alone...

282
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,953
...if you're old enough to embark
on a real relationship...

283
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,475
...you are old enough to be a man.

284
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,835
Well, she's not gonna be
there tonight...

285
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,797
...so I'll tell her Monday.
- Good.

286
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,717
Now, get going. Your mother
and I want some time alone.

287
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,839
There's a visual that
I don't want to take with me tonight.

288
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,798
Well, son, your mom's a hottie,
and I got her.

289
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,996
- I don't see him.
- Maybe he's inside.

290
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,878
- Excuse me, are you on the list?
- Yeah, we're with Oliver Trask.

291
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,270
- Who's Oliver Trask?
- You don't have his name?

292
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,797
No, I don't have his name.
I've never heard it. That's why I'm asking.

293
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,953
- Thanks, you've been very helpful.
- I'll call him and see where he is.

294
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,395
- A lot of freaks here, huh, Cohen?
- Yeah.

295
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,757
Good job, Luke. That should
help make us a lot of friends.

296
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,353
- Damn it.
- What?

297
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,513
Well, dude, they're gonna go on soon.
If Oliver's late, we'll miss the first song.

298
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,639
They only have one album. Factor in
your standard cover, that's 12 songs.

299
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,155
Oh, no. But, hey. I mean, come on.

300
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,312
If we don't get in,
we're still gonna have fun tonight.

301
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,152
- Right?
- What are we gonna do?

302
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,319
I hope you guys aren't waiting for me.

303
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,471
- Summer.
- Cohen.

304
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,234
- Hey, Anna.
- Summer.

305
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,918
- Who are you talking to?
- It just goes straight to voice mail.

306
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,548
Dude, look at that freak.

307
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,551
Hey, I drove alone.
Will you ride with me?

308
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,757
You want to give up so early?
Maybe I can grease a few palms.

309
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,638
Hey.

310
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,556
- There you are.
- What's up, man?

311
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,393
- Hi.
- I thought you were a no-show.

312
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,757
- What happened? I said back door.
- No, you didn't.

313
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,151
- Load in here, guys.
- The band's here.

314
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,753
- It's all happening.
- What up, guys?

315
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,753
Robert, how's it going?
Good to see you.

316
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,319
Looking forward to the show.

317
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,233
- Thank you.
- I guess we're on time.

318
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,960
- Which one's Rooney?
- They're all Rooney.

319
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,669
- Hey, man, this is my posse.
- This is crazy.

320
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,837
- Hey. So where's Natalie?
- Yeah, we had another fight.

321
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,152
This whole long-distance thing's tough.
Looks like I'm dateless tonight.

322
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,278
Hey, no! No way.
We'll be your date, right?

323
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,234
Yeah, right.

324
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,916
- So should we fire up the hot tub?
- Interesting. Open a bottle of wine.

325
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,150
Oh, I like it.

326
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,356
First, TiVo. I'm gonna
erase Hailey's programs.

327
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,999
- Hot pizza?
- Hailey.

328
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,435
Hey, guys. You're just in time.

329
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,629
Doctor. Doctor.

330
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,073
- James.
- What's up?

331
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,595
I just thought that you were
going out tonight.

332
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,514
We were. But then I found out there's
a <i>Golden Girls</i> marathon on Lifetime.

333
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,114
And I decided to dig up
all my favorite board games.

334
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,840
We're having a throwback
to the old babysitting days.

335
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,232
- Why don't you guys join us?
- Great. That would be great.

336
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,476
Oh, I love this episode. This is the one
where Rose adopts the pig.

337
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,039
She adopted the pig?

338
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,679
- Do you play?
- A little.

339
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,115
- Here, man.
- All access? Sweet.

340
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,080
- Hey, it's cool?
- It's cool.

341
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,037
- Hey, check it out.
- Seriously?

342
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,997
Yeah.

343
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,790
Awesome.
I just got a few songs that I wrote.

344
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,398
Okay, I'm just gonna...

345
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,515
Seth, you have to tell her tonight.

346
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,114
- No, I don't.
- Hey.

347
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,633
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

348
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,109
- So, Luke, he's...
- Yeah, we don't let him out much.

349
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,430
Yeah. But you guys are cool,
having fun?

350
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,511
- Everything's awesome.
- Glad to hear it.

351
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,989
Yeah. Everything is not awesome.

352
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,072
If I don't tell Summer tonight,
then later, when I do tell her...

353
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,232
...she'll remember the fun she had
at Rooney. That will cheer her up.

354
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,712
There's never gonna be a good time
to tell her. Tonight's not a bad night.

355
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,476
There's a lot of guys here.
Cute guys, older guys. A lot of musicians.

356
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,790
Girls like musicians.

357
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,190
Maybe you're right.

358
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,832
Am I flattering myself
to even think that Summer'll care?

359
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,516
I mean, me compared
to that dude or that guy.

360
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,511
- Right.
- Are you checking out dudes again?

361
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,638
No.

362
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,349
But there are plenty here tonight,
aren't there? A lot of musicians.

363
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,909
In fact, I think I'm gonna go
find some myself.

364
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,959
Why don't you and Seth talk.
You know, about anything.

365
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,836
- Cohen, you and Anna...?
- Me and Anna what? What?

366
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,196
Will you guys stand with me
at the concert?

367
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,920
Marissa's on a date,
and I'm all alone tonight, so...

368
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,354
Okay, that would be nice.

369
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,512
Yeah. Hey, man. I thought your boy
was supposed to be here an hour ago.

370
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,591
No. Okay, no excuses.

371
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,515
I don't care who you send. Just make
sure it's good and it gets here quick.

372
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,432
All right.

373
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,039
I can't see. I'm stuck behind
a row of giants. Come with me.

374
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,633
Okay, lead the way.

375
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,235
Sorry.

376
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,878
Hey. Did you tell her?
What did she say? Did she leave?

377
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,270
No. Summer is bringing refreshments
for her friends.

378
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,353
- Seth said you were thirsty.
- Yeah. You are thirsty, aren't you?

379
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,793
- <i>You suck.</i>
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

380
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,754
- I gotta pee. You gotta pee?
- I'll come with you.

381
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,314
<i>I'm telling her.</i>

382
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,988
You know the night that Mom and Dad
came home early from Palm Springs?

383
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,276
And we flushed all that beer
down the toilet.

384
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,032
- A lot of good that did.
- I know.

385
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,191
Dad caught you
throwing out the empty bottles.

386
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,795
- I thought you were sleeping.
- Face it, sister.

387
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,632
Everything I know,
I learned from you.

388
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,552
You were a bad influence
back in the day.

389
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,836
How do you think I learned
to piss off Dad?

390
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,595
- The student becomes the master.
- And the master becomes Dad's slave.

391
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,276
Helping to turn paradise into a parking lot,
or at least a three-car garage.

392
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,435
Hey, Connect Four!

393
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,955
Congratulations.
Next Saturday, Yahtzee.

394
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,918
No, wait. Stay. Battleship? Uno?

395
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,991
You know, Sandy's right. It's late.

396
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,391
And, besides, I have a show home
waiting for me in the morning.

397
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,199
Just what Orange County needs.
Another show home.

398
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,511
Airlifted from the McMansion factory
and dropped from the sky...

399
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,240
The one on the bluff,
that's a great house.

400
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,837
If by "great" you mean overbuilt,
overpriced and exactly like this one.

401
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,117
- Oh, nice. Hailey, nice.
- I was kidding.

402
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,511
- I'm laughing on the inside.
- I'm not. You're living in our home.

403
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,958
You're insulting my wife.
You're driving my whole family crazy.

404
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,951
- Is this true?
- Yeah.

405
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,156
And we all know
what you're doing here.

406
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,119
She didn't mean anything.
It's just sisters.

407
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,238
No, all this talk about plans,
about growing up, it's shtick.

408
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,119
It's a routine. And it's tired.

409
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,396
You know who's tired? Me.
So why don't we stop.

410
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,834
No, stop protecting her.

411
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,556
You're not even nice to Kirsten.
She's the only reason we put up with you.

412
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,998
Well, you won't have to put up with me
for much longer, okay?

413
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,276
- Sorry?
- It's not your fault, Jimmy.

414
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,351
No, I meant the board game.

415
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,592
- You like <i>The Golden Girls</i>?
- Yes.

416
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,638
There's a marathon on.
I can't get the song out of my head.

417
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,358
I love <i>The Golden Girls.</i>

418
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,670
It's not Rose's fault.
She just is that way.

419
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,876
You're Rose? I'm Blanche.

420
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,918
It's kind of weird that I relate
to a 70-year-old, but...

421
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,594
How good was the episode
when there was a blackout?

422
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,830
How about when Rose adopts the pig?

423
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,993
Then Sophia loses her glasses
and thinks the pig is a baby.

424
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,957
It's so funny.

425
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,239
Jimmy, wait.

426
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,393
Sorry about that in there.
My little tantrum.

427
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,918
Oh, listen, it's complicated between
you and your sister. It always has been.

428
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,116
You gotta go, like, right now?

429
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,159
Yeah, I don't know if I ever told you,
but I'm an extremely important person.

430
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,118
And so I have to...

431
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,956
Yeah. No, Marissa's at a concert.

432
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,270
Yep, nothing but time.

433
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,036
Didn't tonight feel like
the good old days?

434
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,711
No. It was more like two kind of pathetic
people grasping for the old days.

435
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,470
- Right. That too.
- Yeah.

436
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,916
Look, the good old days.
They're exactly that.

437
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,595
Would you really want to be back
in high school?

438
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,518
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I would too.

439
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,315
- And you think I'm pathetic?
- Yes, I do. It's sad, really.

440
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,915
I always had a crush on you.
You know that?

441
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,194
No. You were 8
when I went away to college.

442
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,590
So I wasn't...

443
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,755
You're Kirsten's sister.

444
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,312
So I've heard all my life.

445
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,434
Look, we don't want to make
a complicated situation...

446
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,556
...even more complicated, right?

447
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,789
The last thing we need is having
Sandy or Kirsten catching us.

448
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,793
Unless that's what you're hoping for.

449
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,271
Look, your sister is amazing...

450
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,637
...and Sandy is such a great guy.

451
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,872
I think you're lucky
to have them looking out for you.

452
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,876
I know that I am.

453
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,312
I'm gonna go.

454
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,357
Okay.

455
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,440
- Hi. I'm gonna...
- Hey, this is great, right?

456
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,352
Perfect.

457
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,834
Come here a second.

458
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,151
- What are we doing?
- This is better.

459
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,392
Wait. But we're missing the concert.
We can't ditch Oliver.

460
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,155
- Oliver's fine. He's friends with the band.
- And with us.

461
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,959
I thought you said you wanted us
to hang out with friends.

462
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,351
You've known him two weeks.
How good a friend can he be?

463
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,034
Look. He's in recovery,
trying to stay clean.

464
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,713
We can talk about stuff.

465
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,235
He tells me things.
What he's going through.

466
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,960
- Unlike me, right?
- I didn't say that.

467
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,356
I know you didn't want
to come here tonight...

468
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,750
...so, I mean,
I guess if you want to leave...

469
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,599
Right.

470
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,032
Later.

471
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,236
Hey, Luke.

472
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,233
- You know who sings this song?
- Rooney.

473
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,639
- Rooney!
- We should keep it that way.

474
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,870
Yeah, Rooney!

475
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,917
What the hell, man?! Get off me!

476
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,196
- Hey, get off him!
- I'm a cop.

477
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,032
- What? There's gotta be some mistake.
- Yeah. His.

478
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,634
He just tried to buy
3 grams of coke from me.

479
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,998
Ryan, go back inside.
Don't tell anybody.

480
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,074
Excuse me, barkeep, sir.

481
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,355
- Hey.
- What can I get you?

482
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,549
How did you do that? The usual.

483
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,193
- Mountain Dew.
- How many?

484
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,396
Unfortunately, three.

485
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,710
So Anna's telling Summer
that we're a couple.

486
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,156
When they get back, I will officially
be in a relationship with Anna.

487
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,914
Unless Summer kills me,
in which case, you've been like a brother.

488
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,798
Good, because I need
your keys and phone.

489
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,918
- Yeah, you okay?
- I'm fine. It's Oliver.

490
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,551
- What? What's going on?
- Tell you later?

491
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,870
All right. You'll miss
a hell of a show, though.

492
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,190
Rooney's not bad, either.

493
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,556
- Is Jimmy gone?
- Yeah. Is she all right?

494
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,950
I knocked. She didn't answer.

495
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,872
Maybe she's giving us the house back.

496
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,033
Or maybe she's packing and she'll
be gone in the morning. And frankly...

497
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,113
...I'd rather have her here, where I can
keep an eye on her, than anywhere else.

498
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,308
You can't keep her here forever. It's no
good for her and it's no good for us.

499
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,399
Hello?

500
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,636
Hey, what's wrong?

501
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,155
Where are you?

502
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,239
I'll be right there.

503
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,960
Ryan's at the police station.

504
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,518
Thank you, Newport Beach.
Good night, everybody.

505
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,997
- Seth.
- Hey.

506
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,276
- Where have you been?
- At the bar. How was it?

507
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,590
It was amazing.
They played the whole album.

508
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,638
Not with Rooney, how did it go
with Summer? Did you tell her?

509
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,916
Tell me what?

510
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,634
So you're a couple?

511
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,313
- No.
- Yes.

512
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,678
We wanted to tell you first before we
became a couple, which now we are.

513
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,751
- So you chose Anna?
- No.

514
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,231
Kind of, yeah.
She came over on New Year's Eve.

515
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,277
You were with me on New Year's Eve.

516
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,591
Technically, you were with
that guy Allan, remember?

517
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,151
And you kept insisting that
I go find someone to kiss, so I did.

518
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,869
I was taking out the garbage, she was
in the driveway. You know how it goes.

519
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,713
Okay, well, congrats.

520
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,710
You're not mad?

521
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,397
Good, because I didn't want this
to affect our relationship in any way.

522
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,199
Well, Anna, I have to say...

523
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,194
...that Rose would've never pulled
that New Year's stunt on Blanche.

524
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,157
I know. I'm sorry.

525
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,551
Although Blanche
would've done it to Rose, so...

526
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,791
So can we still all hang out?
Will you be cool with that?

527
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,872
We'd both really like that
if we could hang out.

528
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,274
Sure. You guys,
we can totally hang out.

529
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,557
I mean, in fact,
what are you guys doing right now?

530
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,159
So they're gonna let him go.

531
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,118
- Really? How'd you do that?
- I'm just that good.

532
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,875
- I used to play poker with these guys.
- Thanks for doing this.

533
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,713
- You didn't have to, really.
- Is this kid a friend of yours?

534
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,313
He's a friend of Marissa's.

535
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,199
They met in therapy.
He said he's been clean a while, but...

536
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,873
They busted him trying to buy coke.

537
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,271
Then he said his parents are away
for a month. Can you believe that?

538
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,158
A parent leaves a kid
like that on his own.

539
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,992
Yeah, imagine that.

540
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,675
- I'll never understand it.
- I hope not.

541
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,671
- I'm glad you called me.
- Me too.

542
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,319
I'm gonna finish up your paperwork.
You sit tight. I'll be right back.

543
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,958
So thanks.

544
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,910
Seth's dad seems cool.

545
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,871
He is.

546
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,914
So why'd you do this for me?

547
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,954
I mean, you don't even like me, man.

548
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,790
I don't really know you.

549
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:32,517
Well, if it's any consolation, I don't
like myself very much right now, either.

550
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,314
- So, what happened?
- I don't know.

551
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,156
Natalie didn't show.
And then I saw you and Marissa.

552
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,876
Your friends.

553
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,358
Then it hit me.

554
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,354
I have no one. My parents are gone.

555
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,911
My friends,
if you can even call them that...

556
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,719
...they all disappeared
when I got clean.

557
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,791
Now I...

558
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,999
There's Marissa.
Seth likes your taste in music.

559
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,354
And Luke pretty much
likes everybody at this point.

560
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,397
And what about you? I mean, you must
like me a little to get me out of jail.

561
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,273
No, that was Sandy.

562
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,157
Marissa.

563
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,472
You gonna tell her?

564
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,831
No.

565
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,952
You are.

566
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,437
Hey.

567
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,950
Yeah, it's Oliver.

568
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,955
Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey!

569
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,634
- I can't have half?
- There are other bagels.

570
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,554
- Not salt bagels.
- You ate them all. And several sesame.

571
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,519
I haven't been the best guest, I know.

572
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,876
- And what you said tonight...
- Hey, Connect Four was happening.

573
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,270
It gets my blood up.

574
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,556
Well, you were right.

575
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,639
So, what's the plan? Hit Caleb up
for more cash. And then what?

576
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,271
- Europe this time? Iceland? Boca?
- I don't know.

577
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,352
You know, I see how happy you guys are,
and I think, "Why can't I have that?"

578
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,829
- Because you don't want it.
- How do you know?

579
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,514
I don't even know what I want.

580
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,751
You could stay here.

581
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,275
I mean, not here exactly...

582
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,829
...but, you know, get a home.

583
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,872
- A job. Settle down.
- No.

584
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,834
See, that's the thing.
All I know is what I don't want.

585
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,039
Well, that's not entirely true.

586
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,237
And the rest...

587
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,677
...you'll figure out. Good night.

588
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,878
Good night.

589
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,070
- Hey.
- Hey.

590
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,671
No, wait, don't get up.

591
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,752
Thanks.

592
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,912
He's not a bad guy, Oliver. He's...

593
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,433
This may come as a shock to you...

594
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,831
...but right now,
I don't want to talk about Oliver.

595
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,033
Oh, hey, wow, kissing.
Sorry about that.

596
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,476
We're gonna hang out inside, but
you guys are obviously alone together...

597
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,675
...so do that.

598
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,798
- Ryan, what happened to you?
- Luke, please, you're shouting.

599
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,112
- Someone stood too close to the speaker.
- Dude, that concert did not suck at all.

600
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,070
- We PlayStationing it, or what?
- Yeah. Any time you want to join us.

601
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,515
Let's go before he wakes up
your parents.

602
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,352
Think we can teach him to fetch?

603
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,559
I don't want to be the third wheel
or watch you guys make out, so enjoy.

604
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,353
- Well, we could stay here.
- Yeah, but maybe we should...

605
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,871
Race you?

606
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,790
Cohen, you've played
this game before?

607
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,520
See the way I ripped
that guy's spine out?

608
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,750
Sitting right here, buddy.

609
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,430
I am so glad we all could hang out
together like this, aren't you guys?

610
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,914
- Yeah.
- Damn it.

611
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,593
- Ryan, you're up.
- You're up, Ryan.

612
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,115
We'll make it best of five.
