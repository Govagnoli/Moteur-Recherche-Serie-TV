1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,229
Previously on The O. C. :

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,311
Wait. Do you have a shirt
I can borrow?

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,556
-I've had enough.
-I'm just getting started.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,035
-You almost kissed Cohen?
-lt was not a kiss. It was a nose graze.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,471
I talked to Wildstorm. I set up
a meeting. We're going to San Diego.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,035
Sandy, I've had a couple strokes.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,674
-Rebecca Bloom. You still love her.
-She's dead.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,075
-How'd she take my return?
-I haven't told her.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,918
I don't want her
to be an accomplice.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,553
Sandy? Is that you?

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,557
Rebecca?

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,110
Ryan, I had no idea you felt this way.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,317
Don't look at me.
There were here when I came in.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,034
Hey, you do realize
Valentine's Day is tomorrow, right?

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,034
We're starting a little earlier this year.
Your mother deserves a long holiday...

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,270
...what with your grandfather
in the hospital.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,948
And you burning the midnight oil
as much as you have.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,554
Give me a hand.
The rest are in the car.

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,833
You got more flowers?
There's such a thing as overkill.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,197
Man, your parents are pretty hardcore
about Valentine's Day.

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,715
I just hope I survive
this hateful holiday.

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,110
-Still broken up over the Alex breakup?
-No.

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,795
That's emotional child's play compared
to what we're dealing with now, Ryan.

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,234
Summer's back.

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,228
-What?
-Yes. And I don't want it be. Believe me.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,029
-But the universe has other plans for us.
-The universe is involved now.

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,316
Why would I have to go
to San Diego with her...

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,870
...on the one-year anniversary
of our sexual tête-à-tête...

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,271
-...or pas de deux, if you will?
-As long as it's not a ménage à trois.

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,159
Since you'll be going to San Diego
with Zach, her boyfriend.

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,759
-Yeah, and my friend.
-Yeah.

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,639
I don't wanna go to San Diego.
I don't wanna go near Summer.

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,678
-No, but the universe.
-Yeah, exactly.

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,478
It shouldn't be a problem for you.

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,200
You and Summer have been friends
for a while now, right?

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,035
Yes. And I'd be a little more confident
about my chances of cheating fate...

37
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,079
...and not cheating
if Summer and I hadn't made out.

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,550
-You guys made out?
-No. But our noses grazed.

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,632
And it was, like, the most
sexually charged nose graze...

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,554
...in the history of nose grazes. It's
essentially nose humping, is what it is.

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,558
-So, what am I gonna do?
-I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,315
You're gonna go to San Diego
with your friend and her boyfriend.

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,432
And you're gonna keep it
in your trousers. Nothing can happen.

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,192
-Got it?
-Yeah. I have no heart.

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,669
-I hate Valentine's Day.
-That's why you're my son.

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,478
What about you?
Anything for Lindsay?

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,114
We're taking a break.
She's getting to know her dad.

48
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,595
So for Valentine's Day
you're getting her Grandpa?

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,395
-Yeah. And that's bad, right?
-Dad, step in here.

50
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,956
Help a brother out. This guy's
got mad Valentine's skills, bitch.

51
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,392
Word, son. I hope I've learned something
after 20 years with your dear mother.

52
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,431
-Right. It's her favorite holiday.
-Yeah.

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,388
Which means she's probably gearing up
for the cupid routine right now.

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,709
Here's my valentine.

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,113
Looks like I'm not the only one
at odds with the universe.

56
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,389
I think I know what this is about.
And I can explain.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,195
You lied to me, Sandy.

58
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,510
-I didn't lie.
-You told me Rebecca was dead.

59
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,316
-When I told you that, I thought she was.
-I went to your office. She was there.

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,196
-You saw her.
-And then I came home...

61
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,272
...you and I had dinner, and nothing.
You didn't say a word.

62
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,232
She's accused of a very serious crime.

63
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,432
Anything I would tell you about her
could make you an accessory.

64
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,712
Don't try to get off on a technicality.
This is about our marriage.

65
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,758
-You and I come first.
-I did what I thought I had to do.

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,598
-She's innocent. And she's my client.
-She's not just your client.

67
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,672
You were in love with her.
Don't pretend this isn't complicated.

68
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,394
You're damn right it's complicated.

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,392
Look.

70
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,789
There's nothing going on
between us.

71
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,794
Oh, please, let's not fight.
Tomorrow's Valentine's Day.

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,391
Happy day before Valentine's Day.

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,632
Okay. You said
that we should take a break.

74
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,033
In relationship speak,
they call this "mixed signals. "

75
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,437
I know. But it didn't occur to me
that Valentine's Day was coming up.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,595
You didn't wanna be alone
on Valentine's Day.

77
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,791
-You're such a girl.
-So, what do you think?

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,514
Can we take some time off
from taking time off?

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,798
-Sure. If you do something for me.
-Yeah. Name it. Anything.

80
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,314
Apologize to Caleb.

81
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,512
-Except that.
-I'm not saying it's your fault.

82
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,029
I'm gonna spend time
there while he's recuperating.

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,795
If you two are at each other's throats,
it will be uncomfortable for everyone.

84
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,791
So if I apologize, I get to take you out
for Valentine's Day?

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,560
Me and Cal. Happy to do it.

86
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,316
Zach?

87
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,192
Hey, Cohen. You're early.

88
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,195
Yeah. I just wanted to stop by
and check in before Zach got here...

89
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,477
-...and sort of touch base.
-Something you wanna talk about?

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,200
Something you wanna talk about?
What?

91
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,954
-You came here.
-Yeah, I know. I know.

92
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,516
I just wanted to make sure...

93
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,029
...that you're dressing warmly.
And you are. Great.

94
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,430
You know, there is
something I wanna ask you.

95
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,716
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

96
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,272
Are these too bling for our meeting?

97
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,552
-I don't wanna come off trashy.
-No. I think they're fine.

98
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,715
Listen, Summer. I know
that the three of us sometimes...

99
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,235
...working together
can get pretty weird.

100
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,916
And so I just have to say that if it ever
maybe gets to be too much for you--

101
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,432
Hey, broken record, I'm fine.
I just want us to kick ass on our pitch.

102
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,359
I really care about this comic book.

103
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,715
What? Is that so hard to believe?

104
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,877
-You guys ready to hit the road?
-Hey. Did you MapQuest the meeting?

105
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,038
-Yep. I got directions. Got snacks.
-I was gonna pack snacks.

106
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,639
-The motor's running.
-Shotgun.

107
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,438
-All right.
-Come on. Move it, Cohen.

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,556
San Diego's not driving to us.

109
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,517
For God's sake, the door's 1 0 feet away.
Must I be humiliated in this chair?

110
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,996
Oh, Dad, just humor us. You can
lose the chair when you get home.

111
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,436
That reminds me.
I brought you a little care package.

112
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,556
That's very thoughtful of you.
Mad Libs.

113
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,716
Those were my favorite
when I was a kid.

114
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,550
Well. I hope you'll be around
long enough to teach me how to play.

115
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,796
Julie's still gallivanting around
in Europe.

116
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,520
Which means I've got
that big old house all to myself.

117
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,274
Well, what about Marissa?

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,034
Marissa can't be bothered.

119
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,112
She's busy running around
with that tattooed new friend of hers.

120
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,311
Well, if you're looking for company...

121
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,789
...I know that Ryan wanted
to stop by for a visit.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,197
-I think I've seen enough of him.
-Lindsay, why don't you go find...

123
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,920
-...the chauffeur and see if he'll pull up.
-Sure.

124
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,670
You and Lindsay
seem to be making strides.

125
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,757
I regret coming into her life so late.

126
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,110
You know how
you can make it up to her?

127
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,995
-Make things right with Ryan.
-What is it with my girls and that kid?

128
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,912
-Dad
-Fine. Fine.

129
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,951
Lindsay. Can three people
play Mad Libs?

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,473
Sure. Why?

131
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,758
Well, I thought it might be quite nice
to invite Ryan over for a round.

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,754
I understand he's handy
with an adverb.

133
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,679
Yeah. I'll call him right now.

134
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,072
Are the Olsens making records now?

135
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,669
-I don't know. You don't like it?
-No.

136
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,758
If she doesn't like your music
she'll drive you off the road.

137
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,399
Cohen, that was so your fault.

138
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,869
He drove us into a ditch
on our way to Tijuana.

139
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,077
-You did the TJ thing?
-We pit-stopped on the way to TJ also.

140
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,238
God, we had to spend this night
in this sleazy-ass hellhole.

141
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,597
-Seriously, it was like hepatitis central.
-Okay, it wasn't that bad.

142
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,469
Hello, Cohen. The bed was, like, covered
with all these tiny little curly hairs.

143
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,076
Oh, really? Well, I seem to remember
you begging me for a spot on that bed.

144
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,872
So who won?

145
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,957
Who got the bed?

146
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,911
-I think we worked it out. I don't know.
-I don't really remember.

147
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,358
Thank you.

148
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,839
I'm home.

149
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,076
Anyone here?

150
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,953
Hello?

151
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,072
I'm home.

152
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,154
-How's the ticker?
-Ticking. Thankfully.

153
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,639
I wasn't expecting you today.

154
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,753
I cancelled my trip to Nice so I could
come home and keep you company.

155
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,153
But I see you're already doing fine
in that department.

156
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,715
-Hi, Julie.
-Lindsay. Hello.

157
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,512
Lindsay's making us some lunch.

158
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,318
-Tuna sandwiches.
-Want one?

159
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,953
I'll pass. Thanks.

160
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,954
But it's nice to see you two have
grown so close since I've been gone.

161
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,277
Well, Juju, Lindsay and l
are in the midst of some Mad Libs.

162
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,115
-I'm sure you wanna go freshen up.
-Fine. I can take a hint.

163
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,353
Well, make yourself at home.
Caleb's casa es su casa.

164
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,199
Okay. Plural noun.

165
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,079
Marissa?

166
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,597
-Honey, it's 1 :00 in the afternoon.
-Oh, get out, Mom. I'm sleeping.

167
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,476
You and your stepfather
are quite the Welcome Wagon.

168
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,595
-Do you want something?
-Just to say hello to my daughter.

169
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,199
And to give you this.

170
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,908
It's a Chanel clutch. Every girl I saw
in Paris was carrying one of these.

171
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,594
Thanks. You can leave it
on the dresser.

172
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,197
Marissa.

173
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,157
You know...

174
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,632
...when I was in Europe
I did some real soul-searching.

175
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,157
-I hope you didn't hurt yourself.
-I'm trying to talk to you.

176
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,477
-I know that you've been angry with me.
-What gives you that idea?

177
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,474
And you have your reasons. I think it's
time to put those memories behind us.

178
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,877
It's time we became friends again.
Let's go to dinner. The two of us.

179
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,238
Thanks, Mom. But I'm not that lame.

180
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,438
-What if I took away your BlackBerry?
-Okay.

181
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,039
And your cell phone.

182
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,471
-You can't take away my cell phone.
-Oh, I think I just did.

183
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,797
You gonna throw the
bedroom furniture in the pool now?

184
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,396
That's great. You want to become
friends, so you're blackmailing me.

185
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,831
That's a great plan, Mom.
I'll see you at dinner.

186
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
-Not bad.
-Well, it beats living in my office.

187
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,595
Your office was fine. It was the
running into Kirsten part that was rough.

188
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,034
She must be furious.

189
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,192
Some poor roses took the brunt of it
this morning.

190
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,551
I know I've complicated
your life lately.

191
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,030
And to thank you,
I got you a little Valentine's gift.

192
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,033
When I saw it, I couldn't resist.

193
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,594
Gandhi. Every time I see this...

194
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,150
...I think of you snoring
right next to me in that theater.

195
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,477
-I couldn't help it. It's a long movie.
-lt was our first date.

196
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,150
-lt was a lousy first-date movie.
-You're right.

197
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,914
Okay. I know that look.

198
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,675
-You wanna talk.
-Oh, here's the thing.

199
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,034
I don't think I'm the best lawyer for you.
I'm not well-schooled in amnesty cases--

200
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,510
-And it might strain your marriage.
-That too.

201
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,156
-Okay.
-I know you wanna put this behind you.

202
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,108
-I want it over too.
-But you and l, spending day after day...

203
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,512
...poring over my case, our meetings
stretching into the wee hours....

204
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,956
There are days I think
Kirsten and me are bulletproof.

205
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,913
I don't wanna test that theory.

206
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,874
I should have seen this coming. One
thing I know about you, Sandy Cohen.

207
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,238
-You always do the right thing.
-I'll get you a list of the best lawyers.

208
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,478
You're gonna get through this.

209
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,518
I wish I was getting
through this with you.

210
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,953
Well.

211
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,115
Be careful what you wish for.

212
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,272
Hey there.

213
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,672
-How's your father doing?
-He's okay.

214
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,271
-And you?
-About the same.

215
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,031
The credit card company
called to verify...

216
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,794
...that you're staying at
the lnn at Playa del Rey.

217
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,953
It's for Rebecca. So she doesn't
have to stay at my office.

218
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,194
I know you're being put
in the middle of this.

219
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,352
But if you wanna take her case,
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

220
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,750
-I'm not gonna be her lawyer.
-Not because of me.

221
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,310
It is because of you. I know not to
mess with you on Valentine's Day.

222
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,115
-Sandy--
-You didn't force me to do anything.

223
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,719
Maybe this is selfish of me.

224
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,075
-But I have to say, I'm happy.
-Good.

225
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,470
There's one thing you could do for me.

226
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,871
Find a restaurant that still has
a reservation open for tomorrow night.

227
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,911
I don't want takeout
on Valentine's Day.

228
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,111
What are you in the mood for?

229
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,628
Something with a view of the ocean,
and an overpriced prix fixe menu.

230
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,552
-Sounds like The Arches.
-Perfect.

231
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,557
I'll call them right now.

232
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,350
Hey, this is the last of these.
So should we make more copies?

233
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,795
You don't have to hang around
all day to help me.

234
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,554
Please. Any excuse
to avoid my house.

235
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,230
My mom's been home for, like, three
hours, and already I'm going insane.

236
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,158
My mom used to
drive me crazy too.

237
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,959
One day I decided I wasn't
gonna let it bother me anymore.

238
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,271
-You make it sound so easy.
-Every time my mom channels Satan...

239
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,228
...I take a deep breath, count to three,
give her a smile and say something like:

240
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,709
"lnteresting idea, Mom.
I'll give it some thought. "

241
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,549
-And that really works?
-Women like that thrive on confrontation.

242
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,593
But if you refuse to engage,
there's nothing they can do...

243
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,759
-...which makes them go more crazy.
-That's a fun way to spend an evening.

244
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,151
But anyone who can make my mom
even crazier gets a free dinner.

245
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,555
-So, what do you say?
-Okay.

246
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,198
But not tomorrow night.
I don't do Valentine's Day first dates.

247
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,432
-I think it's a jinx.
-Okay.

248
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,519
But next week. When we don't have
Hallmark breathing down our necks...

249
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,593
-...we'll go on a date. Cool?
-Cool.

250
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,828
Okay. So let's go over this again.

251
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,393
I'll do the introduction.

252
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,994
-Seth, you do the character arcs--
-Zach.

253
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,994
You just need to relax a little bit, man.
I promise, you have this.

254
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,512
You know, my teeth are all plaquey.
I'm gonna go do a last-minute floss.

255
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,112
God. She is so OCD, man. Backpacking
with her is gonna be a nightmare.

256
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,711
-You guys are going backpacking?
-Yeah.

257
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,595
My sister's getting married in Tuscany.
Summer's gonna be my date.

258
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,355
-Tuscany? Like ltaly?
-Yeah. My family's renting a villa.

259
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,154
We're staying for the wedding,
then we're off on our own.

260
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,993
Backpack through Cinque Terre,
maybe a weekend in Venice.

261
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,118
Wow, that doesn't sound
romantic at all.

262
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,069
Hey. Are you guys here
to pitch to Mr. Bernstein?

263
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,111
-Yes.
-He can't see you until tomorrow.

264
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,271
-He got delayed coming from Japan.
-What?

265
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,189
They'll get you rooms in town, and I'll
reschedule you for first thing tomorrow.

266
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,477
-Wildstorm.
-Another night to work on the pitch.

267
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,596
Yeah. So just Cinque Terre and Venice?
Or maybe Florence too, or something?

268
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,672
-You are dreading this, aren't you?
-Pretty much.

269
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,231
-I'm sorry. Can you blame me?
-Look, it's like the dentist.

270
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,198
Think of how much better
you'll feel when it's over.

271
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,869
Go on. I'll wait here.

272
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,199
-Hey, Mr. Nichol. I came by to say hello.
-Call me Caleb.

273
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,155
-So you play pool.
-No, my first time.

274
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,192
Okay, I came by to apologize.

275
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,913
I'm sorry if I had anything to do
with your heart attack.

276
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,473
Thank you, Ryan.

277
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,677
I realize it wasn't easy for you
to string so many words together.

278
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,079
-Excuse me?
-I'm noting how rarely I hear you talk.

279
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,674
-I don't have much to say to you.
-How about thank you?

280
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,348
For the fine education,
the roof over your head.

281
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,636
-Everything else I've done.
-Like insulting me?

282
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,234
-Treating me like a criminal?
-You are a criminal.

283
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,675
My do-gooder son-in-law
dragged you out of jail...

284
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,195
...and installed you
in his pool house. Remember?

285
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,557
You know, Mr. Nichol,
I don't know why I try to talk to you.

286
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,599
It's just a waste of time.

287
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,633
-So? How did it go?
-There's always next Valentine's Day.

288
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,834
One bed, huh?

289
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,079
Looks like Zach and l
are getting cozy tonight.

290
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,590
-We got adjoining rooms. You're in here.
-We do?

291
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,991
-Really?
-Yeah.

292
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,271
Oh, well, okay. Just one second, though.
If I'm in here, now that means that....

293
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,078
Then what?
You guys would be in here?

294
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,512
Yeah. Is that okay?

295
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,156
Well, sure. Yeah.
I mean, well, it makes sense.

296
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,796
Yeah, that's fine. That's great.
It's actually perfect. So then....

297
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,959
Well, I take it you two will be in here--
In there, actually. Together.

298
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,272
And I will be just on the other side
of this soundproof wall.

299
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,034
-Hey. You okay?
-Yeah. No, I'm fine.

300
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,079
I'm just having an allergic reaction
to the universe.

301
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,232
So. Okay.

302
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,718
Here you go. I got you coffee.

303
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,270
Oh, thanks, Sandy,
but I've given up on that stuff.

304
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,431
-I never thought I'd see the day.
-Oh, yeah.

305
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,716
You used to average
a pot an hour, as I recall.

306
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,352
Yeah. That's probably why I never slept.
That and you keeping me up all hours...

307
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,115
-...with your right-wing conspiracies.
-Who else was gonna listen to me?

308
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,313
See, I assumed that you were
prepping me for father-in-law duty...

309
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,635
...and then everything changed.

310
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,075
-I feel like I'm jumping ship here, Max.
-No, no. You're not.

311
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,229
I mean, your conscience, Sanford,
well, it's always worked in overdrive.

312
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,516
Leaving you and Rebecca
just when we found her.

313
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,237
The rest will work itself out.

314
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,754
-lf you're off coffee, what do you drink?
-Green tea.

315
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,032
Supposedly it's a detoxifier.

316
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,676
And, who knows,
maybe if I started it earlier...

317
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,671
...I would've held up better.

318
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,551
I'll get you some. There's a café
down the pier. I'll be back in a sec.

319
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,711
Okay, thanks, Sandy.

320
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,797
You know, we should turn in early.

321
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,758
We've got the pitch
at the crack of dawn.

322
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,356
Why don't we watch another movie?
I think Van Helsing is on pay-per-view.

323
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,312
I like monsters. Don't know about you.

324
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,198
-I'm pretty tired.
-Me too.

325
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,238
Why don't we go to the gift shop
and get some cards...

326
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,790
...because then we could play gin
or I could do some sleight of hand.

327
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,678
Cohen. Go to bed.

328
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,308
Yes, okay. But listen, I'm gonna be in
here if you guys need me. For anything.

329
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,192
Okay.

330
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,672
Okay.

331
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,153
Maybe we should invent a secret knock
just in case, for whatever.

332
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,952
Good night, Cohen.

333
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,512
That's the knock we'll use.

334
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,952
Hey, Max. They didn't have any
green tea, but I got you some jasmine.

335
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,712
You drink jasmine?

336
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,393
Hey, Max?

337
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,590
No way there's three shots
of espresso in that.

338
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,233
You look kind of spent, Seth.

339
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,592
-Did you sleep at all?
-Yep. Got a solid 1 5 minutes.

340
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,478
They say that's all you need.

341
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,390
What about you?
Didn't sleep too well, huh?

342
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,388
-I slept fine, actually.
-Hi, guys. Larry Bernstein. Come on in.

343
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,869
Okay. All right. He's ready.
Showtime. Come on.

344
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,433
Well, guys. I read the treatment.
And I think it's interesting.

345
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,108
Good. Great to hear it.
And on behalf of all of us--

346
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,835
The three of us, sitting three across
in your office. Thank you.

347
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,316
-And we like your jacket.
-You're welcome. And thank you.

348
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,069
But putting pretty people by the beach
isn't enough for me. Even with powers.

349
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,800
-Talk about characters.
-Great. What can I tell you?

350
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,871
We got Kid Chino,
with his fists of fury.

351
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,669
He's from the wrong side of the tracks.
Think Karate Kid, take away the karate.

352
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,950
Let that marinate.
Then we've got Cosmo Girl.

353
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,395
She's got a passion for fashion
and a magic flask.

354
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,230
What I wanna do right now is take you
to the hot center of our comic, okay?

355
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,113
The core relationship
of what I think we're doing here.

356
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,914
What I'm talking about here
is passion. But real passion.

357
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,719
Not the kind of passion you buy
for $1.99 at the store.

358
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,911
-What does that even mean?
-I have no idea.

359
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,190
-So you're saying there's a love story?
-Y eah.

360
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,630
-No.
-Oh, no, no. No, definitely not.

361
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,717
Maybe you can't see it.
Maybe you can't.

362
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,673
But let me tell you something.
I promise you. It's there.

363
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,599
Among the demon water-polo players
from the toxic Pacific...

364
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,355
...that attack Atomic County.
It's a love story for our time.

365
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,355
For all time.

366
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,233
-Between who?
-Yeah, Cohen. Between who?

367
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,835
Why between the lronist
and Little Ms. Vixen.

368
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,792
What?

369
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,672
The lronist and Little Ms. Vixen?

370
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,270
The lronist. Whose quick quips
and pop-culture-laden bromides...

371
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,637
...can fell even the most
insidious of villains.

372
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,798
And Little Ms. Vixen.
So cute and sweet in her black leather.

373
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,037
Her Amex card can decapitate a demon
up to 1 00 yards away.

374
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,715
Especially when she senses her true love,
the lronist, is in danger.

375
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,674
-Well, this is an interesting approach.
-Yes, but not one we've discussed.

376
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,589
-No, there is no love story.
-Y eah, not yet there isn't, okay? Stop.

377
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,472
Here's the thing. The thing is this.

378
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,151
If the lronist and Little Ms. Vixen
could put their differences aside...

379
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,150
...for just one issue and stop
their bickering and stop their bantering...

380
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,788
...even though the readers
might find it adorable...

381
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,590
...I feel like they would realize how much
more evil they could vanquish together.

382
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,268
No, Cohen. They can't.

383
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,118
Look, we're really sorry, sir.

384
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,158
This is not the comic that
we wanted to pitch to you.

385
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,115
Y es. Well, it has some promise.
But you three are clearly not ready...

386
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,918
-...to forge a partnership.
-Clearly.

387
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,678
So get back to me.

388
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,995
After high school.

389
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,233
The coroner said
he guessed it was a stroke.

390
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,830
He didn't suffer.

391
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,878
-I can be grateful for that.
-I'm so sorry.

392
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,508
-Yeah, I know.
-And Rebecca?

393
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,915
Well, she's doing her best.

394
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,392
And I'm sorry I didn't call till late.

395
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,070
-And stayed out till this morning.
-I understand.

396
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,431
-I still wanna go out tonight.
-Sandy, it's just Valentine's Day.

397
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,798
-We can celebrate another time.
-I think we need this, you know?

398
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,554
I'm not used to things being so...

399
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,991
...Iike they are right now, you know?

400
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,911
I don't like it.

401
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,718
Me neither.

402
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,112
I'll tell you what.

403
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,671
I'm gonna go take a power nap.
And when I wake up...

404
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,719
...I wanna see you dolled up
in your Valentine's finest.

405
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,348
Hey. Well, I thought we agreed we
weren't doing the Valentine's thing.

406
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,229
I know. Just give me one more chance
with him. It'll only take a few hours.

407
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,275
Oh, great. You're back.

408
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,278
Can I talk to you for a second?
In your study.

409
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,595
Look, I'd say we need to talk,
but clearly that doesn't work for us.

410
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,990
Well, what do you wanna do,
take a swing at me?

411
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,390
I'm the only person in town
you haven't punched.

412
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,034
I'll make you a bet. We play pool.

413
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,236
If you win, I stay out of your way. I win,
you accept me as Lindsay's boyfriend.

414
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,952
What is this, The Color of Money?

415
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,350
-It's absurd.
-You got a better idea?

416
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,194
-Fine. Best of seven.
-Rack them.

417
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,797
Thank you.

418
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,153
Well, what would you like to talk about?
Clothes? School?

419
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,555
Cut to the chase.
Tell me what this is about.

420
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,712
It's not about anything.
I'm happy to be here with you.

421
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,434
With your father gone
and Kaitlin in boarding school...

422
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,349
...we're what's left of the family.
It makes sense to lean on each other.

423
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,154
You act like you're all alone.
I mean, you have Caleb.

424
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,795
You know, I think you're old enough
that I can be honest with you about this.

425
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,597
I worry about Caleb and me.
That we might not make it.

426
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,719
Come on, Mom. If you two
can't make it, no one can.

427
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,793
The point is, whatever happens
between Caleb and me, I'll survive.

428
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,760
What I could never handle
is losing you.

429
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,555
Well, thanks. I almost believe you.

430
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,117
Oh, honey. You and me,
we need to play our cards right.

431
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,676
-What do you mean, our cards?
-Spending our time with Caleb wisely.

432
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,030
I've launched the magazine.
It's a good start.

433
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,959
But I'd like to control more
of the company just in case.

434
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,315
If we can play happy family
a few more months...

435
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,109
-...I can figure out my next move.
-Oh, my God, Mom. You're unbelievable.

436
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,272
What? Do you want
your inheritance going to Lindsay?

437
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,277
Because that
is where this is headed...

438
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,950
...unless you put in some serious
face time with your stepfather.

439
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,153
That's an interesting idea, Mom.
I'll think about it.

440
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,835
Now, why don't you tell me
about your trip?

441
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,914
Okay, Cohen. You wanna explain
that meltdown before?

442
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,512
Look...

443
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,638
...if there's something you wanna
say to me, now's your chance.

444
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,592
You know, I just think I'm gonna
lay off the caffeine forever.

445
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,598
-Fine. Don't say I didn't ask.
-You ready to hit the road?

446
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,509
Yeah, you know, actually,
I think I'm just gonna take the bus.

447
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,398
-The bus?
-Fine with me.

448
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,552
You know, actually, if we're not gonna
take Cohen home, we could stay here.

449
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,671
We have the room,
and it's Valentine's Day.

450
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,910
Yeah, and since you guys
are going to ltaly...

451
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,878
...you should start
getting used to the hotel life.

452
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,116
Okay. Headed to the bus depot.

453
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,834
Happy Valentine's Day.

454
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,795
-Hello?
-Oh, I expected to get your voicemail.

455
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,838
-I thought you'd be with your wife.
-We got a late reservation.

456
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,675
-We're just on our way out.
-Oh, I won't keep you. I....

457
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,311
I just....

458
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,349
I didn't wanna disappear
without saying goodbye.

459
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,954
-What are you talking about?
-I'm leaving.

460
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,157
Don't try to talk me out of it.
Let's be realistic.

461
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,636
-My chances of getting off are slim.
-Well, isn't it worth trying?

462
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,879
Not if I don't have my father.

463
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,829
-So when are you leaving?
-Tonight.

464
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,633
I guess there's no chance of you
swinging over here...

465
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,997
-...to say goodbye in person.
-Oh, I don't think so.

466
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,309
-Let me get back to you.
-Okay.

467
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,355
-Rebecca?
-Yeah. She's....

468
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,991
She's leaving tonight.

469
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,628
Going back to God knows where.

470
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,712
-She wants to say goodbye.
-Yeah.

471
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,118
Well, if you wanna go,
I'm not gonna try and stop you.

472
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,073
I'll be right back.

473
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,155
I think we've actually
salvaged Valentine's Day.

474
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,869
Even though Cohen
did his best to destroy it.

475
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,828
I don't think he's ever gonna
get over you. I've kind of accepted it.

476
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,070
Look, Zach, those are his issues,
not mine.

477
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,432
Good. Because all I really care about
is that you and I are okay.

478
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,720
Look at us. We're in a hotel room
by ourselves on Valentine's Day.

479
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,997
-I think we're okay.
-Good.

480
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,151
I mean, we weren't
even supposed to be here.

481
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,198
It's just like fate handed us
this dream date.

482
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,197
So...

483
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,238
...why don't we just make
the most of it?

484
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,638
Summer, before we do anything,
I need to tell you something.

485
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,958
Who is it?

486
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,759
It doesn't matter.

487
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,350
Hey, it's Summer. Obviously. You
should know that, since you called me.

488
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,112
I guess I can 't get to the phone...

489
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,670
... or I am screening because you
creep me out. Leave a message.

490
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,271
Your shot.

491
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,997
-You don' t seem worried.
-Should I be?

492
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,475
-You' re about to lose.
-I don't think so.

493
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,518
You' re a hothead, Ryan.
Pool takes a steady hand.

494
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,591
Well, I've got a steady hand.

495
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,878
Then why are you always in trouble?
Setting fires, impregnating teenage girls.

496
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,878
I know what you're trying to do.
It's not gonna work.

497
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,831
Come on, Ryan.
It's all very chivalrous.

498
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,275
Challenging me to a duel
for Lindsay's affections.

499
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,149
But you know, ultimately,
she's gonna side with me.

500
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,039
-I'm her father.
-Who abandoned her for 1 6 years.

501
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,351
That's all in the past.

502
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,839
I don't think Lindsay sees it that way.

503
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,311
Corner.

504
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,957
Well, this may be the way
you settle things where you come from.

505
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,157
A game of pool, maybe a bar stool
over someone's head.

506
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,390
But in real life,
it takes more than that.

507
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,035
Hey. Sorry. We're done.

508
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,191
God, I was starting
to worry about you guys.

509
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,796
-Well, enjoy your date. It's on me.
-Thanks.

510
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,077
So, what do you wanna do?
Maybe go to Balboa lsland?

511
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,312
-Milk shakes and bumper cars?
-Why don't you stay here tonight?

512
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,268
-Are you sure? It's Valentine's Day.
-Yeah, well, tomorrow night.

513
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,477
-Okay.
-Have fun. Rent a movie or something.

514
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,478
I hear The Color of Money
is pretty good.

515
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,231
Good evening, The Arches.
Can I help you?

516
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,358
Hi, it's Kirsten Cohen.
I'd like to cancel a reservation.

517
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,272
And what time was your reservation?

518
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,358
So you bailed on your wife
on Valentine's Day.

519
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,437
That doesn't seem like
a Sandy Cohen move.

520
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,319
It isn't.

521
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,436
I wanted to say goodbye to you.

522
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,592
But now I gotta go.
I think we've already missed dinner.

523
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,832
So stay here.

524
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,355
I've been without you for 20 years.

525
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,317
And still...

526
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,437
...I'm gonna miss you.

527
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,354
All over again.

528
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,551
Sandy...

529
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,792
...I wish it had never happened.
I wish I could take it all back.

530
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,952
That night, I wish I'd never run.

531
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,598
Me too.

532
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,551
I gotta go.

533
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,671
But you should stay.

534
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,557
Hey.

535
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,074
Sorry I called you away
from your hot date.

536
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,158
I'm just sorry to hear
your Valentine's Day went so terrible.

537
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,432
Terrible? No, no. Try catastrophic.

538
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,513
I blew the comic book...

539
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,157
...and I just completely humiliated
myself in front of Summer.

540
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,511
After the way I acted, I don't
think I'd get back together with me.

541
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,199
Probably for the best.

542
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,477
-I mean, with Zach and all.
-You know, the truth is he deserves her.

543
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,680
And, clearly, he's got
the universe on his side, so....

544
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,953
Hey. I didn't know
you were coming by.

545
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,669
Neither did l.
I guess I'm just sort of here.

546
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,631
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think I'm okay.

547
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,229
I just had a terrible dinner
with my mom.

548
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,516
-Did my technique work?
-Guess so.

549
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,598
But also it was knowing
I could come here and see you.

550
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,040
Not that I wanna put
any pressure on you or anything.

551
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,678
It's just, that's how I feel.

552
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,115
And I had to say it.

553
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,235
-Are you in the mood for the beach?
-Now?

554
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,676
-Yeah. It's almost time.
-Time for what?

555
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,149
For the tide to change.
It's a ritual I have...

556
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,517
...for whenever something really major
is about to change in my life.

557
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,432
I thought you said
no dating on Valentine's Day.

558
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,556
Screw it.

559
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,553
Come on. I'm a huge fan
of spontaneous first dates.

560
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,319
I am too.

561
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,273
No, look, I'm not saying it's not bad.

562
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,319
Hanging out with my grandpa
ranks very low on the Valentine's scale.

563
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,675
I just, you know,
I think mine's worse. I win.

564
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,677
You're right. Yours is worse.

565
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:30,756
Look at all these people.
These normal, non-traumatized people.

566
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,310
In relationships. In love.

567
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,356
You think we'll ever have that?

568
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,997
-No.
-Yeah, I'm with you.

569
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,159
The tide just turned.
