1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,156
- <i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>
- I was with Johnny.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,392
He went through something.
Something like I went through.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,198
Even if Marissa was accused...

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,636
...she wouldn't go to jail.
- She also wouldn't be going to college.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,597
- Look, can we talk?
- Before you say anything...

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,034
- I like you.
- Boy.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,794
<i>Seth, I mean, it's obvious</i>
<i>that we are soul mates.</i>

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,552
What were you doing talking to her?

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,510
You were gonna scam me
into throwing a fake charity...

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,557
...and leave me to pick up
the pieces so you could skip town.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,676
- You don't have any friends here.
- Wrong.

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,400
I have Kirsten.
And I won't do this to her.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,352
Okay, picture me in college.

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,353
Big fish in a small pond
or small fish in a big pond?

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,875
I don't know. I never really
pictured you in a pond.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,032
Me neither. Finding the right college
ought to be more soulful.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,277
- You gotta fill it out. They're due today.
- What's due today?

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,908
- Hey. What's up?
- Hey.

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,674
- "Picking the Perfect College."
- I totally spaced that.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,274
- Does anyone have an extra?
- There you go. Remember...

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,398
...meeting the college counselor today.
- That can be so stressful.

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,199
I can't even pick out my shoes,
let alone plan my life.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,999
It's okay, it's only four years.
And according to this...

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,958
...it's the high point
of an otherwise miserable existence.

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,439
These kids look pretty happy.

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,070
Look, Coop, two girls looking in a
microscope and smiling. That could be us.

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,913
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- Coop, are you okay?

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,117
She's okay. She gets to leave Newport.
We all do. Think about this.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,831
Soon we're gonna be living in real cities
with real, non-Botox, non-plastic people.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,399
- Cohen, shut up.
- And weather.

31
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,915
How about a little weather
for a change, you know?

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,594
I'm not talking about
"it's cloudy with drizzle" weather.

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,079
I'm talking about snowstorm...

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,151
...seal-your-windows-with-duct-tape
weather.

35
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,719
- That's what I want.
- You know...

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,393
...it's getting late.
I'm gonna go.

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,391
- Are you all right?
- I'd get to wear wool.

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,358
- I'd get to wear a real wool sweater.
- Shut up.

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,272
- Sorry.
- Coop, what's wrong?

40
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,274
Nothing. I mean, this whole college thing,
it's great for you guys.

41
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,351
I'm just not gonna get to be
a part of it.

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,318
- What are you talking about?
- Look, I've done the research.

43
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,393
With my background, my history,
I don't have a chance of getting in.

44
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,876
I'm just not going to college,
that's all.

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,759
And there's a different approach.

46
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,952
- So, what's on the agenda today?
- Oh, it's packed.

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,236
- You don't wanna know.
- Sure I do.

48
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,433
Okay, conference call with the zoning
board, lunch with a couple of investors.

49
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,070
I've gotta oversee Ramsey's presentation
for tomorrow. You want me to go on?

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,959
I do. Believe it or not,
it sounds exciting.

51
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,953
What, more so than perfecting
the art of soufflé?

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,033
Speaking of, that one you made
last night, it was topnotch.

53
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,033
- Sandy, I'm going crazy.
- What?

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,236
It's the sifting, the kneading,
the measuring.

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,709
I can't take it.
I need to get out of the kitchen.

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,997
- Honey...
- It's not the cooking I hate. It's the quiet.

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,832
Well, we have to get used to
a quiet house.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,072
I know. The boys started filling out
college forms today.

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,596
Well, look on the upside.
Seth will be right up the road at Berkeley.

60
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,355
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.
Remember before Ryan came...

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,159
...Seth was dead set on going
to school on the East Coast.

62
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,073
- He wants out of California.
- That was years ago. He was a kid.

63
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,915
Sandy, Seth has never said
that he wants to go to Berkeley.

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,559
But he never said he didn't.

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,190
- Try not to go too stir-crazy.
- I'll try.

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,154
Marissa.

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,558
Brace yourself. You, my friend,
are in the presence of a celebrity.

68
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,234
- I am?
- Harper here is moments away...

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,790
...from being a surfing legend.
- I have to make it through this weekend.

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,033
Assuming that you shred it, you're gonna
be picked for PacWest's 2006 team.

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,668
Oh, well, that's great. Congratulations.

72
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,073
Cooper! A little enthusiasm, buddy,
this is a banner day for Dennis Childress.

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,753
It's a banner day for you?

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,992
Yeah. You might get to be the star,
but I get to be the entourage...

75
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,948
...which is a way better deal anyways.
We're talking free swag, VIP parties...

76
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,111
...crashing your world tour.
- I had no idea.

77
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,636
- Someone's gotta carry your surfboard.
- Well, I'll be there to watch you...

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,109
...in your moment of glory.
- You all right?

79
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,236
- You seem a little...
- I'm fine.

80
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,960
Promise. Look, I'll see you guys later.

81
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,193
- Something's wrong with her.
- Poor kid's probably starstruck.

82
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,318
Get used to it.

83
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,953
So we'll deal with grades
and boards later.

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,918
But for now I just wanna get a feel
for what you want.

85
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,878
- Where you imagine yourself.
- Somewhere cold.

86
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,874
- Or brisk. I would settle for brisk.
- I want 365 sun days.

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,712
And don't mean the day after Saturday.

88
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,358
Not someplace too big,
but not a lot of sports.

89
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,910
- Not a lot of big guys playing sports.
- I definitely wanna join a sorority.

90
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,593
Oh, but I don't wanna learn Greek.

91
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,911
- Where are you thinking?
- I don't know. I've only lived in California.

92
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,911
Hawaii. Arizona.

93
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,992
Boston, Connecticut, Vermont,
Maine, Rhode Island or New Hampshire.

94
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,516
- Do they have a college in Cabo?
- I'm not sure.

95
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,638
I guess this sounds like
I haven't given it a lot of thought.

96
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,519
But the truth of the matter is, I have.

97
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,153
I'll be the first in my family to graduate
from high school, let alone go to college.

98
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,517
So I mean, this whole...

99
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,873
It's a lot.

100
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,397
It's just so odd that Charlotte just up
and left without so much as a phone call.

101
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,711
Well, you know, her father called,
he said it was an emergency.

102
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,270
- That's all she needed to hear.
- She hasn't spoken to her father in years.

103
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,557
You know how it is with family.
One day...

104
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,756
...you're estranged,
next you're bugs in a rug.

105
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,559
But enough about Charlotte.
How are you?

106
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,791
It's just, I'm...

107
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,396
I'm losing my mind at home.
I feel like...

108
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,837
Julie, are you even listening to this?

109
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,712
Yes. Of course.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,594
Is there something you need to tell me?

111
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,152
Excuse me.

112
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,553
Ms. Cooper, this is the last time I'm going
to warn you. I need that rent check.

113
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,280
Ten thousand, or this could get
very ugly.

114
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,518
Is everything okay?

115
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,830
I don't need any, thanks.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,276
Hello, I don't need any steak knives.
You want some coffeecake?

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,473
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

118
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,837
You gonna visit me
in Providence next year?

119
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,952
- You're going to Rhode Island?
- Brown University.

120
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,476
The counselor said I had a very good shot
at getting in because I'm awesome.

121
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,200
- This your first choice?
- My only choice. It's liberal.

122
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,591
It's turtleneck weather. Most importantly,
it's 3000 miles away from here.

123
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,150
It's safe to say you're not applying
to Berkeley. Have you told your dad?

124
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,834
Sandy Cohen's a perceptive guy.
He'll figure it out.

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,797
Seth, you gotta tell him.

126
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,594
"Dad, I'm not applying to Berkeley.

127
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,590
Where'd you get a gun?
Why do you have this gun?"

128
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,990
That doesn't have a good ring to it.

129
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
It doesn't have a good ring. Fine.

130
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,155
I'll stop by after school
and break it to him.

131
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,232
- At least you're going to college.
- Unlike a lady friend of yours?

132
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,198
Yeah. I don't get it. I mean, it's...
She's always...

133
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,352
...wanted to go to college, you know?
- Well, you could talk to her.

134
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,795
- Use your powers of persuasion.
- I don't have any.

135
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,872
Ever since I got back to Harbor,
I don't have a leg to stand on.

136
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,951
Well, you need to find somebody
who does.

137
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,271
- You need to get yourself an ally.
- Why are you doing that?

138
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,591
I don't give a crap about this school.
I'm out of here.

139
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,633
Summer. Feel my forehead.

140
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,870
- What? Why?
- I have college fever.

141
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,439
- Don't you?
- Maybe.

142
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,751
What are the symptoms,
you become incredibly annoying?

143
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,153
Summer, cheer up.
You're just gonna love Arizona.

144
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,037
How do you know
that I'm applying there?

145
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,031
I work in the college counseling office.

146
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,350
- I do a lot of filing.
- Oh, and snooping.

147
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,594
Well, I did notice that you and Seth are
headed to opposite ends of the country.

148
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,115
- Well, we have different tastes.
- Yeah, apparently.

149
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,192
He wants to go to Brown,
and you wanna go someplace sunny...

150
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,954
...where kids drink till they vomit.
- Do you have a point?

151
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,838
I'm just sad for you, is all.

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,515
You know, I mean, the long-distance
thing can be such a grind.

153
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,036
What am I talking about? I'm sure you
and Seth have a whole plan worked out.

154
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,152
- A plan?
- Yeah.

155
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,228
Seth wouldn't just skedaddle
off to the East Coast...

156
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,551
...without so much as a thought
to your relationship, would he?

157
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,234
No one is skedaddling
anywhere yet, okay?

158
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,630
If you two haven't even
talked about this yet...

159
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,995
...my guess is there's
stormy weather ahead.

160
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,789
Intimacy, it's a tricky business.

161
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,873
Dad.

162
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,031
I didn't know
you'd be dropping by today.

163
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,998
Yeah, well, you know,
I had kind of a big day at school.

164
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,794
I know. You had a meeting
with your college counselor.

165
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,473
I'm dying to hear about it.

166
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,708
You know, she said
that I actually have a lot of options.

167
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,475
Well, of course you do.
And whatever you decide, I'll respect.

168
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,709
- Good.
- I'm just happy...

169
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,189
...you're considering Berkeley.

170
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,113
- You are. Well, aren't you?
- Yeah, considering?

171
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,508
- Sure.
- Great.

172
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,557
- Yeah.
- As long as it's still on the table...

173
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,199
...I'm happy.

174
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,036
Yes, Berkeley. Okay. Well, I'm glad
we got this all cleared up.

175
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,270
I'm gonna see you back at the house.

176
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,795
Oh, okay. All right. You got it.

177
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,110
- Dad, good talk.
- You... Yep.

178
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,833
Hey, Cheryl. Yeah, will you get Paul Glass
at Berkeley on the line for me?

179
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,993
Hey. Thanks for coming to get me.

180
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,152
Not a problem. Hey, whoa,
you wanna hang out for a minute?

181
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,393
- What, you just wanna enjoy the scenery?
- I wanted to talk to you about college.

182
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,154
- I told you, I'm not going.
- I know, you made up your mind.

183
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,197
You could talk to somebody.

184
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,718
Sorry, I sort of overheard what you were
talking about. What are you doing here?

185
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,917
I was trying to convince Marissa
to see your guidance counselor.

186
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,470
- Oh, Mitchell Davidson. He's a great guy.
- That's what I hear.

187
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,869
That's what you hear?

188
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,031
From who?

189
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,040
Oh, my God, you guys planned this,
didn't you?

190
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,397
Look, we just... We didn't want you
to do something you might regret.

191
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,553
So you conspired to get me here? To
lecture me on what to do with my life?

192
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,188
- It's not like that.
- I thought I could talk to you.

193
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,079
- I thought you were on my side.
- I'm on your side. Trust me.

194
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,038
Just leave me alone.

195
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,311
Oh, man, it'll be great to see you.

196
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,234
Yeah, that's right, tomorrow night.
I'll see you then. All right, Paul. Bye.

197
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,073
- Who's that?
- Our old friend Paul Glass.

198
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,516
Paul Glass,
as in Paul Glass from Berkeley?

199
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,035
Well, not from anymore. At.
He's working there now.

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,993
What? He called me. Besides, Seth came
by the office yesterday to talk colleges.

201
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,232
- He seems interested in Cal.
- As long as you don't pressure him.

202
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,356
No. No pressure.

203
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,751
A nudge. A father's allowed to nudge.

204
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,717
Nudging's allowed.
But any more than that...

205
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,598
...and I'll confiscate your
Cal sweatshirt.

206
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,796
- You wouldn't dare.
- Try me.

207
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,349
I gotta go. I'm gonna try
to make a Cardio Barre class.

208
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,512
Cardio Barre is crawling with Newpsies.
How bored are you?

209
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,477
I thought I'd go because Julie loves it.

210
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,633
And I thought it might cheer her up.
Lately she seems not herself.

211
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,675
- Is that a bad thing?
- I'm serious, Sandy.

212
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,559
- She's keeping something from me.
- When it comes to Julie...

213
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,995
...sometimes it's better not knowing.
- Yeah.

214
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,832
Yes. Yeah. Whatever. Let's go.

215
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,751
- You look very sporty.
- Thank you.

216
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,353
So how did it go with Marissa?

217
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,670
She accused me and Johnny
of ganging up on her.

218
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,673
- Oh, so it went well.
- I don't know. I guess it's to be expected.

219
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,796
We'll be splitting up.
It makes people tense.

220
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,757
Okay, but why focus on the negative?

221
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,798
This is a cause for celebration.
We get to finally leave Newport.

222
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,190
Not everybody sees that
as something to celebrate.

223
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,793
You wanna stay in Orange County?

224
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,155
Grow old playing golf,
chatting about the NASDAQ?

225
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,392
No, I'm just saying, you know,
maybe Newport isn't all evil.

226
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,596
Name one thing about Newport
that isn't evil.

227
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,719
- I will name you two.
- Cohen, hi. You, me, upstairs now.

228
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,712
Tell my parents I love them.

229
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,314
- How are you?
- Better, thanks.

230
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,191
- Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.
- I didn't mean to pressure you.

231
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,158
You know, I realized after,
you're probably just trying to help.

232
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,470
I made an appointment
with the college counselor.

233
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,554
- All right, you did?
- I mean, I can't promise anything...

234
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,789
...but I'm gonna try.

235
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,832
These are our college lists.
Do you see a difference?

236
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,752
Yeah, the font. Looks like you went
with the Times New Roman.

237
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,309
The schools, doofus.
None of them are the same.

238
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,198
None of them are
in the same time zone.

239
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,557
Okay, so you want West Coast,
I want East Coast. It's not a hip-hop war.

240
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,632
We are gonna be separated
by like a zillion-billion miles.

241
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,392
I was up all last night thinking
about that.

242
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,869
You were?

243
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,672
You haven't even given this
a second thought, have you?

244
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,438
- Summer, wait a second.
- No. Too late, Cohen.

245
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,032
Julie, you're leaving us already?

246
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,035
Well, you know, I was only
staying here temporarily.

247
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,589
I'm renovating my place
in Balboa Estates.

248
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,112
- Couldn't stand the racket.
- You live in the Balboa Estates...

249
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,317
...and you drive your own U-Haul?
- I'm just keeping it real.

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,594
Well, gotta go. See you around.

251
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,955
Three-F.

252
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,877
Mrs. Rushfield? Hi.

253
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,958
I wanted to read up on a school. Brown.

254
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,077
I know, it's a major reach.
But it doesn't hurt to look, right?

255
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,879
Of course. Let me just
get the file for you.

256
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,109
Thanks.

257
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,471
That's been checked out.

258
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,194
Here you go.

259
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,035
This is just what we were looking for.
Thank you, Taylor.

260
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,395
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

261
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,516
- You're applying to Brown?
- Maybe.

262
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,398
I'm sure they'd just love to have you.

263
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,676
I hear the Ivies often recruit
from Fred Segal.

264
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,354
- I can get into Brown if I want to.
- Of course you can.

265
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,717
And on the off chance that you don't,
you can always come and visit.

266
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,348
Seth and I will show you around.

267
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,870
You have the grades. Lots of activities.
My guess is you'll be fine.

268
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,800
Except I'm not sure I wanna go.

269
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,590
I'm sorry, Marissa. I'm a little confused.

270
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,637
What are we doing here?

271
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,757
Does this have anything to do with
what happened to you over the summer?

272
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,990
I read about it in your file.

273
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,313
It's just, I'd have to explain it,
wouldn't I?

274
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,040
Well, on the applications, yes.

275
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,077
You will have to say
why you were expelled.

276
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,233
But if it means getting into college,
it seems like a small price to pay.

277
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,194
I've just spent all this time
trying to forget about it.

278
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,716
And, you know, if I had
to dredge it up again...

279
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,872
...I don't know if I could handle it.
- I get it.

280
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,634
That's a tough skeleton
to have in your closet.

281
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,033
But if you want my advice...

282
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,358
...write about it.

283
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,117
- See what comes out.
- That's exactly what I don't wanna do.

284
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,431
Marissa, you can't run away
from your past.

285
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,315
So before you let it ruin your future...

286
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,551
...you might try learning to live with it.

287
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,919
Oh, excuse me.
Could I get a little help over here?

288
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,390
- I ain't no bellman, lady.
- How charming.

289
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,391
- I take it you're my landlord?
- Yup.

290
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,439
I'm Gus. Welcome to the Taj Mahal.

291
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,156
- I can't believe I'm back here.
- You've lived here before?

292
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,833
I'm speaking figuratively.

293
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,834
Truth is, I moved out of
a place like this when I was 18.

294
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,389
I never thought I'd be back.

295
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:55,635
Yeah, well, when I was a kid, I wanted
to be wide receiver for the Chargers.

296
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,475
Sometimes life don't work out.

297
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,236
Everyone's here. Perfect.

298
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,550
A college buddy of mine, Paul Glass,
is in town.

299
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,711
I invited him over for dinner tonight.

300
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,359
And what brings Paul to town?

301
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,233
- Oh, something to do with work.
- Something for Berkeley?

302
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,914
- Your friend works at Berkeley?
- It's not what you think.

303
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,911
- You mean, an ambush?
- A resource.

304
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,913
- You guys might enjoy talking to him.
- Sounds like an ambush.

305
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,750
It's dinner. They have to eat.

306
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,996
- Hey, what are you guys doing here?
- PacWest Surf Contest.

307
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,392
- Today's the day, remember?
- Oh, you know, that's okay.

308
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,716
- I don't wanna be a downer.
- Why, what's up?

309
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,992
I tried to write this essay for school...

310
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,076
If I can't write the essay, you know,
I may as well forget about college.

311
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,158
So forget it. Come on tour with us.

312
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,153
- What?
- It's not a bad idea.

313
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,675
Travel the world,
give yourself some time to think.

314
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,159
- Are you serious?
- Look...

315
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,390
...maybe you just need
to take the pressure off.

316
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,074
You know, give yourself some time.

317
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,468
Why not do it in Fiji?

318
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,437
Just come to the contest today,
see what you think.

319
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,312
All right. Give me five minutes.

320
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,189
- Hey.
- Hey.

321
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,316
Was that Johnny and Dogboy
downstairs?

322
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,711
Yeah, Johnny's got this
big surf contest today.

323
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,279
I'm gonna go support him.

324
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,594
What about your essay?
You know, you can use my computer.

325
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,637
Just be gentle with it.

326
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,429
Yeah, that might be put off
for a while.

327
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,270
What are you talking about?

328
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,753
Hello.

329
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,755
- Hey, Julie. Glad you were free.
- Well, I can't stay long.

330
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,273
Did I tell you I'm moving?

331
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,670
It's such a hassle, but the
new place, it's beautiful.

332
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,831
Well, then I'll get right to it.

333
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,351
How'd you like to go
into business together?

334
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,437
- What?
- Well, think about it.

335
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,352
The magazine, the fundraiser.

336
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,672
- We make a good team.
- Kirsten, I don't need your charity.

337
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,989
Then why are you living in a trailer?

338
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,388
I'm sorry. I followed you yesterday.

339
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,712
Well, then I certainly hope
you're opening a detective agency.

340
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,393
It's not charity.

341
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,358
I'm going crazy doing nothing.
I need this.

342
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,473
Well...

343
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,794
...if you need it, I guess.

344
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,316
Just one thing. If we're partners, I need
to know what happened to Charlotte.

345
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,472
She can't be with her dad.
She hates her dad.

346
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,314
Oh, God, she didn't relapse, did she?

347
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,353
No, she couldn't,
because she's not an alcoholic.

348
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,511
What are you talking about?

349
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,911
Oh, Kirsten, I never wanted
to tell you this.

350
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,788
Charlotte went to rehab to find...

351
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,311
...a rich, vulnerable woman
she could exploit.

352
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,830
She's a con artist. I'm so sorry.

353
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,513
- But the fundraiser...
- A scam.

354
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,875
She was planning on taking
that money with her...

355
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,474
...but I stopped her at the last minute.

356
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,477
Oh, my God.

357
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,597
- You were in on it?
- Kirsten...

358
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,273
Kirsten, let me explain.

359
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,798
- What is it, Cohen?
- We need to talk.

360
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,277
I brought visual aids.

361
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,959
Boarding-school stuff?

362
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,556
My entire life, I have wanted to get
as far away from Newport as possible...

363
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,756
...and the only reason
I didn't is because...

364
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,956
...Ryan came and you
started talking to me...

365
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,795
...and I'm very glad I stayed,
but now I have to go.

366
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,953
Fine. I get it.

367
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,680
What's your plan for us?
E-mails? Phone calls?

368
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,991
- See each other once every two months?
- Or...

369
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,594
Or you could come with me.

370
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
No. You've always wanted to go east.

371
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,948
- I've always wanted to stay west.
- But don't you think...?

372
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,680
But what? My dreams are
not as important as yours?

373
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,594
Summer, I'm trying to make this work.
I feel like you're just writing us off.

374
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,910
You don't see Ryan
and Marissa giving up.

375
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,229
Not yet anyway.

376
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,836
What does that mean?

377
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,350
<i>Get ready for our surfers</i>
<i>to hit the water.</i>

378
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,752
<i>We're about to start the competition.</i>
<i>And the first surfer in the water...</i>

379
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,956
You don't have to go
trying to be a bitch here.

380
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,032
I'm telling you, there is no shame
in playing it safe. Tell him.

381
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,953
- Tell him what?
- Our lives. Costa Rica, Fiji, Hawaii.

382
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,317
- It all rides on today.
- Way to take the pressure off, man.

383
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,154
- Hey, you're gonna be great out there.
- Thanks.

384
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,039
I gotta get to the staging area.
See you guys later.

385
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,832
Bye.

386
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,194
So is this what next year's
gonna be like?

387
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,591
Just hanging out on the beach,
watching Johnny surf?

388
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,796
That and scoring hot foreign babes.

389
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,439
Great.

390
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,670
By the way,
I talked to some people that I know.

391
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,877
They think they can get you a job
as a label rep for the tour.

392
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,955
Yeah. So if you're serious about it,
let me know. I'll make it happen.

393
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,593
- Hi, man.
- Hi.

394
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,558
What's up? Everything all right?

395
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,436
You would think that
we could deal with next year...

396
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,309
...I don't know, next year. But no.
It's gotta screw up this year too.

397
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,199
Yeah. Marissa and I have
some of that too.

398
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,271
By the way, have you spoken
to her today?

399
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,591
No, I was on my way to see
if she wanted to grab lunch. Why?

400
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,314
Have a seat. I don't wanna
tell you this standing up.

401
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,357
- Thanks for coming, Taylor.
- Well, it was no problem at all, Summer.

402
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,953
I wanna talk about next year.

403
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,429
First, let me just say that where
I apply to college...

404
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,113
...is frankly none of your business.

405
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,238
And if some of those schools
happen to cross with Seth's, well...

406
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,470
Taylor. Shut up, okay?

407
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,112
You can have him. Go to Brown
or wherever you smart people go.

408
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,675
He's yours.

409
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,832
- This is a ploy, isn't it?
- No, it's life.

410
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,434
He's going to Rhode Island
and I'm going to Arizona.

411
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,795
I thought you would do
the long-distance thing.

412
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,111
And struggle along, break up at
Thanksgiving and hook up at Christmas.

413
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,840
Then break up in January
when we're both back at school?

414
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,072
- You could apply to a school near him.
- Imagine me on the East Coast.

415
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,391
I'd be like those animals ripped
from their habitat and put in the zoo.

416
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,109
My fur would get all mangy.
I'd throw dung at people. It'd be awful.

417
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,838
You know, I'm almost offended...

418
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,639
...that you think I would believe
that sort of idiotic lie.

419
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,714
You want the truth, Taylor?

420
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,909
What if he goes to college
and meets a bunch of really smart...

421
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,278
...and interesting girls and realizes that
that's who he's supposed to be with?

422
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,674
And that you're
just his high school girlfriend.

423
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,351
Cute, you're fun to be with...

424
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,835
...but doesn't want his kids
to have your DNA?

425
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,273
Yeah.

426
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,551
Maybe we should just end it,
you know.

427
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,432
- Summer.
- You be nice to him, okay?

428
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,879
- That was so awesome.
- Yeah, you were amazing.

429
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,952
- Well, I caught some good waves.
- And modest.

430
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,634
I'm gonna go see
when they're announcing the teams.

431
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,276
I'm gonna call my mom,
let her know how I did.

432
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,795
She's working up in San Jose
this weekend.

433
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,831
- Hey.
- Hey. Heard you were here.

434
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,040
- Yeah, Johnny was competing.
- What's going on?

435
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,715
Last night you say you wanna go
to college and now you're doing this?

436
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,555
Ryan, I tried to write the essay.

437
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,756
- I couldn't.
- Okay, I'll help you.

438
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,399
No, I really don't think you can.

439
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,668
Hey, Ryan. Thanks for coming, man.

440
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,428
- What's up?
- Did you tell Marissa to blow off college?

441
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,716
- Of course not.
- Then explain why you're here.

442
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,515
Dude, no offense, but maybe
you just don't understand...

443
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,908
...what she's going through.

444
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,992
- Is that what you think?
- No. Okay, I think it's complicated.

445
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,273
What's up, everybody?

446
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,998
Yeah!

447
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,074
We're about to announce
this year's PacWest Surf Team.

448
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,630
But before we do that, let's give it up
for those surfers out there, huh?

449
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,194
Johnny! Johnny!

450
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,750
- Look, can we talk about this later?
- You know what, you two talk. I'm done.

451
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,954
Johnny!

452
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,711
- No, wait.
- Johnny!

453
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,279
- I'll get him.
- Johnny!

454
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,755
Ryan.

455
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,189
Johnny!

456
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,435
Our first member of this year's team
is Johnny Harper.

457
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,511
Johnny Harper, where are you?

458
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,674
Somebody call an ambulance!

459
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,111
- Were you all with Johnny Harper?
- Yeah.

460
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,788
- He's gonna be okay, right?
- Does he have a parent here?

461
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,554
His mom's flying in from San Jose.
How is he?

462
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,188
Lucky. The only real damage
is to his knee.

463
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,874
There's been a clean tear of the ACL,
some bone damage.

464
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,156
- He'll require surgery.
- When can he surf again?

465
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,790
I'm less worried about him surfing
than when he's gonna walk again.

466
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,234
He'll be awake in an hour
if you wanna see him.

467
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,116
I can't deal with this.

468
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,029
It's my fault. He was coming after me
when he got hit.

469
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,634
Ryan, let's not do this now, okay?

470
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,588
You should probably go.

471
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,834
Sandy will be wondering
where you are.

472
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,879
I think I should go find Chili.

473
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,678
I'll call you.

474
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,151
Kirsten, look who I found.

475
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,993
I heard this is where
Newport's newest culinary talent lives.

476
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,913
- Paul, it's good to see you.
- And you remember Seth.

477
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,594
Sure, last time I saw you,
you were in a Berkeley onesie.

478
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,070
- Thank you for that.
- Why don't you run upstairs, put it on.

479
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,550
- And... Oh, here's Ryan. Paul Glass.
- Nice to meet you.

480
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,756
Seth, grab the bread
and we can go outside.

481
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,354
Sure. After you.

482
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,708
- Paul...
- How's your friend?

483
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,518
He's gonna be okay. At least I hope.

484
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,477
What do you say
we get something to eat.

485
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,629
Yeah.

486
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,551
What is it with people
showing up with bags?

487
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,836
I brought you something.

488
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,274
Providence College?

489
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,032
It has good Catholic values...

490
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,158
...admission standards a little
more in your wheelhouse...

491
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,835
...and, best of all,
it's 20 minutes from Brown.

492
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,150
- Taylor...
- Look, Summer...

493
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,630
...who knows what will happen in the
future? But right now, Seth loves you.

494
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,268
And you're not even giving him
a chance.

495
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,119
Why are you doing this?

496
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,392
I figured Brown was
a little <i>Vanity Fair</i> for my taste.

497
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,918
- And now I'm considering the Sorbonne.
- No, I mean, why are you being so nice?

498
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,435
Well, pathetic as it sounds, you and Seth
are pretty much my best friends.

499
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,592
And, let's face it, I never really had
a shot with him.

500
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,113
- Taylor, we are your friends.
- Really?

501
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,514
Because I just got Kieslowski's
<i>Decalogue</i> on DVD.

502
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,830
And I don't know if you're
into Polish cinema...

503
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,356
...but maybe you could come over. We
could have a sleepover marathon and...

504
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,353
No. Sorry. Okay.

505
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,672
Keep in touch, Summer.

506
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,398
So anyway, it was Halloween...

507
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,757
...and I set Sandy up with a roommate
of this girl that I was dating.

508
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,198
I didn't have a costume, so when I went
to pick her up, I put a bag over my head.

509
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,669
I felt like I was dating
the Elephant Man.

510
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,434
You know, supposedly something
like 50 percent of people...

511
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,034
...meet their future mates in college.

512
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,713
You two have girlfriends?

513
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,874
Yes.

514
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,758
- I'm gonna get that.
- Sure.

515
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,150
- I don't know anymore.
- Yeah.

516
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,670
All right, so, what do you call
a black guy who flies a plane?

517
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,754
A pilot, you freaking racist.

518
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,757
<i>It's the Cohens. We can 't come</i>
<i>to the phone, so leave us a message.</i>

519
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,388
- <i>Thanks.</i>
- <i>Kirsten, it's me.</i>

520
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,949
<i>Look, I know you probably</i>
<i>never wanna see me again.</i>

521
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,829
<i>I just wanted to say I'm sorry, again.</i>

522
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,839
<i>After everything you've done, you...</i>

523
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,389
<i>You deserve a better friend than me.</i>

524
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,833
You know?

525
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,391
I'm sorry. I have to run.

526
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,393
- It was good to see you, Paul.
- It was great to see you too.

527
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,073
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, it's fine.

528
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,390
I'll be back in a half an hour.

529
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,033
- Oh, Summer.
- Hi.

530
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,237
- I was hoping that I could talk to Seth.
- Excuse me.

531
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,677
And then there were three.

532
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,516
Thank you. If I had to listen
to one more Berkeley anecdote...

533
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,358
Come here.

534
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,596
- How did this go?
- Okay.

535
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,910
- It's not that cold, but...
- Well, I wanna see...

536
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,640
...what we are going to look like
next year.

537
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,872
- What are you talking about?
- I'm coming with you.

538
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,393
Providence College.

539
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,472
- It's only 20 minutes from Brown.
- Are you serious?

540
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,438
Yeah. I wanna give us a shot,
you know.

541
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,034
And I can't do that from
across the country, so...

542
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,272
I don't believe this.
What made you change your mind?

543
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,998
Taylor.

544
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,470
She made me see that at Brown you're
gonna be surrounded by smart people.

545
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,359
It's gonna make you feel really stupid.
So you need someone...

546
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,397
...to make you feel smart again.

547
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,230
I mean, you want me to come
with you, right?

548
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,118
Do I want you to come with me?

549
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,955
Summer, you're my little snow angel.

550
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,954
My little rabbit.

551
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,518
- Hey.
- Hey.

552
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,274
How do you feel?

553
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,072
Like I just got hit by a car
and shot full of drugs.

554
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,152
- Look, this is all my fault.
- Yeah, I guess.

555
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,429
But kind of Ryan's, too,
for reacting the way he did.

556
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,395
And Chili for coming up with
the whole surf contest in the first place.

557
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,794
And the chick who hit me
didn't help things.

558
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,552
You know what?

559
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,271
No matter how you slice it,
my knee's still screwed up.

560
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,875
Well, what are you gonna do?

561
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,874
I'm gonna get the operation...

562
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,793
...do the rehab
and get back on my board.

563
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,516
Things happen, Marissa.

564
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,595
What else you gonna do? Give up?

565
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,833
Gus.

566
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,351
I told your wife, I don't swing.
Oh, Kirsten.

567
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,353
What...? What are you...?

568
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,398
Hey, Julie. I was wondering
if we could get together tomorrow...

569
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,073
...and discuss business ideas.

570
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,349
Wait, you... You still wanna
go into business with me?

571
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,080
I asked myself why you
didn't go through with the scam.

572
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,710
You could be living
in Charlotte's beautiful condo.

573
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,468
But you're here.

574
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,190
- Yeah, I guess I could.
- I know you did it for me.

575
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,073
Let me do this for you.

576
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,598
- Hey, Julie.
- I got a gun, Gus.

577
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,273
That's cool.

578
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,876
Yeah. Let's do it.

579
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,635
Don't. Don't. Don't go there.
Don't do that again.

580
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,076
You did that one time.
Don't do that again.

581
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,635
- No more stories from me.
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

582
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,510
- Because I think we're about to lose Ryan.
- No, no, no. It's all great. I just...

583
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,111
I don't know if I'm ready
for the whole college thing.

584
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,319
How's that?

585
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,552
I look around, I mean,
I got a home, family.

586
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,993
Part of me feels like
I finally got it together.

587
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,398
I'm not sure I'm ready to leave that.

588
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,438
You know, going away to college
is not goodbye.

589
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,318
I know.

590
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,753
What happens on vacations,
do I stay in the pool house?

591
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,396
No matter where you go,
this will always be your home.

592
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,514
Hey, Dad, can I talk to you
inside for a second?

593
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,033
Yeah.

594
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,270
- Excuse me a minute.
- Yeah.

595
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,311
So tell me, in this leaving equation...

596
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,069
...is there a serious-girlfriend component?

597
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,869
Oh, boy.

598
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,435
Hey, sorry for ducking out earlier.

599
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,672
Yeah, you missed my story about
playing Nanki-Poo in <i>The Mikado.</i>

600
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,834
Oh, yeah, that's too... Too bad.

601
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,479
Listen...

602
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,313
...I don't want you
to get upset, okay?

603
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,232
But...

604
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,713
...I'm not going to Berkeley.
I wanna go to Brown.

605
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,077
I'm not upset. Brown's a great school.
I wish you would've told me.

606
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,993
Dad, I've been trying to for years.
You didn't wanna hear it.

607
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,790
It's that I want you to have
the same amazing experience that I had.

608
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,191
That is exactly why I need to go east.
It's exactly what you did.

609
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,710
You left everything behind,
and you forged your own path.

610
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,632
I need to do that.

611
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,078
You're already doing it.

612
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,552
Come here.

613
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,914
- Hey, Seth's applying to Brown.
- I think it's great.

614
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,674
Listen, Summer's upstairs
ordering things from L.L. Bean...

615
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,149
...so I have to...
- Hurry. Hurry.

616
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,791
So...

617
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,840
...it seems that we're gonna be
empty nesters.

618
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,433
True.

619
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,315
What do you think about getting
an apartment in Providence?

620
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,916
Providence.

621
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,071
She's a pretty important part
of your life.

622
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,555
Yeah.

623
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,269
You know, ever since I got here,
she's always accepted me for who I am.

624
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,838
I don't know if I can leave that.

625
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,513
Ryan.

626
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,391
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

627
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,357
- How's Johnny?
- He's okay.

628
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,551
He's amazing, actually.

629
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,075
You know, he says
he's gonna surf again.

630
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,636
I feel responsible.

631
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,792
Ryan, it's not your fault...

632
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,349
...or mine. It just happened.

633
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,756
We can't keep blaming ourselves
for everything.

634
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,797
And how do we do that?

635
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,396
Well, for starters,
I'm applying to college.

636
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,829
All right.

637
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,230
You know, as awful
as the shooting was...

638
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,994
...if I don't let it go,
it's just gonna ruin my life.

639
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,472
Both our lives.

640
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,712
- The essay?
- I'll say what happened.

641
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,429
You know, that I saved the life
of someone I love.

642
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,319
A college will either accept that or not.

643
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,072
I can't keep hiding from it.

644
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,271
It made me who I am.

645
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,752
There is no going back.

646
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,279
With everything we've been through
the past two years...

647
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,556
...and the fact that we're still here...

648
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,553
...it really makes me think
there's nothing we can't handle.

649
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,795
Sorry to interrupt.
I wanted to say good night.

650
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,997
I felt kind of weird sitting alone, and
I couldn't help overhearing.

651
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,594
I'm hoping that you both
will apply to Berkeley.

652
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,519
I think it'd be a good fit.

653
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,753
If you have any questions,
just give me a call.

654
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,389
- You guys dressed?
- Yeah.

655
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,278
Anybody hungry?

656
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,273
This one's gotta pack on some pounds
for the cold weather.

657
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,758
- Says Mr. Toothpick.
- Hey, Providence College?

658
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,710
- Wow, we're thinking about Berkeley.
- So we'll be in Northern California...

659
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,359
...you'll be in Rhode Island.

660
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,990
You and Seth will have to do the
long-distance thing. You better not cheat.

661
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,798
Well, it's college. Things happen.

662
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,269
- Are you questioning your sexuality?
- No.

663
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,591
