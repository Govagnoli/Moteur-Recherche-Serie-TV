1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,412
Précédement dans The O.C...

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,649
Fermer le Newport group est une bonne chose, n'est-ce-pas?

3
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:04,883
Tu mets le passé derrière toi

4
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:05,765
De combien parlons-nous?

5
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:07,037
Si tu as besoin d'aide pour le paiement initial

6
00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:08,665
Je ne suis pas ruineé, Kirsten.

7
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:09,488
Je suis refléchie

8
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:10,576
Tu m'as acheté un appartement.

9
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:12,168
Julie, je ne te demande rien

10
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:12,950
C'est entierement à toi.

11
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:14,185
Je n'ai pas d'amis.

12
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:19,199
Je ne fais confiance à personne et j'essaye de controler les gens
ce qui les fait fuir.

13
00:00:19,262 --> 00:00:20,756
Et donc, pas d'amis

14
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:22,703
Hey, qu'est ce qui va pas? Qu'est-ce que tu lui as fait?

15
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:24,341
Rien, je vais bien

16
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:26,952
Tu vois ta copine discuter avec un gars que tu ne connais pas.

17
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:28,112
Ca peut arriver à tout le monde.

18
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:29,980
Ma vie ne fonctionne pas sans toi

19
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:32,942
Ca se passe toujours si bien quand on est ensemble.

20
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:37,190
Ma vie ne fonctionne pas sans toi.

21
00:00:44,265 --> 00:00:45,752
C'est mon frère.

22
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:51,792
Tu es entrain de le tuer.

23
00:01:37,426 --> 00:01:39,723
- Oui.
- Hey, c'est moi.

24
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:41,163
Ca va?

25
00:01:41,278 --> 00:01:44,933
Non, en fait... si, mais j'ai fait un rêve

26
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:48,511
et Trey était là à nouveau, et toi aussi
et tout recommençait.

27
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:51,522
Ecoute, je suis désolée de t'avoir réveiller, ok?
J'ai peur.

28
00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:54,783
Je sais, je sais, mais tu n'as pas de raison de l'être.

29
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:56,993
Trey n'est plus là

30
00:01:57,678 --> 00:01:59,482
Tout va bien.

31
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:02,520
Retourne dormir, je te verrai demain, ok?

32
00:02:04,345 --> 00:02:05,672
Ok.

33
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:13,882
Hey.

34
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:16,620
Oh...

35
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:18,940
Des cauchemards, hein?

36
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:22,243
AU début j'ai cru que tu etais une des ces personnes qui transpire la nuit.

37
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:24,431
Je voulais rien dire, mais...

38
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,690
Je pensais que si je dormais avec toi, ils disparaitraient.

39
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:30,462
Tu en as parlé à Ryan?

40
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:34,092
J'ai essayé. Tu sais comment il est.

41
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:36,192
Ouai. Lui et les mots..

42
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:38,571
Et il a traversé ça avec moi,
il devrait comprendre

43
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:39,661
Je sais

44
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:41,930
Et bien, moi, je suis là.

45
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:45,622
Quoi?

46
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:49,302
J'aimerai juste que Ryan sache que c'est tout ce qu'il a à dire

47
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,363
Ouai.

48
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,221
Alors? Tu as ton nouvel emploi du temps?

49
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:57,823
Ici

50
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:58,891
Tu as toutes tes fournitures?

51
00:03:58,977 --> 00:03:59,803
Dans le sac.

52
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,941
Il a déjà été à l'école.
Il sait comment faire.

53
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:03,590
On est simplement content que tu retournes à Harbor.

54
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:07,152
Fais en sorte que tout aille bien.
Dr. Kim a été très claire.

55
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:10,502
Je sais, je sais. Je ne dois pas m'attirer d'ennui, et je le ferai pas

56
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,643
Ne t'inquiète pas.

57
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:15,140
Juste toi et moi

58
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:16,390
Une autre tasse de café?

59
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:17,751
Don't mind if I do.

60
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:21,801
Toi et moi et la maison rien que pour nous?

61
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:23,893
Je pourrai m'y habituer.

62
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:27,521
Ah, si je retournai jamais au bureau...

63
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:29,220
Et bien, avec de la chance, tu n'auras pas besoin.

64
00:04:29,328 --> 00:04:30,772
J'ai trouvé un acheteur pour le Newport Group.

65
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:32,403
Douce mélodie à mes oreilles

66
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:36,971
Si le rendez-vous ce passe bien demain, je signerai les papiers.

67
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:38,521
Et ensuite, sayonara Newport Goup.

68
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:40,162
- Ca te va?
- Quoi?

69
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:42,702
Quitter la société que ton père a batie.

70
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:44,990
Tu y as passé 15 ans.

71
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,643
Et ç a m'a pris tout ce temps pour me rendre compte que je la detestai.

72
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:50,340
Oh, Sandy, je suis prête à la laisser partir.

73
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:06,221
Ryan et Marissa n'ont pas rompu depuis des semaines.
Ca doit être un nouveau record.

74
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:07,750
Oh, mais je sens une rupture qui s'annonce

75
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,582
J'ai un sixième sens les concernant

76
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:12,173
Ils rompent, se remettent ensemble, peut importe

77
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:14,232
C'est un cycle naturel. Ca a un rpport avec les marées.

78
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:17,452
Non, c'est différent maintenant. S'ils rompent, Marissa pourrait disparaitre.

79
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:20,920
Elle pourrait être engloutie par Newport Union.
C'est comme le triangle des Bermudes.

80
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:23,860
C'est une école, et c'est à des it's tiles away.

81
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:27,912
Ecoute, je m'en fous.
Ces deux la ont besoin de se to login some serious couple time

82
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:30,602
ou notre carré va se transformer en angle.

83
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:33,663
Ca fait quoi d'être de retour?

84
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:34,791
On va prendre un café

85
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:35,683
Ah,  excellent.

86
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:38,172
C'est chouette, j'ai beaucoup de boulot à faire

87
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:39,762
Je peux passer le week end à étudier.

88
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:42,453
Tu ne peux pas--On a des projets.

89
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:43,250
Ah bon?

90
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:45,771
Ouai, hum, Cohen a invité Marissa et moi pour diner ce soir,

91
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,683
et tu peux pas nous eviter dans ta propre maison.

92
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:49,820
Ah, je sais pas, je crois que je devrais back off for a little while.

93
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:52,370
maintenant que je suis de retour à lécole
ça doit pas être facile pour Marissa.

94
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:53,611
Le moins que je puisse faire c'estprendre un peu mes distances

95
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:56,551
Tes distances? Non, non, non. Qui a besoin de distance?
Marissa, elle aime être tout près.

96
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:58,581
Oui, diner ce soir, chez moi.

97
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:01,473
Je suis sûre que ma mère est à la maison en ce moment même
à nous cuisiner quelque chose de degoutant.

98
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:03,411
Je peux avoir 3 cafés s'il vous plait?

99
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:04,241
Merci.

100
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:05,452
Ok, c'est bon, un diner

101
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:07,531
Oh, mon dieu. 22 la v'la

102
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:08,661
Salut.

103
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:11,002
Vous avez entendu parler de l' "emprisonnement" demain soir?

104
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,812
Toutes les terminales va passer la nuit dans le gymnase.

105
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:16,202
Oh! On peux pas.

106
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:18,363
Ouai. Je vais me couper le bras avec une tronconneuse

107
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:22,740
Oh, c'est dommage. Tu vas devoir le rater

108
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:25,362
l'emprisonnement est obligatoire.
Ca compte comme un cours

109
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:27,973
Et je sais que toi, tu ne peux rien sécher

110
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:29,341
On sera là.

111
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:30,262
Super.

112
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:33,073
Ca va être terrible!. On va même griller des marshmallows

113
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,882
On va utiliser des bec bunsen pour simuler des feux de camps

114
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:38,120
C'est une petite idée que j'ai eue.

115
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:39,512
Oh, mon dieu 

116
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:40,922
C'est ingénieux

117
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:44,853
Rappelez-vous- la seule chose dont vous aurez besoin
c'est un sac de couchage

118
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,091
et l'esprit ouvert

119
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:49,751
Et notre samedi soir est foutu

120
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:53,831
Oh, hum, j'allais oublier. Je vais avoir besoin de bras
pour m'aider à tout isntaller demain

121
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,852
Alors,  Seth et Ryan... j'ai pensé que vousseriez d'accord pour le faire.

122
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:00,613
Je t'ai aider à revenir à l'ecole

123
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,913
Donc...

124
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,772
Je vous verrai demain à 14h

125
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:06,691
Et  le reste de notre week end est foutu

126
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:10,333
Marissa! prête pour ce week end?

127
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,510
Je ne sais pas, Que se passe t-il ce week end?

128
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:16,690
Des swells arrivent d'Antarctique,
ce qui veut dire qu'il va finalement y avoir de la hauteur

129
00:07:16,787 --> 00:07:18,583
Ok, je n'ai aucune idée de ce que ça veut dire

130
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:21,783
Oh, j'ai oublié. Née et elevée à Newport mais n'a jamais surfé.

131
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:22,461
C'est moi

132
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:26,311
Ca veut dire qu'après la plus calme des saisons,
on va finalement avoir des bonnes vagues.

133
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:31,243
On aime accuellir ces swells du sud avec un
rituel ancien connu comme "La patrouille de l'aube"

134
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:33,273
Ca veut dire que vous faites la fête toute la nuit avant de surfer?

135
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:35,311
Hey, elle n'est pas totalement hopeless.

136
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,653
Tu devrais venir avec nous.

137
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:40,121
Certains d'entre nous vont sortir ce soir
même si les grandes festivités commencent demain

138
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:42,583
On t'apprendra peut-être même quelques mouvements

139
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:44,752
Ou alors je resterai sur le sable à vous regardee?

140
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:47,392
Ugh. Viens, Chili, on a physique

141
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,421
La partouille de l'aube, ce soir

142
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,163
Grandé geniallisimeté

143
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,110
Whoo!

144
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:53,565
T'as aussi une heure de libre

145
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:56,259
Euh..oui

146
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,296
Ca va?

147
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,772
Tu as l'aire un peut fatiguée.

148
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,490
Ouaou, merci.

149
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:04,431
Désolé

150
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,460
Non, c'est pas grave.

151
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,412
Je dors pas vraiment beaucoup

152
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:09,641
Pas du tout

153
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:11,621
Trop de café?

154
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:13,523
Je ne pense pas que ce soit ça

155
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:16,432
Des cauchemards?

156
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:22,031
Peut-être. Quelque chose de ce style.

157
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:27,221
Viens. Allons dévalisé les distributeurs, c'est moi qui offre

158
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:28,731
Comment pourrai-je refuser?

159
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:35,260
Bonne nouvelle

160
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:36,991
Les demenageurs ont amené mes affaires

161
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:39,152
Notre apart est presque vivable.

162
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:40,930
Merveilleux. On devrait fêter ça

163
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,240
Oh, je devrais te faire une cremaillère

164
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:47,663
Merci mais tu m'as déjà assez fait de faveurs.
Ca devient un peu effrayant

165
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:50,411
Oh, allez. Je vais à Aspen dans quelques semaines

166
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:53,623
Marissa va emmenager et vous allez toute les deux m'oublier.

167
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:55,321
Laisse moi au moins te preparer une fête avant mon départ

168
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,680
Je ne sais pas. Je suis un peu à court d'amis ces derniers temps.

169
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:01,583
Ah, tout le monde t'a abandonné quand tu as perdu ton argent, hein ?

170
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:03,361
Tu devrais les voir en Cardio

171
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:06,712
Elles ne me regardent même pas dans les yeux.
J'étais la reine du cours

172
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:08,881
La même chose m'est arrivé la première fois où je suis sortie de désintox

173
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:11,583
Toutes les femmes de New York m'ont froidement ignorée.

174
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:12,851
Comment as tu fait?

175
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:15,223
J'ai pensé à partir...

176
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:17,642
mais à la place j'ai organisé une fete

177
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:21,332
Une soirée de bienfaisance. C'est la chose
la plus intelligente que j'ai jamais fait.

178
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:24,452
J'ai ammasé beaucoup d'argent pout une bonne cause
et j'ai récupéré ma vie.

179
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,202
Et bien je ne peux plus organisé de telles choses maintenant
Je n'ai ni l'argent ni le clout.

180
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:31,742
Je peux t'aider. On aura bien sûr besoin de Kirsten, mais...

181
00:09:32,158 --> 00:09:36,263
Ca te ferait vraiment du bien, Julie.
Tu devrais y relfechir.

182
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,881
Ca te dit un diner ce soir? Les Cohen nous invitent.

183
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:48,890
Euh oui mais je te rejoindrait la bas,
parceque j'ai dit à Johnny que je le verrai à la plage

184
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:51,311
Hmm. Encore Johnny.

185
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,642
Casey et Chili seront là aussi.

186
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:57,181
Ces swells arrivent et c'est comme Noël si t'es un surfer.

187
00:09:57,857 --> 00:09:59,792
Tu devrais venir demain pour voir.

188
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:04,503
J'aimerai mais je vais être emprisonnée dans le gymnase
et forcée à manger des marshmallow grillés.

189
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,422
Ouai, j'aimerai que ça soit une blague

190
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:08,831
On dirait un evenement preparé par Taylor Townsend

191
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:11,243
Des fois, la vie à Harbor ne me manque pas.

192
00:10:11,748 --> 00:10:13,430
Je te verrai chez les Cohen alors.

193
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:15,870
Ok. A plus euh

194
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:19,003
Je voudrais pas être toi euh

195
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:26,711
Hey, où sont les autres?

196
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:29,103
Casey est en route

197
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:31,083
Chili's still out there.

198
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:32,772
See the distance?

199
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:35,820
That kid... wiping out.

200
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,191
Whoa, ouch.

201
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:40,063
Anyway you've just got me on a break, wanna sit ?

202
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,183
Sure.

203
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:45,132
It's so beautiful out here.

204
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:47,262
Almost makes me wish I surfed.

205
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:50,763
Yeah, I'm telling you, it helped me.

206
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:53,921
You know, with my sleep.

207
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:57,733
With everything, really.

208
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:01,602
You want to talk about it?

209
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:09,722
Uh... I don't know about you, but I'm freezing.

210
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:12,010
I'm gonna run to the car and grab a sweatshirt; you want to come?

211
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:14,620
Sure. Um, let me just call Summer.

212
00:11:15,878 --> 00:11:17,383
Do you have to go?

213
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:20,770
No. No, it's okay.

214
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:31,501
What are you making?

215
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:32,822
Beef stew.

216
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:35,500
Can't we just order out like normal people?

217
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,280
We are normal people.

218
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:38,932
Normal people cook.

219
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:42,081
I wonder if my poor mouth will ever taste pizza again.

220
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:46,330
Probably not, because we are very abusive parents, cooking for you like this.

221
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:48,100
- Hey.
- Hey, Summer.

222
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:50,683
You're just in time. I hope you like stew.

223
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:52,482
Oh, it's my favorite.

224
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,443
Where's Marissa?

225
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:55,243
Oh, she can't make it, she's busy.

226
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:58,841
Oh, is she studying? 'Cause I've been known to get her to blow off some homework.

227
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:00,760
Uh, she's not studying.

228
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:04,173
She's at the beach with Johnny.

229
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:09,791
Ryan, try not to punch Summer.

230
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:10,970
I'm just the messenger.

231
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:14,590
Yeah, that's all right. Really, I mean, she's with her friend.
She has to hang out with him.

232
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:16,120
She probably just got help up

233
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:17,161
Yeah.

234
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:22,263
Well, I guess there'll be more beef stew for everyone.

235
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:26,780
You want one?

236
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:27,962
Yeah, sure.

237
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,193
Thanks.

238
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,430
Hmm, Central Varsity Baseball.

239
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,052
I didn't know you played.

240
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:39,503
I don't. Not anymore.

241
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:42,022
I quit everything when I moved here.

242
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,363
New town, new sports.

243
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:47,801
Just want to start over

244
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:51,140
What?

245
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:56,713
Uh, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

246
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:00,261
It's my dad.

247
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:03,902
We had a fight

248
00:13:04,888 --> 00:13:06,490
I haven't seen him since.

249
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:08,051
When was that?

250
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:12,172
I don't know, like, three years ago..more

251
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:15,191
Well, have you tried calling him or contacting him?

252
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:18,432
It's not that easy.

253
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:23,741
He was a... drunk.

254
00:13:24,858 --> 00:13:27,091
He used to always go after my mom.

255
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:28,892
You mean...?

256
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:33,662
One night, I just snapped

257
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:37,843
I came home from baseball practice...

258
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:40,641
and there he was.

259
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:45,490
Had her up against the wall, his hands around her neck...

260
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:48,940
I just...lost it

261
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:51,801
Lost it...

262
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,310
I took my baseball bat

263
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:58,222
I guess I just started beating him.

264
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:01,111
I-I don't remember any of it.

265
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:07,691
And when I came to, he was unconscious.

266
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:10,281
I was covered in his blood.

267
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:11,830
Oh god.

268
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:15,552
You know, when I think back on that night...

269
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:19,531
I don't even know who I was

270
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,973
How could I have done that 

271
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:28,892
I know what you mean.

272
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:37,663
Johnny, I'm sorry.

273
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,281
You want to hear something crazy?

274
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:46,190
You're  the first person I've told.

275
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:13,740
Coop... wake up.

276
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:18,062
Oh... oh, my God, let me sleep.

277
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,601
No, sorry, can't let you do that.

278
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:23,100
I waited up last night till, like, a million o'clock. Where were you?

279
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:24,263
I ...

280
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:26,842
I was with Johnny.

281
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:30,441
Yeah. Well, I had fun explaining to the Cohens that you couldn't make dinner

282
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:33,672
because you were off romping on the beach with some surfer guy.

283
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:37,292
Oh, I know. I'm sorry I missed it. I meant to be there.

284
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:39,042
Yeah, well, you weren't.

285
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,101
And now I'm finding, hmm, just suspicious articles

286
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:45,662
of clothing lying around the room, belonging to strange men.

287
00:15:45,856 --> 00:15:48,031
I've seen unfaithful, Coop; I know the signs.

288
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:52,043
Summer... I would never cheat on Ryan, ever.

289
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:56,013
Okay. I knew that. I just needed to hear you say it.

290
00:15:56,976 --> 00:16:01,021
Now, why are you blowing off your boyfriend to hang out with some random guy?

291
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:02,082
He needed to talk.

292
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:03,841
Well, that's what his girlfriend's for.

293
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:04,962
He needed to talk to me.

294
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:06,041
Because he likes you.

295
00:16:06,116 --> 00:16:08,641
He doesn't like me. We just have stuff in common.

296
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:11,173
Yeah. He's a surfer, you're a shopper.

297
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,172
Totally make the connection.

298
00:16:13,978 --> 00:16:17,641
He... went through something, something like I went through.

299
00:16:17,736 --> 00:16:20,241
And, I don't know, he just gets me.

300
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:24,143
Okay, so Johnny gets you and what, Ryan doesn't?

301
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:26,072
I didn't say that.

302
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:29,551
Besides, he doesn't have a crush on me, he has a girlfriend.

303
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:33,771
And if you don't believe me, then why don't you come to the beach with us later?

304
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:38,213
Fine. I can go before the lock-in.

305
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:42,612
But you have to find your boyfriend and apologize to him for last night.

306
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:47,282
So, have you talked to Marissa yet?

307
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:50,180
Nah, I got a message from her late last night.

308
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:54,292
No explanation, just says she's sorry, she's gonna stop by later today.

309
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:56,950
Right on cue.

310
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,652
Hey.

311
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,840
Hey.

312
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:04,072
I'm sorry about last night. You must be mad at me.

313
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,362
No, I'm just curious.

314
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,513
Where were you?

315
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:08,673
I was talking to Johnny.

316
00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:10,331
About?

317
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:11,760
It's personal.

318
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:16,540
Look, I know how bad that sounds, it's just, you've got to trust me-- 

319
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,171
there's nothing going on between me and him.

320
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:20,101
No, no, I believe you, I just...

321
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:22,012
I just want to make sure you're all right.

322
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:27,943
So...

323
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:31,790
Well, I'm still dealing with all of this stuff with Trey.

324
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:36,151
Ryan... we're on the clock here.

325
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:37,443
Chop, chop.

326
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:38,850
It's  okay.

327
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:40,433
I'll see you later.

328
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:45,540
Mr. Cohen, Kurt Williams. It's nice to meet you.

329
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:46,382
Nice to meet you.

330
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,823
I'd like you to meet my associate Matt Ramsey. He's a rising star in our company.

331
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:51,972
Good to meet you. Come on in, gentlemen. Have a seat.

332
00:17:52,377 --> 00:17:53,310
Thank you.

333
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:59,452
Mr. Cohen, Matt and I are thrilled at the prospect of taking over the Newport Group.

334
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:01,681
Well, I'm thrilled to sell it to you.

335
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:04,583
But I do have a condition. Only one.

336
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:05,683
'Course.

337
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:07,440
The Martinson Complex.

338
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,790
They're low-income properties down by the water.

339
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:11,672
You've done your homework.

340
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,183
I fought my late father-in-law tooth and nail to get those up,

341
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:17,010
and now I, uh,

342
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:19,960
I got to know they won't be destroyed.

343
00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:22,421
Even if they don't bring in much revenue.

344
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:24,291
I totally agree, Mr. Cohen--

345
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:27,892
it's properties like those that are the heart and soul of a company like this.

346
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,371
Absolutely.

347
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:35,433
Mr. Cohen, I'd like to assure you that I intend to keep Caleb Nichols legacy in place.

348
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,872
So you're not gonna knock them down and build another juice shop.

349
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,552
You have my word.

350
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:42,641
All right.

351
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:45,392
Terrific.

352
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:54,701
I made these myself.

353
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:56,971
They should help keep us psyched in the wee hours.

354
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:58,882
Yeah, you're... talented.

355
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:00,621
- Taylor?
- Okay, I'll put them up.

356
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:04,580
Mom, hi.

357
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:07,682
Hurry, I'm running late. I have your party favors in the car

358
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:10,471
These your prisoners?

359
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:13,473
They look like they want to be here just about as much as I do.

360
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,690
Tape would be a good idea.

361
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:19,633
Taylor?

362
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:21,960
Taylor, do you have any...

363
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:23,640
I mean, really, Taylor,

364
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:26,820
locking in a bunch of kids so you don't have to spend another Saturday night alone?

365
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:28,480
Mom, that's not why I'm doing it.

366
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:29,733
Baloney.

367
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:31,751
You're doing it because you're lonely.

368
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:33,672
If you'd just loosen up a little bit...

369
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,953
I would be one of the popular girls. I know, Mom.

370
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:38,681
I'm off to the club.

371
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,441
If you need me, I'll be on my cell.

372
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:45,870
And, Taylor... untuck your shirt.

373
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:48,592
Your ass is so not made for low-riders.

374
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:50,711
Got it.

375
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:56,733
So they're, like, really into surfing here, huh?

376
00:19:56,835 --> 00:19:59,873
Yep, it seems to be kind of a Newport Union obsession.

377
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:02,413
Marissa.

378
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:04,452
Hey, everyone. This is Summer.

379
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:05,090
Hey.

380
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:06,841
Oh man, I should have known

381
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:09,113
Hot chicks always travel in packs.

382
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,240
Like wolves?

383
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:11,603
Um, that's Chili.

384
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:15,280
Yeah, don't listen to anything that he says. We think he was dropped on his head as a child.

385
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:16,842
Uh, makes sense.

386
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:18,843
- Well, it's nice to meet you guys.
- You, too.

387
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:20,473
Hey, Johnny.

388
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:25,791
See you found yourself a couple of new groupies.

389
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:28,791
Summer, Marissa, this is Volcheck.

390
00:20:28,898 --> 00:20:30,820
He likes to think he owns the waves.

391
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:32,732
He's got to be better than you.

392
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:33,572
Yeah.

393
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,882
Cuz I go for a cut back out there and wipe; that's nice.

394
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:37,670
Whatever, man.

395
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:39,102
I don't know, I'm just saying.

396
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:41,831
You're gonna have to do better than that if you want to get on the Park West Tour.

397
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:45,130
Was that the tour that you tanked last year? Or...

398
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:47,203
Chili, it's cool.

399
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:49,771
Come on, you guys. Let me show you where we can get some drinks.

400
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:52,251
Casey, hold up a second.

401
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:56,553
I thought you were dating Harbor

402
00:20:57,345 --> 00:20:58,363
I am.

403
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,281
Doesn't look like it.

404
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:05,563
Casey, come on, let's go.

405
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:11,452
No, it's been great, except for Julie leaving her wet towels all over the house.

406
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,780
Well... life without a maid is an adjustment.

407
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:18,603
I can't believe you two living together. You must be having so much fun.

408
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:19,762
We are.

409
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:23,203
We both know how lucky we are to have survived the last few months, so...

410
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,731
we've been talking about finding a way to get back.

411
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:30,432
We want to throw a charity event-- black tie, the club, whole nine yards.

412
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:32,760
For underprivileged women, so that they can go to rehab

413
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:34,372
and have the same chance to heal that we did.

414
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:36,350
Well, that sounds like a wonderful cause.

415
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:38,042
So you'll help us through it?

416
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:46,360
Uh... W-Well, actually, I told myself I'd wait a while before I jump back in to all that.

417
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:48,353
You know those Newpsies.

418
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:49,993
Make you want to drink.

419
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:55,453
Ah, excuse me.

420
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:00,031
I'll handle this.

421
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:10,571
Look, Kiki, you know, I am all for you taking your recovery slowly,

422
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,633
but I'm just worried about Julie.

423
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,810
I mean, if she's ever gonna get back on her feet, she needs a way back into society.

424
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:18,482
Charlotte, I understand, but you two don't need me to throw this.

425
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:20,891
Of course we do. Nobody in this town even knows me,

426
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,853
and Julie couldn't get arrested.

427
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:27,051
Your name on the invitation would be a huge draw.

428
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:28,953
I don't know.

429
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:33,700
Look, do it for your friend; she needs you.

430
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:36,441
Hey.

431
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:39,813
What are you guys talking about in here?

432
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:44,472
Uh... I was just telling Charlotte how I'd love to help.

433
00:22:45,237 --> 00:22:46,540
Really? You would?

434
00:22:46,587 --> 00:22:48,841
Mm-hmm. I'm in.

435
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:00,723
What's up?

436
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:02,242
Whoo!

437
00:23:02,357 --> 00:23:04,083
Welcome to my casa.

438
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:08,480
Hey, Summer. Why don't I give you a little tour, show you my lair?

439
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:10,001
You're a dweeb.

440
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:11,832
Will you show me where to drop my stuff?

441
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:13,201
Sure. Follow me.

442
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:17,192
Wh-Where's his girlfriend?

443
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:20,070
I don't know.

444
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:22,560
Hey, Dawn Patrol!

445
00:23:22,645 --> 00:23:24,201
You know what I'm talking about.

446
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:28,960
So I think this will officially make you the first girl in Chili's room.

447
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:30,340
What an honor.

448
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:35,893
Oh, my God. Is this you and Chili?

449
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:36,950
Oh, I forgot he had that.

450
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:37,942
Wait, let me see that.

451
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:39,282
No, no, no. I'm sorry, I can't do that.

452
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:41,162
- Please? That's hysterical.
- Come on, come on! Please? Oh!

453
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,001
- You looked cute, really.
- No, it's not cute.

454
00:23:43,115 --> 00:23:45,330
Both of us in Power Rangers underwear, not cute.

455
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:48,871
Yes, it is. Please, I promise. I really promise I won't laugh.

456
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:50,053
Okay?

457
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:55,763
You liar!

458
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:57,303
That's really great.

459
00:23:57,398 --> 00:23:59,142
Come on, no, stop. Come on.

460
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:00,761
- Please?
- Stop.

461
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:03,121
I'm a sensitive person.

462
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:05,273
- We can laugh about it.
- No, we can't, no.

463
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:11,810
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

464
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,560
Hey. Where are you?

465
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:17,053
I don't know, some guy Chili's house. At the end of Dune Road or something.

466
00:24:17,146 --> 00:24:19,843
Okay, are you not aware that lock-in is mandatory?

467
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,700
Well, I don't care about lock-in right now. I just need Ryan to get here, okay?

468
00:24:22,785 --> 00:24:23,833
It's an emergency.

469
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:25,060
Why? What's the problem?

470
00:24:25,157 --> 00:24:26,561
I can't get into it right now

471
00:24:26,656 --> 00:24:30,303
Sorry. All cell phones must be surrendered at the door

472
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,060
The lock-in hasn't even started yet.

473
00:24:33,156 --> 00:24:35,172
Yes, but you're in the gym.

474
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:38,602
Believe me, by making you exist in a world where we don't depend

475
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:41,742
on technology to communicate with one another,

476
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:44,220
I'm doing you a very serious favor.

477
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:48,633
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

478
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:50,940
Summer called. She said something about you getting to some guy's house

479
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:53,052
on Dune Road right away. Some emergency.

480
00:24:53,147 --> 00:24:54,243
Is it Marissa?

481
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,470
I don't know. My cell phone was confiscated,

482
00:24:56,557 --> 00:24:58,752
which I do believe is a violation of my civil liberties.

483
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:00,232
Okay, I gotta go.

484
00:25:02,688 --> 00:25:04,872
Where do you think you're going, Ryan Atwood?

485
00:25:05,268 --> 00:25:08,302
If you're not back here by the time the doors lock at 9:00 p.m.,

486
00:25:08,396 --> 00:25:10,392
you're in very serious trouble.

487
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,543
Yeah, I gotta go.

488
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,653
I don't get it. Why don't you like me?

489
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:28,502
I'm already dating a dork.

490
00:25:29,117 --> 00:25:29,953
Yeah.

491
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:32,461
That kind of gives me inspiration.

492
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:35,373
I'm wearing you down.

493
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:40,252
There you are.

494
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:42,432
Yeah, I just needed a little disco nap.

495
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:45,222
You okay?

496
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:46,461
Yeah, I'm fine.

497
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:50,953
I'm gonna go get myself a refill.

498
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:58,252
I'm fine. It's okay.

499
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:02,140
Oh crap

500
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:12,052
This is Seth. It's 2005, you know how these things work.

501
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:13,922
Oh, why am I getting your voice mail!

502
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:15,872
Cohen, look, about Ryan, abort mission.

503
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:18,231
I repeat, abort mission.

504
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:21,242
Or not. Atwood!

505
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:22,482
Hey!

506
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:24,400
You move quickly.

507
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:26,240
Yeah, well, Seth said Marissa's in trouble?

508
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:27,872
Oh, yeah, false alarm.

509
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:30,123
You know, you should get back to the lock-in. You don't want to miss out on the s'mores.

510
00:26:30,218 --> 00:26:31,893
Uh-huh. Why'd you call me?

511
00:26:31,998 --> 00:26:33,241
Well, I...

512
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:37,751
I was just worried about Johnny and Marissa.

513
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:41,833
Johnny? You mean that Johnny? Hanging-with-his-girlfriend Johnny?

514
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:44,643
I have a bit of a hair trigger. But you should go before Marissa sees you.

515
00:26:44,748 --> 00:26:45,880
Ryan?

516
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:48,042
What are you doing here?

517
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:51,301
- I was, uh, just checking up on...
- Me.

518
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:55,541
He wanted to make sure that I had a ride to the lock-in.

519
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:57,861
She's low on gas.

520
00:26:58,185 --> 00:27:00,613
Hey, Ryan. Glad you could make it

521
00:27:00,726 --> 00:27:02,491
Let me show you where you can get a drink.

522
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:05,191
I'd love to.

523
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:12,831
Matt, thanks for coming.

524
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,172
Sure.

525
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:16,642
Is there a problem with the sale, or...?

526
00:27:16,746 --> 00:27:19,020
Well, I was hoping you could tell me about that.

527
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:21,780
Let's talk about your boss.

528
00:27:22,366 --> 00:27:24,920
Well, he's a brilliant businessman.

529
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:27,243
But I shouldn't trust him, should I?

530
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:31,452
That handshake... that smile--

531
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:35,073
oh, I've met his type before. This town is full of them.

532
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:38,590
This is about the Martinson Complex, isn't it?

533
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:40,672
Yes.

534
00:27:43,647 --> 00:27:45,771
I need to know those people won't be displaced.

535
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:48,021
You know, I'd love to tell you otherwise, but Williams

536
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,820
is gonna tear down whatever is not making him a bundle.

537
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:51,662
Simple as that.

538
00:27:51,756 --> 00:27:53,033
I appreciate your honesty

539
00:27:53,117 --> 00:27:55,812
Well, unfortunately, honesty is not a valid commodity in this business.

540
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:59,103
Well... to me it is.

541
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:02,191
Then don't sell to Williams.

542
00:28:02,495 --> 00:28:05,073
Hang on to the company. I'll help you.

543
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,883
I don't know about that.

544
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:10,661
I'm no businessman, and you don't look much older than my son.

545
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:12,002
I'm 26.

546
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:14,101
I graduated Magnacum Laude in Berkeley

547
00:28:14,196 --> 00:28:14,670
Berkeley?

548
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:18,531
I got my MBA in one year in Kellogg, and the last 14 months I spent working under Kurt Williams.

549
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:20,823
Well, that's an impressive resume,

550
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:23,520
but there's no substitute for life experience.

551
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,221
That's what you'll bring to the table.

552
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,662
Me, I'll... I'll crunch the numbers. I'll do all the boring stuff.

553
00:28:28,826 --> 00:28:32,502
Look... if you give me this opportunity,

554
00:28:32,606 --> 00:28:35,790
I will work my ass off for you, I promise.

555
00:28:36,436 --> 00:28:38,963
I've been dodging this business for the last 20 years.

556
00:28:39,047 --> 00:28:40,811
Think of the change that you could bring to this community

557
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:43,643
if you had control of a multimillion dollar company.

558
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:45,791
Well, I'm gonna have to think about that.

559
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:48,850
You know what that means, don't you?

560
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:50,873
I gotta ask my wife.

561
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:52,232
Of course.

562
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:56,130
Look, all I'm asking for is a shot...

563
00:28:56,787 --> 00:28:58,062
six months.

564
00:29:01,937 --> 00:29:03,560
So, I was thinking five grand a person.

565
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:06,022
Mm-hmm. That sounds fair. We'll have three courses.

566
00:29:06,106 --> 00:29:07,053
Perfect.

567
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:13,270
One sec, it's my dad again

568
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:14,542
Hello?

569
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,213
Did you need anything else?

570
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,203
Uh...

571
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:26,822
Can you hang on a sec? My friend is treating.

572
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:31,330
Actually, just a sec. Here.

573
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:38,940
Let's see. I'm not sure which one of these she might want to use.

574
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:50,393
You know... why don't I just give you cash?

575
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:07,613
So look, I just want you to know I'm... I'm only here 'cause Summer called.

576
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:10,151
You sure you're not here because you freaked out about me and Johnny?

577
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:13,633
Well, I wasn't, but I'm starting to think I should be.

578
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:15,833
What's going on with you guys?

579
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:18,781
I... I don't know, I just...

580
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:20,672
I can talk to him.

581
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:21,733
About what?

582
00:30:21,818 --> 00:30:26,781
About... about Trey, I guess.

583
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,412
You can't talk to me about it?

584
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,533
I tried. I mean, I tried the other night.

585
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:32,491
At 4:00 in the morning.

586
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:35,051
Yeah, and you told me to go back to sleep.

587
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:37,860
I mean, it's like you want to pretend it didn't even happened.

588
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:40,122
Wh-What do you want me to do?

589
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:44,602
I mean, I can't fix this. I can't make it go away.

590
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:49,013
Hey. How's it going?

591
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:50,241
Great.

592
00:30:51,107 --> 00:30:53,393
Look, I gotta get to the lock-in.

593
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:55,531
I'll see ya.

594
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:58,943
Guys.

595
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:01,451
Hello?

596
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:02,900
Hey, Ryan, where are you?

597
00:31:02,975 --> 00:31:04,651
Where's Summer? You guys got to get over here.

598
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:06,352
I'm leaving. See you in a minute.

599
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:09,442
Okay, well, hurry up. I'm freaking out right now.

600
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:13,982
I'm using a pay phone, and God knows what ancient strand of lip herpes I'm contracting.

601
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:16,432
That's disgusting. I'll be there as soon as possible.

602
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:17,343
Atwood!

603
00:31:17,516 --> 00:31:21,293
Wait up, I'm sorry I overreacted. I meddled.

604
00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:23,211
- Oh, my God, I'm Seth.
- It's okay.

605
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:26,020
Look, I just get nervous that we're gonna lose her, you know?

606
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:28,731
I cannot sleep tonight if you guys do not make up.

607
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:30,932
Will you please just go back in there and talk to her?

608
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:33,900
Where's Ryan?

609
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:36,163
He's gone; we had an argument.

610
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:38,110
You should call him.

611
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:40,603
You'll feel better if you talk to him

612
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,703
Well, is there somewhere I could go, somewhere quiet?

613
00:31:43,795 --> 00:31:45,182
Yeah. Follow me.

614
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:51,142
You could use Chili's room.

615
00:31:54,018 --> 00:31:55,161
Johnny.

616
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:07,653
You get my sponsorship, I got your girl.

617
00:32:07,768 --> 00:32:09,120
Seems fair to me.

618
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:13,412
How you doing? You good?

619
00:32:23,128 --> 00:32:24,962
Let me take Voclheck's ass, man

620
00:32:25,065 --> 00:32:27,623
I mean, I know the dude's crazy and he could probably break me with his bare hands,

621
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:29,531
but you know what? It's worth it.

622
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,302
Are you okay?

623
00:32:32,987 --> 00:32:34,362
I know where he is, too.

624
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:36,603
By the dunes. You know he's there with his bros

625
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:39,312
Johnny, look, if we can do anything, just let us know, okay?

626
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:40,601
Thanks, guys.

627
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:43,112
I think I just need to be alone.

628
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:47,292
Okay.

629
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:51,671
I'll get it.

630
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,821
Casey.

631
00:32:57,907 --> 00:32:59,361
Is he here?

632
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,923
Yeah, sure.

633
00:33:01,477 --> 00:33:05,032
Look, just so you know, I'm not a terrible person.

634
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:08,851
I could just see where... all this was headed

635
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:09,760
What do you mean?

636
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:14,282
The way he's been looking at you, all your long, secret talks.

637
00:33:14,385 --> 00:33:16,110
It's not even like that.

638
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:17,790
Wake up, Marissa.

639
00:33:18,768 --> 00:33:22,551
You may not know it yet, but he's falling in love with you,

640
00:33:22,648 --> 00:33:25,321
and I'm not going to sit around and watch that happen.

641
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:26,672
Johnny's gone.

642
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,173
He went after Volcheck

643
00:33:33,785 --> 00:33:35,950
So, you want to stop and get a movie on the way home?

644
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:37,582
Sounds good.

645
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:42,052
Just answer me one tiny question

646
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:43,381
Who the hell are you?

647
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:47,841
What?

648
00:33:47,946 --> 00:33:49,721
You heard me. I just saw what's in your purse.

649
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:53,452
What, like, half a dozen credit cards, all with different names?

650
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:57,432
I think you and I have had a little misunderstanding.

651
00:33:57,528 --> 00:34:01,111
Please. There is not a lie in the world I haven't heard or told

652
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:04,790
so just give it to me straight. It'll save us a lot of time.

653
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:08,972
I was never going to hurt you, Julie.

654
00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:12,193
Right, you were just gonna scam me into throwing a fake charity,

655
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:15,172
and leave me to pick up the pieces so you could skip town.

656
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:18,700
What if you help me?

657
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:21,513
- Are you drinking again?
- Just hear me out.

658
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:24,592
We raise a couple hundred grand, we split it, and I disappear.

659
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:26,420
You're rich again and everybody in town sleeps better

660
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:28,822
because they think they've helped a good cause.

661
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:33,401
I'm not a criminal.

662
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:35,090
You haven't had to be yet.

663
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:40,801
Have you given any thought to how you're gonna support your family?

664
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:43,392
I mean, you don't have a man to bail you out this time, Julie.

665
00:34:45,046 --> 00:34:48,620
If you're smart...you'll take matters in your own hand

666
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:54,650
I thought you loathed corporate America.

667
00:34:54,746 --> 00:34:56,662
Oh, I do, I loathe it all:

668
00:34:56,757 --> 00:34:59,671
greed, Republicans, navy suits.

669
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:01,921
So why are you considering this?

670
00:35:02,076 --> 00:35:04,691
Well, after your father died, I basically shut down my law practice

671
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:06,380
so I could deal with the Newport Group.

672
00:35:06,497 --> 00:35:08,813
This might be a way to make it all mean something--

673
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:10,310
your work and mine.

674
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:14,050
Well, if this is something that you want,

675
00:35:14,335 --> 00:35:15,592
you know I'll support you.

676
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:17,041
What about you?

677
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:21,020
If my taking over the company threatens any of the progress you've made...

678
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:22,892
I'm out of the woods now.

679
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:27,143
It's time for you to get back to making yourself happy.

680
00:35:29,356 --> 00:35:34,650
Okay, um, if we could just move it over to the bleachers, that would be great, great.

681
00:35:34,738 --> 00:35:38,410
Everyone, um, can you, can you make your way over to the bleachers, please?

682
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:40,153
- Yes, everyone.
- Hey, Taylor, Taylor.

683
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:44,582
How's it going? So far, this lock-in, it's awesome.

684
00:35:44,698 --> 00:35:45,760
Not happening, Seth.

685
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:46,931
What, what's not happening?

686
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:49,200
Your kissing my ass so I'll sign in Ryan and Summer.

687
00:35:49,286 --> 00:35:50,922
No, no, no. But actually, it turns out they got held up.

688
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:54,031
So if you could just, uh, cut them some slack, that'd be great.

689
00:35:54,128 --> 00:35:58,101
Seth, what I'm doing here is creating an atmosphere of trust.

690
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:00,752
Now, if I give your friends preferential treatment,

691
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:03,642
well, then I've muddled the message, haven't I

692
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:04,563
What?

693
00:36:04,657 --> 00:36:07,293
Now those doors are gonna lock in 20 minutes

694
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:10,050
And if Ryan and Summer aren't here...

695
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:13,812
You can't save people, Seth.

696
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:15,593
They need to save themselves.

697
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:16,653
Thank you for your help.

698
00:36:16,765 --> 00:36:17,640
Sit down.

699
00:36:17,897 --> 00:36:18,682
Go on.

700
00:36:18,986 --> 00:36:21,601
Okay, everybody... Hi.

701
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:25,143
So, um, lock-in hasn't officially started yet,

702
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:28,810
but hey, we can still start the fun, right? Whoo!

703
00:36:29,348 --> 00:36:31,711
Who's in the mood for trust falls?

704
00:36:32,435 --> 00:36:34,030
Nobody.

705
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:38,390
So if you could each find a buddy,

706
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:41,630
preferably someone who you don't know very well.

707
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:43,793
Or even someone of a different race.

708
00:36:43,896 --> 00:36:45,803
You're a loser!

709
00:36:53,185 --> 00:36:54,180
What are you doing up here ?

710
00:36:54,307 --> 00:36:55,512
I am going to help you.

711
00:36:55,616 --> 00:36:58,600
I don't need your help. Get off my stage, geek.

712
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:03,800
Okay, um, well, maybe we'll just work up to trust falls.

713
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:07,010
Why don't we turn to the person next to us

714
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,961
and tell them something about ourselves that, um,

715
00:37:10,057 --> 00:37:11,521
they may not already know?

716
00:37:11,638 --> 00:37:14,941
Taylor Townsend sucks!

717
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:18,440
Watch out for those.

718
00:37:18,555 --> 00:37:22,630
Uh, hi, everybody. My name is Seth Cohen, the West Coast Cohen's.

719
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:26,020
I was feeling like we should all play a delicious game of Capture the Flag.

720
00:37:26,066 --> 00:37:26,561
Bite me!

721
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:29,971
Now, I should warn all of you, I'm very talented at this game.

722
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:32,302
Yeah, I was All-Camp Capture the Flag captain at Camp Takaho, so...

723
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:35,123
You were All-Geek at Camp Geek!

724
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:39,280
Why are you doing this ?

725
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:41,003
I can take it. I'm used to it.

726
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:41,880
Seth Cohen's a tool!

727
00:37:41,977 --> 00:37:42,731
Thank you.

728
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:46,821
Now listen, everyone to my right, you're gonna be the red team,

729
00:37:46,918 --> 00:37:49,592
everyone to my left, you're gonna be the blue team.

730
00:38:06,656 --> 00:38:10,913
Hey, check it out. It's Harper. He's come to whip Volcheck's ass.

731
00:38:14,636 --> 00:38:16,270
Kevin, we need to talk, man.

732
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:17,721
Oh, yeah?

733
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:20,162
What are you going to do?

734
00:38:20,355 --> 00:38:21,960
Why would you do that to me?

735
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,043
How could you do that to me?

736
00:38:23,158 --> 00:38:24,322
Back off!

737
00:38:24,715 --> 00:38:27,200
You little bitch, you even want more!

738
00:38:27,287 --> 00:38:28,352
You want some more of that?

739
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:29,450
Back up!

740
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:36,200
Come on.

741
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:39,153
Don't worry about it, don't worry about it.

742
00:38:39,257 --> 00:38:41,031
Yeah, watch it.

743
00:38:41,198 --> 00:38:42,812
Get that bitch out of here.

744
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:45,101
You know what? Hold on. I got to do something.

745
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:52,151
Stay away from him.

746
00:38:53,726 --> 00:38:54,652
Come on.

747
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:58,412
Not tonight, fellas.

748
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:00,363
I think some drinks are in order.

749
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:02,471
Bartender, two shots of Patron.

750
00:39:02,558 --> 00:39:05,062
I haven't had tequila in... in forever.

751
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:06,942
Then we should have a whole bottle.

752
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:08,791
Game on, man.

753
00:39:08,898 --> 00:39:11,700
What, what's next? A frat party at SC?

754
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:15,250
No, I... just wanted to celebrate.

755
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:18,233
Listen, I expect you to take this job seriously.

756
00:39:18,335 --> 00:39:21,271
I'm not gonna be out drinking with you every night after work.

757
00:39:21,915 --> 00:39:23,401
Weekends, maybe.

758
00:39:24,025 --> 00:39:25,461
And tonight.

759
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:27,702
Game on, Matt.

760
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,003
Game on, boss.

761
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:32,923
Hi, Seth.

762
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:35,201
Hi.

763
00:39:36,988 --> 00:39:38,063
Are you okay?

764
00:39:38,187 --> 00:39:41,990
Well, I'm trapped in the gym with everybody but my only two friends in the school,

765
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:46,980
so other than this being my worst nightmare ever, yeah, I'm okay.

766
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:52,582
So I just wanted to say thank you for before.

767
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:54,641
I really appreciate it.

768
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,751
Yeah, it's no problem. After 12 years, I'm immune to mockery, so...

769
00:40:00,577 --> 00:40:05,031
And about the sign-in sheet. Um, we could work something out.

770
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:06,312
You mean it?

771
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:07,491
Sure.

772
00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:13,900
So do you mind if I, um, join you for some pizza?

773
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:16,011
No. Go ahead.

774
00:40:18,136 --> 00:40:19,173
Thanks.

775
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:21,502
I guess Ryan's gonna miss the lock-in.

776
00:40:21,606 --> 00:40:23,482
Yeah, well, it's probably better he stayed with Johnny.

777
00:40:23,575 --> 00:40:25,312
He'll keep him from going after Volchek again

778
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:27,351
Yeah, well, at this rate, we both might miss it.

779
00:40:27,445 --> 00:40:28,991
- Wait here, okay?
- Okay.

780
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,901
Can anyone hear me?

781
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:42,220
Who is it?

782
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:44,353
Taylor, it's Summer! Open up!

783
00:40:48,756 --> 00:40:49,883
Taylor!

784
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:52,622
Taylor?

785
00:40:52,965 --> 00:40:55,851
Sorry! I can't hear you.

786
00:40:55,938 --> 00:40:58,881
What do you mean you can't hear...? You're responding! Taylor!

787
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,061
Sorry!

788
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:02,032
What?!

789
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:03,332
Taylor!

790
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:14,902
And I'll take a cheeseburger, extra fries.

791
00:41:17,118 --> 00:41:18,550
Dinner's on me, man.

792
00:41:18,887 --> 00:41:20,792
I'm really sorry about the fight.

793
00:41:21,116 --> 00:41:25,233
Although I... I gotta say, watching Volcheck get his ass kicked was pretty awesome.

794
00:41:25,328 --> 00:41:26,611
I'm glad I could be of service.

795
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:28,162
Hey, man, where'd you learn how to fight like that?

796
00:41:28,258 --> 00:41:31,953
Ah, you know, Chino's a pretty good training ground.

797
00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:37,043
Actually I never wanted to fight till I got to Newport

798
00:41:44,345 --> 00:41:46,122
Cohen is gonna kill me.

799
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:49,281
I'm sorry. I feel like it's my fault you missed the lock-in.

800
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,400
Actually, I kind of feel like everything's my fault.

801
00:41:52,505 --> 00:41:54,363
What, you mean Johnny and Casey?

802
00:41:54,707 --> 00:41:56,561
Not what I was referring to, but thanks.

803
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:58,640
I'm sorry, Coop, it's obvious, though.

804
00:41:58,755 --> 00:42:01,302
She saw him falling for you, so she hurt him before he could hurt her.

805
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:02,773
It's a classic girl move.

806
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:05,283
- Summer, I know what everyone thinks, but...
- Yeah, he likes you.

807
00:42:05,386 --> 00:42:07,762
And sooner or later, you're gonna have to deal with it.

808
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,801
I really wish everything would just slow down.

809
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:14,670
Well...

810
00:42:21,128 --> 00:42:22,431
No such luck.

811
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:29,122
Yeah, Coop, this shouldn't be a problem for you at all.

812
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:33,482
