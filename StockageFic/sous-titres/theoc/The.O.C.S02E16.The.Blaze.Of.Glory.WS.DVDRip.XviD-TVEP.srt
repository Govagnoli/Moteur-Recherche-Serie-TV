1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,315
-Previously, on The O. C.
-What are you doing here?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,550
T ake a look.
T ell me how much it's worth.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,830
I'll write you a check
for $50,000 right now.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,592
I was thinking more like $500,000.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,352
-Hi, Carter.
-Pleasure to meet you.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,192
-Ever been married?
-I am married.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,839
You're not wearing a ring.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,837
Where's your ring?

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,235
I guess I'm not the only one
she lies to.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,789
I know my daughter.
Marissa's only been in love once.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,394
And he looked a whole lot different
in a wife-beater.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,591
-Do you miss him?
-Every day.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,591
It's hard to believe,
but spring is here.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,398
Yeah. This year's just flying by.

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,030
Yeah. And, you know, I gotta say,
this year, not as good as last.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,474
-You think?
-I do.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,359
I mean, look, we all tried
some new things and that was fun.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,718
Yard guys, illegitimate daughters,
less fighting, more live music.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,390
Well, maybe you remember last year
as better because it was all new.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,199
You think I've sentimentalized
the past out of proportion?

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,590
Yeah. Come on.
We can't keep living in last year.

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,478
Sure we can.
And check this out, man.

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,551
Things are going back
to the way they were.

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,711
I'm back with Summer,
you're single again.

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,154
I know where this is going.

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,993
Yeah, it's going to
the Harbor School Pep Rally Bonfire.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,274
Come on. You could rally
a little pep, couldn't you?

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,829
-Especially if you invited along....
-Don't say it.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,558
It would be so last year though.

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,472
Nothing's going on with me
and Marissa.

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,313
So there's just no feelings
there whatsoever?

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,630
-You couldn't care less?
-It's not about that.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,837
Besides, she's clearly already taken.

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,868
Bye.

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,837
I don't know.
I don't see any chemistry.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,276
Maybe we should ask them to kiss,
real slow-like.

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,429
-Hey.
-Hey.

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,670
I couldn't help but notice
the bonfire banner.

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,115
Don't talk to me about it.
It's been so stressful.

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,113
I can't even find someone
to design the bonfire.

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,191
-You guys coming?
-Don't know. A pep rally.

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,430
Yeah, a bonfire pep rally.
You bet we are.

43
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,471
Okay, cool. Well, I'm gonna be late.

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,871
You're going the way of lockers and
classrooms. Why don't you walk her?

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,110
That would be a nice gesture.

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,279
-Okay. Thanks.
-No problem.

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,354
-Live in the now, Seth.
-I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't do that.

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,272
Bye.

49
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,591
-Hi.
-Hey.

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,751
Oh, no, don't even
think about it, Cohen.

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,990
We've lived through enough
of their suffering.

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,354
Yeah. And it was awesome.

53
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,994
Do not meddle with them.
They're, like, combustible.

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,113
Yeah, Summer, and what better place
for said combustion...

55
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,919
...than the Harbor School
Pep Rally Bonfire?

56
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,757
-You're kind of creeping me out.
-I'm okay with that.

57
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,431
Wait, Summer.

58
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,272
Come back.

59
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,950
All right, nice and easy.
Now, start that shoulder turn.

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,509
Keep your eye on that ball.
Maintain the spine angle.

61
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,398
Come on. Turn those shoulders.

62
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,518
Finish that turn. Feel that weight shift.
Do you feel the...?

63
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,190
All right, I'm just gonna stand here
nice and quietly.

64
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,958
But supportively.

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,154
That was good. Your feet were busy.
Quiet your feet down.

66
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,157
-Come on, try it again.
-No more tries.

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,395
I hate golf. I suck at golf.
I no longer wanna play golf.

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,637
-You could only get better.
-I'll have to take your word for it.

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,156
Come on. We could play together.
You look so cute in that visor.

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,517
I do?

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,395
I gotta go.

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,638
We're putting together
our first issue of Newport Living...

73
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,109
...trying to figure out what photo
of Julie to use.

74
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,793
T alk about Sophie 's Choice.

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,235
Who'd you finally get to edit
the Medusa Monthly?

76
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,237
Carter Buckley. He's really great.

77
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,159
He wants to take it
beyond gossip and dish.

78
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,828
Focus on culture, the local art scene.

79
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,600
So it's really more of a pamphlet
than a magazine.

80
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,994
Carter Buckley.
Now, what's he done before?

81
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,755
A bunch of stuff.
A magazine called The Ugly American.

82
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,354
National Geographic, GQ.

83
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,159
And he self-published a magazine
called Revolution.

84
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,837
-You've gotta be kidding.
-You know it?

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,070
That was the magazine
of Berkeley's left wing.

86
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,272
Portraits of the misunderstood,
the marginalized, the crackpots.

87
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,837
-An entire magazine about losers.
-But loveable ones. I read it religiously.

88
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,872
I'm impressed.
You know, I'd love to meet him.

89
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,473
Well, I'll set something up.

90
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,117
-You found your wedding ring.
-Yeah. Behind some cushions.

91
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,554
Thanks for the lesson.

92
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,794
-Hello, Marissa.
-Hey, Cohen.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,595
-You seem stressed, a little distracted.
-Yeah, well, it's this bonfire.

94
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,479
It would be really great
if we had, you know, a bonfire.

95
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,796
Well, Coop,
I think I got what ails you.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,911
First of all,
only Summer calls me Coop.

97
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,798
I figured, we're back together now...

98
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,394
...and if A equals C and B equals C
then A equals B.

99
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,790
-Know what I'm saying?
-No. I really don't.

100
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,157
So, what's your plan?
Who's your social-chair savior?

101
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,796
-Ryan.
-Mr. Water Polo? I don't think so.

102
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,032
Yeah, but think about this.
That guy worked and-- No, no.

103
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,873
He toiled in an actual construction job.

104
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,674
Also, he enjoys architecture
and burning stuff down.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,513
He did torch Caleb's model home.

106
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,277
-I don't know. You think he'd say yes?
-To you? How could he resist.

107
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,711
Especially now that Lindsay's gone.
The kid's kind of blue.

108
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,798
It might be good for him. Distract him.
And it would be fun.

109
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,270
Yes. Yes. Although I personally
don't see the appeal, yes.

110
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,711
-All right, that's a good idea. Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

111
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,519
Seriously, don't.
Especially to Summer.

112
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,638
Hello, Mother.

113
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,758
No, I'm not coming home, okay? Bye.

114
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,552
Please do not--

115
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,029
She's such a little me.

116
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,877
Okay, like you're not creepy enough,
you're appearing in doorways now?

117
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,554
-Trouble at home?
-Like I'd open up to you.

118
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,995
-I'm here if you need me.
-I'll keep that in mind.

119
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,593
-What do you want?
-My money.

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,193
Again, good to know.

121
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,874
-How'd you get past security?
-Charm and good looks.

122
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,952
-I know you've got this magazine ready.
-Get out, Lance.

123
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,032
This is not the moment when you want
your perfect reputation...

124
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,112
...undone by one bad decision
and not so flattering lighting.

125
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,111
You got three days
to give me my money...

126
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,756
...or everyone in Newport's gonna see
a lot more than your face.

127
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,191
Traffic was terrible.
Is Carter here yet?

128
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,875
Mr. Buckley left a voicemail at around
3:30 a.m. Said don't expect him today.

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,837
Three-thirty? Did he say why?

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,560
No. But I couldn't understand
everything on the message.

131
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,758
-He was slurring.
-You're kidding.

132
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,079
Well, I guess Julie and l
will proceed without him.

133
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,954
-Oh, hey, Kiks. Can't make the meeting.
-ls something up?

134
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,232
Just a critical personal emergency.
But nothing important.

135
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,999
I guess the meeting's cancelled.

136
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,232
I can try Mr. Buckley,
see if he's changed his mind.

137
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,197
No. I'll take care of it.

138
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,950
So how are you and Alex?

139
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,952
You know, really great.

140
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,112
-Really great? Or really great?
-Really great.

141
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,952
Thanks for clearing that up for me.

142
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,152
Tell Seth never to call me Coop again.
He ruined the nickname.

143
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,874
-Cohen called you Coop? When?
-Earlier.

144
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,911
Hey, I hope I'm not interrupting.

145
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,071
No, actually,
I was hoping I'd run into you.

146
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,673
-Yeah? You were?
-You were?

147
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,713
I was. I need someone to build
the bonfire for us...

148
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,678
...and I figured, who else
has worked in construction--

149
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,996
-Has burned down a house?
-Yeah. Exactly.

150
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,794
And I thought it would be fun
working together.

151
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,879
-You did?
-You did?

152
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,828
Besides, if you don't do it then the water
polo team's not gonna have a pep rally.

153
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,632
Well, we can't have that happen.

154
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,751
-Sure, yeah, okay.
-You'll do it?

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,958
-That's great. Isn't that great?
-It's great!

156
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,759
-What's great?
-Ryan's gonna build the bonfire for us.

157
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,876
Hey, great idea, you two.

158
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,072
I love that. Making it happen
on behalf of the school.

159
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,909
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
the idea is just inspired.

160
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,471
Well, I've got a big test
to study for...

161
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,438
...so it looks like I'll be eating
in the library. So long.

162
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,474
Oh, come on. Do you have to go?
You know, will you two excuse me?

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,560
So thanks again.
I'll see you after school?

164
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,637
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay. My place?

165
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,559
-Your place with Alex?
-Yeah. Is that a problem?

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,912
-No.
-Okay.

167
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,196
No problem at all.

168
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,472
No, I looked in the box. This computer
does not have an access key.

169
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,279
Look, all I wanna do
is check my e-mail.

170
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,718
No! Do not transfer me.

171
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,751
-You must have been talking to Marissa.
-Julie, you scared me.

172
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,150
-More than usual.
-Always a pleasure, Sanford.

173
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,113
Only Caleb gets to call me Sanford
because he won't not.

174
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,997
-What are you doing here?
-Official business.

175
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,829
And as a new client,
I'm not impressed.

176
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,110
If this is a marital issue,
I have to decline.

177
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,078
-Caleb's got me on retainer.
-Caleb and I are just fine.

178
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,913
And, well, I'm trying
to keep it that way.

179
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,235
Well, l....

180
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,392
This is the first time in my life
I'm actually speechless.

181
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,751
It was the '80s.
I was young, I had no money and....

182
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,755
-lt was the '80s.
-That explains everything.

183
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,831
I'm not gonna give you
my whole sob story.

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,753
Needless to say,
I never thought that it would resurface.

185
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,997
-So where did this come from?
-The auteur behind this masterpiece.

186
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,436
His name is Lance Baldwin.
He's an ex.

187
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,837
So you started with a porn producer
and you ended up with Caleb.

188
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,197
-See, I'd consider that a lateral move.
-He wants half a million.

189
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,790
Or he goes public on the eve
of Newport Living 's launch.

190
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,868
-You've gotta go to the cops.
-No. Sandy, no cops.

191
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,270
And before you even suggest it,
no Caleb.

192
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,032
-I am so not the guy for this.
-Sandy.

193
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,472
Please.

194
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,991
I'm begging you.

195
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,750
Forget the company or my marriage.

196
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,079
If Marissa ever found about this....

197
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,115
I mean, she's already moved out
on me. She won't take my calls.

198
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,198
She would never speak to me again.

199
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,996
It's all right, Julie.

200
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,393
You deal with Marissa
and I'll deal with the colonel.

201
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,110
It's a Boogie Nights reference.

202
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,634
Expect a lot of them.

203
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,792
-Don't worry about it. I wasn't reading.
-What the hell is your problem, Cohen?

204
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,391
You're interrupting very studious people.
Like me.

205
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,153
Okay.

206
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,152
All right.

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,833
-Now no one can hear you scream.
-What is your problem, woman?

208
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,594
You are. What did I tell you
about messing with them?

209
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,672
I was concerned the water polo team
wouldn't have a pep rally...

210
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,035
...so I suggested it
for the good of the school.

211
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,475
-Cohen.
-They belong together.

212
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,238
-No, they don't.
-Yes, they do.

213
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,472
It's me and you, and Ryan and Marissa.
That's the way it should be.

214
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,755
Listen up, asshat.

215
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,435
Ryan and Marissa separate,
both great people that I love.

216
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,751
T ogether, disaster.
So stay away from them, all right?

217
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,390
Or otherwise, more than the bonfire
is going up in flames.

218
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,319
I can make no promises.

219
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,875
Hey, what's up?

220
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,315
Nothing. I just wanted to see
what you were up to.

221
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,799
We haven't had time to hang.

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,390
I know. I just have this project
to work on after school with Ryan.

223
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,512
With Ryan?

224
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,472
-What thing?
-This bonfire pep rally.

225
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,273
You never mentioned a pep rally.

226
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,238
Yeah, I kind of have a handle
on your sense of school spirit.

227
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,076
Yeah, good point. So I guess
I'll just see you at home.

228
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,230
-Hello?
-Yeah, sorry. I'll see you later.

229
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,919
Hello! Anyone here?

230
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,111
Kirsten. Sorry, private party.

231
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,555
We had a meeting!
You wanna explain what happened?

232
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,911
Oh, it was just a little thing I like to call
my wedding anniversary.

233
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,590
-You're divorced.
-No wonder this party sucks.

234
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,118
I see you found your ring.
Must mean you're still married.

235
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,719
Thanks for stopping by.

236
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,591
Look, I'm sorry I just stopped by.

237
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,394
But you could apologize
for blowing off the meeting.

238
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,755
Right. Yeah. I'm sorry.

239
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,112
And I'm sorry for all the future meetings
I'm gonna miss.

240
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,913
You see, now you don't have to
feel bad about firing me.

241
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,390
Maybe you're not in the best frame
of mind to be having this discussion.

242
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,676
I'm gonna be less self-loathing
if I'm sober?

243
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,513
Come on, I work for a rag
about Julie Cooper-Nichol.

244
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,156
-No, it's about culture, it's about art.
-Oh, come on, Kirsten.

245
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,397
This magazine is just a photo opportunity
for 55-year-old women...

246
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,879
...with 25-year-old breasts.

247
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,390
But this is a chance to turn
this community upside down...

248
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,472
...be subversive, irreverent.

249
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,874
I'd rather be drunk.

250
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,950
You see, Oats. It's even the same
on The Valley. Last year was just better.

251
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,231
You and Captain Oats catching up?

252
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,198
Yeah. Does he seem grumpy
to you these days?

253
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,955
Yeah. I know how he feels.
This bonfire thing is a disaster.

254
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,878
Oh, yeah. You and Marissa
working on the bonfire together.

255
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,235
-That's pretty cool, huh?
-Not so far.

256
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,436
I did a bunch of designs
but they all suck.

257
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,871
Yeah, well, I'm sure whatever
you come up with Marissa will love you.

258
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,312
It.

259
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,320
-There's nothing going on.
-It's none of my business.

260
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,948
Hey, you guys cool
fending for yourselves for dinner?

261
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,270
-Sure.
-Your mother's at work, and I gotta run.

262
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,034
-But I'm leaving you money for pizza.
-Thanks.

263
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,112
-You two all right?
-Yeah. Just school project.

264
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,916
-Ryan's working with Marissa.
-You and Marissa. That's nice.

265
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,593
Just like last year.

266
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,399
You and Mom have been working a lot.
Everything all right?

267
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,471
Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine.
Just busy.

268
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,558
I feel like there's maybe been some
kind of tension recently.

269
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,556
You're married to someone for 20 years,
you're bound to hit a few bumps.

270
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,711
It takes work,
but we love each other.

271
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,438
-Good.
-Okay. I'll see you.

272
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,352
-All right.
-Bye.

273
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,671
Did you hear that, Ryan?
Love takes work.

274
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,679
-You referring to me and Marissa?
-I'm staying out of that.

275
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,912
You go work on your cool bonfire.
Me and Oats are gonna order in.

276
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,034
-Hey, can I borrow Captain Oats?
-Sure.

277
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,237
But he's a poor substitute
for a broken heart.

278
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,311
Oats, if he touches you
anywhere weird...

279
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,630
...and by weird I mean....

280
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,390
I want you to neigh as loud as you can.

281
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,718
See, you're punching people.
That's very last year.

282
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,712
It's cool though.

283
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,670
-What?
-Well, it's nice to see you too, sweetie.

284
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,553
Hello. I haven't been vaccinated.
What do you want?

285
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,198
Well, I thought that we could talk
face to face.

286
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,634
-May I come in?
-No.

287
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,952
Don't you think you're taking this a
little too far? You enjoy living in squalor?

288
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,680
You and Caleb don't live here.
Can't be that disgusting.

289
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,155
-I could make you come home.
-What, call the cops?

290
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,834
-I'd tell them about you.
-I'll take your credit cards.

291
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,592
-I'll get a job.
-You? Doing what?

292
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,997
Or maybe I'll just steal.
You know I'm really good at that.

293
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,989
Marissa, come home. Please.

294
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,309
Don't throw away your future
just because you hate me.

295
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,040
We've all done things in life
that we regret, but it is never too late.

296
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,078
-The door's always open.
-Not this one.

297
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,550
Alex, hey. You're in my room.

298
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,591
Which never happened
when we were dating.

299
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,309
I hope I'm not interrupting.
You trying on new clothes or something?

300
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,278
No, actually. I'm trying on clothes
from last year.

301
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,112
Come in.

302
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,552
Hi. What's going on?

303
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,077
I know this is weird,
but I need your advice.

304
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,037
It's about Marissa.

305
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,997
Okay. Well, I'm a little fuzzy
on your guys' relationship...

306
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,436
...so perhaps you have some photos,
or a video or things you--

307
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,715
-I was just trying to be thorough.
-It's not about me and Marissa.

308
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,472
This is about Marissa and Ryan.

309
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,476
-I have a sense about them.
-Yeah, I have a lot of Penguin to try on.

310
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,232
So there is something going on.

311
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,313
If you were this sensitive and neurotic
when we dated, it might have worked.

312
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,673
I really, really have fallen hard
for this girl.

313
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,753
Please, will you tell me
if I'm fighting for a lost cause?

314
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,356
Are they just one of those couples
that will always be a couple?

315
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,431
Is this about the other night
at the mall?

316
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,758
What, no?
I know all about the mall, why?

317
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,235
Okay, so big deal.
They slept in a tent together.

318
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,752
-A lot of friends would do that.
-I'm sorry. Did you just say tent?

319
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,314
Did you think I said that? No, no. What
did you think? Did you think I said tent?

320
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,517
-No, I was saying they repented.
-Marissa forgot to mention that.

321
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,075
-lt wasn't a big deal.
-You've been very helpful.

322
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,913
I wasn't even trying to meddle.
I was saying....

323
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,119
Summer's gonna kill me.

324
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,831
-Hey.
-Hey.

325
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,316
-Come in.
-Great, thanks.

326
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,033
Sorry about the mess.
We're between maids.

327
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,838
How do you survive?

328
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,197
-So where's Alex?
-Working.

329
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,669
-Got it.
-Just us.

330
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,874
-Keep going.
-Okay.

331
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,511
Let's see.

332
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,233
-Captain Oats!
-Yeah.

333
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,868
Seth let us borrow him
for the bonfire.

334
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,555
-We're not gonna burn him, are we?
-No, no. He's our inspiration.

335
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,554
We'll build a scale model so we'll know
how much wood to use for the real thing.

336
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,517
-Oh, a Trojan horse.
-Exactly.

337
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,114
So, what do you think?

338
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,030
I think it's perfect.

339
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,312
Yeah, it's not bad.
So let's get started.

340
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,398
How are you with popsicle sticks?

341
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,872
Really good.

342
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,794
-You got a warrant?
-You're not suspicious, are you?

343
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,236
I'm Sandy Cohen.
I'm Julie Cooper's attorney.

344
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,120
-And I'm a huge fan of your work.
-You got my money?

345
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,231
I'm here to negotiate.

346
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,393
Is this gonna be a three way?
Because my rate doubles.

347
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,269
Why don't you go grab some more
smokes at the store. We got business.

348
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,312
You know the offer. Five hundred grand
makes this thing go away.

349
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,836
That's no offer. That's extortion.
She's willing to pay you $50,000...

350
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,434
...which could finance
a handful of your masterpieces.

351
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,073
You need to add another zero.

352
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,755
Otherwise, this thing is streaming live
on the lnternet in 72 hours.

353
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,793
-You really think anyone's gonna care?
-I think Julie will.

354
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,839
Enough to save her magazine.
Her marriage.

355
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,037
-Well, you'll be hearing from me.
-It's been a pleasure.

356
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,200
-This is gonna be great.
-Glad you liked it.

357
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,636
Yeah, and I'm glad Seth
suggested you for the job.

358
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,712
-Seth suggested me?
-Yeah, why?

359
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,791
Nothing.
He's kind of stuck in the past.

360
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,758
He thinks that now that he's back
with Summer that....

361
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,152
You know.

362
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,357
-Yeah. Crazy.
-Totally.

363
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,152
Yeah.

364
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,079
Good night.

365
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,195
Hey! You almost hit me.

366
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,119
-I'm sorry. I'll try again.
-What do you think you're doing?

367
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,835
Let me try to put it in a way
you'll understand. Stay away from her!

368
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,519
-There's nothing going on.
-What?

369
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,875
Studying late together,
sharing a sleeping bag.

370
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,759
-Yeah, there's nothing going on at all!
-Hey, listen to me.

371
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,277
No, you listen to me.
Don't go near my girlfriend again.

372
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,276
You understand me now?

373
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,598
Walk away.

374
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,594
I'm gone.

375
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,436
-I'm sorry I missed you last night.
-I'm sorry I missed you too.

376
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,239
-The all-consuming magazine.
-And you were...?

377
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,710
-Also at work. On a new case.
-Another Newport calamity?

378
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,112
No, this is one I've never seen before.
I hope to never see it again.

379
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,676
How about we log
a little quality time?

380
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,916
I'd love to, but I have to work.

381
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,428
-With Carter Buckley?
-Actually, without.

382
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,995
It turns out that Newport Living
wasn't for him.

383
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,714
When he didn't show up for work,
I went by his place...

384
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,555
...and I found him drowning
in self-pity and tequila.

385
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,950
Couple of weeks in Newport,
his spirit's crushed.

386
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,758
I'd never have thought
that possible.

387
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,478
He built a whole magazine...

388
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,393
...around people who fought the system,
no matter the cost.

389
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,596
The guy was an inspiration to me.

390
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,592
You know that magazine
of his that you loved in college?

391
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,230
-Do you happen to have a copy?
-Revolution? Yeah, I probably do.

392
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,198
It's probably in the office
or maybe the garage.

393
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,276
Hey, man.
How'd it go last night with Marissa?

394
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,671
-Things with Marissa went great.
-Good.

395
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,992
Things with Alex, not so much.

396
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,710
-Alex was there?
-Yeah. She threw a beer can at my head.

397
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,519
-What?
-And shoved me a couple times. Yeah.

398
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,992
-Pretty hard actually.
-That is one angry lesbian.

399
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,514
Okay, here's the thing.

400
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,269
I may have accidentally let a little
something slip about, you know....

401
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,754
-A tent?
-No, I didn't.

402
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,592
Yeah, okay, maybe.
Yes, I did.

403
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,196
Why is she's making such a big deal?
There's something dirty about camping?

404
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,470
And before Alex and l
had our friendly chat...

405
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,234
...Marissa mentioned it was your idea
we work together.

406
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,039
I mentioned it,
but I shouldn't hog all the credit.

407
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,832
Stay out of it!

408
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,718
Just because you're
back with Summer--

409
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,996
I know.

410
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,150
You were just a lot happier
back then so....

411
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,920
-Well, that was then.
-All right.

412
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,876
You have one new message.

413
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,791
Hey, I'm not gonna be able
to make it tonight.

414
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,476
But the wood's ordered, and you have
the plans, so everything should be fine.

415
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,119
Have fun.

416
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,113
Who was that?

417
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,194
My mom. More empty threats.

418
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,271
You were asleep last night
when I got home.

419
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,516
Yeah. Yeah, I was really tired.

420
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,109
You should try sleeping in a tent.
With Ryan.

421
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,357
But you already did that.

422
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,515
Look, I'm sorry.
I was going to tell you that.

423
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,750
It's just,
I didn't wanna make it a big deal.

424
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,111
-But it wasn't, until you lied.
-I didn't lie.

425
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,271
-I just--
-Lied?

426
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,833
No big deal.

427
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,437
Please tell me
you have some good news.

428
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,191
Well, unfortunately, Lance is as sleazy
as he looks, but not as dumb.

429
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,510
He owns the rights
to the movie in perpetuity.

430
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,911
And you were a consenting adult,
so if he wants to make money off it...

431
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,274
...it's his prerogative.

432
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,590
Sandy, there's gotta be some way
to stop him.

433
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,194
We could charge him with extortion,
get an injunction.

434
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,794
-But that would involve the authorities--
-No!

435
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,238
Even if I paid him off, there's nothing
to stop him from leaking it anyway.

436
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,038
Look, I'll figure something out.

437
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,430
You worry about Marissa,
I'll handle the rest.

438
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,875
I can worry all I want,
it doesn't seem to help.

439
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,679
Why is the one person who knows
best for their child...

440
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,149
...the last person that
child wants to hear from?

441
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,709
We had a similar situation
with Seth last summer.

442
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,716
All I can say is that sometimes
it's not the message...

443
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,598
...it's the messenger.

444
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,994
I don't know, Coop.
It sounds like a pretty bad fight.

445
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,879
-Maybe you should just move home.
-I can't.

446
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,873
Because you love Alex,
and wherever she is, that's your home?

447
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,600
Because it would make my mom
too happy.

448
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,238
What was I thinking?

449
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,876
Well, if you can't go to the bonfire
with Ryan...

450
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,553
...then go home to Alex.

451
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,439
You can't ride two horses
with one ass.

452
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,837
It's a proverb.

453
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,668
Okay, well, Ryan's not going
to the bonfire.

454
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,632
Why? I thought it was like his idea.

455
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,274
He didn't say, but I know
it's because of Alex.

456
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,431
I'm confused.
I thought Alex wasn't going.

457
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,794
She's not.

458
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,077
But Ryan and I were working late
at the apartment the other night...

459
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,834
...and somehow she found out
about the mall and the tent.

460
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,909
-Well, I hadn't exactly told her about it.
-lf you didn't tell her then who did?

461
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,669
I am going to kick his ass
back to last year!

462
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,354
Hello. Summer? Whose ass?

463
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,354
Not now, Seth. I'm busy.

464
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:22,789
Hi. Sorry to interrupt you doing whatever
it is you were doing. Brooding, is it?

465
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,396
Yeah. Right now I'm in the middle of
a major session, so if you could....

466
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,518
-What's going on?
-Well, actually...

467
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,114
...I'm glad I caught you
before you go to the bonfire.

468
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,635
-I'm not going to the bonfire.
-But you have to.

469
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,678
-You and Seth on the same team now?
-No, I'm on my own mission.

470
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,195
I need help. With Marissa.

471
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,749
For whatever reason
that I don't quite understand...

472
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,396
...she listens to you.

473
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,075
-She needs help.
-Maybe she's happy where she is.

474
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,475
Do you think that Marissa
knows what she wants?

475
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,673
She is in so far over her head
with this relationship.

476
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,956
She's skipping school,
staying out all hours...

477
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,759
...risking everything important to her
to prove a point.

478
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,559
Okay. So, what do you want me
to do about it?

479
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,591
I know that she wants to come home.

480
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,751
If she does it for me,
she's letting me win.

481
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,239
But if she does it for you--

482
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,631
No, I'm not getting into the middle
of Marissa's life. Not again.

483
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,110
-Especially her relationship with Alex.
-This is not about Alex.

484
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,872
It's about Marissa and her future.

485
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,838
Which we can both see
is slipping away from her.

486
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,594
Ryan, please. Help me.

487
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,432
Convince her to come home.

488
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,916
You know that's what's for the best.

489
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,840
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Looking for Marissa.

490
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,513
This is you staying away?

491
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,954
I'm here because of her mom.

492
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,237
-You and Julie Cooper a team now?
-Yeah. Where is she?

493
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,992
She's at her little bonfire.

494
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,554
-All right.
-No, no.

495
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,877
You remember what I told you last night.
You stay away from her.

496
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,399
-Or what?
-You wanna find out?

497
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,273
-Sure.
-You go down there, it's on.

498
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,355
Great. You know, this sort of thing
used to be my specialty.

499
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,948
Oh, a little word of advice.

500
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,317
You gotta work this hard,
it's not working.

501
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,189
Is this board for the hind legs
or the front? It's just labeled leg.

502
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,828
-Front, I think.
-Right or left?

503
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,639
Guess. The odds are fifty-fifty.

504
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,238
Marissa, the horse's head
seems to only fit the hindquarters.

505
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,231
What do we do?
We're running out of time.

506
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,469
I don't know, okay?

507
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,797
I picked the font for the banner.
I color-coordinated the balloons.

508
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,758
-This is not my area of expertise.
-Maybe I can help.

509
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,110
Hey, I thought you weren't coming.

510
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,794
Captain Oats was concerned
that he be well represented.

511
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,349
He's very self-conscious.
He is Seth's horse.

512
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,353
-So are you gonna stick it out?
-Yeah. If I'm needed.

513
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,792
Oh, yeah. Hang on.
Hey, everybody! This is Ryan.

514
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,514
He's gonna answer any and all
of your questions.

515
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,559
Okay, great.

516
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,269
That's a good question.

517
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,354
All right! Great.

518
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,557
That horse is gonna have its head
up its ass if we're not careful.

519
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,990
We need to rotate the neck
to the other side.

520
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,798
You guys in back take care of that.

521
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,714
I need you ladies right over there
to hoe that area. Hoe that thing down.

522
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,474
We need to set
the tiki torches over here.

523
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,671
Hey, you with the gasoline.

524
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,559
Away from the fire.
What are you doing, man?

525
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,278
All right. The sun's gonna be down
in an about hour.

526
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,079
We can make this happen,
okay, people! Let's go! Let's go!

527
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,755
Well, that was a dirty trick.

528
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,034
-Haunting me with my past.
-I was trying to inspire you.

529
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,716
You know, looking this thing over,
it feels like a lifetime ago.

530
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,678
What was I thinking making a magazine
all about losers?

531
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,950
At least they were lovable ones.

532
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,068
Where'd you find this?

533
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,639
A crusading idealist...

534
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,395
...who remembers every word
of that magazine like it was yesterday.

535
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,477
My husband.

536
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,350
Well, I'll have to meet him.

537
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,759
So, what do you think? You in?

538
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,190
You say subversive and irreverent,
I say Julie Cooper-Nichol.

539
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,476
-Where does that leave us?
-Pretty much lost.

540
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,512
That's pretty much
my favorite place to start.

541
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,070
I've got an idea.
Okay, it's not really my idea....

542
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,277
Summer. Hey, how are you?

543
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,637
I hope you have Motrin in the house
because you're about to feel pain.

544
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,199
I wanted everyone to be happy.

545
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,430
Well, nice going.
Now everybody is miserable.

546
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,875
You need to start apologizing,
starting with Ryan.

547
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,917
-Okay!
-Go!

548
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,991
Ryan? You around?
I'm here to apologize.

549
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,230
-He's not here.
-Yeah, I know. I can see that.

550
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,313
-Well, where is he?
-You think he went to the bonfire?

551
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,075
If so, we have a four-alarm emergency
on our hands. Break out your hose.

552
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,113
-It's a metaphor.
-I know.

553
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,317
-You got me my money?
-I got this.

554
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,353
Starting your own film company?

555
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,080
What better star to hitch my wagon to
than Julie Cooper?

556
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,355
You're buying the film?

557
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,030
The master, the film, and the negatives.
We're gonna meet your offer.

558
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,269
-A hundred bucks?
-Consider it a good-faith deposit.

559
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,714
I need two weeks.

560
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,474
I sign this, I get half a mil
in two weeks?

561
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,755
That's right.

562
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,799
So you know, if one frame of this
leaks onto the lnternet--

563
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,713
I'm not saying that'd happen,
you seem like a stand-up guy.

564
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,155
--we're coming after you
for 1 0 times the amount.

565
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,754
It's called copyright infringement
and piracy.

566
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,559
And you could go to jail.

567
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,269
Hello?

568
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,431
Some good news
and some not-so-good news.

569
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,828
Good news first, always.

570
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,315
You don't have to worry
about the movie surfacing.

571
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,516
As long as we pay him,
which is the bad news.

572
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,477
And where am I gonna
get this money?

573
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,353
You have to talk to Caleb.
Hopefully, he'll understand.

574
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,109
Yeah, sure he will.
I am so screwed.

575
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,637
I know. I saw the footage.

576
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,951
This is going great.

577
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,992
Not for long.

578
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,550
Hey, what are you doing here?

579
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,755
-Are these your friends?
-Yeah. They're here to see Ryan.

580
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,437
-You gotta be kidding me.
-Why? You think this is funny?

581
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,828
Hey, guys. Stop it.

582
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,231
Guys, seriously, stop it, okay!
Cut it out!

583
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,635
No, not you guys. You guys are great.
Go Harbor!

584
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,833
This is between you and me.

585
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,235
-Fine, then let's talk, you and me.
-Fine.

586
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,473
I like the wrist cuff.

587
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,156
You wanna tell me
what the hell is going on?

588
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,912
-I just wanna talk.
-You wanna talk?

589
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,117
Tell me why you brought two skeezy
ex-cons to my school bonfire.

590
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,558
I am sorry I interrupted your bonfire!
It just seems like that's all you do lately.

591
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,950
I didn't realize moving in
meant giving up my life.

592
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,795
I didn't ask you to give up your life!
All I ever wanted was to be a part of it!

593
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,475
This is my life, okay!

594
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,313
That's it! So, what do you think?

595
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,232
I think...

596
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,830
...this is your life, and I don't fit in.

597
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,400
Pep rallies, cheerleaders.

598
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,233
-Boys.
-Nothing happened with Ryan.

599
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,437
Yeah, not yet. But what do you give it?
A week, a month?

600
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,795
I really wanted this to work
between us.

601
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,559
Look, I'm sorry if I hurt you.

602
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,030
I'm sorry that I brought
two skeezy ex-cons to your bonfire.

603
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,631
Actually, only one of them
ever really served time but....

604
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,599
So, what happens now?

605
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,870
Who knows?

606
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,593
I think I might go back home...

607
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,959
...save some money,
go back to school.

608
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,469
It actually looks kind of fun.

609
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,037
Yeah, from really far away.

610
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,633
Come on.

611
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,551
You're gonna miss
the human pyramid.

612
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,829
Okay.

613
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,278
Pretty good, huh?

614
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,593
Not into the school-spirit thing.
That's cool.

615
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,358
I'm sorry.

616
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,436
-lt wasn't about you.
-I know. That's okay.

617
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,278
You okay?

618
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,432
Yeah.

619
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,592
Now all that's left
is lighting the bonfire.

620
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,154
-I don't hear any screaming.
-I don't see any ambulances.

621
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,718
-Maybe we're here just in time.
-Or maybe someone was right all along.

622
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,793
Thanks.

623
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,954
You know what, this honor's yours.

624
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,077
We built it together.
Let's burn it together.

625
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,719
Hey, I think Captain Oats
would be very proud...

626
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,474
...or deeply disturbed by this visual.

627
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,319
-You guys, it's so good.
-Thanks, Seth, for making it all happen.

628
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,193
Oh, you see that?
They're thanking me.

629
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,238
-That's nice.
-So, what are you guys gonna do now?

630
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,191
Feel like going home?
