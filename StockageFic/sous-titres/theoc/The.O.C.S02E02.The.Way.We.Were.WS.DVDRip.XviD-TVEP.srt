1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,277
-Previously on The O. C.:
-He's totally checking you out.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,995
It's the first time since Julie left me
I don't feel completely alone.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,718
DA comes
to see me at the beginning of summer...

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,077
...tells me the sky is falling,
and he hasn't done a damn thing since.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,834
You're not charging that
on the company card, are you?

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,313
Acknowledge me now
or lose me forever.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,038
I can't believe this.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,156
-So you and Summer....
-Not so good, actually.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,912
She'll probably
never speak to me again.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,196
-Do you guys still talk?
-Not really. We used to...

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,039
...but it just sort of
made everything harder.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,716
-We can not go.
-We can't not go.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,792
We can so not go. We missed
registration. No one's expecting us.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,468
-Your mom called the school.
-Did my mom call the--?

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,437
You're the bad boy.
You're the outsider.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,636
Lead me into temptation,
not homeroom.

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,392
It's just the first day of school.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,632
Exactly. An entire day
of Ashton Kutchers knuckle-knocking...

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,950
...and going on and on about summer.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,670
Their summer, not my....

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,075
You know, the season, not the person.

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,438
-At this point, how would I even know?
-You haven't called her?

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,269
Remind me to explain the difference
between Plastic Man and Elongated Man.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,710
-That's a no?
-When did I have time to call?

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,111
I just got back. I have three months
of back issues to bag and board.

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,272
And on top of that, apparently,
I have to go to school.

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,029
-Could've called her from Portland.
-I did, every day. I got her voicemail.

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,988
Until she picked up, and said if I ever
call again, her dad will have me killed.

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,397
-So Summer has no idea you're back.
-Killed, Ryan, as in dead.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,319
Well, that was months ago.
She's probably moved on by now.

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,512
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,352
Moved on?

33
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,839
Gotten over it.

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,470
Gotten over it? Why?

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,870
Because I just--?
I meant nothing to her?

36
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,469
I'm gonna brood silently, over here.

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,511
-She's gonna have me killed.
-She's not.

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,955
You're right. She'll ignore me.
That's worse.

39
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,912
So? She's been ignoring you for years.

40
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,838
That was before I was not ignored.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,036
Why should I have to go back to that?
Why?

42
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,634
Because you left for three months
without telling her.

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,313
-So it's my fault?
-You left.

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,238
-Because of you.
-So it's my fault?

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,034
You think she'll buy that?

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,470
-Just talk to her.
-And say what exactly?

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,110
-I don't know. "I'm sorry," maybe?
-Really. "I'm sorry. "

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,074
Is that what you said to Marissa?

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,596
No, but I'm going to.

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,113
Oh. Okay, then.

51
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,596
So it turns out, what do you know,
I'm not the only coward in the room.

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,189
No, I'm just gonna see her at school.
I know that.

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,709
You're gonna walk up to her
in front of everyone...

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,111
...and be all, "Hey,"
and hope she "Heys" you back?

55
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,197
Yeah, we're not going to school.

56
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,590
Okay, listen,
whatever happens today at school...

57
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,877
...the important thing is that
the Ryan-Seth team's back in action.

58
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,598
Together, we can face anything.

59
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,750
I'm moving to Portland.

60
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,798
-Good morning, men. Sleep well?
-No.

61
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,871
-Ready for your first day of school?
-No.

62
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,792
-There's bagels.
-Coffee.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,639
-I'd love some, thanks.
-And then there's Archie.

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,149
Will you explain to me
this remodeling thing again?

65
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,469
Your mother got bored.

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,713
Your father complained about having
no place for his surfing memorabilia.

67
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,791
Oh. So it is my fault.

68
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,840
-We'll finish the kitchen today.
-The rest of the house?

69
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,759
-ls that the phone?
-Sandy.

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,559
-Honey, I'm mid-schmeer.
-I am late for work.

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,558
Well, if I could find it,
maybe I'd answer it.

72
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,311
Hello?

73
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,478
Hello?

74
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,676
-Hung up.
-I hate when they do that.

75
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,231
I called the school,
so you're registered.

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,356
You just have to go by the office.

77
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,988
-Your dad will go with you just in case.
-All right.

78
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,478
I thought you were gonna take them.

79
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,835
-I have a meeting.
-I have a meeting.

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,508
If it's too much trouble,
maybe we should stay home.

81
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,116
I have to go.

82
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,872
-Hello?
-I'm really glad that you guys are home.

83
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,349
-Maybe we should raise our allowances?
-He's where?

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,071
You don't know?

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,913
It's the office.
All right, I'll find him. Thank you.

86
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,313
-I have to go.
-I have to go.

87
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
You want me to take them?

88
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,796
Not an auspicious way
to start the school year.

89
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,269
Thanks, Archie. Don't worry.
I'm sure nobody saw.

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,598
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

91
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,473
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God. Ryan!

92
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,435
-Hey!
-Hey.

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,151
-All right, wish me luck.
-Yeah.

94
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,191
-Summer.
-What are you doing here?

95
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,035
I'm back. I'm back at the Cohens',
back at Harbor. I'm.... I'm back.

96
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,551
But how?
I mean, what about Theresa?

97
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,273
It's kind of a long story.

98
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,757
I wanna hear it
if you wanna tell me.

99
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,598
Yeah, sure. After school?

100
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,031
After school. It's a date.

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,118
Summer!

102
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,470
-Aren't you even going to talk to me?
-Nope.

103
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,712
Sorry. Maybe I'll write a letter.
You can read it over and over...

104
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,394
...trying to figure out
what I was thinking all summer.

105
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,438
-Wait a second.
-I am done waiting for you, Cohen.

106
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,519
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go meet my boyfriend.

107
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,276
Boyfriend?

108
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,790
I can't believe this is happening.

109
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,428
Well, how much are they offering?

110
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,235
Wow. So when do we
have to be there?

111
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,194
I can't. It's too soon.

112
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,033
I still haven't told Jimmy yet.

113
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,076
-Because I don't wanna hurt him.
-Hey.

114
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,475
There you are, to be sure.

115
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,278
Jimmy's up. I gotta go.

116
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,237
I will, I promise. Bye.

117
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,753
-Susie says hi.
-Susie...

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,150
-...calls too early.
-It's almost 9.

119
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,276
Whoa. Time for a mimosa.

120
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,597
Are you trying to get me drunk?

121
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,115
I am trying to keep you drunk.

122
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,359
Last night was pretty awesome.

123
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,796
The whole summer's been awesome.

124
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,520
The beach, the yacht, you.

125
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,199
No, you.

126
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,632
You're the one.

127
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,552
Listen, I've got a really good idea...

128
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,598
...and I want you to
really concentrate on it, okay?

129
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,310
We should keep the boat
for another month...

130
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,034
...and we go down to Cabo.

131
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,309
-Jimmy, we can't.
-Why can't we?

132
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,314
Come on, it's not like either of us
have jobs that we have to go back to.

133
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,395
Come on, look,
I'll manage my portfolio online...

134
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,189
...and, you know, this way
the summer never has to end.

135
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,876
-You know? Right? Am I right?
-Right.

136
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,837
-Right?
-Right, right.

137
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,190
I put this schedule together for you,
which you'll probably hate...

138
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,157
-...which is fine.
-I'm sure it's okay.

139
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,510
I based it on the schedule
from last year.

140
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,877
-Nice GPA, by the way.
-Really? Thanks.

141
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,709
So is there anything missing?

142
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,638
Favorite subject? Favorite teacher?

143
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,950
Electives? Anything?

144
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,994
Honestly, l' m just happy not to be
working construction right now, so....

145
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,590
You know, Ryan, it's not too early
to start thinking about colleges.

146
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,949
Thanks, but I can't afford college,
and I won't let the Cohens pay for it.

147
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,556
Ryan, you have great test scores...

148
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,070
...a solid GPA, and if you work
your ass off when you get out of here...

149
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,231
...you can do whatever you want.

150
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,229
The question is, what do you want?

151
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,673
How do you mean?

152
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,957
Well, what do you like?

153
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,509
What are you interested in?

154
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,396
I don't know.

155
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,352
Seriously, I don't know.

156
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,391
Okay.

157
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,071
I have an assignment for you.

158
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,477
Go to your classes and write down
everything you like about them...

159
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,315
...and everything you don't like,
and most importantly, why.

160
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,432
T omorrow, we'll go over it
and make sure you get what you want.

161
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,553
-I'm sure this schedule is fine, really.
-You'll find out and let me know.

162
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,558
-All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
-Yep.

163
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,032
Love letter to Marissa?

164
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,430
No, no. It's....

165
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,636
Did Miss Fisher
give you an assignment?

166
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,549
No, but I didn't get a warm cinematic
hug from anyone when I got here either.

167
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,035
-Cute. Did you guys talk?
-Yeah, we sure did.

168
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,111
Long enough
to hear she has a boyfriend.

169
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,148
-Buddy, I'm sorry.
-It's all right, man. You know why?

170
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,959
I had a whole life at this school
before Summer.

171
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,912
-Sure.
-An outcast's life, maybe...

172
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,878
...but I was a vital part
of the Harbor club scene.

173
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,838
-There's a Harbor club scene?
-Sure.

174
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,918
Sailing Club, Film Club,
and, wait for it...

175
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,237
...wait for it.

176
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,789
The Comic Book Club.
Check it out. Huh?

177
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,830
-Who's this guy?
-That's me with powers.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,274
The power to be handsome.

179
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,908
This may have something to do
with the outcast thing.

180
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,430
No, it doesn't. Listen, Spider-Man 2?
You know how much money that made?

181
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,318
We're not outcasts anymore, okay?

182
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,152
We' re edgy. We're like trailblazers.

183
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,592
-We?
-Yeah, dude, listen.

184
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,877
Miss Fisher says get involved?
Well, I need you to get involved.

185
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,674
Get involved. Get onboard.
You, me, Comic Book Club...

186
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,354
...and hopefully others.
I need you to pass those out.

187
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,513
Hey, guys.
Comic Book League. Check it out.

188
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,154
We're gonna get into the issues.
Stuff that matters.

189
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,834
T oday's topic,
"Capes: Fey or Kind of Cool? "

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,672
Ryan, you better pass those out.

191
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,758
Thanks for the ride to my car.

192
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,678
Anything to get away from Cohen.

193
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,351
Do you wanna go get lunch after this?

194
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,431
I should probably
get back to school.

195
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,874
Back to Ryan, you mean?

196
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,432
So tell me, is he taking you
to the Kickoff Carnival?

197
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,875
You gonna go for another spin
on the Ferris wheel?

198
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,158
-He said we'd talk after school.
-About getting back together?

199
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,880
No. I don't know.
Would that be so bad?

200
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,514
No, I mean.... Well, it's just....

201
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,997
Him and Cohen can't think
they can walk in and out of our lives...

202
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,998
...whenever they want, you know?
I-- Whose truck is that?

203
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,314
The yard guy's,
and he's blocking my car again.

204
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,114
-Hey, hey!
-Hey, DJ, you're blocking my car!

205
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,238
Do not honk at DJ. He's hot.

206
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,235
He's the yard guy.

207
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,550
He can park his truck
in my driveway anytime.

208
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,956
I'll see you back at school.

209
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,149
-What are you doing in here?
-I work here.

210
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,318
I have to go.

211
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,551
So go.

212
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,351
Will I still see you today after school?

213
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,114
I.... I can't. I'm sorry.

214
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,032
-It's just--
-It's okay.

215
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,077
Don't worry.

216
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,313
I may still be here when you get back.

217
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,873
Hey.

218
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,156
-What are we drinking?
-Sum, wait.

219
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,115
What are you drinking?
Did you spike your latte?

220
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,960
-It's been a weird day.
-Marissa, we're at school.

221
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,559
Yeah. Exactly.

222
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,868
What is going on with you?

223
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,109
-Did something happen with Ryan?
-What am I supposed to say to him?

224
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,352
About?

225
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,590
About DJ.

226
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,358
DJ? Who in the hell is--?

227
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,272
Oh, my God, the yard guy?

228
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,913
-Yeah, I know.
-Marissa!

229
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,913
-Since when?
-Since-- I don't know. All summer?

230
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,439
And you didn't tell me?

231
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,155
Summer, I couldn't tell anyone.
No one can find out about this.

232
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,679
Okay.

233
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,398
God, that is so hot.

234
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,318
No, it's not, believe me.

235
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,112
Really? But he's so ripped.

236
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,992
No, he's great, it's just....

237
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,870
He's the yard guy.

238
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,478
Now Ryan's back,
and I don't know what to do.

239
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,710
Well, just explain it to him.
He left...

240
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,278
...and suddenly, there was a hot, hot
yard guy in the yard, who was hot.

241
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,998
You didn't do anything wrong.

242
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,714
If I didn't do anything wrong,
why should I tell him?

243
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,715
Well, if it really is over with DJ,
then I guess you don't.

244
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,197
Let's go get you some coffee
with actual coffee in it.

245
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,349
-Two coffees, please. Black.
-Yes, sir.

246
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,999
You're gonna lose that hand.

247
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,549
Since when is Scotch
part of your nutritious brunch?

248
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,157
Since the DA's office finally decided
they had enough to indict me.

249
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,956
So, what did they decide
to charge you with?

250
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,199
Bribing certain city officials
to obtain building permits.

251
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,913
That's a new one.

252
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,389
-ls there any truth in it?
-Please.

253
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,028
Why I would I need to bribe anyone?

254
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,636
-I own this town.
-Sure you do. You bought it.

255
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,435
All right, I admit that I have done
some things that I'm not too proud of...

256
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,592
...but I did not do
what they are accusing me of.

257
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,472
Well, then, they'll have no case.

258
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,350
What they do have, however,
are documents.

259
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,318
Bank statements showing
large sums of money transferred...

260
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,278
...from the Newport Group
to the city councilmen's office.

261
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,709
Well, how is that possible?

262
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,395
I don't know.

263
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,190
Will you help me?

264
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,839
How?

265
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,029
I was hoping you could tell me that.

266
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,275
-Hey.
-Okay. Sorry I'm late.

267
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,079
No, no. You're right on time.
We're just getting started.

268
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,794
Ryan, would you please
take the minutes?

269
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,315
-Seth, it's just us.
-Yeah. Write that down.

270
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,748
I now call to order this year's first Harbor
School Comic Book League meeting.

271
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,956
Members include Seth Cohen.

272
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,152
Present. Ryan Atwood.

273
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,318
-Seth, if it's just--
-Ryan Atwood?

274
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,154
Present. If it's just you and me,
can we do this at home?

275
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,033
-There'd be no yearbook picture.
-Maybe not a bad thing.

276
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,834
Maybe you couldn't undermine me
in front of the League?

277
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,197
Hey, I'm here for
the Comic Book Club.

278
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,112
-You are?
-You are?

279
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,508
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

280
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,951
Because you're on
the water polo team?

281
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,071
What's that supposed to mean?

282
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,432
Okay.

283
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,717
You wanna talk comics?
Let's talk comics.

284
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,269
-What day do new comics come out?
-Wednesday.

285
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,873
-Wonder Woman's secret identity?
-Doesn't have one.

286
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,758
True, which I think is a mistake.

287
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,798
-I know. Me too.
-Who's your favorite superhero?

288
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,673
Depends who's writing him,
but I'd have to say Superman.

289
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,877
Superman. This guy.
He's too perfect, guy.

290
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,310
No. He seems perfect, but he's not.

291
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,031
I mean, if you think about it,
he's actually kind of messed-up.

292
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,550
He lost his parents, lost his whole
planet. He's, like, totally alone.

293
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,399
He could take over the world
if he wanted, but he doesn't.

294
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,835
He just keeps helping people.
Why do that?

295
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,312
Unless he was trying
to make a connection.

296
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,040
Trying to, like, find his way home.

297
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,352
-Who's your favorite writer?
-Bendis.

298
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,875
-Well, hot damn, welcome to the club.
-Thanks.

299
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,998
This is gonna be good.
Today's topics, we have some. The Hulk.

300
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,879
He gets bigger,
all his clothes rip off except...

301
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,951
...his pants. Why is that?

302
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,752
-We'll meet every Wednesday.
-Yes.

303
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,797
Hit the comic store
and then hang out.

304
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,552
-Awesome. I'm psyched.
-Great.

305
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,957
-I'll hit you those Green Lantern jpegs.
-Yeah, definitely do that.

306
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,391
Dude, I love that guy.

307
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,591
Whoa. You're not the only one.

308
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,519
No, she cannot be dating him.

309
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,955
That's not even possible.
How is that possible?

310
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,833
-A second ago, you wanted to date him.
-Because he's me.

311
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,675
See what she's doing? She's dating
the WASP version of me. It's so stupid.

312
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,070
-What, you think Zach--?
-Yeah, I do. Look at him.

313
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,869
He's like, what, the conventionally
attractive, athletic, confident...

314
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,278
...just, completely non-neurotic...

315
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,635
...WASP version of me.

316
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,030
So there it is. The haunted mansion.

317
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,510
Damn. I am definitely
not in Chino anymore.

318
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,919
So have you talked to Theresa at all
since you--?

319
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,719
Since we lost the baby? No, no.

320
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,272
But we didn't really talk a whole lot
while I was there either.

321
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,715
So you weren't really a couple?

322
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,758
-I mean, you never--?
-No. No.

323
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,994
It wasn't really like that at all.

324
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,028
So, what about you?

325
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,112
You dating anybody?

326
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,989
No. I'm not dating anybody.

327
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,757
Okay, so, if you're not
dating anyone...

328
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,037
...maybe you'd wanna go to
the Kickoff Carnival with me tomorrow?

329
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,711
I don't know.
Can we go on the Ferris wheel?

330
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,950
My last boyfriend
was afraid of heights.

331
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,680
Poor guy.
He didn't know what he was missing.

332
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,194
Come on. I can't wait
for you to see the house...

333
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,999
...and the look on my mom's face
when she sees you in it.

334
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,429
-You got a job?
-No, it's not just a job.

335
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,794
It's a whole new career.

336
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,552
-ln fashion.
-Hailey.

337
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,916
-ln sales.
-Hailey.

338
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,792
-ln Japan.
-Oy!

339
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,758
-How's Jimmy doing with that?
-He's great.

340
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,512
-He doesn't know.
-Hailey....

341
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,071
I tried to tell him, but he just seems
so happy all the time.

342
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,114
He's making so much on the market,
all he wants to do...

343
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,436
...is drink and sail and go to Cabo.

344
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,232
You poor thing.

345
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,072
I'm too young for early retirement.

346
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,317
-You're too old for running away.
-I'm not running this time.

347
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,194
I have a shot
to make a real future out of this.

348
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,550
Jimmy just seems kind of...

349
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,472
...stuck.

350
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,914
He loves you.

351
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,956
-I love him too.
-Then you have to tell him.

352
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,314
-I can walk on my own, you know.
-Yeah, when you're not drunk.

353
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,516
-I'm not.
-Oh, no, you're all right.

354
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,750
-You're fine.
-Oh, my God, Cal?

355
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,515
I spoke too soon.

356
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,950
What's the matter with him?
Is he all right?

357
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,314
Did he have a stroke?

358
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,836
I'm fine.

359
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,394
-He had a bottle of Scotch.
-You got him drunk?

360
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,596
No, I took him to lunch
to get him sober.

361
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,320
I am not drunk.

362
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,470
Somebody tell me what's going on.

363
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,198
-Cal?
-I'm going to bed.

364
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,989
The pleasure is all yours, Sanford.
Enjoy.

365
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,355
-You may wanna sit down.
-You may wanna just tell me.

366
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,230
Caleb is gonna be indicted.
I don't know when...

367
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,352
...but the DA's office
has been investigating him for....

368
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,158
For a while now.

369
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,471
For how long?

370
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,953
How long have they been
investigating him, Sandy?

371
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,915
Since before the wedding?

372
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,392
Son of a bitch.

373
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,398
Well, you know,
he didn't wanna worry you.

374
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,829
Is he going to jail?

375
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,709
They're accusing him of bribing city
officials, and apparently they have proof.

376
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,513
-I wish there was something I could do.
-No, you don't.

377
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,193
You despise him. You despise me.

378
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,591
You'd love nothing more than to see us
get exactly what we deserve.

379
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,037
-No. Julie, no.
-Let me tell you something.

380
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,708
If Caleb's going down,
Kirsten's going with him.

381
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,677
So you better come up
with something...

382
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,991
...or it won't be just my kids
who lose everything.

383
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,312
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go take care of my husband.

384
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,553
-Hey. How's it going?
-Let me help you with that.

385
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,233
How was your first day at school?

386
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,391
It was all right, actually.

387
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,233
How'd it go with Miss Fisher?
Is that your assignment?

388
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,311
-She told you about that?
-Y eah.

389
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,631
She called to tell me
she wants us all to sit down...

390
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,836
...and start talking about
colleges for you.

391
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,389
-That's fantastic--
-Where the hell are you going?

392
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,632
-You're paying me to work, aren't you?
-I thought I was.

393
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,438
-Ryan, did you tell her?
-No, but--

394
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,239
Ryan figured out why there's no wall
in our family room.

395
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,675
-There's no wall--
-He misread the blueprints...

396
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,673
...and ordered the wrong I Beam,
hoping we wouldn't notice...

397
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,400
...while he bills us
for the time it'll take to replace.

398
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,989
-We're doing other things.
-Yeah, eating our bagels.

399
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,634
Taking your kids to school.
I ordered the right beam.

400
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,910
-The wrong one got delivered.
-I get that...

401
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,758
...but can I ask you something?

402
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,918
If you just moved the new wall
out about 1 0 inches...

403
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,275
...couldn't you just use
the I Beam you've got?

404
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,715
-You an architect?
-No, I worked construction--

405
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,878
-Don't tell me how to do my job.
-Don't talk to him like that.

406
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,392
There are still couches in my kitchen.
What, looking for another free meal?

407
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,158
Want us gone? We're gone.

408
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,550
Get your little construction worker
to finish up.

409
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,116
-Archie, don't go. Please.
-No, no, no. Thanks for the coffee.

410
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,074
Sandy, apologize.

411
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,632
I have nothing to apologize to him for.
Nothing.

412
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,792
And I am sick of putting myself
on the line for this family...

413
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,234
...and getting nothing.

414
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,960
If you wanna apologize, apologize.

415
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,639
I'm done.

416
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,550
I'll call Archie and apologize.

417
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,153
No.

418
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,988
You're right.
He should have told us about the beams.

419
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,672
I'll call a new contractor
in the morning.

420
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,314
I know I wasn't the easiest person
to live with this summer.

421
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,310
I was just really upset
about the boys being gone...

422
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,831
...and I took it out on you.

423
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,716
I'm sorry.

424
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,798
You know...

425
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,311
...what I said in there...

426
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,040
-...it wasn't about you.
-Thank God.

427
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,636
-Because you were scary.
-Really? I was scary?

428
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,518
Yeah.

429
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,793
I've never seen you go off on anyone
like that except for my dad, and....

430
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,115
Oh, no. What did he do now?

431
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,231
-Hey.
-Hey.

432
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,113
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm just tired.

433
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,793
You missed all the drama.

434
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,793
It's all right.
I think I got my quota for the day.

435
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,278
How'd it go with you and Marissa?

436
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,238
She's gonna go to the carnival with me.
You wanna come with?

437
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,918
Hang out with you and Marissa
and Summer and Zach?

438
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,992
Is that how it's gonna be
from now on?

439
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,076
-Probably. I don't know.
-Great. I can't hang out with you again.

440
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,719
Doesn't mean we can't be friends.

441
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,111
You really think Summer will wanna
be friends with me after what I did?

442
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,669
Especially now she has Zach?
The guy's like Superman.

443
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,075
-He's not Superman.
-He's like a thoroughbred.

444
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,231
I'm a monkey, with cymbals.

445
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,716
So, what are you gonna do?
Spend a whole year with Captain Oats?

446
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,108
Not like I have a choice.

447
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,869
Of course you do. Just call her.
Look, be her friend.

448
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,156
I can't, man. It's too late.

449
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,392
She's not gonna wanna hear
anything I have to say.

450
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,359
Okay. So, what happened was...

451
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,273
...Susie and l
were roommates in Santa Cruz...

452
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,558
...until we dropped out of college
to start our own fashion line.

453
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,233
You had your own fashion line?

454
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,318
No, because we took all
my dad's money, moved to Paris...

455
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,277
...and partied till I had to move back.

456
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,637
Now, that is the American dream.

457
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,392
But Susie stayed in Paris.

458
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,788
She got a job at Chanel...

459
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,032
...and just sold her first collection
to a company in Japan.

460
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,633
Here's to Susie.

461
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,396
To Susie, who asked me to be
her sales rep and move to Japan.

462
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,318
More wine?

463
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,119
She asked you to move to Japan?

464
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,158
-I know, right?
-So...

465
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,555
...what did you say?

466
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,231
I said I'd talk to you about it.

467
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,835
You're asking me to move to Japan?

468
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,672
No.

469
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,838
You've got your kids.
You have a whole life here...

470
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,679
...and being with you has
made me realize I want all that.

471
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,515
I want a job. I want a future.
I don't wanna run away anymore.

472
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,676
Then don't.
You can have all that here.

473
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,393
I can't. The money's in Japan.

474
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,591
So? I'll back you.

475
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,153
No, I can't take your money.

476
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,397
It wouldn't be my money.
It would be our money.

477
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,311
-Marry me.
-What?

478
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,909
I've had and lost
enough jobs to know...

479
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,674
...the only thing important in life
are the people in it.

480
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,957
And I want you in my life, Hailey.

481
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,198
I wanna marry you.

482
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,992
Happy, high vibrations attract happy,
high-vibrational circumstances.

483
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,072
Yucky, low vibrations attract yucky--

484
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,595
I' m doing my homework!

485
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,155
It's the same principle
as a tuning fork.

486
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,869
If I fail lntro to Pre-Calc this semester,
it's all because of you.

487
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,078
Ryan? I....

488
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,595
Sorry. I thought you were
the evil step-monster.

489
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,159
She let me in. She seems nice.

490
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,278
Well, she just switched antidepressants.
Give it a day.

491
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,510
-Can I come in?
-Sure. Wait.

492
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,955
-Did Cohen send you?
-No. He has no idea I'm here.

493
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,189
-So.
-So.

494
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,799
You just in the neighborhood?

495
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,037
No.

496
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,957
I owe you an apology.
It's my fault Seth took off last summer.

497
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,673
Ryan, stop. It is so not.

498
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,711
If I hadn't left, you'd be together.

499
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,549
That is not true. He would've found
some Cohen-y way to break us up.

500
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,312
He can't help it. He's Cohen.

501
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,239
Come. Sit.

502
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,796
Okay.

503
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,239
Look, I know
you have a boyfriend now--

504
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,159
Whoa. No. Who told you that?

505
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,709
-I thought you told Seth that.
-Yeah, to torture him.

506
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,872
See, Zach and l, we're just hanging out.
He is not my boyfriend.

507
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,277
I do not want a boyfriend, okay?
I had a boyfriend. He sailed away.

508
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,473
Which was wrong, but....
But he cares about you so much...

509
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,029
...and if you could just
give him another chance...

510
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,630
...and maybe we could all go back
to the way that we were?

511
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,072
How?

512
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,959
You guys just left. For three months.

513
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,794
You moved on. I moved on.
Marissa moved on.

514
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,032
What?

515
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,870
I mean the way we were
wasn't always so great.

516
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,677
You guys had to deal with
Marissa's mom, Luke, Oliver, Theresa...

517
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,758
...and Cohen and l
never should have hooked up.

518
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,630
Look, just trust me on this.

519
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,836
Things are the way they are
for a reason.

520
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,998
You should go talk to Marissa.

521
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,798
You can't keep calling me, DJ.

522
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,755
You shouldn't even be here.
We're eating dinner.

523
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,911
Who is he?

524
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,197
He was my boyfriend.

525
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,915
So you're back together now?

526
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,354
-I'm sorry.
-Didn't look sorry when you were kissing.

527
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,711
-That's not fair.
-Don't talk to me about fair.

528
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,159
What were we doing
all summer?

529
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,430
I know, but he's my boyfriend.

530
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,149
-And I'm the yard guy, right?
-DJ, come on.

531
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,796
-I hear the way you talk about me.
-We agreed not to tell anyone.

532
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,719
-Because I'm the yard guy!
-Because you'd get fired!

533
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,553
Know what? I quit.
Have fun explaining that to your mom.

534
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,119
DJ, wait.

535
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,478
I'm not like that!
You know I'm not like that.

536
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,033
Please.

537
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,476
Hey, don't cry.

538
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,834
Please, don't cry.

539
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,596
I pull in the driveway,
Marissa's making out...

540
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,716
...with some guy
I've never seen before.

541
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,236
-What did you do?
-Nothing. I drove off.

542
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,153
I guess you should have called first.

543
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,038
She said she wasn't dating anyone.

544
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,430
Maybe she's not.
Maybe they just hook up for sex.

545
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,314
I'm sorry. I'm distracted.

546
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,119
Listen, man, I cannot believe
you talked to Summer for me.

547
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,953
Dude, thank you.
That is just above and beyond you.

548
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,235
-Now you have to help me get her back.
-Seth.

549
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,356
She said she wants to try again.

550
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,873
-Y eah, as friends.
-Come on.

551
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,635
Why go to the trouble of telling you
that Zach is not her boyfriend...

552
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,438
...if she just wanted to be friends?

553
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,791
Why would she tell you she just
wants to be friends if she doesn't?

554
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,713
Because she's hurt and scared
and she's hiding behind walls.

555
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,993
Y eah, and I will bring those walls down
with one single grand gesture.

556
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,634
-No. No grand gestures.
-I'm afraid it is time...

557
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,156
...to stand on that proverbial coffee cart
and declare my love for her.

558
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,954
Maybe at the carnival.
Maybe it'll be a hot-dog stand.

559
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,873
Okay, all right, all right.
What do I do about Marissa?

560
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,710
I don't know.
I mean, what do you wanna do?

561
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,110
You sound like Miss Fisher.

562
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,073
-I forgot to finish the assignment.
-Hey.

563
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,199
See where this is going? This is good.
Marissa's distracting you from school.

564
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,998
Summer and I will get back together.

565
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,276
The thing is,
by the end of Kickoff Carnival...

566
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,273
...the four of us, we're gonna be
exactly the way we were.

567
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,592
Dad. What are you doing here?

568
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,433
-He's having breakfast.
-Julie's not talking to me.

569
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,997
She left a note saying she checked into
the Montage for a $3000 spa weekend.

570
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,557
But you get the Sandy Cohen
lox scramble with rye toast.

571
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,154
So are you here to see Sandy
so he can bail you out again?

572
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,230
No, I'm not dragging Sandy
into anything.

573
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,193
Before serving me these eggs...

574
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,511
...he was the closest thing I had
to a friend in this town.

575
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,351
I came to apologize, Kiki.

576
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,789
And to ask you to remember that
whatever happens in that courtroom...

577
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,633
...I did what I did for this family.

578
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,198
I should go.

579
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,590
-Where to?
-lnterviewing lawyers all day...

580
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,110
...then I imagine I'll be home tonight,
shredding documents.

581
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,788
Don't do that.
Have dinner with us instead.

582
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,155
I won't cook, I promise. Although...

583
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,630
...if Kirsten's mad enough at you,
she might.

584
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,189
I don't wanna be any trouble.

585
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,635
We'll order in.

586
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,710
So the thing is, I'm not really a writer.
At all.

587
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,000
Words are kind of not my thing.

588
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,395
Obviously.
So maybe if I had some more time--

589
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,669
What is this?

590
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,314
What I did when I should've done
what you asked me to.

591
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,474
Yeah, but what is it?

592
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,918
It's the Cohens' new family room.

593
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,314
Actually, that's....
That's what it should have looked like...

594
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,869
...but the contractor didn't know
what he was doing.

595
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,235
Can I see your schedule, please?

596
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,275
Yeah.

597
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,514
Because we're gonna need to get you
into advanced math and science classes.

598
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,396
Some calculus, physics--

599
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,312
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why?

600
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,789
You'll need them
if you want to become an architect.

601
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,233
Isn't that what you want?

602
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,874
-You taking off?
-Yeah. Dad's coming for dinner tonight.

603
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,999
I left a message on Hailey's cell inviting
you guys, but I never heard back.

604
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,835
Well, that's because she's probably
halfway to Japan by now.

605
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,912
-Did she at least tell you, or--?
-Yeah, no. She told me. Yeah.

606
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,991
I just didn't listen.

607
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,879
I asked her to marry me instead.

608
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,753
Oh, Jimmy.

609
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,556
No, it's good. It's good. It's....
You know, I'm happy for her.

610
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,154
You know,
it's what she always wanted, so....

611
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,038
What do you want?

612
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,829
I don't know. I thought I wanted
to spend the rest of my life with Hailey.

613
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,274
-lt was fun.
-I'm sure.

614
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,955
Living on a yacht, drinking all day,
sailing off to Cabo.

615
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,398
How come when you say it,
it sounds bad?

616
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,792
Listen to me. You can do
whatever you want with your life...

617
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,838
...but you're not gonna waste it.
I won't let you.

618
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,919
Hailey's made her move.

619
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,551
What's yours?

620
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,713
-We can just not go.
-We can't not go. We're here.

621
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,359
Look at them. Oblivious, having fun.

622
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,875
To them it's all funnel cakes
and fried Snickers.

623
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,156
Just a chance to mingle
with the carny folk...

624
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,153
-...and win an awesome stuffed monkey.
-For us?

625
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,108
But for us, Kickoff Carnival determines
the course of our romantic lives...

626
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,475
-...for the entire year.
-No pressure.

627
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,750
We did good last year. We did okay.

628
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,070
You kissed Marissa
on the Ferris wheel...

629
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,073
...Summer threw up on my shoes....

630
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,433
I think I know how she felt.

631
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,915
I'm gonna go find a hot-dog stand
to climb. Good luck.

632
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,919
I was gonna tell you.

633
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,919
No, you weren't.
I asked you point-blank and you lied.

634
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,348
-I didn't lie.
-Marissa.

635
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,393
Was I supposed to wait for you?
You weren't coming back.

636
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,833
I wanted you to tell me the truth.

637
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,948
His name's DJ.

638
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,715
He works for my parents, so we had
to keep it a secret from everyone.

639
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,152
We're not seeing each other anymore.

640
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,478
After last night
when he found out about me, right?

641
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,312
Look, I'm sorry.
For right now, we should....

642
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,717
We should just be friends.

643
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,233
Friends?

644
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,153
Ryan, we're not friends.
We were never just friends.

645
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,352
I guess that was the problem then.
See you.

646
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,759
So, what'll it be?
Funnel cake or a fried Snickers?

647
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,239
Bottled water.

648
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,517
What? You can't come to a carnival
and just have bottled water.

649
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,353
No, I meant with the funnel cake
and the Snickers.

650
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,713
What?

651
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,274
Cohen. What are you doing?

652
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,232
Nothing. Why?

653
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,595
Looks like you're humping
the hot-dog stand.

654
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,149
No, actually, Summer,
I'm not even humping anything.

655
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,835
You know how I love to stand
on countertops in public places.

656
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,956
You know,
hot-dog stands, coffee carts--

657
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,752
-Oh, no--
-Because, Summer Roberts...

658
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,433
-Cohen, do not!
-...I love you.

659
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,478
-What?
-Hey, Zach. How's it going?

660
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,831
Don't listen to him.
He's crazy. He reads comic books.

661
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,558
-I know. So do l.
-You do?

662
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,797
Zach, listen. I really hope
this doesn't affect the League.

663
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,912
-Summer and I have a history.
-But no future. We are leaving.

664
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,678
Wait. Hang on. Just hear me out.

665
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,559
-Cohen, back off! I mean it.
-Fine! Just one second.

666
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,634
Seth. She said back off.

667
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,916
Please?

668
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,157
-You all right?
-No, but I have not yet begun to fight...

669
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,788
...or grovel, should it come to that.

670
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,113
Oh, my God.

671
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,838
Cohen?

672
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,111
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

673
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,435
-Yeah. I'm fine.
-Good!

674
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,354
What do you think you're doing?
This isn't a game!

675
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,393
-You could've gotten hurt!
-Good thing I didn't.

676
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,398
What do you want from me, Cohen?

677
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,270
I just want you.

678
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,078
No, you don't.

679
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,752
You had me.

680
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,590
You had me at Chrismukkah
in a freaking Wonder Woman costume...

681
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,954
...and you chose Anna.

682
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,270
You had me three months ago,
and you left.

683
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,392
-I wanna make that up to you.
-lt has nothing to do with me.

684
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,313
It is about you,
and it is always about you.

685
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,989
What you need,
and what you want, you know.

686
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,510
It seems that you only want me
when you can't have me.

687
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,197
You like the chase, and that's all.

688
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,391
So you know what? You can have it.

689
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,028
I'm going home.

690
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,674
All right, man. Let's go home.

691
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,116
Hey, guys. You're home early.

692
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,475
You hungry?
There's some Moo Shu left.

693
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,789
Do you want some?

694
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,952
-Grandpa, you eating on the floor?
-Yes, it has come to this.

695
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,192
Unfortunately, the family room
is still stuck inside the kitchen.

696
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,874
-How was school?
-Really good. I'm never going back.

697
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,593
Just what a father likes to hear.

698
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,394
-Ryan broke up with Marissa.
-Summer broke up with Seth.

699
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,437
-Zach will never talk to us again.
-Who?

700
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,392
New guy. But on the plus side...

701
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,037
...Ryan's taking AP physics, AP math,
and this Moo Shu looks delicious.

702
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,629
-It's really good.
-Caleb Nichol?

703
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,309
Sir, you're under arrest.

704
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,597
Gentlemen.

705
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,634
-What took you so long?
-You have a right to remain silent.

706
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,712
Anything you say can be
used against you in a court of law.

707
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,678
You have a right to an attorney
during questioning.

708
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,718
-What's going on?
-Your father will explain.

709
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,717
Dad, I'm so sorry.

710
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,070
You have absolutely nothing
to apologize for.

711
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,633
-Do you understand?
-Yeah.

712
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,751
Put your hands behind your head.

713
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,114
Don't say anything. I'll follow you
to the station. I'm his lawyer.
