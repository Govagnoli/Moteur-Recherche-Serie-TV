00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,034
<i>Previously on</i> The O. C:

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,111
- lf you need anything else, let me know.
- Thanks.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,669
- I want you to leave Ryan alone.
- You really think I'm gonna hurt him.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,798
I chickened out. Which is kind of
my go-to move these days.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,154
But I'm rescheduling the interview.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,312
- Oh, that's Maya Griffin.
- Whose father's the head of the board?

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,313
I'm totally cool about turning
your apartment into the Playboy Grotto.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,469
- I'm Jess.
- Trey.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,631
I've always had this fantasy
about two brothers.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,949
I want you out of Newport.

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,315
- We could take off together.
- And where would we go?

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,469
Vegas.

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,598
- Marissa and I are broken up.
- Glad you finally made your decision.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,869
Your Brown interview is in 11 hours.
Don't you think you should prep for it?

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,918
No. I've got a new approach.
It's called "don't think about it."

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,150
I guess that's better
than your last approach.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,073
- Hey, what's all that?
- Little halftime buffet.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,232
Pretzels, Ding Dongs,
gelled gefilte fish. Tried to mix it up.

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,549
That's always appreciated.

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,950
- Ryan, you ready for a rematch?
- Do we have to?

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,678
I thought I called winners.

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,990
No offense, I just don't think
you should step into the ring with me.

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,516
Before Ryan and I came, PlayStation
was pretty much his best friend.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,910
- Come on. One game, Seth.
- That's my controller.

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,992
- Ryan, will you get drinks with me?
- Yes.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,198
- Okay, you ready?
- That's my lucky controller.

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,477
So, Atwood, seems like
you're really moving on.

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,232
Yeah. Trying to.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,597
Well, I promise,
no weirdness from me.

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,959
Coop's my best friend, but I've also
accepted the fact that you and Marissa...

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,314
Not really meant to be.

32
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,756
Which is why it's good that
you've found the opposite of Marissa.

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,876
You really think
Sadie is Marissa's opposite?

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,031
And game over.

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,838
Whoa, dude, you got killed already?

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,595
I am humbled, man.
I am humbled and mortified.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,436
It's okay. I can't take all the credit.
I found a cheat code on the Internet.

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,160
- Ryan, this one's a keeper, man.
- Anti-Coop.

39
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,630
Who knew my new PlayStation idol
would be your new girlf... Your new...

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,916
- All right, like... Friend. Girl friend.
- Friend.

41
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,911
- Nice save.
- I think "friend" is the word.

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,230
- I'm gonna get that. Thanks.
- Nice dodge.

43
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,755
"Friend" was what I was looking for.

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,991
Ryan.

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,430
- Jess.
- Oh, good. You recognized me.

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,192
Even with the new look.

47
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,510
Yeah. Kind of came with the new life.

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,153
Listen, I brought you something.

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,870
It's a belated birthday present.
From your brother.

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,758
- You keep in touch with him?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,559
I lived with him out in Vegas
for a while.

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,233
Just got back a few months ago.

53
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,873
Here.

54
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,874
Thanks.

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,271
Don't you wanna know
how he's doing?

56
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,353
Hey.

57
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,630
Ryan, if you wanna talk,
you know where I live.

58
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,476
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

59
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,756
Let's just go back inside.

60
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,471
Come on, you're up next.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,633
- Hey.
- Hey.

62
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,239
You know, I know Trey's
not made of money or anything...

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,356
...but he could have sprung for a shirt.

64
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,273
- It's an inside thing. Long story.
- I like long stories.

65
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,470
Too bad.
I don't feel like telling this one.

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,198
Breakfast is ready in the kitchen.

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,756
I haven't seen one of those in years.

68
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,718
Do you remember when your dad and I
used to buy these for you?

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,152
Couldn't get you to play with them.
Where did you find this anyway?

70
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,753
Trey.

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,436
- A friend of his dropped it off.
- Remember Jess?

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,068
Girl who took too much X
and floated face-down in a pool?

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,152
Yeah, she moved to Vegas with Trey
and they lived together.

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,353
- Well, how is he? Is he okay?
- I don't know.

75
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,318
Figured he's out of my life.
Why get back into it?

76
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,198
Well, breakfast is ready.

77
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,190
- What are you doing?
- Thought you'd be at school.

78
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,875
So you were gonna lurk around
while I wasn't home?

79
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,359
Came to drop something off.

80
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,192
I thought you were gonna sell this.
This watch was really expensive.

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,920
No, I decided to hang onto it.

82
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,958
And now you're giving it back?

83
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,477
Well, there's a surprise twist. Thanks.

84
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,917
Anything else?

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,870
Look, I just wanna be alone right now.

86
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,600
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Yeah, you look busy.

87
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,194
I'm gonna be at the beach tonight.
Maybe I'll see you.

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,918
Don't count on it.

89
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,395
No, you're the man, sir.

90
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,073
Okay, I'll see you soon.

91
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,596
- So?
- Turns out the guy is a huge anime fan.

92
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,320
We got into the whole <i>Akira</i>
vs. <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> debate.

93
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,550
Both came down on <i>Ghost in the Shell.</i>

94
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,633
I have no idea what you're saying,
but I'm so happy for you.

95
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,394
I'm gonna go call my parents.
Tell them to start packing.

96
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,709
Congratulations, baby.

97
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,117
Oh, holy Kodak moment.

98
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,316
I guess Seth just aced
his Brown interview.

99
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,994
That's fantastic.
We're so gonna party tonight.

100
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,434
I'll make a flan.

101
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,431
Oh, well, you know what, Taylor?

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,750
Seth and I were thinking
about hanging out alone.

103
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,559
My dad's out of town,
we have the house to ourselves...

104
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,870
Say no more.

105
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,316
What, Taylor?

106
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,472
- What's wrong with your eye?
- It's a knowing wink, Summer.

107
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,029
You and Seth,
the house all to yourselves...

108
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,838
...who knows what could happen?

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,117
Me. There'll be leftover Thai
and the <i>Blade</i> trilogy.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,515
Oh, I didn't realize that you and Seth
had lost the magic.

111
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,194
Surprised you didn't come sooner.
You must be panicking.

112
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,113
Okay, I didn't come to you,
and why would I panic?

113
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,033
Well, it looks like you two
are going to college together.

114
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,668
Don't you worry
that Seth's eye will wander?

115
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,674
All the nubile young coeds,
you, the familiar old shoe.

116
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,832
I'll have you know, Taylor,
that I'm five levels hotter than him.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,309
Summer, the libido
does not listen to logic.

118
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,950
At this age, men are driven
by a reptilian force.

119
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,714
Spread the seed. Spread the seed.

120
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,548
- Spread the s...
- Taylor.

121
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,429
If Seth and I go to college together,
we'll be fine.

122
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,956
And I'll have you know,
we have a very healthy sex life.

123
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,394
Then super. You have fun tonight.

124
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,711
- But, Summer, if you need to girl talk...
- Bye, Taylor.

125
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,359
Hey.

126
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,317
Glad you're home.

127
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,597
Yeah, I just walked in.
I didn't know you were stopping by.

128
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,671
I needed a break from dry-walling.

129
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,791
You're still into toy cars?

130
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,030
I'll choose to find that cute
instead of creepy.

131
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,031
It's just something someone gave me.

132
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,272
This wouldn't have anything to do
with that Hooters waitress...

133
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,396
...that showed up at your doorstep
yesterday?

134
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,917
Jess is just a friend of my brother's.
I'd tell you the whole story, but...

135
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,957
But you'd just rather not?

136
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,794
That's cool.

137
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,997
But just know that if you do decide
to tell me, I will listen.

138
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,071
And without judgment.

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,998
Or you can keep it all to yourself.
Both are fine with me.

140
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,071
Okay. I'm gonna get going.

141
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,515
Dr. Henry Griffin. What a surprise.

142
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,319
- I hope you don't mind.
- Please. We're building a hospital.

143
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,630
When all's said and done,
we'll be like family.

144
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,190
- Hang on a sec. Let me get Matt in here.
- I'd rather that you didn't.

145
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,156
The board called
an impromptu meeting yesterday.

146
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,551
It seems there's been some complaints
about your associate.

147
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,994
Complaints?

148
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,276
Rumors. Parties at his house.

149
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,749
Booze, gambling,
God knows what else.

150
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,115
Board's not sure
they wanna do business with him.

151
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,355
I'll talk to him.
Make sure he cleans up his act.

152
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,876
This is not about a slap on the wrist.
We want him off the project.

153
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,393
Matt worked his ass off on this deal.
I couldn't take him off it.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,798
Then I'm afraid we can't go forward
with the hospital.

155
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,551
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Take a few days. Mull it over.

156
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,234
Remember, this hospital
could change everything for you.

157
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,075
Do you really wanna give it all up
for one 26-year-old hotshot?

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,479
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

159
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,234
What's going on tonight,
big plans with Sadie?

160
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,519
Maybe. I don't know,
I haven't really decided yet.

161
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,830
Yeah? What's plan B?

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,399
Jess?

163
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,198
I just need to know if Trey's okay.

164
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,796
Nothing you hear is gonna make it
easier that he's not a part of your life.

165
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,875
Listen, as we speak, your new
sometimes kind of girlfriend...

166
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,749
...is probably sitting, cradling a hunk of
plaster, waiting for you to make a move.

167
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,196
So you can either dwell on the past
and go see Jess...

168
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,999
...or live for the now
and give Sadie a call.

169
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,679
So you called?

170
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,796
- Marissa. Hey.
- Hi.

171
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,235
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

172
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,755
- Just in the neighborhood?
- Yeah, I was driving by.

173
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,913
Okay, no, I wasn't.

174
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,596
The truth is, Summer's with Seth. I'm all
alone and I'm going out of my mind.

175
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,149
Tomorrow I'm gonna go up to L.A.,
but if you want...

176
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,311
...feel free to make this
your crash pad.

177
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,153
- That would be great.
- All right. Make yourself at home.

178
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,597
All right. Two down, one to go.

179
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,718
You really wanna watch
the entire <i>Blade</i> trilogy?

180
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,075
Can't leave the disk unwatched.
It'll feel bad.

181
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,834
I thought tonight was about
celebrating your interview.

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,560
It is. Hence the trilogy.

183
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,958
You know...

184
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,069
...we could forget the movie,
go upstairs.

185
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,480
You smell so good.

186
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,596
- You like the smell of salami?
- Cohen!

187
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,911
What? I had a salami sub.
I feel like it's lingering.

188
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,514
- You know what? Just forget it.
- Forget what?

189
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,876
I was trying to create a mood.

190
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,959
I know. I know that now.

191
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,475
I was just thrown off a little bit
by your approach.

192
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,030
Nuzzling your ear and complimenting
you? I wasn't reinventing the wheel.

193
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,998
Normally, you throw me down
and do your thing. But I can adjust.

194
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,515
- Not interested.
- Summer.

195
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,628
You smell good too.

196
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,271
- Press play before I break your face.
- Fine.

197
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,392
<i>Hey, it's Sadie. Leave a message.</i>

198
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,916
Hey. So I know you're painting,
but it's Friday night.

199
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,911
I'm making you take a break.

200
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,152
I'll be there in 20 minutes, okay? Bye.

201
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,794
Hey, Ryan.

202
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,758
I was just about to take a swim.
Come on in.

203
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,194
Look, I can't stay long.

204
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,238
But you couldn't resist getting
the lowdown on your brother?

205
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,399
Guy has a way of sucking you in.
I know.

206
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,439
Drink?

207
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,670
Just tell me, is he okay?

208
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,108
Well, he misses you.

209
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,273
Trey's not the type to cry into his pillow
every night, but I can tell.

210
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,759
You know him that well, huh?

211
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,672
Let's just say he's of a certain mold.

212
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,877
Angry, damaged, reckless.
That's the kind of guy I go for.

213
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,998
My boyfriend now, Jim, same deal.

214
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,591
We all have our types, don't we?

215
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,838
Tell you what,
why don't you stay a while.

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,912
Look, Jess, we were never friends.

217
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,632
Got it.

218
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,431
You can go if you want.

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,752
Do you know Trey's dealing?

220
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,955
Blackjack. Off the strip.

221
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,792
So he's staying out of trouble?

222
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,269
Trying to.

223
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,598
- Don't move. I'll get some clothes.
- Jess.

224
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,274
Just stay a little while.

225
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,155
I have a lot more
to tell you about Trey.

226
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,832
- Music too loud?
- No, it's just the grunting...

227
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,196
...and excessive banging
that I'm concerned about.

228
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,998
Sorry.

229
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,197
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

230
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,192
Girl problems?

231
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,717
Safe bet usually, but no.
Actually, this is more complicated.

232
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,759
Is it that girl Jess again?

233
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,708
Yeah. And my brother.

234
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,950
Just trying to prevent
another casualty of Trey.

235
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,951
So you're trying to save this girl?

236
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,668
Is that something I do?

237
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,356
Look, we love Marissa. She's family.
And she means a lot to us.

238
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,034
But she's been through so much.
You got pulled into that.

239
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,238
Yeah, well, some of that
was my fault.

240
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,198
You're right. I can't argue with you.

241
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,830
You should never argue with a woman
who's here to discuss women.

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,275
Have we mentioned
that we love Sadie?

243
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,192
She's smart and she's grounded.

244
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,397
And I am trying,
trying not to screw it up.

245
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,189
Because a girl isn't tied to train tracks
doesn't mean she should be ignored.

246
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,672
I know, I know, it's just Jess is trying
to put Trey behind her, start a new life.

247
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,957
Great. As long as she doesn't
get in the way of yours.

248
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,830
- Marissa.
- Sandy.

249
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,673
Look, I know it's weird I slept here...

250
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,308
...but I didn't feel like being
in the trailer by myself.

251
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,948
If you need somewhere to go,
you can come to our house.

252
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,112
I know. You guys are like family.

253
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,470
- It's just that these days...
- Things are difficult with you and Ryan.

254
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,471
But you don't belong here.

255
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,551
Okay, I was just leaving anyway.

256
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,314
If you're looking for Matt,
he went to L.A. for a meeting.

257
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,914
Well, I'll track him down.

258
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,036
- And you go home.
- Okay.

259
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,713
All right.

260
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,074
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

261
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,038
- Hi, I'm picking up an order for Roberts.
- Sure. Just a second.

262
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,758
Thanks.

263
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,518
- Guess who?
- Oh, God.

264
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,954
Hi!

265
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,158
- Looks like someone got the short straw.
- No, I ordered pancakes.

266
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,788
No, you drew the short straw.

267
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,391
After sex when everyone's hungry
but nobody wants to get the takeout...

268
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,152
...short straw picks up the food.

269
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,155
Yes. That is exactly
what you're seeing happening here.

270
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,231
Total short-straw scenario.

271
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,791
With the hunger and all the sex
we had last night. Yes.

272
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,033
So was last night, like, totally kinky,
or was it more about tender lovemaking?

273
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,397
You know, smooth jazz,
a burning fire, a zebra-skin rug...

274
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,152
We had a very nice time.

275
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,749
- My God. You didn't have sex, did you?
- Are my pancakes ready yet?

276
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,990
Your lips aren't chapped,
there's no love bites.

277
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,594
- Your voice isn't hoarse from screaming.
- Pancakes?

278
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,912
- Thank you. Goodbye, Taylor.
- Summer.

279
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,672
Summer, wait, I can help you!

280
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,598
- Hey.
- Hey.

281
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,194
Grab a brush.
We're in the home stretch.

282
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,554
So I thought maybe
I was gonna see you last night.

283
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,953
- Got tied up. Sorry.
- What, do you work for the CIA?

284
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,512
Doesn't matter. I got distracted
for a few days, but I'm fine now.

285
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,033
In fact, I'm all yours.

286
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,714
Okay. Fine. You're forgiven.

287
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,630
But in exchange for your silence,
I demand a dinner.

288
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,392
Okay. Tomorrow night?

289
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,799
Okay. Perfect. Yeah.

290
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,391
<i>Hey, it's Summer. Leave a message.</i>

291
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,513
So nothing happened.

292
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,035
- Still, Matt should know better.
- But he doesn't.

293
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,192
You have to remember that he's not
that much older than the boys.

294
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,989
He just needs some advice
from the great Sandy Cohen.

295
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,789
Oh, sometimes you overestimate me.

296
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,473
Not possible.

297
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,074
- Get a room.
- Hey, count your blessings.

298
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,028
Kids with affectionate parents grow up
to be better adjusted sexually as adults.

299
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,156
I know. I meant, get a room. My room.

300
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,548
And do it in front of me.

301
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,990
- This Sadie?
- No, it's Jess.

302
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,712
Jess?

303
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,997
Whoa, slow down, slow down,
I can't...

304
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,032
What do you mean?

305
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,514
No, no, no, stay put, stay put.
I'll be right there.

306
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,080
Hey. I thought you weren't gonna
let this happen again.

307
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,516
After this I'm done.
If I need help, I'll call, okay?

308
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,719
- Thanks for coming.
- I needed to talk about Seth anyway.

309
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,677
So have you talked to him today?

310
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,149
No, I think we're too embarrassed
to face each other.

311
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,470
Or he's treading water
till he gets to Brown...

312
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,916
...and finds a big pair of pale
New England boobs to replace me.

313
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,514
Babe, you just had an off night.
It'll be okay.

314
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,440
- This ever happen with you and Ryan?
- Actually, no.

315
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,398
I mean, we had our problems.
That just wasn't one of them.

316
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,516
What about the end,
when you drifted apart?

317
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,671
Kind of the opposite.

318
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,159
I guess...

319
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,554
...the more emotionally unavailable
you are...

320
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,915
...the more you end up
wanting each other.

321
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,235
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

322
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,231
Hey, you think
we should get out of here?

323
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,755
- Sold.
- Okay.

324
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,834
- Did you see him?
- Not yet.

325
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,037
- How many times has he come?
- Started hours ago. He's calling too.

326
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,077
- And when did you end it?
- Earlier today.

327
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,276
I guess I was inspired
by our talk last night.

328
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,319
So I called him, told him I didn't wanna
see him anymore, and now here I am.

329
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,630
Down a boyfriend, up a stalker.

330
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,315
- Is that him in the Mustang?
- Yup.

331
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,199
- He's coming in.
- Yeah. Just go in the back.

332
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,673
- She doesn't wanna see you.
- Who are you, her bodyguard?

333
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,593
No. But I'll kick your ass
if you take one step further.

334
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,039
He's gone?

335
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,077
I don't think he'll be back.

336
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,879
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I'll be fine. I promise.

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,558
You sure?

338
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,237
Ryan, I know you don't believe me,
but I really am trying to change.

339
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,991
You don't have to stay.

340
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,559
Morning.

341
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,598
Hey. Scrambled or fried?
I made both.

342
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,115
Neither. I should get going.

343
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,238
But coffee would be nice.

344
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,551
Ryan, don't look all awkward,
like it's the morning after.

345
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,349
It's not like anything
happened last night. Stay. Eat.

346
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,832
Let me get rid of this.

347
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,432
Hello?

348
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,556
Trey. Hi.

349
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,754
Of course I do.

350
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,468
I'd have to think about it.

351
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,590
Look, I gotta go.
I'm sitting here with your brother.

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,197
Sure. Hang on.

353
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,356
Do you wanna talk to him?

354
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,635
Now's not a good time.

355
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,156
I'll call you later.

356
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,114
He wants me to come back.

357
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,075
- What happened to trying to change?
- I am trying.

358
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,719
It's just that it's Trey.

359
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,159
It's hard.

360
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,471
- Especially all by myself.
- Your parents, where are they?

361
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,837
Well, my dad's in Tokyo on business,
and my mom's at the spa...

362
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,230
...a.k.a., in bed
with her tennis instructor.

363
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,234
So as you can see,
I don't have much to distract me.

364
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,960
Unless you wanna give it a try.

365
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,158
Look, I can't stay here and babysit you.
What about your girlfriends at USC?

366
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,197
I could call,
see if they wanna come down.

367
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,999
Call them, invite them down,
just take a breath.

368
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,030
Ryan, I'll try, but what if I freak out?

369
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,838
You won't.

370
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,198
Matt, call me back.
We got a lot to discuss.

371
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,954
- Everything okay?
- Oh, it's just business.

372
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,518
Hey, I heard you aced
your Brown interview.

373
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,751
Looks like the stars
are aligning for you. And Summer.

374
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,718
- Could be another four years together.
- Yeah.

375
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,552
Hey, let me ask you a question.

376
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,076
When you were at college with Mom,
did it ever...

377
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,835
...get sort of stale with the monogamy
and the constant being-together?

378
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,797
- Your mother was a firecracker.
- Okay.

379
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,872
My buddies used to say, " If you see
rocking, don't come knocking."

380
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,110
- So sorry I asked.
- Good morning, honey.

381
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,236
- Hi, honey.
- Have either of you seen Ryan?

382
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,233
I checked the pool house and it looks
like he didn't sleep there.

383
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,960
- Good morning, everyone.
- Sadie. Hello.

384
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,475
Bagels. Hope you don't
mind me crashing breakfast.

385
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,153
Not at all. Let me get you coffee.

386
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,436
Hey, is Ryan around?

387
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,199
Actually...

388
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,838
You've really gotta learn
to lie better.

389
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,794
We'll just let you two...

390
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,076
You really are a terrible liar, my dear.

391
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,117
You could have jumped in.

392
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,271
So let me guess...

393
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,149
...Ryan got some 911 call from Jess
and it required him spending the night.

394
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
- That has not been confirmed.
- Don't have to protect him.

395
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,635
It's fine, honestly. I'm not jealous.

396
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,951
I'm just not really sure that Ryan and I
are right for each other.

397
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,394
Because?

398
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,959
Because he just seems to have
a lot of really intense issues.

399
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,953
Yeah, well, intense issues
seem to follow Ryan around.

400
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,951
Well, I don't know
if I'm up for that now.

401
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,076
Well, listen,
I think Ryan really likes you.

402
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,199
And I think if you hang in there,
you two will eventually settle in...

403
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,669
...to a super laid-back,
boring-ass relationship.

404
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,197
But cut him some slack, he just got out
of a two-year drama-fest with Marissa...

405
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,158
...and the one time that
he tried to date someone normal...

406
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,312
...she turned out to be my dead
grandfather's illegitimate daughter.

407
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,630
- So you know how that goes.
- Right.

408
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,997
Yeah, of course.
Of course I know how that goes.

409
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,348
Can you do me a favor
and not tell Ryan that we talked?

410
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,552
You know
how to keep a secret?

411
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,671
Nobody's home.

412
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,068
Don't worry, it's just me.

413
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,594
- Hi.
- So listen, I hate to pop in like this...

414
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,469
...but I'm meeting Ashley and Madison
later to brainstorm for a prom theme.

415
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,110
- Do you wanna come?
- You probably don't need me for that.

416
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,679
Summer, are you kidding me?

417
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,717
It's the end of the year.
We are all fried.

418
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,393
Come on, please?

419
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,710
Fine.

420
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,552
Here you go.

421
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,631
Do you print out
a flyer for everything?

422
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,995
You'll thank me when
you make your 2006 scrapbook.

423
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,876
There was the party with Bill Merriam,
the few dates I went on with Maya.

424
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,712
Nothing the board could oust me for.

425
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,519
- What about Marissa?
- What about Marissa?

426
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,275
I went to your house yesterday to talk,
and she answered the door in pajamas.

427
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,473
- She needed a friend.
- Well, then be a friend.

428
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,633
But for God's sake, do not be throwing
pajama parties with 17-year-old girls.

429
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,711
- Nothing happened.
- That doesn't matter.

430
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,440
The board is watching you,
waiting for you to screw up...

431
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,797
...and you're screwing up.
- This is a witch hunt.

432
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,191
If they wanna take me down, they will.
Unless you stop them.

433
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,474
I mean, so please...

434
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,916
...call Griffin. Tell him you're gonna
keep me on the project.

435
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,115
School on a Sunday is, like,
beyond creepy.

436
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,759
Summer, you're right on time.

437
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,273
Where's Ashley and Madison?

438
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,154
- Summer?
- Cohen.

439
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,436
You know, you said
the A.V. club was meeting.

440
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,955
I brought <i>History of Violence.</i>

441
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,112
This is a total ambush.

442
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,113
Look, you two are like my family.

443
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,396
If I sense there's trouble
with my Sethummer...

444
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,757
...I am gonna do what I can to help.
- We're not in any trouble.

445
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,558
That we've acknowledged
to each other.

446
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,996
That is exactly why
I brought you here today.

447
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,355
Communication. Intimacy.

448
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,159
These are two skills
that you two could improve upon.

449
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,279
Now, I am not a licensed sex therapist,
but my father was.

450
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,638
Before he ran away, he used to conduct
sessions with couples in our basement.

451
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,270
- That's creepy.
- Okay...

452
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,510
...we're going to start off
with touching.

453
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,431
I want you to place your hands
anywhere on each other's bodies...

454
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,079
...excluding breasts
and genitals.

455
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,278
- I have to go.
- Cohen.

456
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,393
- Put your hands on me now.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

457
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,354
Summer? Good.

458
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,435
Okay, now, I want you
to concentrate on your eye contact.

459
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,989
Get lost in each other's gaze.

460
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,358
I'm getting lost. I'm getting lost.

461
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,116
As you gaze into each other's eyes,
do you feel stirrings?

462
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,793
Deep in your loins?

463
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,638
- No, I don't really feel anything.
- Yeah, I got nothing.

464
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,392
Not even the faintest spark?

465
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,074
A tiny flicker?

466
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,639
What does that say about us?

467
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,396
Well, I also do breakup counseling.

468
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,079
- And for you?
- I'll have the same.

469
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,958
- Great. Thanks.
- Thank you.

470
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,195
So I'm sorry that I didn't take you
anyplace nicer for our first date.

471
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,273
Are you kidding? This place
is the culinary destination of Newport.

472
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,876
- Wait till you try the pancakes.
- Next time.

473
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,678
- Next time?
- That's the plan.

474
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,718
Yeah. All right. Excuse me.

475
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,357
Jess?

476
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,431
- Is this Ryan Atwood?
- Who's this?

477
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,794
Kim, I'm Jess' friend.

478
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,872
- We really need you to come over here.
- What's going on?

479
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,952
Word got out about Jess' tonight,
and now half of USC is here.

480
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,270
<i>And Jim is on his way over here,</i>
<i>and on a rampage.</i>

481
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,033
- Grab Jess and get out of there.
- <i>She's locked in the pool house.</i>

482
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,909
She's drunk and crying and she says
the only person she'll talk to is you.

483
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,074
Wel...

484
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,635
Yeah, okay, I'll be right there.

485
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,117
Is everything okay?

486
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,510
Not really.

487
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,838
Okay. You know,
if you have to go, Ryan, go.

488
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,718
It's fine. Really, I get it.

489
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,274
You do?

490
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,908
No. I don't.

491
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,837
But I get that something's pulling
you under and you can't let it go.

492
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,120
So whatever it is, please, just go deal
with it and find me when you're done.

493
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,388
I'm right here.

494
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,108
I wasn't looking for you.

495
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,228
But I'm here now.

496
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,517
Whatever this game is you're playing...

497
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,511
...stop.
- You don't want me to go away.

498
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,750
- What makes you say that?
- You're Ionely.

499
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,400
Right, well, thanks for the analysis.
I feel much better.

500
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,076
No, look. If you need a break
from everything going on in there...

501
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,113
...I can help.

502
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,753
I think I'm doing just fine on my own.

503
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,833
- You must be Ryan.
- I am.

504
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,070
I'm so glad you're here.
She's in there.

505
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,795
Still won't come out.

506
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,508
Jess?

507
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,319
Jess, it's me, open up.

508
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,877
- You came.
- Yeah. What is it?

509
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,669
- What are you so upset about, huh?
- I thought I could have friends over...

510
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,717
...and then I started missing you.

511
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,711
Let's go out.
They're worried about you.

512
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,359
No, no, no.

513
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,999
I don't wanna be with my friends.

514
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,435
- I wanna be here with you.
- That's not a good idea.

515
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,398
Are you kidding?
This is the first good idea I've had.

516
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,154
Jim, Trey, none of those guys
knew how to take care of me.

517
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,152
You know how
to take care of me, Ryan.

518
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,514
It's all right.

519
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,071
It's okay.

520
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,030
- Jess. Jess. Jess.
- Hey!

521
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,398
- Moving on already? That what this is?
- Settle it with me.

522
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,792
- You wanna talk outside?
- Yeah.

523
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,718
Lock the door.

524
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,590
- You seeing her?
- She's a friend of my brother's.

525
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,559
- Not that guy Trey?
- Well...

526
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,711
What? You gotta take
your brother's leftovers?

527
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,029
Listen to me,
you gotta stay away from this girl.

528
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,158
- She's trying to start over, you let her.
- None of your business.

529
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,070
You're right.

530
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,389
That's why I'm leaving.

531
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,196
- Ryan! Ryan, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

532
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,399
Look, Jess, if you're smart
you'll stay away from him.

533
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,232
- And my brother.
- Of course I will.

534
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,517
- After the way you fought for me.
- You gotta stop dating guys like him.

535
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,312
And I gotta stop dating girls like you.

536
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,471
Take care of yourself.

537
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,630
- Hello.
- Taylor, I really don't wanna talk...

538
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,472
...about my sex problems
with Summer.

539
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,633
Okay, okay. So the intimacy exercises
were a miserable failure.

540
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,711
But I don't think you should lose hope.

541
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,031
- Do you have some sort of secret cure?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

542
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,474
It's called raunchy sex.

543
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,916
Now, now, you don't see me
as a sexual being, Seth. I get that.

544
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,312
But without revealing too much, if sex
were a martial art, I'd be a black belt.

545
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,119
Weirdly, I'm not surprised.

546
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,034
Now, I would like to talk to you about
a little something called the <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

547
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
How do you know all this?

548
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,997
Dean Hess hid a treasure trove
of secrets underneath his pink shirts.

549
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,359
Okay. Position one.

550
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,990
Okay, I really don't wanna picture you
doing that with the Nazi dean.

551
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,391
Seth, do you want your sparks
back with Summer?

552
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,470
- Yes.
- Then listen and learn.

553
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,394
Okay, this is the yoni
and this is the lingam.

554
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,348
Matt may not have shown the best of
judgment, but it's nothing I'd fire him for.

555
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,751
And the " sacrificing one life
to save the many" argument?

556
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,593
Yeah, I don't get it.
The board loves you, Henry.

557
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,274
One phone call from you,
nobody has to sacrifice anyone.

558
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,795
- What makes you think I would do that?
- Business.

559
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,712
Our plan is the best one,
you know that.

560
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,711
Makes me wonder
about the board, though...

561
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,269
...that they'd scrap
a lucrative project over this.

562
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,556
It makes no sense
from a business perspective.

563
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,392
But maybe it's personal.

564
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,190
This is about Maya, isn't it?

565
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,112
She cried for days over him.

566
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,435
I'm sorry, Henry.

567
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,713
But you didn't have to lie to me.

568
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,314
I'm just a father
looking after his daughter.

569
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,799
Reason and logic don't stand
a chance. I understand that.

570
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,039
All different kinds of loyalty, Sandy.
I chose mine.

571
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,597
Now you choose yours.
What's it gonna be?

572
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,910
Hospital or Matt?

573
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,553
- Hey, Coop.
- You okay, Sum?

574
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,278
Yeah, just Cohen called.

575
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,954
He's coming over, he wants to talk.
Doesn't bode well.

576
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,997
Well, maybe he's coming
to patch things up.

577
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,276
Or maybe he's coming over
to break up with me.

578
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,749
<i>Anyway, it means that I can 't</i>
<i>hang out tonight, okay?</i>

579
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,434
Oh, hey, I totally understand.

580
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,751
- Just call me later.
- Okay.

581
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,833
- Hey.
- Hey.

582
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,436
- How did it go?
- Fine. Fine.

583
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,513
Matt called a couple of times.
Sounded nervous.

584
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,151
- Matt?
- Yeah.

585
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,632
I'll let you talk to him.
I'm gonna go lock up the house.

586
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,190
- Oh, hey. I didn't know you were here.
- Yeah.

587
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,079
- Didn't you have a date with Sadie?
- Almost.

588
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,117
- But then...
- That girl Jess again?

589
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,558
Yeah, I finally learned my lesson,
but it might be too late.

590
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,112
It's never too late.

591
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,876
You just have to talk to her.

592
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,434
Hey. Am I interrupting?

593
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,955
Princess Sparkle's here
for emotional support.

594
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,997
Helping to cushion for the fall.

595
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,232
Put her in her drawer, she shouldn't
see what's about to happen.

596
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,509
- That bad?
- Now, for the next 20 minutes...

597
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,877
...or 24 hours if I turn out to be Sting,
you have to keep an open mind.

598
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,392
- What are you talking about?
- lf you'll be so kind as to disrobe...

599
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,755
...we will begin with
the wheelbarrow position.

600
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,194
Oh, my God.

601
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,911
As it turns out, I have recently been
schooled in the art of tantric sex.

602
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,796
- Where? Some pervy Internet chat room?
- No, no, no, it was very tasteful.

603
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,837
- Taylor came over...
- What?

604
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,754
Taylor, like, came over to your house
and gave you one-on-one sex education?

605
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,230
- Is that a no to the wheelbarrow?
- I'll wheelbarrow you.

606
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,954
Hi.

607
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,711
My brother and I used to play
with these.

608
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,198
Especially when my mom
was drinking...

609
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,117
...we'd go in the back bedroom
and play cars...

610
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,673
...and pretend we didn't hear.

611
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,110
He always used to tell me that he'd
save up and buy us a Camaro one day.

612
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,078
We'd blow town, never come back.

613
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,598
Wasn't gonna happen,
so one day he tried to steal one.

614
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,112
I was there.

615
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,597
Somehow that landed me here
and him in Vegas.

616
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,673
We don't talk anymore.

617
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,798
And you didn't tell me because?

618
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,714
I guess I'm not used to
unloading on people.

619
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,838
Too busy being loaded on, I guess.

620
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,958
I don't know.

621
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,156
But I wanted to start over with you.

622
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,114
You know, I have many talents.

623
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,078
One of them is listening.
You just gotta let me do it.

624
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,148
Deal.

625
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,232
That's not to say
we should just be talking.

626
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,309
- Whoa.
- Yeah, whoa.

627
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,993
It's a good thing I put
Princess Sparkle away for that.

628
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,392
To think it was that amazing, and
we didn't even get to the wheelbarrow.

629
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,317
You know, we should make a pact.

630
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,471
If we go away to college together...

631
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,155
...we should, like, fight,
like, every day.

632
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,914
I'm pretty sure
I can make that happen.

633
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,479
Sorry.

634
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,991
