1
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:01,369
sly on The O.C.:

2
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:02,669
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:04,536
Oh, I ain't here to work,
came to see my girlfriend.

4
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:06,569
<i>You are an ignorant buffoon.</i>

5
00:00:06,636 --> 00:00:07,769
Mom, aren't you going
to stay for midnight?

6
00:00:07,836 --> 00:00:09,569
Your mom has a headache.

7
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:11,135
<i>But you should stay, have</i>
Bullit give you a ride home.</i>

8
00:00:11,202 --> 00:00:16,236
In my dream, I had found
my other half,
and it was an otter.

9
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:18,669
Tell me about
your spirit animal.

10
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:20,569
It was this otter.
An otter?

11
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:22,669
<i>When Henri-Michel would</i>
tell me he loved me,</i>

12
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:25,569
it was like the whole world
melted away.

13
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:26,903
So what are you saying?

14
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,436
I don't think that
I should be with anyone.

15
00:00:28,503 --> 00:00:29,603
Bye, Ryan.

16
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:43,536
Hello.

17
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:44,669
Taylor, where are you?

18
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:45,836
I thought you were going
to come to dinner.

19
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:48,202
Oh, uh... you should just go on
without me.

20
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:49,836
I haven't finished
my errands yet.

21
00:00:49,903 --> 00:00:51,603
Wait, you've been gone all day.

22
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:55,636
Well, I had to go to the dry cleaner
and get my nails done and then go
to the Matthew Barney exhibition.

23
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:57,135
Oh, okay.
Well, is Ryan with you?

24
00:00:57,202 --> 00:00:58,369
No, Kaitlin, I told you.

25
00:00:58,436 --> 00:00:59,669
We're giving each other
some space.

26
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:01,703
I haven't spoken to him
in over a week.

27
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,503
Okay, well then, I guess you're
not going to Kirsten's thing.

28
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:05,135
What thing?

29
00:01:05,202 --> 00:01:07,135
Her party.
She's turning 40.

30
00:01:07,202 --> 00:01:10,870
I was kind of hoping that you were going to be there
to do something weird,so it's not so boring.

31
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:12,336
Wait, do you want to know
where it is?

32
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:13,703
No. Uh-uh.

33
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,002
I don't.
Uh...

34
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:16,903
I have to go.
Good-bye.

35
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:19,669
Excuse me, miss.

36
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,735
Yes?

37
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:23,202
I'm afraid you're making
some of the business owners
around here a little nervous.

38
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:24,402
Why? What are you
talking about?

39
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:27,436
Well, you've been loitering here
for the past seven hours.

40
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:29,069
(laughing):
Loitering.

41
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:30,870
What's loitering?
I've been... just...

42
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:32,469
What are you doing
with those binoculars?

43
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,736
These...

44
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:37,469
are for bird watching.
Mm-hmm.

45
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,569
There's a very interesting
oriole in that tree right there.

46
00:01:39,636 --> 00:01:40,703
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

47
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:41,903
Okay, Ryan's off work
in ten minutes.

48
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,002
Can you just give me a...

49
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,269
Ten minutes!

50
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:46,803
You want a donut?
No.

51
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,236
Hey, Taylor's not joining us?

52
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:49,436
Nope.

53
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:50,769
Lucky her.

54
00:01:50,836 --> 00:01:53,035
Sorry this isn't up to
your standards, honey.

55
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:55,169
I'm a little short
on cash right now.

56
00:01:55,236 --> 00:01:56,603
So why'd you leave New Match?

57
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:59,102
Because Kirsten and I are better friends
than business partners, okay?

58
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:00,536
Could we just leave it at that?

59
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:04,936
Excuse me.

60
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:10,002
Five people in this house and I
end up eating dinner by myself.

61
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:12,202
Hi.

62
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:14,803
So we're still on
for Friday, right?

63
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,669
Well, I don't like sneaking
around either,

64
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:21,636
but we don't have much of
a choice, do we?

65
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:24,035
I know, I miss you, too.
(Che chanting)

66
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,402
What?

67
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:27,703
Oh, no, that's just
Summer's boyfriend Che.

68
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:30,302
Hold on, um, I'll go outside,
okay?

69
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,436
Che, what are you doing?

70
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:55,803
The I-Ching was devised by
ancient Chinese mystics

71
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,069
as a way to interpret
the invisible current
of the universe.

72
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:01,903
What are you trying
to figure out?

73
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,402
I had a dream, Summer...

74
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:08,636
...in which my soul mate
was revealed to me.

75
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:10,569
That's great.

76
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:13,903
It's great, but...
it's complicated.

77
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,269
I must be certain--

78
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:18,069
Dragon on a mountaintop.

79
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:19,436
That's interesting.

80
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:24,636
Um... Che?

81
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:26,836
Nothing against
Chinese mystics,

82
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:29,102
but, uh, if you want to find out
if someone's your soul mate,

83
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,636
why don't you just try
spending time with them?

84
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:32,369
You think that's what
I should do?

85
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:34,002
Yeah. Why not?

86
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:35,469
See if you have
anything in common.

87
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:40,836
Because the day after tomorrow
is Groundhog Day

88
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:44,436
and I'm planning a little
black ops mission to free
Newport Chuck.

89
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:46,035
The groundhog?
Yeah.

90
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:47,369
You've heard of this travesty?

91
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,936
I've heard about
the festival.

92
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:51,769
They put him onstage
with the mayor
and if he sees his shadow,

93
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:53,202
it means six more
weeks of winter.

94
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:55,569
Which is crazy considering
we don't even have winter
to begin with.

95
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,970
But I think they treat him okay.

96
00:03:57,035 --> 00:04:00,135
No, 364 days a year, little
duder is stuck in a cage.

97
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:02,169
Now he gets to play circus freak
for a day?

98
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:03,870
No, that's absolutely criminal.

99
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:04,435
OK

100
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:07,569
Just don't involve me
'cause that's how I got
kicked out of Brown.

101
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:09,636
You coming to dinner?
No, go without me.
Summer...

102
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:11,803
besides getting you
kicked out of college,

103
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,035
you know I'd never
do anything to hurt you.

104
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:17,736
Of course.

105
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:21,135
I'll see you
in a little bit.

106
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,369
Tomorrow, brother.

107
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,102
Tomorrow...

108
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,102
we'll get this whole thing
figured out.

109
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:39,436
That, right there,
is grasshopper at night.

110
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:40,769
Are you sure you
don't want to come?

111
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:43,302
Watching a movie about a guy
eating a live octopus?

112
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:44,336
I think I'll pass.

113
00:04:44,403 --> 00:04:47,336
It's also got one of the greatest
fight sequences
in probably
the last five years.

114
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:48,669
Oh, yeah,
that'll convince her.

115
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:52,569
Listen, Mom, what better way
to see out your 30s than a little South
Korean shock cinema?

116
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:54,336
So tempting.

117
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:56,469
You're going to be late.
You better go.

118
00:05:06,836 --> 00:05:08,703
Oh, hi, it's Kirsten Cohen.

119
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:10,936
I was wondering if Dr. Harris
could see me; it's urgent.

120
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:12,102
<i>SETH:
Are you sure it's</i>
all right to leave her?</i>

121
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:13,135
<i>She seems a little down.</i>

122
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:14,669
Oh, she's turning 40.

123
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:17,970
Even for a woman as beautiful
as your mother,
that's not easy.

124
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,102
Well, maybe we
should stay.

125
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:20,769
No, trust me.

126
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:22,736
Right now, all she wants
is a little time alone

127
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:24,870
to process everything.
You don't think she
knows about the party?

128
00:05:24,936 --> 00:05:27,035
What? No.
Are you kidding me?

129
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:29,135
Nobody plans a surprise
party like Sandy Cohen.

130
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:30,402
I could've been
with the CIA.

131
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:33,469
I hear they're known
for their birthday parties.

136
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:32,936
Che, what are you...?

137
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:35,036
I mean, this is real, right?
This isn't a dream?

138
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,136
Unless this whole
life is a dream.

139
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:39,203
But, no, for our purposes,
you are awake.

140
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:43,436
Seth, how do you feel about
the subjugation of animals?

141
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,936
Um...

142
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:47,570
I hate it.
When you hear

143
00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:50,735
that a fellow mammal
is being exploited
for cheap entertainment

144
00:06:50,802 --> 00:06:53,503
instead of being allowed
to burrow
in the soft soil
of Mother Earth,

145
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,103
does it make you want
to tear your hair out?

146
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:57,203
Mm-hmm.
Well, then rise
and shine, brother,

147
00:06:57,269 --> 00:06:59,735
for the clarion call of justice
has rung across the land.

148
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,069
I'm glad I don't sleep naked.

149
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,269
Yeah, me, too.

150
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,269
I didn't think about that.

151
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,136
You could've had...

152
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:13,902
<i>Tell him you want</i>
to feel his butt.</i>

153
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:17,136
<i>Yeah, say how you can't wait to
get two big</i> handfuls of butt.

154
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,669
Okay, you guys,
that's gross.

155
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:20,602
I'm supposed to be
my mom, okay?

156
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:21,735
Exactly.

157
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:24,769
Look, you want this guy
to think your mom
loves him, right?

158
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:27,103
This is how adults
talk to each other.

159
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:29,735
I've been e-mailing Bullit as
my mom for, like, a month now.

160
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:33,169
You don't think it'd be
a little weird
if I randomly asked him
about his butt?

161
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:35,570
No. It just shows that
she cares for him.

162
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:36,836
And his butt.

163
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:40,635
Do you guys not realize
how much you talk about
other guys' butts?

164
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:42,103
Do you want your mom to close
the deal or not?

165
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,303
(typing)
"I miss your butt.

166
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:49,470
Love, Julie."

167
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,869
Awesome.
Awesome.

168
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:58,136
Hey. You busy?
No.

169
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:00,203
I'm just going in to pick up
Kirsten's birthday present.

170
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:01,602
Thought you might
want to come along.

171
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:02,902
You know,
grab some lunch.

172
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:04,669
Ah, yeah, sure.

173
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:05,536
Is everything okay?

174
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:06,802
Mm-hmm. Fine.

175
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:11,269
How are you doing with all
that's going on with Taylor?

176
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:12,836
Okay.

177
00:08:12,902 --> 00:08:14,002
Are you sure?

178
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,136
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,

179
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,769
she says she needs time.
I get it.

180
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:18,802
I got plenty of other things
to keep me busy.

181
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:23,203
Sandy, I'm fine.
I'm not sitting around
missing her if that's
what you're asking.

182
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,169
All right.

183
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:26,269
Okay.

184
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:27,303
Good.
Yep.

185
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:29,236
Let's say half an hour?
Yep.

186
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:30,403
All right.

187
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:45,836
I need help, Doctor.

188
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,303
Well, Taylor,
admitting that

189
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:49,203
is the first step
in recovery.

190
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,136
But tell me, how did
you hear about me?

191
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:54,702
Oh, I read your article about
emotional addictions
<i>in The Journal</i>
of Abstract Thought.</i>

192
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,169
I saw you teach at UCI,
and it just kind of
seemed like fate.

193
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:00,869
And you think that
you're suffering from
an emotional addiction?

194
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:03,236
Yeah, pretty much
all my life.

195
00:09:03,303 --> 00:09:05,902
'Cause I never
really knew my dad
and my mom is...

196
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:08,036
kind of like Idi Amin
with fake boobs.

197
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:11,236
You know, big on the
torturing and the tyranny,
not so big
on the nurturing.

198
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:13,403
I see.
And then from there,
I just kind of became

199
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,103
this person who whenever
anybody would hold out, like,

200
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:18,203
the slightest prospect
of emotional support,
I would just seize on it.

201
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,802
Like, I married a man
who I knew for two weeks
just because he told me
he loved me.

202
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:23,570
And how has that manifest
itself now?

203
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:25,836
Well, I'm dating this guy, Ryan.

204
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:29,735
And he's just really wonderful
and...

205
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,136
I really care about him a lot,

206
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,536
but I told him that
I needed some space because...

207
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:37,036
Because you know
that you're not ready

208
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:39,136
for a mature relationship
and you don't want to ruin it?

209
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,036
Yes. Exactly.

210
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,236
And how has that been?

211
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:42,369
This time apart?

212
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:45,802
Well, that's kind of
the other problem.

213
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:47,069
Um...

214
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:50,436
sometimes, when I like someone,
I... sometimes...

215
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:54,136
kind of, uh, stalk them.

216
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:55,735
Uh-huh.

217
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:57,570
<i>Not in like a scary Star 80</i> way.

218
00:09:57,635 --> 00:09:59,203
Just to, you know, like,
follow them around

219
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:03,470
and take pictures
and log their activities
and then compile it all
in a factually accurate,

220
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,669
yet aesthetically pleasing
scrapbook,
and it's all really very...

221
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:08,136
Oh, my God, I'm a total lunatic.

222
00:10:08,203 --> 00:10:09,836
Taylor, you are not a lunatic.

223
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:14,136
You recognize that this behavior
is not healthy and you want to correct it.

224
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:15,602
I do.
I really, really do.

225
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:16,902
All right, well...

226
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:20,336
as you know, from my article,
my methods are very aggressive.

227
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:23,936
Okay.

228
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:25,635
I'm in your hands, Doctor.

229
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,635
What are you doing?

230
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,269
Neil and I bought
these in Cabo.

231
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,536
I'm selling them.

232
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:39,702
Why?

233
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:42,103
Because times are tough,
Kaitlin.

234
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:44,503
Well, do I need to remind you
that your boyfriend's
a billionaire?

235
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,602
No, he's not.
I mean...

236
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:48,436
Are you cheating on Bullit?

237
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:50,702
No, I'm not even dating him.

238
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,869
That fizzled when
he went to Dubai.

239
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:54,136
Oh.

240
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:55,536
Well, he thinks you guys
are still dating.

241
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:57,869
Have you been
talking to him?

242
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:00,002
No. Just a couple e-mails.

243
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,802
And what have you
told him?

244
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:02,969
Nothing.

245
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:04,969
Just... I know
he really likes you.

246
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:07,002
And I know he thinks you guys
are still a couple.

247
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,203
But wait, are you
seeing anyone else?

248
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:11,836
That's none of
your business.

249
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:14,002
Fine.

250
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:16,136
Okay, well, what are you going
to tell the Bullit?

251
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:17,303
'Cause he comes back today.

252
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:21,570
Will you please answer that?

253
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:30,470
Julie Cooper?

254
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:32,136
Um... yeah.

255
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:33,902
Thank you.

256
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,203
"Can't wait till tomorrow night.

257
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,969
Miss you already."

258
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:55,902
Mrs. Cohen,
thanks for waiting.

259
00:11:57,203 --> 00:12:00,169
So, tell me what's going on?

260
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:03,702
Well, the last few weeks
I've been feeling weak...

261
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,536
just drained of energy.

262
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:08,570
There's been
some nausea
and light-headedness.

263
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:10,936
Now, I have to ask:
have you been drinking?

264
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:13,902
Not a drop.
And has there
been any undue stress?

265
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:15,702
No.
I mean, not more than usual.

266
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,470
Well, let's take some blood.

267
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,602
Then we'll be able
to tell you something.

268
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:23,635
Ooh, you turn 40 tomorrow.

269
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:25,869
Happy birthday.

270
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:28,203
Thanks.

271
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:42,136
SETH:
You're crazy.

272
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:44,203
Seth...
I thought you wanted

273
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:45,836
to release turtles into
the ocean or something.

274
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:47,503
I'm not going to help you
steal Newport Chuck.

275
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,336
Why, 'cause he looks so happy
down there?

276
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:52,570
I don't know,
he seems
to be doing all right
with the free carrot deal.

277
00:12:57,503 --> 00:12:59,103
Well, I see this was a mistake.

278
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:01,602
I guess we don't have all that
much in common after all.

279
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:05,002
Oh, well.

280
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,503
Who knows what might have been.

281
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,403
Oh, God. Fine. Okay.

282
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,136
What?

283
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:15,269
You know, you helped me
heal my inner otter, I owe you.

284
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:17,536
You mean, you want to help?

285
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:20,103
Yeah, that's it--
I feel we have a bond.

286
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:22,436
So what's the plan?

287
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,869
Hey, Peanut.

288
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:26,002
I just left the airport.

289
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:27,602
We need to talk.

290
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:30,369
Not if it's about that duty-free
booze you asked me to buy.

291
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:37,635
No, it's definitely
not about that.

292
00:13:37,702 --> 00:13:40,036
There's a little something
that I should talk to you about.

293
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:42,869
Okay, then why don't you
meet me at the jewelry store.

294
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:44,436
What are you talking about?

295
00:13:44,503 --> 00:13:47,103
Well, Squirt, I liked
your mother before I left,

296
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:51,036
but these e-mails I've been
getting lately,
especially the last one...

297
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:54,269
let's just say,
I like the way her mind works.

298
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:56,069
Yes, she is the girl for me.

299
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:59,103
You're going to ask her
to marry you?

300
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:00,602
Oh, damn am.

301
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:02,036
Why? What were you going
to tell me?

302
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:03,735
Nothing.

303
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,836
She loves anything
that's an emerald cut.

304
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:08,470
So you're saying
I should ask her?

305
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:11,503
Yeah, absolutely.

306
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,769
You should totally ask her.

307
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,303
Totally.

308
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,634
--You saved a valet ticket?

309
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:24,268
Oh, yeah, that's from
our third date.

310
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:25,601
He's a very
generous tipper.

311
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:27,835
You wouldn't know it
to look at him.

312
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,668
What's this?

313
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,068
Toothpick.

314
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:32,601
Gross.

315
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:35,402
Well, he didn't
use it... much.

316
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:37,968
Okay, Taylor...

317
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:43,302
although I wholeheartedly support you
getting rid of everything in this box
for purely sanitary reasons,

318
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:48,168
If you like Ryan and he likes you,
screw the therapist and figure out
your stuff together.

319
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,935
I mean, all of this
just seems a little insane.

320
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:53,935
Summer, my whole life I've been
completely powerless

321
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:55,935
before people who say they have
feelings for me.

322
00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:59,202
I feel like I need to do this
for myself
as much as for me and Ryan.

323
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:01,268
Even if you lose him?

324
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,768
If I don't do this,
I'm going to lose him anyway.

325
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,268
I don't have a choice.

326
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:11,068
Okay.

327
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:13,668
Well, I hope you know
what you're doing.

328
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:24,469
Yeah.

329
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:26,868
Me, too.

330
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:37,668
Kaitlin.

331
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:39,435
Ryan.

332
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:40,501
Hi.

333
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:42,469
Hey.
You buying some jewelry?

334
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:45,268
Yeah, just buying
some class rings.

335
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:46,335
Are you here with someone?

336
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:47,801
No. Are you?

337
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:50,735
Yeah, Sandy's buying part of
Kirsten's birthday present.

338
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:53,002
Hey, how's Taylor been?

339
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:55,202
Well... weird.

340
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:56,435
Weird like...?

341
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:57,735
Weirder than normal.

342
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:00,735
Really?
Yeah.
A little bit.

343
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,901
Hi, Mr. Cohen.
Kaitlin, you coming
to the party tomorrow?

344
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:04,235
Um, yeah, totally.

345
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:07,135
Listen, I got to go,
but I'll see you guys.

346
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,835
Everything okay?
No.

347
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,302
The guy in Carson.

348
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:12,668
I just got a message.

349
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:13,935
He lost it.

350
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:15,235
He lost it?

351
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:16,435
Yeah.

352
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:18,469
I don't know
how you do that.

353
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:22,402
The hell you hiding from?

354
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:24,835
You scared me.

355
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,735
Well, quit hiding
out in the shadows
like some
Al Quaeda wacko.

356
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:29,601
I just thought I saw my mom.

357
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:31,335
So what'd you
end up getting?

358
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:34,601
Yeah, I did.
How you like that?

359
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:36,801
Wow.
Is it the most expensive one?

360
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:38,968
Well, Bullit bought it.
Of course it is.

361
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:40,268
And your mama deserves it.

362
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:41,268
Good. All right.

363
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,402
Now let's talk about
that proposal.

364
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:43,701
No, I got it worked out.

365
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:47,701
This Iranian fellow
on my flight
played me this Persian
love song on his cell phone.

366
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:49,102
So I downloaded it.

367
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:50,835
Check that out.
(chuckling)

368
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:54,002
Whoa, huh?

369
00:16:54,068 --> 00:16:56,435
Mm-hmm, let's definitely talk
about that proposal.

370
00:16:57,901 --> 00:16:59,002
It's gonna work.

371
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:12,568
No, once the truck is outside
for the ceremony tomorrow,

372
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:13,868
there's going to be
too many eyes.

373
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:15,668
The best bet is to
break into the lobby

374
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,402
and take him from the city hall.
But the door is locked.

375
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:19,668
The main door's locked, yes.

376
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:21,868
But yesterday, I took a tour
of the city hall

377
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:24,302
and I taped the lock on
the fire door on the roof.

378
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,302
How is that tour by the way?
I've always wondered.

379
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,634
You know,
it's surprisingly good.

380
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:29,935
Good local history,
doesn't get too anecdotal.

381
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:31,369
Oh, great.
How do we get on the roof?

382
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:32,735
Oh.

383
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,335
Hmm?

384
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:35,568
You know what this is?

385
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:37,369
A grappling hook.

386
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,268
I climbed Denali last year.

387
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:40,235
It's an Outward
Bound course.

388
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:41,601
This is gonna be
like a piece of cake.

389
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:43,135
I've never climbed.

390
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:44,402
I brought
a papoose for you.

391
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:47,568
Oh, great.
Okay, so we
climb on the roof,
we break in,

392
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,068
we break Chuck
out of his cage,

393
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,235
we climb down the roof.

394
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,435
And return him to the savannahs
of his childhood.

395
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:54,469
I actually heard he was captured
in Irvine, but just one thing...

396
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:55,701
Yeah.

397
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:57,068
You know this plan
is insane, right?

398
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:58,102
It'll never work.

399
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:02,102
Seth, when the universe intends
for something to happen,

400
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,469
it will happen.

401
00:18:04,534 --> 00:18:06,601
How about a pre-op snow cone?

402
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,335
Oh, great.
I'm talking your
language now, huh?

403
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:11,268
You like snow cones?
I like... my favorite
flavor is cherry,

404
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:12,501
but my dad's
is blueberry.

405
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:15,135
Hi.

406
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:16,268
Are you Ryan Atwood?

407
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:17,302
Yeah. Can I help you?

408
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:18,501
This is from Taylor.

409
00:18:18,568 --> 00:18:20,002
O... kay.

410
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:21,102
Excuse me.

411
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,335
Wait.

412
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,601
Who are you?

413
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:25,634
Dr. James.

414
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:27,435
I'm helping Taylor
through some issues.

415
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:28,868
So you're her therapist.

416
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:31,235
More of an emotional
crisis manager.

417
00:18:31,302 --> 00:18:33,168
And she gave you...

418
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:34,235
Is she in your car?

419
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:37,369
Uh, Mr. Atwood...

420
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:39,235
Taylor, what is this?
What's going on?

421
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:42,634
Ryan, I have instructed her
that she should have
no direct contact
with you for one week.

422
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,068
Uh, okay, but she's right here.

423
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:45,534
Taylor. Taylor.

424
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,801
Can you just please tell him
that I'm sorry,

425
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:49,835
but I really think this is
what's best for me and us?

426
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:51,202
Ryan, she's sorry,

427
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,534
but she...
Yeah, I heard that.

428
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:53,901
Taylor, would you
talk to me, please?

429
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:55,335
This is crazy.

430
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:58,568
All right, would you at least
tell me what this is about?

431
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:00,701
Are you breaking up
with me?

432
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,901
She asks that you trust
her for a while longer.

433
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:07,935
(sighs):
Taylor, look,

434
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:09,501
whatever the reason
you're doing all this,

435
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:11,501
you don't have to--
we can work on it together.

436
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,235
Please.

437
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:15,102
Please.

438
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:21,102
Good-bye, Ryan.

439
00:19:21,168 --> 00:19:22,735
Does that mean...
(engine starts)

440
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:23,901
Okay, you're gonna...

441
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:47,268
Hey, little buddy.

442
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:49,268
Che.

443
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:50,335
Che.

444
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,968
What was wrong
with the elevator?

445
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:59,002
Nothing.

446
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:00,801
I just really love doing that.

447
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,268
Hey, little duder.

448
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,768
(rattling)
What was that?

449
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:07,302
Let's get... let's get it out.

450
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:12,501
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

451
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:16,801
Okay, where are the ropes?

452
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:19,235
I left them inside.

453
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,469
Dude...

454
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:21,668
No, it's all right.

455
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:23,402
Uh... relax.
I'll go get them.

456
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:25,568
Here.
Do you want to...?
Give it here.

457
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:32,634
(whistles):
Hey.

458
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,568
There some sort of problem?

459
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,501
Uh...

460
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,668
it is possible
that the piece of tape

461
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:40,068
I put over the lock
got torn through.

462
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:43,402
So are you saying
we're stuck up here?

463
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:44,901
No.

464
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:47,302
As long as I can...

465
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:50,102
Yeah.

466
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,902
--Get out.

467
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:13,501
Che, what are you doing?

468
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:15,369
I didn't mean to wake you up.

469
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:16,701
I'm meditating over a dream.

470
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:20,434
You realize this is
the second time you and I have

471
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:21,935
spent the
night together?
So?

472
00:21:22,002 --> 00:21:26,002
So... does that mean
anything to you?

473
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:30,534
You'll be going
on your little adventures
by yourself from now on?

474
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:36,501
Seth...

475
00:21:36,568 --> 00:21:38,002
when the universe...

476
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:40,668
intends for something
to happen...

477
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:43,501
<i>...it will</i> happen,

478
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:48,735
and our personal desires
or natural predilections,
they just don't
figure in.

479
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:50,002
In fact...

480
00:21:53,035 --> 00:21:54,968
there's something that I've
been meaning to tell you.

481
00:21:56,968 --> 00:21:59,501
This belong to you two?

482
00:22:00,468 --> 00:22:01,701
Crouch behind me.

483
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:05,534
Oh! Happy birthday,
sweetheart.

484
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:06,868
Thanks.

485
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:08,534
Hey. Come on. Sit down.

486
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:11,434
I am making you
a birthday breakfast
you won't believe.

487
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:12,835
Oh, that's sweet,
but, Sandy,

488
00:22:12,902 --> 00:22:15,002
I don't think I'm
in the mood for a big breakfast.

489
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:16,768
Oh, you're taking this
turning-40 thing a little hard,

490
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,701
aren't you? You know, it's not
the end of the world.

491
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:20,534
You're more beautiful now
than the day we met.

492
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:22,601
Soon, Seth and Ryan'll be gone.

493
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:24,235
We'll be able to do
whatever we want.

494
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,269
We'll be like kids again.

495
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:26,735
And live in the back
of a mail truck?

496
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:27,968
Why not?

497
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:30,735
'Course, maybe we'll throw in
a pillow-top mattress.

498
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,135
My back's not what
it used to be.

499
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:35,135
Sandy...

500
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:37,768
Hey!

501
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:39,035
Happy
birthday.
Oh...

502
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:42,534
Hey, thanks.

503
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:45,102
Did I interrupt something?

504
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:46,601
No.
No!

505
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:48,269
Okay.

506
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,269
Oh.

507
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:53,701
Excuse me.

508
00:22:53,768 --> 00:22:55,501
Hey, dinner
reservations 8:00.

509
00:22:55,568 --> 00:22:57,135
Don't make any plans.

510
00:22:57,202 --> 00:22:58,302
Any luck yet?

511
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:00,801
Nothing. I must've made
30 calls yesterday.

512
00:23:00,868 --> 00:23:03,534
All right.
Well, anything you need me
to do today, I'm all yours.

513
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:05,568
Thanks.

514
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:06,935
I feel she really needs this.

515
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:11,768
Of course I can see
the doctor today,
but can't she just tell me?

516
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:17,135
I understand.
She wants to tell me in person.

517
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:20,768
Hi, babe.

518
00:23:20,835 --> 00:23:22,269
Mom, where are you?

519
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:24,468
I'm at the spa getting
shined and buffed. What's up?

520
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:26,335
What does it feel like
when your appendix bursts?

521
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:30,468
<i>I don't feel</i> proud.

522
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,668
Well, you should be.

523
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:34,002
What you did yesterday
was very difficult.

524
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:35,668
Yeah, but the look
on his face...

525
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:37,002
I just wanted
to hold him.

526
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:39,468
And you will, but first you
have to take care of yourself.

527
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:41,801
Excuse me.

528
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:43,168
Hello.

529
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:44,501
Yes.

530
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:45,801
Oh.

531
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:47,035
All right.

532
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:48,168
Listen, I've got to go.

533
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:49,434
Another patient's
having a crisis.

534
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:50,501
But we'll talk later.

535
00:23:50,568 --> 00:23:51,534
Okay.
All right.

536
00:23:58,568 --> 00:24:00,835
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Sorry about that.

537
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:03,002
You guys must be getting
ready for the festival.

538
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,534
Yeah. Thanks.
Uh... okay.

539
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:05,835
Come on, guys,
let's go. Uh...

540
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,168
We don't want
to be late.

541
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:14,168
Kaitlin?

542
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:15,335
Mom, I'm fine.

543
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:17,235
What? Wh...?

544
00:24:19,202 --> 00:24:21,168
What are all these
flowers doing here?

545
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:23,835
There's someone who wants
to ask you something.

546
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:26,035
What are you
talking about?

547
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:27,068
There you are.

548
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:28,168
Gordon!?

549
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:29,501
You are a sight for sore eyes.

550
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,968
Come to Big Daddy.

551
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:32,235
Okay, everybody stop.

552
00:24:32,302 --> 00:24:34,935
What is going on?
You're not dying and...

553
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:36,568
Gordon, what are
you doing here?

554
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:38,401
It's time, squirt.
Hit it.

555
00:24:38,468 --> 00:24:40,168
I really don't think
that it's...

556
00:24:40,235 --> 00:24:41,534
Trust me.
Hit it.

557
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:43,102
Okay.

558
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:47,035
Oh. My God.

559
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:49,068
Julie Cooper,

560
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:52,302
I've traveled
the world over,
had everything
money can buy,

561
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:56,635
but there comes a time
in a billionaire's life
that his money
ain't worth a dime

562
00:24:56,701 --> 00:25:00,002
unless he has someone
to share it with.

563
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:02,202
Will you marry me?

564
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:10,168
I don't know what to say.

565
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:12,434
Oh, a "yes" works for me.

566
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:13,601
Mom, isn't this great?

567
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:16,369
Y... I-it's very, very nice,

568
00:25:16,434 --> 00:25:17,501
but, please, stand up.

569
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,601
Um...

570
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:20,501
I'm, I'm flattered, but...

571
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:21,868
w-will you turn
that off, please?

572
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:23,068
Okay.

573
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:24,102
Fine.

574
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:25,801
Thank you.

575
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:28,534
I guess I'm just surprised.

576
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:30,468
Well, when I see
something I want,

577
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:33,235
I go for it like a bullet. Bang.

578
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,968
But, Gordon, we haven't spoken
since you went to Dubai.

579
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:40,002
Mom, he just asked you
to marry him.

580
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:41,468
I mean... look at the ring.

581
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:42,735
It's ri-dog-ulous.

582
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:44,601
An-and what about
all those e-mails?

583
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:49,202
I've never seen so many
X's and O's and that would be
hugs and kisses, right?

584
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:50,868
W-what e-mails?

585
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:53,068
You know, the music was
actually really awesome.

586
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,235
GORDON:
And especially
that last one--
you know the one,

587
00:25:56,302 --> 00:25:57,801
where you said...

588
00:26:04,968 --> 00:26:06,468
Oh, crap.

589
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:17,935
Hello.
Caterpillar.

590
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:19,835
Che, oh, my God,
he looks so sad.

591
00:26:19,902 --> 00:26:20,968
Who?

592
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:22,434
Newport Chuck.
I'm looking at him

593
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:24,601
right now-- I thought you were
going to rescue him.

594
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:26,801
Well, things didn't go
exactly as planned.

595
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:29,434
Are you at the pier right now?
Yeah. They're setting up

596
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:31,468
for the ceremony right now.
Where are you?

597
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:32,468
The Man caught me.

598
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:34,369
What?
You're in jail, Che?

599
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:35,935
No, don't. No, don't
worry about me.

600
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:38,202
You have to focus on Chuck.
He needs you right now.

601
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:40,468
Caterpillar, you have
to rescue him.

602
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:42,501
No. Che, I told you
not to involve me.

603
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:47,002
Sometimes, Summer...

604
00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:49,801
our destiny is chosen for us.

605
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:52,235
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

606
00:26:52,302 --> 00:26:53,302
Okay.

607
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:56,501
It's all you.

608
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,168
I was next.

609
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:04,335
Who should I call?

610
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:06,968
<i>TAYLOR:
I see. So, who else</i>

611
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:09,701
is on stage other than the mayor
and, obviously, Newport Chuck?

612
00:27:09,768 --> 00:27:11,302
Well, a couple
of the mayor's men,

613
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,369
some city
council members,
a few police officers.

614
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:15,568
And so, uh, that's it?

615
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:19,369
Mmm. Wait. There's
also a few people
dressed as groundhogs.

616
00:27:21,135 --> 00:27:23,035
What paper did you
say you're with?

617
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:25,401
<i>Uh... Groundhog's Day Weekly.</i>

618
00:27:25,468 --> 00:27:27,868
which comes out once a year,
usually around...

619
00:27:27,935 --> 00:27:28,635
Groundhog Day?

620
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:30,202
Yes. Thank you so much.

621
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:31,235
Mmm.

622
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,768
You were e-mailing him
and pretending to be me?

623
00:27:43,835 --> 00:27:46,635
I just know you
don't deal well
with long-distance
relationships.

624
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:47,868
I thought you
might regret it.

625
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:49,335
Really? That's the reason?

626
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,835
Has nothing to do with you being
sick of eating frozen dinners?

627
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:55,102
What? And your saying
no has nothing to do
with the fact you're
seeing a mystery man?

628
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:57,801
A.) I never said no.

629
00:27:57,868 --> 00:28:00,135
B.) That is my private life.

630
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:03,035
Kaitlin, there is more to
relationships than just money.

631
00:28:03,102 --> 00:28:05,434
I don't care for The Bullit
just because he's a billionaire.

632
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,235
Maybe I care a little bit.

633
00:28:08,302 --> 00:28:12,335
But the reason why I would've
told him to marry you
is because I know he loves you,

634
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:15,335
and he's a
really nice guy,
and he's really funny...

635
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:19,902
...and he'd make
an amazing step-dad.

636
00:28:34,835 --> 00:28:37,235
You have to tell
him the truth.

637
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:38,735
What are you
gonna tell him?

638
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:41,302
I don't know.

639
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:46,701
Well, better make up
your mind quick...

640
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:51,468
...'cause I'm taking him with me
to Kirsten's party.

641
00:29:07,434 --> 00:29:08,401
Hello.

642
00:29:08,468 --> 00:29:10,401
Kirsten. I need your help.

643
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:11,434
Uh-huh.

644
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:12,468
Oh. Happy birthday.

645
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:13,635
Thanks.

646
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:15,534
Bullit just proposed to me.

647
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:16,534
That's nice.

648
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:19,369
I told him I'd give him
an answer by tonight,
but the truth is...

649
00:29:21,235 --> 00:29:22,968
...I've been seeing
someone else in secret.

650
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:24,269
You'll never believe who.

651
00:29:24,335 --> 00:29:25,501
Julie, I'm, I'm gonna lie down.

652
00:29:25,568 --> 00:29:26,735
Congratulations.

653
00:29:34,568 --> 00:29:36,501
That was a guy
at the junkyard at Chatsworth.

654
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:38,168
He's got one.

655
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,835
<i>He says</i> he can have it
at the yacht club in an hour.

656
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:42,235
Sounds like everything's
gonna be okay.

657
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:43,534
Well, let's hope.

658
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:49,168
What's going on
with you and Taylor?

659
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:53,202
Come on. You've been
in the dumps today.

660
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:55,235
Honestly, I don't know.

661
00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:58,335
She said she needs
space; I said, "Sure."

662
00:29:58,401 --> 00:29:59,335
TAYLOR (muffled):
Stupid tree.

663
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:01,468
Oh... dumb branches.

664
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,668
RYAN:
I sort of
talked to her.

665
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,202
Taylor was right
there, right?

666
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:07,902
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah;
but she wasn't
supposed to be
talking to me.

667
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,835
She would say
something and then
the therapist would
say it again to me.

668
00:30:15,902 --> 00:30:17,868
Wow.

669
00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:18,968
It's crazy, huh?

670
00:30:19,035 --> 00:30:21,002
SANDY:
Yeah. I mean, a little, but...

671
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:23,434
And, I mean, I want her
to do what she needs to do.

672
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:24,568
Did you tell her that?

673
00:30:24,635 --> 00:30:25,768
I tried.
(phone ringing)

674
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:26,868
Excuse me.
Yeah, sure.

675
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:29,801
SANDY:
Yeah, hello. Seth?

676
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:30,968
Where are you?

677
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:39,902
Oh, no...

678
00:30:40,902 --> 00:30:43,168
Oh, whoa, you...

679
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:44,269
You okay?

680
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:45,902
Taylor?

681
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:48,902
What are you doing?

682
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:51,868
I was just...

683
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:52,835
Taylor, are you okay?

684
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:55,568
I'm sorry. Just...

685
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:56,935
forget you ever knew me.

686
00:31:02,035 --> 00:31:04,568
--Newport Plaza turned
into a crime scene today

687
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:07,302
as a young woman
dressed up as a groundhog

688
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,668
grabbed Newport Chuck
and made a dash for it.

689
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:12,269
And, while Newport's
beloved groundhog

690
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:14,935
has yet to be recovered,
the Newport Police Department

691
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:17,102
has taken a woman into custody

692
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:20,434
whom they believe
to be the kidnapper.

693
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:21,968
My dad said
he'll be right over.

694
00:31:22,035 --> 00:31:23,968
What about me?
Don't worry, Dale.

695
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:25,002
He knows
you're here, too.

696
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:27,035
But I don't wanna leave.

697
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:32,135
Seth, I haven't
been honest with you.

698
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:36,534
Uh... remember
in the sweat lodge

699
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:41,068
when you discovered that
your animus was a sea otter?

700
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:42,168
Mm-hmm.

701
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:43,902
Well...

702
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,534
see, I had a dream
that night, too.

703
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:49,902
Uh... and I discovered
that my animal self
was a bullfrog.

704
00:31:49,968 --> 00:31:51,302
Oh.

705
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:53,235
And, uh...
Oh, that's awesome;
frogs are cool.

706
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:55,735
Yeah, but there's, there's
kinda more to it.

707
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:56,601
See... (clears throat)

708
00:31:59,302 --> 00:32:05,568
I also discovered that the
animus of my soul mate...

709
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:07,835
CHE:
Well, see, my...

710
00:32:07,902 --> 00:32:10,534
in the dream, my bullfrog

711
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:15,535
was in love...

712
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,135
w-with...

713
00:32:40,568 --> 00:32:41,768
...a groundhog.

714
00:32:46,768 --> 00:32:49,035
It wasn't an otter at all.

715
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:51,735
What? Wha-What wasn't an otter?

716
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:53,302
Uh...

717
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:54,902
Never mind.

718
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:56,768
(chuckles):
No, nothing. What?

719
00:32:56,835 --> 00:32:58,202
You were gonna say...  Che!
Never mind.

720
00:32:58,269 --> 00:32:59,235
Che, what wasn't an otter?

721
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,168
I ate a squirrel once.

722
00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:28,701
That's great.

723
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:33,035
Cohen, Cook,
someone's posted bail for you.

724
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:34,102
Whew!

725
00:33:35,468 --> 00:33:36,935
You coming?

726
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:39,501
No, you go.

727
00:33:39,568 --> 00:33:41,801
I'm not leaving
till we're both free.

728
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:43,501
Works for me.

729
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:58,135
Sandy, where have you been?

730
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,534
I called you three times.

731
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:01,302
Well, it's been
a busy afternoon.

732
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:04,269
Please tell me that you haven't
planned anything big tonight.

733
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:06,434
<i>Well, on your</i> birthday, sorry,
but I plead the Fifth.

734
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:08,302
Listen, can you meet me
at the yacht club?

735
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:09,635
I thought
we were going together.

736
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:11,902
Yeah, I know, but I had to make
other arrangements.

737
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,635
Sandy...

738
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:16,102
I'll see you
in a few minutes.

739
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:19,434
Hi, Dad. I hope I'm not
late for Mom's party.

740
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:24,435
--Kirsten Cohen?

741
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:26,768
Yes?
I'm here to take you
to your husband.

742
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:35,035
<i>RYAN:
I cannot believe that you tried</i>
to steal Newport Chuck.</i>

743
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:38,901
<i>Sometimes the universe
makes you do things that
you</i> don't even understand.

744
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:41,502
Sure. Well, Sandy didn't
seem to upset about it.

745
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:45,535
Are you kidding?
He's waited 18 years
for me to be arrested
for political activism.

746
00:34:45,602 --> 00:34:48,101
It's probably the proudest
moment of his entire life.

747
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:50,268
Ah!

748
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,302
It's your mom.

749
00:34:53,502 --> 00:34:55,701
Good evening.
Good evening.

750
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:57,268
Thank you.
You're welcome.

751
00:34:57,335 --> 00:34:59,001
Happy birthday.
Oh, thank you.

752
00:34:59,068 --> 00:35:02,701
I hope your father didn't do
anything too extravagant.

753
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,202
Ooh, might be
(laughing)

754
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,302
a little late
for that, yeah.

755
00:35:08,868 --> 00:35:10,035
(laughs)

756
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,635
Oh, my God.

757
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:15,202
Yeah, that was
my first thought, too.

758
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:22,868
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

759
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:24,302
Oh...

760
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:26,901
Sandy, it's...

761
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:29,268
No, it's not
the same mail truck
we had at Berkeley,

762
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,801
but it is exactly
the same model.

763
00:35:30,868 --> 00:35:32,635
It's amazing.

764
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:37,935
Thank you.
And here's your real present.

765
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,901
Happy birthday.

766
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:42,901
Around-the-world
first-class air tickets.

767
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:44,001
Just you and me.

768
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:47,400
That's not bad, huh?

769
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:48,867
Ah...

770
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:51,767
I-I think I can...
I can top it.

771
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:54,200
Can I talk to
you in private?

772
00:35:54,267 --> 00:35:55,367
Yeah.

773
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:56,534
You two stay here.

774
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,801
Fellas, watch the truck.

775
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,068
Okay.

776
00:36:04,101 --> 00:36:06,034
I want you seated for this.

777
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:07,534
Is everything okay?

778
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,434
I went to a doctor.

779
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:12,200
Are you sick?

780
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:13,567
Yes.

781
00:36:13,634 --> 00:36:15,767
But only in the mornings.

782
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:17,400
What?

783
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,101
I'm pregnant.

784
00:36:21,168 --> 00:36:23,934
Wait, one more time.

785
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:26,767
Sandy, we're having a baby.

786
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:28,767
We're having a baby?!

787
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:31,567
Everything's gonna change.

788
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:33,233
You're not kidding.

789
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:38,767
I love you.

790
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:42,001
Well, that's good,
because there's gonna be
a lot more of me to love.

791
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,567
Oh, my gosh.

792
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:55,567
And then Brad was, like,
"Oh, no,"

793
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:57,434
and I was, like,
"Oh, yeah."

794
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,267
Well, that Brad sounds like
a piece of work.

795
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:04,168
And I still can't believe you
wrote me all those e-mails.

796
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:06,001
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

797
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:09,267
And that last one,
a little frisky,
a little inappropriate.

798
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,101
Aw, but what the hell.

799
00:37:11,168 --> 00:37:12,701
The offer still stands--

800
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:16,367
she's still the
most exciting woman
I've ever met.

801
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,834
Kaitlin. Gordon.

802
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:20,101
Mom, did you hear that?

803
00:37:20,168 --> 00:37:21,867
The Bullit still wants
to marry you.

804
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,300
(exhales):
Yes.

805
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,667
Well, Gordon,
that's very generous.

806
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:31,634
But I'm afraid my answer
has to be no.

807
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:37,634
Sit down;
I'm not finished.

808
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:41,267
As I was saying, no--

809
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,367
because we don't know each other
well enough.

810
00:37:43,434 --> 00:37:45,567
But... I'm willing
to correct that.

811
00:37:45,634 --> 00:37:50,034
I like you, Gordon,
and if after spending time
together,

812
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,467
I can grow to love you,
then...

813
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:55,467
yes, I would be proud
to be your wife.

814
00:37:58,034 --> 00:37:59,467
Wow. (chuckles)

815
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:01,168
Oh, wow.

816
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:03,467
Come here.

817
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:09,934
Can I get up now?

818
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:12,734
Yes, of course
you can get up.

819
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:27,567
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

820
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:29,068
<i>That's what I</i> said.
I know

821
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:30,567
this isn't what
everybody expected.

822
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,734
That's family, there's nothing
more important than that.

823
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:34,001
I mean...

824
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:37,267
<i>I mean,</i> you're...
you're pregnant.

825
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:38,600
SETH:
It's so weird.

826
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,634
Yeah, well,
congratulations.

827
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:43,200
SETH:
Yeah, it's great.

828
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:45,567
Especially since it makes me
getting arrested
seem trivial now...

829
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:47,767
You got what?
Thanks for prepping her, Dad.

830
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:49,667
Oh, that--
we'll deal with that later.

831
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:52,867
Uh, right now...
we've got some guests inside.

832
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:54,634
Actually, I was gonna run
and pick up Summer, so...

833
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:56,267
Oh, could you give me a
ride, 'cause I got...

834
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:59,701
Go tell Taylor that you
love her and you can't
live without her?
Mm, something
like that.

835
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:02,101
Hey, I'll see you guys
in a few minutes.
Yeah.

836
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,567
And suddenly, we're alone again.

837
00:39:08,634 --> 00:39:10,500
Eh, not for long.

838
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:27,701
(sighs):
Okay.

839
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,801
(exhales):
Take care of him.

840
00:39:31,867 --> 00:39:35,567
Don't worry-- soon enough
he'll be burrowing away with
his little brothers and sisters.

841
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:37,400
Listen, I'm so sorry
that I got you arrested.

842
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:39,034
I should've never asked
to borrow your costume.

843
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:41,200
I didn't mean
to get you into trouble.

844
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:44,667
It's okay-- turns out
the mayor's a lover of
our animal brethren.

845
00:39:44,734 --> 00:39:46,934
He gave us both amnesty.

846
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:48,333
Yeah, and this way
we got to meet.

847
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,168
The universe works
in mysterious ways.

848
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,467
So your dream was right
all along-- that's amazing!

849
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:55,801
SETH:
Hey.

850
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:57,233
Wow, crowded room.

851
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,734
Hi.
You guys off?

852
00:39:58,801 --> 00:40:01,967
Yes. To where the winds
of libery blow over
the mountaintops.

853
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:02,934
You mean Chicago or something?

854
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,034
Take care, you two.

855
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,168
In another life, brother.

856
00:40:09,233 --> 00:40:10,767
Hey...

857
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:12,300
Hey.

858
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,134
So, are we too late
for your mom's birthday party?

859
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,667
Uh, actually, I think it
may be more of a baby shower

860
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:19,734
now, but I'll explain
in the car, or maybe

861
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:21,267
I won't-- I think it's
supposed to be a secret.

862
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:24,567
Listen, what did, uh, Che mean
when he said "in another life"?

863
00:40:24,634 --> 00:40:26,734
In another life what?
Um...

864
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:37,333
Hello?

865
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,834
(heavy breathing over phone)
Hello?

866
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:42,168
MAN (breathy whisper):
Oh, yeah...
Who is this?

867
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,168
What are you wearing?

868
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,233
Ryan?

869
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:49,500
Hi.

870
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:51,701
Were you just trying
to stalk me?

871
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:53,400
Yeah, I guess I need
a little more practice.

872
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:56,767
That is the most romantic thing
anyone has ever done for me.

873
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,701
Mm.

874
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:01,834
So does that mean the whole,
uh, space thing...

875
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:03,333
Yeah, terrible idea.
Mm.

876
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,333
You don't mind dating someone
who's a total weirdo?

877
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,467
No, no. In fact, I was thinking
we could work around it.

878
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:13,001
Like, I have to go
to Kirsten's party,
but if you wanted...

879
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:14,200
you could follow me.

880
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:15,734
Yes, and then
when we get there,

881
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:17,500
I could hide behind
a plant and just

882
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:19,001
kind of watch you.
Exactly, exactly.

883
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:21,367
<i>And then, on the way home,
I could stalk you.</i>

884
00:41:21,434 --> 00:41:23,068
<i>Yes! And then
I stalk you.</i>
Yes!

885
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:51,867
* *

886
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,567
Hi. It's me.

887
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:07,734
No, I-I won't be
making it tonight.

888
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:09,233
Um...

889
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,233
Listen, I, uh...

890
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,867
I'm back with Bullit.

891
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:16,134
I know.

892
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,767
I know.

893
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:22,267
But this is the best thing
for my family.

894
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,834
I'm sorry.

895
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:30,333
Me, too.

896
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,001
Good-bye, Frank.

897
