00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,194
<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,998
How would you like to go
into business together?

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,628
- I don't need your charity.
- Then why are you living in a trailer?

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,518
I don't wanna go to Berkeley.
I wanna go to Brown.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,990
What if he goes to college
and meets a bunch of really smart girls...

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,628
...and realizes that
that's who he's supposed to be with?

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,518
- What are you doing?
- Let me explain.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,033
You called people in
on a Sunday to fire them.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,270
He likes you. And sooner or later you're
gonna have to deal with it.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,919
Maybe you just don't understand
what she's going through.

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,355
- You two talk. I'm done.
- Ryan.

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,314
I feel responsible.

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,959
I'm gonna get the operation...

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,997
...and get back on my board.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,431
You guys, seriously, thank you.

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,477
- Sure, we're happy to help.
- Not a problem.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,551
I'm along for the ride,
but you're welcome.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,390
You didn't have to do this.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,596
Come on, yeah, we did.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,673
I mean, Chili's out of town,
your mom's at work.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,319
We weren't gonna let you
take the bus.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,471
Taking a bus
never seems to end well here.

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,913
- It's this one, up on the right.
- The one with the white trim?

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,196
No, it's the one next to it.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,314
- The infinity pool's in the back.
- Don't worry about it.

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,119
- You should see where Ryan grew up.
- We're moving soon.

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,555
After I go pro, a year on the circuit,
save money...

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,870
...buy my mom
a house in the Flower Streets.

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,271
- Seems a little optimistic now, but...
- No.

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,874
- Well, thanks again.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,996
- See you.
- Here, let me help you.

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,718
No, I'm... I'm fine.

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,996
Y'all are gonna be late for school.

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,993
- Don't forget.
- Oh, thanks. Later.

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,434
Yeah.

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,792
Okay, definitely not fine.

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,874
- I can't watch this.
- I have a free period right now.

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,190
- Yeah, stay. Help him get settled.
- You think?

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,920
I'll see you tonight.
We'll catch up, get something to eat.

40
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,351
No, no, it's fine.

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,514
Don't speak. The kid has no one.

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,109
And I trust Marissa.

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,635
So I was thinking our new business...

44
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,395
...could provide something
that's missing in Newport.

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,393
- But we've got everything.
- Not a great bookstore.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,199
Latest fiction, authors giving readings.

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,669
Interesting,
but I was thinking that our business...

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,229
...could provide something
that Newport actually wants.

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,755
- Okay, Julie. What's your idea?
- Okay.

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,196
I was reading in <i>Stuff</i> magazine,
you can get a girl to clean your house...

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,636
They're called housekeepers,
and Newport is definitely on to that trend.

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,030
Not housekeepers. Nude maids.

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,192
Who wants to see their maids nude?

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,831
- Not maids, Kirsten. They're strippers.
- Who wants a stripper doing their laundry?

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,195
As long as she knows how to iron
the way I like:

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,032
Wrinkle-free, and not too starchy.

57
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,990
Sandy gets it.
A few weeks at the Newport Group...

58
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,752
...he's thinking like a businessman.

59
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,275
You've gotta give the people
what they want.

60
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,318
I'm trying to give people
without a lot of money a place to live.

61
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,710
Matt set up a big meeting
with potential investors.

62
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,952
Sandy, I don't think
I'm in favor of low-income housing.

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,633
Julie, you live
in a trailer park.

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,873
And I am highly motivated
to change my circumstances.

65
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,271
If you make being poor too comfortable,
what's the incentive to get rich?

66
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,396
Believe me, if anyone should know...

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,074
Wow, on that uplifting note...

68
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,199
...I'll leave you two to hash out the finer
points of the free-market economy.

69
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,477
Look, why don't we do something
that we know Newport needs...

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,914
...and we're already good at.

71
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,792
- I'm blanking.
- Party planning.

72
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,189
I'll cater.
Charity events, private dinners...

73
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,875
We know all the vendors, all the sites,
already have a huge client base.

74
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,159
I'm in.

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,633
Marissa called?

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,119
We just dropped her off.

77
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,952
Why would she call? She's busy.

78
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,315
- Hey...
- Hey, can't talk. I have to go see Dr. Kim.

79
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,914
- You in trouble?
- No, I have to change my college file.

80
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,479
I got my SAT score.

81
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,631
Summer, we got our SAT scores back
months ago.

82
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,518
Oh, well, I took mine late, remember?

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,557
There was a <i>Valley</i> marathon
the first time.

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,472
- How'd you do?
- Ryan, come on.

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,029
You never ask a lady her age,
weight or SAT score.

86
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,235
I got a 2300.

87
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,752
What, that bad?

88
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,356
- That good.
- As good as you, Cohen?

89
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,717
- Better.
- By just the tiniest bit.

90
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,715
You know, I read a study once that said
that if 1500 third-graders took the SAT...

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,314
...one would get a perfect score
by probability alone.

92
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,391
Yeah. Well, I'm not
a third-grader, Cohen.

93
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,028
I'm not saying you are,
but how else do you explain it?

94
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,592
I don't know.

95
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,319
How is that even possible?

96
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,869
She did save Chrismukkah.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,355
Okay, so you've got your blanket...

98
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,796
...pillows. What else? The remote...

99
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,473
...magazines...

100
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,553
- Just call me if you need anything, okay?
- Don't wait by the phone.

101
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,076
- Since you've thought of everything.
- Maybe I should stop by after school.

102
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,390
- Give you your homework.
- Oh, I'll get it later.

103
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,196
Is everything okay?
If I didn't know better...

104
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,351
...I'd think you were trying
to get rid of me.

105
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,036
- Whatever you could do would help.
- Ma, hey.

106
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,237
Please, call me right away
if anything changes. Thanks again.

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,960
- Baby, how you feeling?
- Ma, this is...

108
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,157
- The famous Marissa Cooper.
- Hi.

109
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,914
Come here, sweetie.
Oh, Johnny talks about you so much...

110
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,469
...I feel like I know you already.

111
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,713
You didn't tell me she was gorgeous.

112
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,791
- Ma, you're embarrassing her.
- Sorry.

113
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,873
Thank you for bringing him home.

114
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,715
I tried to get someone to cover for me,
but no one wants the night shift.

115
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,950
Marissa has class.
You're gonna make her late.

116
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,193
Well, just wait, I've got some
good news. I got you an appointment.

117
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,909
With the best sports-medicine doctor
in all of Orange County.

118
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,278
A real fancy orthopedic surgeon.
Works with the Angels and the Ducks.

119
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,874
- Thanks, Ma.
- One hitch.

120
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,076
Being that he's in demand,
there's a wait list.

121
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,708
And the wait's gonna be a little while.

122
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,634
- What, like a week?
- Seemed kind of more like months.

123
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,231
But the team will be gone.
I'll miss the tour.

124
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,595
I know, honey.
But there's always next year.

125
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,352
Maybe there's a way to get moved up.

126
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,717
No, no, I tried. But, you know,
they give these favors to friends...

127
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,791
...and donors to the hospital.

128
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,873
Babe.

129
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,555
I'm sorry, l... I did the best I could.

130
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,268
- Hi.
- Hey.

131
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,479
You are not gonna believe this.
So it turns out that I am totally smart.

132
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,551
Yeah, you are, in your own way.

133
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,597
Not in my own way. In your way too.

134
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,038
- I have a lot of what they call "aptitude."
- Really?

135
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,714
Dr. Kim told me that every few years
she has a student...

136
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,031
...that turns out to be academically
gifted but didn't apply herself.

137
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,875
You know, just focusing more on boys
and shopping and celebrity gossip?

138
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,359
If I study for my finals...

139
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,159
...I could get my grades up enough
to go to Brown with you.

140
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,948
Wouldn't that be awesome?

141
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,511
Yeah, sure. But, you know, do you
even...? Do you wanna go to Brown?

142
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,399
Well, now I do. Dr. Kim said
that you can make your own major.

143
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,472
And the school colors are seal brown.
How cute are seals?

144
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,669
Look, they're having this thing tomorrow
for prospective students.

145
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,671
And I thought we could go together.

146
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,991
Okay, yeah. That sounds like a date.

147
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,793
Okay.

148
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,553
What are you reading?

149
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,349
It's just <i>Fear and Trembling.</i>
It's Kierkegaard.

150
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,275
He's the godfather of Existentialism.
Sort of invented the concept of angst.

151
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,509
Well, now that I'm smart,
I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

152
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,679
All right, I'll do the welcome, explain
our philosophy, present the model.

153
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,559
- I'll follow up with the numbers.
- What about Thai for dinner?

154
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,154
Sounds great.
Happy days are here again.

155
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,957
You two are so perfect together,
it's almost painful to be around.

156
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,031
We've been working on it
for about 25 years.

157
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,997
You're bound to get it right eventually.

158
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,230
What about you?
There's a girlfriend in Chicago.

159
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,630
Yeah, yeah. She's a great girl.

160
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,631
I look forward to meeting her.

161
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,919
Here's a couple of guys
who know a thing or two about romance.

162
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,798
- Seth, Ryan, meet Matt Ramsey.
- Hey.

163
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,552
- Matt, meet my boys.
- Hey there.

164
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,234
Matt and I are working on
our housing development.

165
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,311
Oh, that's my cue
to help Mom with dinner.

166
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,389
- This is it, huh?
- Yeah.

167
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,357
It's an early version, but pretty much.

168
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,549
You guys probably don't want
my two cents, but...

169
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,119
What? No, no, no, go ahead.

170
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,278
You put a wall up here,
it turns this space into a courtyard.

171
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,032
Add some benches, a playground.

172
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,792
- Good idea.
- It was just a thought.

173
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,799
- You're a senior? Applying to college?
- Yeah.

174
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,748
What would look better than an internship
with a prestigious development company?

175
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,195
- lf it's cool with the boss.
- We could use the help.

176
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,510
- You got any plans?
- Yeah, with my girlfriend.

177
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,033
Cancel them.

178
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,074
Well, this is the doctor's home page.

179
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,549
And it says here
he works out of Hoag Hospital.

180
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,836
My mom's done
a bunch of charities for them...

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,470
...and Summer's dad even works there,
so this is kind of perfect.

182
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,470
Marissa, I appreciate everything...

183
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,551
...but you can't do this.

184
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,757
Why? Because I might one day
decide to become a surfer...

185
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,638
...get hit by a bus, need surgery...

186
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,997
...then realize I used my one good favor
with the best doctor in town?

187
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,549
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen.

188
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,398
I just don't want you to think
this is your problem.

189
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,678
Too late.
Hang on, Summer's picking me up.

190
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,478
Sorry.

191
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,792
- Hey.
- Hey, you ready to go?

192
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,231
Oh, hang on.

193
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,992
Oh, it's Ryan. We're supposed
to have dinner tonight. I should...

194
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,151
- Hey.
- Hi.

195
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,437
- You have to help me.
- Well, I thought Marissa was helping you.

196
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,512
She is. She's driving me,
feeding me, bringing me my homework.

197
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,954
She's trying to get me in...

198
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,235
...with some doctor.
- That's okay.

199
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,516
She's a good friend,
I don't see the problem.

200
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,830
She's too nice,
spending too much time with me.

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,956
Well, she tends to be a little clingy.

202
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,078
- No, it's not that I don't like it.
- We'll get together later.

203
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,269
It's that I do.

204
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,670
- A lot.
- I called this, like, so long ago.

205
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,956
This... This is a major problem.

206
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,473
Not for anybody but me, okay?

207
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,868
Just don't tell anyone.

208
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,951
- All right, bye.
- Promise?

209
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,034
- Yeah.
- Hey.

210
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,079
What'd I miss?

211
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,639
Thanks for dropping me, Sum.

212
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,791
Hey, you think maybe
you could pick me up too?

213
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,279
Oh, maybe you should ask Ryan.

214
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,351
I think he's gotta go
to the Newport Group.

215
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,078
Oh, I guess I could swing by Union.

216
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,832
Oh, can you pick me up at Johnny's?

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,834
Because I'm gonna drop off his homework
and hopefully I'll know about the doctor.

218
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,198
Hey, you think maybe you could ask
your dad to put in a good word?

219
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,476
Yeah, I guess. Are you sure...

220
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,518
...I don't know,
that that's the best idea?

221
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,990
You being all involved in Johnny's life?
You guys are getting really close.

222
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,549
Yeah, well, he doesn't really
have anyone else.

223
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,597
I mean, his mom's sweet,
but it just seems...

224
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,557
...like everything's
kind of hard for her.

225
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,314
- I'm just trying to help.
- Okay. I'll talk to my dad.

226
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,756
The sooner Johnny gets on his feet,
you don't have to be his nursemaid.

227
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,754
I kind of like being his nursemaid.
You know, maybe I should be a nurse.

228
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,711
- That is a good one.
- <i>So was Marissa cool...</i>

229
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,440
...with you canceling last night?
- Didn't have a problem.

230
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,273
- Do you have a problem with it?
- Why would I...? I cancelled.

231
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,317
If you cancelled on me,
I'd have a problem.

232
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,756
If I cancelled on you and you didn't
have a problem with it, then I might.

233
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,354
Sounds like you already got a problem.
And not with me.

234
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,148
- Who would my problem be with?
- I think it's great that Summer's a genius.

235
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,669
Listen, Dr. Kim said
she had some untapped potential.

236
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,432
No one went around using the G-word.

237
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,151
- Don't do this, man.
- Do what?

238
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,072
- Compete with Summer.
- Why? Because...

239
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,992
Do you think Summer would win?

240
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,913
So I figured out
what our start-up costs will be.

241
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,991
Do you wanna share an appetizer?
Crab cakes?

242
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,149
Sounds good.

243
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,550
We can charge food and liquor
on a per-event basis.

244
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,110
But dishes and linen we have to figure
out whether it's worth buying our own.

245
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,510
You know what I'm craving?
Sweet-corn ravioli.

246
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,875
Do you think that'll be heavy
with the crab cakes?

247
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,838
What I think is that you don't find
this business interesting.

248
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,311
Oh, I'm sorry.

249
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,995
Kiki, I've just been
eating a lot of ramen lately.

250
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,315
Julie, if this business works, you'll never
have to boil your dinner again.

251
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,634
I had a supplier list.

252
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,958
I left it in the car.

253
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,918
- I'll be right back.
- I'll decide on my order while you're gone.

254
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,431
Or read some spreadsheets.

255
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,397
Right here.

256
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,794
So I see you're
suddenly without a lunch date.

257
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,510
- Wanna join me at the bar for a drink?
- No, my friend will be back shortly.

258
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,437
Well, maybe I can buy you both drinks.

259
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,190
Well, she's an alcoholic,
and we're having a business lunch.

260
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,349
We're partners.

261
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,832
In a business.

262
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,952
Really?

263
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,594
What kind of business?

264
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,593
Well...

265
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,230
- Hey, Julie.
- Kirsten.

266
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,870
Oh, this is Jeff Granzow. This is my
business partner, Kirsten Cohen.

267
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,996
Nice to meet you.

268
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,714
We were in the middle of something,
if you'll excuse us.

269
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,917
Actually, I invited Jeff
to join us for lunch.

270
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,392
He just hired us to do a dinner party
at his house this weekend.

271
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,994
For $5000.

272
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,274
Oh, well, have a seat.

273
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,993
Do you like crab cakes?

274
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,230
Hey, Ashley, Madison.

275
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,676
- Summer, hey.
- Didn't expect to see you here...

276
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,479
...at a Brown event. No offense.
- Oh, none taken.

277
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,398
You know, maybe we should just leave.

278
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,073
Why?

279
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,072
Well, you know...

280
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,159
You don't think I belong here.

281
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,198
No, it's not that. You know,
you don't have to do this for me.

282
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,634
Oh, this isn't about you.

283
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,272
It isn't? Because this
has been my dream for years...

284
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,670
...and, I mean, all of a sudden,
it's yours too?

285
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,676
Well, maybe I never had a dream.

286
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,637
You know,
maybe for once in my life...

287
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,995
...I actually wanna do
something with my life.

288
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,878
Like something important.

289
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,473
Be the first woman in space...

290
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,596
...or win one of those noble prizes.

291
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,830
Women have been going to space
since the '60s.

292
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,150
And it's not noble prizes, it's Nobel.

293
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,874
Marie Curie won in 1903
for discovering radium.

294
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,749
- I think you've made your point.
- Hey, don't leave.

295
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,114
Oh, I'm not leaving.

296
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,114
Look, you may know more
about history and science and stuff...

297
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,669
...but I know a thing or two
about working a room.

298
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,673
Hey, Madison.
Wait up.

299
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,233
You all right?

300
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,033
Yeah.

301
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,270
I just got a lot on my mind. I promised
it wouldn't interfere with my work.

302
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,032
This job means a lot to you, huh?

303
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,111
Kind of means everything.

304
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,998
I relocated to do this with Sandy.

305
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,673
And my girlfriend...

306
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,229
Well, my ex now, I guess.

307
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,915
I took her down to Cabo last weekend
and invited her to join me here...

308
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,069
...as my wife.

309
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,116
It turns out she doesn't like
warm weather. Or me.

310
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,078
- Have you told Sandy this?
- It's not his problem.

311
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,434
Sandy's a good guy.

312
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,477
And he's taking a big chance on me.

313
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,676
- I don't wanna let him down.
- Tell me about it.

314
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,309
Guys, I hate to do this to you,
but my plate's full.

315
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,517
Whatever it is, put it right out
of your mind. It's already done.

316
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,399
There's legislation in the works
that would change the zoning.

317
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,471
I need you to work out both scenarios:

318
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,359
One if it passes, one if it doesn't.

319
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,314
That means twice the work.

320
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,279
- Maybe you could reschedule the meeting?
- I would if I could.

321
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,910
These guys are coming tomorrow,
and then heading down to San Diego...

322
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,638
...to look at another development.

323
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,076
Fourteen hours, laptop, coffee.
Ryan and I are good to go.

324
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,708
That's the spirit. Thanks.

325
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,353
We gonna have time to get ready?
If not, we should tell him.

326
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,916
Come on. We'll take a little field trip.

327
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,070
You guys,
next year is gonna be so much fun.

328
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,913
Maybe we should drive together,
like, have a road trip?

329
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,513
- Shotgun.
- Excuse me.

330
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,159
If I could have your attention.

331
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,276
I wanna thank you for coming.
Great group.

332
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,317
- So true.
- But, unfortunately...

333
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,199
...on average, Brown admits
one student a year from Harbor.

334
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,033
And it's stiff competition.
I wish I could admit you all.

335
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,476
But enjoy the event. And good luck.

336
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,039
Thank you.

337
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,713
- Hey, can I talk to you?
- I need to talk to the Brown guy.

338
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,078
Hey, hi. I was wondering, in your opinion,
what makes a student stand out?

339
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,437
- Yes, besides good grades.
- And high SAT scores.

340
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,160
Well, all our applicants
are leaders at their schools.

341
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,878
What it really takes is a hook.

342
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,229
Fascinating.

343
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,519
Okay, okay.
And could you clarify with an example?

344
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,990
Say the cellist in our quartet
was graduating and you played the cello...

345
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,111
Next week?

346
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,635
That is great news. I can't believe it.

347
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,552
It's really not that big a deal.

348
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,917
Summer's dad is a surgeon at
the hospital, and they knew each other.

349
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,153
I'm glad it worked out, though.

350
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,276
This calls for some kind of celebration.

351
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,953
Marissa, you're staying for dinner.

352
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,872
Ma, I'm sure she has plans.

353
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,871
Oh, I do, actually, with Ryan.

354
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,079
- That's her boyfriend.
- Well, invite him too.

355
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,313
We'Il... We'll order in.
We'll play board games or watch movies.

356
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,034
- That's him.
- Probably wondering where you are.

357
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,872
No, he knows.

358
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,430
Hey. So do you wanna come over
to Johnny's and get takeout and DVDs?

359
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,354
- We're gonna celebrate.
- Yeah. Yeah, okay, that sounds good.

360
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,318
Probably start without me, though.

361
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,068
Be there as soon as I can.

362
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,117
- What's up?
- Hey.

363
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,678
- It's cool. He's with me.
- Sure thing, boss.

364
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,833
Hey, what are you doing, man?

365
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,879
- I thought we were on a coffee run.
- Well, I never said that.

366
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,598
I do some of my best thinking here.

367
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,671
I can see why.
Loud music, topless women.

368
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,354
- No distractions at all.
- Sometimes a good distraction...

369
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,636
...is the best way to recharge. All right?

370
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,758
- Here's my muse, Lily.
- Hey, Matt.

371
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,592
How's my favorite customer doing?

372
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,115
I'm in need of some serious
one-on-one time.

373
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,391
Should I ready
the champagne room for you?

374
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,752
- Hey, come on, man.
- I got this, all right?

375
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,593
I'm gonna have a time-out,
then we'll go pull an all nighter.

376
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,320
I got plans. I can't...

377
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,112
First dance is on me. I'll be right back.

378
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,316
Hi, I'm Sipowicz.

379
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,756
Hi, Sipowicz.

380
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,520
I didn't know
Julie was taking this seriously.

381
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,240
Well, you gotta hand it to her.
She's a born entrepreneur.

382
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,870
Hey, I'm starving,
and that actually smells good.

383
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,112
Well, it's not for you. Pizza's coming.

384
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,554
Is that a pirate costume?

385
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,753
- Summer and I are in a war.
- A pirate war?

386
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,480
It turns out Brown
takes only one student from Harbor.

387
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,871
- We both wanna be it, so I need a hook.
- Oh, you mean like a Captain Hook.

388
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,071
I'll get that. Maybe it's dinner.

389
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,513
Summer going to Brown?

390
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,068
- I mean, no offense...
- She did save Chrismukkah.

391
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,394
Is Ryan eating with us?

392
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,279
He's working with Matt tonight.
He's a good influence on Ryan.

393
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,955
He's young, he didn't come from much,
he's making something of himself.

394
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,874
He's a good role model.

395
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,749
- You don't have to do this.
- Bought and paid for.

396
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,229
Oh, that's my cell.
Ringing in my pocket.

397
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,709
I definitely feel something vibrating.

398
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,317
- Yeah, if you could just...
- No, let me.

399
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,313
<i>It's Ryan. Leave a message.</i>

400
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,278
Hey, it's me.

401
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,477
I was just wondering
where you are, so...

402
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,632
It's getting kind of late.

403
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,870
So call me.

404
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,472
<i>I'll scrimp and I'll save</i>
<i>and I'll work my fingers to the bone.</i>

405
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,358
<i>Oh, there's just one thing.</i>

406
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,193
<i>- What about...?</i>
<i>- Children?</i>

407
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,318
<i>Oh, yes. I don 't know what to do</i>
<i>when they cry. Do you, dear?</i>

408
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,755
<i>Drown them like puppies.</i>

409
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,639
<i>As you see, the nursery's far away</i>
<i>from the rest of the house.</i>

410
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,110
<i>And if you have children, you'll find that</i>
<i>this is a wonderful arrangement.</i>

411
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,430
<i>They can carry on,</i>
<i>and you'll never even notice.</i>

412
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,876
<i>- Sunken nursery.</i>
<i>- In fact, if you lock them in...</i>

413
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,432
<i>... you'll never have to see them again.</i>

414
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,670
<i>- Much less talk to them.</i>
<i>- Talk to them? Heavens.</i>

415
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,308
<i>- Nobody talks to children.</i>
<i>- No, they just tell them...</i>

416
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,873
Where have you been?

417
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,510
- Summer...
- I have been worried sick for hours.

418
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,392
Since my alarm went off 20 minutes ago
and I noticed you weren't here.

419
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,993
Sorry, I fell asleep.

420
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,878
Oh, at Ryan's?

421
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,389
At Johnny's.

422
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,039
- At Johnny's?
- We were watching a movie.

423
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,949
What's that?

424
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,349
- A tuba.
- Which you have why?

425
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,788
Because I do.

426
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,232
In fifth grade, when I said
I was going to beauty-pageant camp...

427
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,710
...I was going to band camp
and learning to play the tuba.

428
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,550
Quit changing the subject.
I cannot believe you slept there.

429
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,233
- Does Ryan know?
- Know what?

430
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,915
How bad that movie was last night.

431
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,799
Where were you?

432
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,598
Yeah. Where were you?

433
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,238
None of my business.

434
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,350
- I was with Matt. We were working.
- Wow, so late?

435
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,919
Yeah, big presentation today.

436
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,274
So movie no good, huh?

437
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,749
Yeah, well, it kind of put me to sleep.

438
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,439
- How's Johnny?
- Better, I think.

439
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,876
Good, good. You get home okay?

440
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,471
Yeah. Yeah, his mom drove me.

441
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,394
- I just wanted to say hi.
- Yeah, don't let me keep you.

442
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,118
Okay.

443
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,795
The investors are in the conference room,
I need your part of the presentation.

444
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,393
Call me when you get this.

445
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,518
Matt's missing in action.
Any idea where he could be?

446
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,830
He was pulling an all nighter.
Maybe he slept in.

447
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,195
- Right through the alarm. Sorry, Sandy.
- Ready?

448
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,635
As I'll ever be.
Let me put my tie on, clear my head.

449
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,074
- Five minutes?
- You got four.

450
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,708
And you might wanna run a comb
through your hair.

451
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,955
- Thanks for not busting me.
- Gonna make me wish I did?

452
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,357
I know these guys. I got it under control.

453
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,673
- Summer?
- Oh, hey, Ash.

454
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,831
- You're not in the band.
- No, technically not.

455
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,072
I thought I could play, blow minds,
get asked to join. What do you...?

456
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,834
I'm a big fan of physical comedy,
and I'm extremely limber.

457
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,037
Plus, Johnny Depp
has been a huge inspiration in my life.

458
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,919
I just think he's taken the pirate thing
to a whole new level.

459
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,799
- And the Brown Bear is retiring next year.
- I told you.

460
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,393
We already have a mascot.

461
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,874
Oh, my God.

462
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,792
- And what's with the peg leg?
- What?

463
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,270
It's really creeping me out.

464
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,188
Cohen!

465
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,193
Cohen, what are you doing?

466
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,636
- Summer, what are you doing?
- I asked first.

467
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,075
You don't need to answer that,
because it's obvious.

468
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,511
Yeah, I'm not the one wearing a tuba.

469
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,468
That's really big talk from a guy wearing
hoop earrings. At least I play the tuba.

470
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,152
What? I do.

471
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,360
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get to practice.

472
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,153
- Did you just whack me?
- Did you just jab me with your peg leg?

473
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,437
- It was a tap, you little whacker.
- It was a jab, jabber.

474
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,159
Why do you have to be better than me
at everything?

475
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,548
See? That's just it, Summer.

476
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,518
I'm not better than you at everything.

477
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,399
There was one thing
that I was better at.

478
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,154
The commercial space at street level
can provide jobs...

479
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,754
...places to eat, a daycare center...
- It sounds good.

480
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,912
But we've heard there are regulations
in the works which...

481
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,877
...could complicate things.
- So have we.

482
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,395
Matt's worked out
both sets of numbers. Matt.

483
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,109
Thanks, Sandy.
So if the legislation does not pass...

484
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,397
...the profit model will look like this.
- And if it does?

485
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,155
Then we would have to decrease
the amount of commercial space...

486
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,709
...which would decrease the revenue.

487
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,236
- By how much, do you think?
- I would say a significant amount.

488
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,031
Matt, we do business in dollars.
How many are we talking about here?

489
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,316
- I'm...
- Well...

490
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,596
...we haven't worked out
those numbers right now.

491
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,832
We didn't drive all the way down here
for a hypothetical conversation.

492
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,595
Of course. We'll have those numbers
to you by this afternoon. Right, Matt?

493
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,797
Thank you, Mr. Cohen...

494
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,316
...for your impressive presentation.

495
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,835
I think we've heard all we need to today.

496
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,514
Well, thanks for your time.

497
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,352
I can't believe this.

498
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,594
I'm sorry. I...

499
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,639
Anything you'd care to tell me?

500
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,398
Coming.

501
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,119
Johnny?

502
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,952
In here!

503
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,112
Oh, my God.

504
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,759
Oh, God. All right, come on.

505
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,673
- Here.
- I think I twisted it again.

506
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,353
Okay. Come on, now.

507
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,839
Where are your painkillers?

508
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,315
- Hello. Good evening.
- Good evening.

509
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,952
Oh, Jeff, what a beautiful...

510
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,872
...beautiful place.
- Thank you.

511
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,838
Would you and your guests
want dinner in the dining room, or...?

512
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,353
Oh, the terrace would be nice.

513
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,636
Let me ask my guest.

514
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,233
Dining room or terrace?

515
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,918
Excuse me?

516
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,479
I haven't invited anyone.

517
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,837
I was hoping, Julie,
that you might join me for dinner.

518
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,560
Mr. Granzow, if this is a joke,
it's not funny.

519
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,030
I spent two days cooking,
and Julie bought out the flower mart.

520
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,191
One dinner, please.
I'll pay what I promised.

521
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,999
I just want the chance
to get to know you better.

522
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,313
Julie, we're leaving.

523
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,519
Julie?

524
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,468
You did all this for a date with me?

525
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,998
Fine, but you're serving yourselves.

526
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,110
- Hungry?
- Nope.

527
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,909
What the hell happened?

528
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,434
- I'm so sorry...
- You weren't prepared for the meeting...

529
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,273
...I could overlook.
That you were here, you brought Ryan...

530
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,998
...really tries my patience.

531
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,390
- But I'd hear you out.
- Thanks.

532
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,710
- That means a lot.
- But you lied to my face.

533
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,348
You disrespected me,
and the company I'm trying to build.

534
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,080
- The one that you wanted to build.
- It won't happen again.

535
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,755
You're right, it won't. I want you out
of the office tomorrow. You're fired.

536
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,558
- Come on...
- Not another word out of you.

537
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,280
Don't think you don't have
anything to be sorry about.

538
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,756
Hey, Johnny,
do you know where there's a towel?

539
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,990
I don't want this ice to melt all over you.

540
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,718
Try under the sink.

541
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,272
You know, Marissa...

542
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,352
...you're really making this hard.
- Making what hard?

543
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,639
We're friends.

544
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,472
Yeah, we are friends.

545
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,438
How many of those painkillers
did you take?

546
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,795
I have to tell you something.

547
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,555
- I can't say it.
- Say what?

548
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,757
Don't say anything back, okay?

549
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,434
I don't want anything.

550
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,354
I just want you to know the truth.

551
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,519
The truth about what?

552
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,433
I really like you.

553
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,751
Okay, I really like you too.

554
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,391
No.

555
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,796
I mean...

556
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,233
...I "like you" like you.

557
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,437
I think I'm in love with you.

558
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,074
So, Ryan, you're a working man now.

559
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,593
How's the job going?

560
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,469
Model homes, calculators, dudes in suits.
I bet that's some pretty exciting stuff.

561
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,551
You'd be surprised,
and so would Marissa.

562
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,199
- What's she up to?
- I don't know.

563
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,590
I'll ask her when I see her,
which will be tonight.

564
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,638
- What's with the questions?
- I'm trying to exhaust your issues...

565
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,075
...so we can get to mine.
Have we covered everything?

566
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,352
My biggest fear, stated plainly:

567
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,319
What if Summer's being smart
changes our whole dynamic?

568
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,311
- Why would it?
- Because my intelligence...

569
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,268
...was the one quality she admired in me.
It made me almost a man in her eyes.

570
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,115
Come on, man, that's not true.
You got plenty of other positive qualities.

571
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,759
You're...

572
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,353
You're...

573
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,159
You're funny when you wanna be.

574
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,629
Have you noticed how
Summer's gotten funnier lately?

575
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,712
- I think she's funnier than me.
- You're an expert in comic books...

576
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,438
...and yakuza films.

577
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,989
- Girls don't like that.
- You know how to work a grill.

578
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,554
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

579
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,517
I thought I would come up with more...

580
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,989
...but the point is,
Summer doesn't wanna be you...

581
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,594
...she wants to be with you. Right?

582
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,079
You want that too. So...

583
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,276
- Apologize, I know.
- Yeah.

584
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,556
- Where you going?
- I gotta go to Sandy's office.

585
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,280
I have some apologizing to do myself.
Give me a ride?

586
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,439
Why don't we have cars?

587
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,433
Don't answer it.

588
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,830
Johnny's gonna think I'm mad at him.

589
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,237
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

590
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,712
Look, he was in pain.
He took a bunch of pills.

591
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,519
And he probably doesn't even remember.

592
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,673
It's not a big deal.

593
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,877
Yeah, well, a Vicodin love confession
is still a love confession.

594
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,551
I'm sure he didn't mean it.

595
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,598
I'm sure he did.

596
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,273
Why?

597
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,431
Because he told me...

598
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,750
...the night that I picked you up
from his place.

599
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,473
Why didn't you say anything?

600
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,153
He made me promise not to.

601
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,876
He said he wasn't gonna do anything,
so he didn't want you to know.

602
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,111
And now I know.

603
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,148
What am I gonna do?

604
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,357
Pretend you don't.

605
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,552
Maybe you should
just stay away from him for a while.

606
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,593
I gotta call Ryan.

607
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,988
Are you gonna tell him?

608
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,232
These guys won't return my calls.
I can't get even a response...

609
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,960
...much less schedule another meeting.
- Look, I am sorry.

610
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,634
- Matt said he had it and I believed him.
- Well, so did I.

611
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,756
It makes no sense
for him to blow this off.

612
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,151
- He's the one who set up the meeting.
- His girlfriend dumped him.

613
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,312
- Oh, because he went to the strip club?
- Because he took the job.

614
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,074
- It hit him pretty hard.
- You're breaking my heart.

615
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,912
He didn't want anyone to know.

616
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,991
Especially his boss.

617
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,673
Sorry for the drop-by.

618
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,273
Wow, Matt must be some tipper.

619
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,351
Matt and I are friends. From college.

620
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,354
Yes, I went to college.

621
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,112
I'm dancing to pay for law school.

622
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,840
But I don't dance for Matt.
Mostly, we talk.

623
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,629
- About what?
- Matt's been under a lot of pressure...

624
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,518
...and not just work stuff.

625
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,831
I think he just
kind of crashed and burned.

626
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,070
- He couldn't have chosen a worse time.
- I know.

627
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,789
Maybe none of this makes any difference,
but Matt is a good guy.

628
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,394
And this job means the world to him.

629
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,870
What if I told you I was the one that
put Matt in touch with those investors...

630
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,679
...and that I could get you
another meeting?

631
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,435
- Is one your professor?
- No, a customer.

632
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,237
Dad, Gloria, I'm heading over to Seth's.

633
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,238
- Hi, Seth.
- Hey.

634
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,436
I just came over to apologize.

635
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,394
Me too. Well, no. I'm...

636
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,788
I'm listening.

637
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,518
Okay.

638
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,318
Look, I'm sorry
I've been such an ass, okay?

639
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,914
It's just, you're so superior to me
in so many ways.

640
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,469
You know, you're better-Iooking,
you're more popular...

641
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,073
...you're stronger.

642
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,798
And not just emotionally.

643
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,672
Cohen...

644
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,159
...I'll always look up to you.

645
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,676
And not just because
you're taller than me.

646
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,831
I am taller than you.

647
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,233
You know, that guy from Brown...

648
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,358
...he didn't say that they couldn't
take more than one from Harbor.

649
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,398
- Hey, well, this might be the year.
- That's right.

650
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,269
Don't try and make me
feel worse than I already do.

651
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,078
It's impossible.

652
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,873
You knew you didn't do the work.

653
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,553
You knew you'd get caught.

654
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,233
You knew how I'd react.

655
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,231
- You must've wanted to get fired.
- Right.

656
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,312
Since I'd have
absolutely nothing else going for me.

657
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,269
The next time you have a problem,
say something.

658
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,112
If you need help...

659
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,952
...ask for it.

660
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,718
I'll remember that.

661
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,749
Be here at 8 a.m. on Monday.

662
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,548
We'll give it another try.

663
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,318
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

664
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,550
This is your last chance,
don't screw it up...

665
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,871
...or you owe me bigtime.

666
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,313
Oh, hey, Julie.

667
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,597
- How was your date?
- Oh, it was awful.

668
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,876
We didn't click,
we had nothing to talk about...

669
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,758
...and his tongue was like sandpaper.

670
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,831
Sorry to hear that.

671
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,592
Sorry. I should never have stayed.

672
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,911
It was so unprofessional of me,
and you made all that food for nothing.

673
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,594
Well, it wasn't for nothing. We got paid.

674
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,954
In a way, our first venture was...

675
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,190
...a success.
- Yeah, I guess so.

676
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,590
How weird is it that a guy
would spend that much...

677
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,115
...just to have dinner with a woman?

678
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,635
Julie, I have an idea for a new business.

679
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,828
Oh, my God!

680
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,355
High-class call-girl operation. I love it!

681
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,273
No, a high-end dating service.

682
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,274
That could work too.

683
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,638
Hey, Johnny. What are you doing here?

684
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,313
I'm sorry, you're on your way out.

685
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,872
I won't be long, I...

686
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,874
You must think I'm a stalker
just showing up like this.

687
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,679
- All my calls went to voice mail, so l...
- Johnny, look.

688
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,671
You don't have to explain yourself.

689
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,751
We can just act like it didn't happen.

690
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,990
Those pills will
really mess with your head.

691
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,912
Believe me, I should know.

692
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,877
Look, Marissa...

693
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,073
I didn't mean to say those things.

694
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,789
But I did mean them.

695
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,278
- I just don't want things to get weird.
- I think things already are a little weird.

696
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,749
- Well, we can still be friends, right?
- Of course.

697
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,792
I just...

698
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,309
I think maybe
we need to spend some time apart.

699
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,518
Okay.

700
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,599
Okay.

701
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,673
If you get in and I don't,
you have to go, okay?

702
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,034
Because this is your dream.

703
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,237
And if you get in and I don't, same thing.
It's your dream now too.

704
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,358
Whomever gets in, I still love you.

705
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,159
And I still love you.

706
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,678
Actually, it's "whoever gets in,"
not "whomever," because...

707
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,912
See, "who" is a pronoun, and those...

708
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,678
- Hello?
- Hey.

709
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,469
Hey, I was just calling you.
Where are you?

710
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,030
Summer's room. No one's here.

711
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,997
You should've told me you were coming.

712
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,116
Well, then it wouldn't have been
a surprise.

713
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,635
But then I wouldn't be sitting
here in the pool house.

714
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,952
Right. You want me to come over there?

715
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,113
No.

716
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,508
No, just talk to me.

717
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,718
Okay.

718
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,918
- Hi.
- Hi.

719
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,475
How was your weekend?

720
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,593
It was pretty strange.

721
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,991
- I bet mine was stranger.
- I doubt it, but you go ahead.

722
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,833
Okay, well...

723
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,352
- There's no reason to be upset...
- I'm the one that got a lap dance.

724
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,314
You got a lap dance?

725
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,152
Well, maybe you should go first.

726
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,437
No, no, no, I interrupted you.
Please. Please continue.

727
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,308
Well, there's something
I wanna tell you about Johnny.

728
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,199
- Ryan?
- I'm listening.

729
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,194
Well, the other night,
when you were supposed to come over...

730
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,999
<i>... I fell asleep at Johnny's.</i>

731
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,878
<i>Nothing happened.</i>

732
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,237
We were just really tired.

733
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,789
<i>But then the next night...</i>

734
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,631
