00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,233
<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,038
I'd do a few surf competitions...

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,953
...maybe hook up with some sponsors,
turn that into a career.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,076
I'm gonna get the operation,
and get back on my board.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,037
- What's going on?
- I can talk to him.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,112
Knowing that you're pulling for me,
it keeps me going.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,912
- Mom, hi.
- Hurry, I'm running late.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,436
- lf you'd just loosen up, you would...
- I would be one of the popular girls.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,909
Truth is, I'm looking down the barrel
of divorce two.

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,593
I live in a trailer park.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,194
No student has ever been
involved in a shooting.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,397
Apparently, the parents are protesting.
They want Marissa out.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,792
Who's ready for another "faux-jito"?

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,679
I think I kind of hit a wall
on the "mocktails."

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,035
- It's a school night.
- It's not a school night.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,159
It's our last night, before our last
semester of our last year of high school.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,676
- So we have to make it last.
- It's hard to argue with that logic.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,398
You guys, this has been
a really fun winter break.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,754
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,876
The four of us,
hanging out like old times.

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,439
Yeah, it's gone by so fast.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,672
I wish I could TiVo it so we could
play it over until graduation.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,071
Unfortunately, after tonight, it's back
to regular scheduled programming.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,434
For you guys.

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,591
I gotta go back
to Newport Union by myself.

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,474
- I gotta pee. You gotta pee?
- No, not really.

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,073
- I gotta pee.
- Okay.

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,152
Screw it. I'll go get us some drinks first.

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,716
- What if it doesn't have to end?
- Winter break?

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,759
No, the four of us being together.
It's a new year, but it's our last chance.

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,558
Senior photos are this Friday.

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,872
The Harbor Class of 2006 will be
immortalized in the yearbook for all time.

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,918
- Marissa has to be part of that.
- Are you saying what I think?

34
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,640
Yes. The dirty dean, he's gone. Right?

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,155
And Dr. Kim,
she's always seemed pretty reasonable.

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,754
Yeah, but the board kicked out Marissa,
not Dr. Kim.

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,638
- Plus, concerned parents...
- Whatever.

38
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,949
Out of sight, out of mind.

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,394
Time heals all wounds?

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,029
If you love something, set it fre... No?

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,873
- Maybe they're over it.
- Yeah. This town's real forgiving.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,758
They were all out of "faux-jitos"...

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,959
...so I got a couple "I'll Fake Manhattans"
and a "Safe Sex on the Beach."

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,032
Ryan, what if the four of us can
all finish senior year together?

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,794
Summer's planning
"Operation Free Marissa."

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,791
Secure allies, go behind enemy lines...

47
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,554
- Been watching The War Channel?
- It's the new Food Network.

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,432
- I'm up for a little danger and intrigue.
- See?

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,999
You seriously wanna do this?

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,233
Okay. All right. But we don't tell
Marissa until we have a plan.

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,277
Cheers. To get Marissa
where she belongs.

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,559
Anyone have an idea how?

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,240
I cannot believe
it is our last semester of high school.

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,914
I know.
College applications have been sent off.

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,991
Studying, homework, learning.

56
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,276
All the reasons
to come here are irrelevant.

57
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,352
Good. With your free time
you can help out with "Free Marissa."

58
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,317
And to what are we freeing her from?

59
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,516
Exile to public school?

60
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,549
A year of solitude, ill-fitting gym shorts,
mediocre lunches. Hey, there's Ryan.

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,676
Hey. Can't talk.
Appointment with Dr. Kim.

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,195
- What are you gonna say?
- Just gonna come out and ask.

63
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,510
All right. Direct approach. I like it.
Good luck.

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,989
Excellent.
Prong one of the campaign initiated.

65
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,674
You and I will take on prong two:
Grassroots movement.

66
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,116
You know, information booth,
petition, maybe a protest rally.

67
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,989
- How many prongs are involved in this?
- Dude, like, so many prongs.

68
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,677
Ryan, come on in.
What can I do for you?

69
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,400
Dr. Kim. Sorry I'm late.
I wanted to talk about Marissa.

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,028
- Oh, how's she doing over at Union?
- Good, good.

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,599
As good as can be expected.

72
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,752
Actually, I was wondering
if you might consider reinstating her.

73
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,911
- l...
- Grades are good, hasn't been in trouble.

74
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,152
I understand Marissa's expulsion
seemed terribly unfair to you...

75
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,788
...frankly, I wish the outcome
had been different myself.

76
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,190
- Would you let her reapply?
- Even if I wanted to...

77
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,830
...only the Board of Trustees has the
power to readmit an expelled student.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,479
Great. Could we meet with them?

79
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,518
They're meeting on Thursday
to discuss the new semester.

80
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,636
It's a little late...

81
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,030
...but...

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,950
...I could probably get
her case on the docket.

83
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
- That would be great.
- You're fighting an uphill battle.

84
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,308
- Wouldn't be the first.
- They rarely reverse decisions.

85
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,677
- All we need is a chance.
- Students are not allowed to speak.

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,068
You'll need a parent advocate.

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,435
I know someone who'd be
right for the job.

88
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,910
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,673
You might check the library
for transcripts of old meetings.

90
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,319
There might be a precedent.

91
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,754
Say...

92
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,150
...fall semester, 1996.

93
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,913
- Hey. Marissa.
- Johnny. Hey.

94
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,833
How was your break?
I feel like I haven't seen you in forever.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,992
Just been laying low since the operation.
Started physical therapy.

96
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,832
- Great.
- What have you been up to?

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,551
I don't know, just hanging out with Seth
and Summer, Ryan, doing nothing.

98
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,392
It was kind of great, actually.

99
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,191
Well, look, if you still got
nothing to do there's this...

100
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,794
...thing I want you to go to with me.

101
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,837
Okay. What kind of thing?

102
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,998
It's a party, actually.

103
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,833
You see, PacWest is doing
this big press event for their...

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,037
...2006 surf team on Thursday.
- The PacWest surf team?

105
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,838
Coach called asking
how the surgery went.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,389
It turns out one of their guys
failed the drug test.

107
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,754
I got an alternate spot.

108
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,480
I can do my physio- on the road,
and compete by summer.

109
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,676
- That's amazing, Johnny.
- Thanks.

110
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,314
We can only bring
one guest to the party, so...

111
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,198
...what do you say?
- Well, I mean, shouldn't you...

112
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,555
...take your mom, or, I don't know,
one of your entourage?

113
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,234
- I'm sure Chili's dying to go.
- No, I want you to go.

114
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,397
I mean, none of this would
be happening if it weren't for you.

115
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,829
All right, then I wouldn't miss it.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,959
- Hey, I'm really happy for you, Johnny.
- Thanks.

117
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,914
- First meeting of a new year.
- Of a brand-new enterprise.

118
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,638
- Let's dig in.
- Okay.

119
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,438
Divorced, divorced, separated, divorced.

120
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,397
So many broken marriages
in this town.

121
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,279
- It's an epidemic.
- Speaking of which...

122
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,197
- Dr. Roberts is getting a divorce?
- You didn't hear it from me.

123
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,074
I need to go say hi.
He's been so good to Marissa.

124
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,110
- Hey, Neil, how are you?
- Julie. Julie.

125
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,190
- Well, happy New Year.
- Should old acquaintance be forgot?

126
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,478
I don't think that you're in much danger
of being old, or forgot, any time soon.

127
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,914
You're too sweet.

128
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,674
I never properly thanked you
for having me over for dinner.

129
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,912
It was a pleasure. Took the focus off
of Gloria's conspicuous absence.

130
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
You haven't told Summer
about your separation?

131
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,557
No, she thinks Gloria didn't call
because she's in some Zen retreat.

132
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,917
Marissa thinks I'm supervising
the longest condo renovation in history.

133
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,189
I feel a couple of New Years
resolutions coming on.

134
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,674
If we're gonna launch a campaign
to get Marissa back...

135
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,308
...we have to find someone
who can organize the masses...

136
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,471
...someone who they'll follow
into battle.

137
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,029
You mean, General Townsend?

138
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,714
Affirmative.

139
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,999
- Hey. Taylor. Hi, Mad. Hey, Ash.
- Mad, Ash.

140
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,392
Summer, Seth. Hi! I left you guys
a message about my Boxing Day party.

141
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,595
I guess you didn't get it.
How was break, awesome?

142
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,991
Yes. So awesome, in fact,
that we need your help with something.

143
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,991
Oh, you want my help?

144
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,276
Whatever you need.
I'm there for you 110 percent.

145
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,829
- Cool. We're launching a campaign...
- I love campaigns.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,991
- to get Marissa back into Harbor.

147
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,674
That's...

148
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,592
...aggressive.

149
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,988
- Are you serious?
- Taylor...

150
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,388
...who out of our group...

151
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,836
...would be better at winning the hearts
and minds of the student body?

152
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,071
- Did you say, "our group"?
- So you'll do it.

153
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,879
It's an honor to share your foxhole.

154
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,389
We're going in front
of the trustees on Thursday...

155
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,632
...so I was thinking you could
go home tonight and brainstorm...

156
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,438
...we could go over the plan at 0800?

157
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,875
- Sounds good.
- Thanks, friend. Bye.

158
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,718
Oh, my God. Taylor.

159
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,238
Marissa is your number one rival.

160
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,597
If she gets back into Harbor,
she'II, like, totally socially crush you.

161
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,913
Grow up, Ashley.
That is so last semester.

162
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,799
I hate to be the one
to burst your popularity bubble...

163
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,713
...but isn't your mom
still head of the Parents Association?

164
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,155
- So?
- So she's the one who started...

165
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,914
...the petition to get Marissa kicked out
in the first place.

166
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,236
Also last semester.

167
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,193
- I'm sure she's totally over it.
- Your mom? Over it?

168
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
And, in 1996, the board voted
to reinstate a kid due to...

169
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,509
..."extenuating circumstances" after he
threatened another student with a knife.

170
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,671
You've done your homework.

171
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,239
So that's precedent, right?

172
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,437
Yeah, but a precedent is just
a small piece of a bigger puzzle.

173
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,272
It doesn't guarantee anything.

174
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,876
Look, if you're saying we don't
have a case, then it's fine, I get it.

175
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,759
But if this is because you
don't want Marissa...

176
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,990
...and me going to the same school...

177
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,549
...I promise you,
things are different now.

178
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,348
- You have a shot. But it's a long one.
- Okay.

179
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,239
We need a parent advocate
to address the board. Would you?

180
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,710
A good cause, poor odds, a chance
to ruffle some Newpsie feathers?

181
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,075
How could I say no?
Who's the chairman this year?

182
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,031
- Guy named Mercer.
- Jim Mercer?

183
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,872
- Yeah. You know him?
- He's a judge.

184
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,316
- I've argued before him many times.
- And that's a good thing, right?

185
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,349
Well, he's what they call a
"hanging judge." He's a real hardass.

186
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,875
- We'll have to present a good case.
- Great.

187
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,594
Now, all we gotta do is...

188
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,474
Cross your fingers
because it is all handled.

189
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,437
Any luck, you'll be back Friday morning.

190
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,834
Is that the good kind of speechless
or the bad kind?

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,958
Good kind.
I just... Wow, could it really happen?

192
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,712
It's not a sure thing, but, yeah.

193
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,839
Look, I know that you just got settled
at Union, you made a few friends...

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,036
...if you're happy,
I don't wanna mess it up.

195
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,758
No, are you kidding?

196
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,876
I'd love to finish
high school with you guys.

197
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,589
All right. I'm gonna grab dinner,
check in with Sandy and call you later.

198
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,916
- Hey, when's the meeting?
- Thursday.

199
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,119
- This Thursday?
- Yeah. That all right?

200
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,438
Yeah.

201
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,589
Hey.

202
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,672
- Hey, did you talk to Ryan?
- Yeah.

203
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,479
Not exactly the triumphant
enthusiasm I was expecting.

204
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,791
I'm sorry. I really do appreciate
everything you guys have been doing.

205
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,393
- But?
- Does anyone...

206
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,879
...even want me back at Harbor?

207
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,759
- Other than your three best friends?
- What if it doesn't work?

208
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,990
It's gonna work.

209
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,470
- And the meeting is this Thursday?
- Coop, what is going on?

210
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,710
It's just that PacWest is
announcing Johnny...

211
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,950
...as an alternate on their
team that night...

212
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,872
...and I promised him I'd be there.

213
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,998
Well, that's really nice of you
but you're gonna have to cancel.

214
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,388
Sorry.

215
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,959
He'll be happy for you.

216
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,590
The boys seem really excited
about getting Marissa back into Harbor.

217
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,953
- You think she has a chance?
- There's a good argument to be made.

218
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,348
- Morning.
- Good morning.

219
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,030
The boys have poster board and paint.

220
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,431
I love student activism.

221
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,716
Yeah. Did you get a chance
to call Judge Mercer?

222
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,996
He's gonna be out of town
until Wednesday.

223
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,994
But I did speak to another trustee, and
we'll be given a fair chance to present.

224
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,628
Let us know if there's anything
we can do. We should go.

225
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,712
Yeah, Summer will kick our ass
if we're late with our supply drop.

226
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,629
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

227
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,315
This isn't the same Judge Mercer
that jailed you for contempt?

228
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,869
Six hours in the slammer.
He didn't like my closing.

229
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,234
And to this day...

230
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,836
...I don't understand what it is I said
to the guy that struck such a nerve.

231
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,072
All I remember is that he hated you,
passionately.

232
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,191
- Maybe he won't remember.
- Not likely.

233
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,430
And he's not out of town.
He's ignoring me.

234
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,239
Thinks anything a counselor has to say,
should be on record.

235
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,073
Oh, come on.
It's not like this is an actual trial.

236
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,356
Tell that to Judge Mercer.

237
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,518
You need to see the PacWest doctor?
Why can't your doctor send your charts?

238
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,636
It's something to do
with their insurance.

239
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,030
I'm sure it's just standard stuff.

240
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,553
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

241
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,151
Can I talk to you for a sec?

242
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,633
If you want, I can give you a lift
to the doctor's at lunch.

243
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,711
If you want,
I can give you a lift any time.

244
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,197
I thought you were done
with the doctors.

245
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,113
Yeah, it's just a routine postop thing.
It's no big deal.

246
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,157
- Okay.
- So, what's up?

247
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,558
I was gonna call you last night.

248
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,915
I don't think I can make it to your party.

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,195
- You're not sure, or...?
- No. No, I can't.

250
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,158
See, there's this board meeting
at my old school...

251
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,514
...and I have to be there...

252
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,478
...because they're gonna decide
whether or not I can reapply.

253
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,957
- You're going back to private school?
- Well, it's not a done deal.

254
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,238
- But, yeah, I'm gonna try.
- That's great.

255
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,235
Really? Because I was worried
you might be upset.

256
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,437
- Why? I mean, I'm happy for you.
- Right. Of course.

257
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,876
Chili will be stoked, you know.
He was next in line for the party, so...

258
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,439
I'm really sorry.

259
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,158
You'll go to the next one.

260
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,871
All right. See you later.

261
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,197
- Okay, how many flyers do we have?
- Four stacks of 200.

262
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,430
Okay, good.
I want one on every locker by lunch.

263
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,830
You put the extras
on bathroom stalls and mirrors.

264
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,833
- Any word on the T-shirts?
- Ryan's supposed to get them at lunch.

265
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,754
Great. I'm gonna pressure my button guy,
see if I can get them at the same time.

266
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,954
Fire in the hole.

267
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,358
- Taylor.
- Mom, what are you doing here?

268
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,556
- My pre-meeting.
- Taylor's mom's on the board?

269
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,713
Do you know there's a motion on the
docket to reinstate Marissa Cooper?

270
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,029
- Yes.
- Flyer?

271
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,954
May I have a word with you?

272
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,035
I don't know what she's saying,
but it can't be good.

273
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,919
"How dare you do this
without talking to me."

274
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,038
I can read lips. <i>Star</i> magazine,
"What the Stars are Really Saying."

275
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,638
- I'm helping my friends, Mom.
- You don't have any friends.

276
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,155
Which is one of the reasons
why I had Marissa Cooper...

277
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,630
- "Removed from school in the first place."
- That's so demented.

278
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,152
Oh, you dropped your...
You dropped your... Your flyer.

279
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,393
I can't help you guys anymore. Sorry.

280
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,710
Taylor...

281
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,956
- I guess that means no button guy.
- Oh, Seth.

282
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,712
I wanted to meet the button guy.

283
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,398
I'm looking at a comp sheet
that puts the property value at 12.

284
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,757
Yeah, I'm meeting him right now.
Okay, I'll call you back in 20.

285
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,319
So...

286
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,517
...I say we put a cash bid
on the Urbina building at eleven-five.

287
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,875
You said the Urbina building
was overvalued.

288
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,918
Before my guy found out
Lockheed will build a plant in the area.

289
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,718
Oh, well done. Your guy?

290
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,518
Yeah. I have a guy.

291
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,154
He's your guy too.

292
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,268
Licensed private investigator,
registered with the state.

293
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,032
Completely legal. Above the board.

294
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,714
Maybe he could dig up something
on Honorable Jim Mercer.

295
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,677
- Who's that?
- Head of the Harbor Board...

296
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,673
...who has final say on whether
Marissa will be readmitted.

297
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,831
- That's a problem?
- He's not a fan of mine.

298
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,514
I'll put in a call.

299
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,399
Just a background check.
See what comes up. It'll be fun.

300
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,873
- Hey.
- Hey.

301
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,759
- What are you doing here?
- I dropped by to give you an update.

302
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,673
- And some schwag. What do you think?
- I love it.

303
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,717
What's next? Coffee mugs,
baseball caps?

304
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,792
- Whatever it takes.
- I can't believe this is happening.

305
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,756
Where's Johnny?
Doesn't he eat with you?

306
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,956
Yeah, well, he had a
doctor's appointment.

307
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,031
PacWest is giving him a second chance.

308
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,713
- Really? That's great.
- Yeah.

309
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,438
Everything's finally working out.

310
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,552
Hello?

311
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,269
Okay.

312
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,317
Are you sure?

313
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,316
Okay, well, then I'll come right now.
All right.

314
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,756
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, that was just Chili.

315
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,071
I guess he's not feeling well
so I need to bring him this book.

316
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,754
- You need to bring him a book now?
- It won't take long.

317
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,036
- All right. I can drive you.
- No, you get back.

318
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,351
Help Summer on the front lines.
I'll see you guys at the diner, okay?

319
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,272
- Yeah.
- Thanks for stopping by.

320
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,078
Yeah.

321
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,510
Don't tell me there's a problem
with the shirts.

322
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,069
T-shirts are fine. They're in the car.
It's Marissa.

323
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,955
I just came from Union. She got a call
and took off. Something I should know?

324
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,634
- Well, there might be a slight issue.
- Right.

325
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,031
I mean, not like an "issue" issue.
A friend issue. A Johnny issue.

326
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,832
She's afraid she might
be abandoning him.

327
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,117
- Of course she is.
- Wait! Stand down, private.

328
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,317
It's the way she's wired.
You wouldn't love her if she wasn't.

329
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,835
She wants to come back here
and she told Johnny.

330
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,275
If you wanna get mad
and punch somebody...

331
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,510
...or something, why not Taylor's mom?

332
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,355
You need to get your ass back into gear,
and start handing out some buttons.

333
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,473
- Neil.
- Julie.

334
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,392
- What a nice surprise.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

335
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,710
I mean, I didn't expect
to see you at home.

336
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,030
- I'm looking for Marissa.
- The girls aren't home.

337
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,111
Why don't you come in.

338
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,471
So no rhinos to plasty today?

339
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,916
No, Gloria called. She wants her things
sent to her sister's in Napa.

340
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,832
So I cleared my schedule...

341
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,433
...thought I'd talk with Summer.

342
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,955
Aren't we two peas in a pod?

343
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,872
Now that Marissa might go to Harbor...

344
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,237
...the money I've saved for a new place
will go to tuition.

345
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,994
Kind of forces my hand
with the trailer situation.

346
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,958
- I don't know what she's gonna think.
- She's gonna be grateful.

347
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,716
Her mom making sacrifices
for her future.

348
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,473
Oh, yeah.

349
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,996
Girls should be home...

350
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,957
Should be home any minute.

351
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,393
They were up most of the night
working on that petition.

352
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,869
- They're so hopeful.
- Here we are to ruin everything.

353
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,314
Really.

354
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,878
It's really selfish of us
if you think about it, isn't it?

355
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,389
Yeah. You know, I suppose
I could wait a few days, you know?

356
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,754
See how everything pans out.

357
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,036
Seems like more of a
weekend conversation.

358
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,158
- You are so right.
- You know, I could really go for a drink.

359
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,833
You read my mind.

360
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,394
Oh, my God.

361
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,316
Where is he?

362
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,554
Who knows?

363
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,188
PacWest doctors
refused to sign off on his knee.

364
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,033
Said it's too soon to tell whether
he'll be back 100 percent.

365
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,519
They won't let him tour.

366
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,834
I've never seen him like this.
Not even after the accident.

367
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,956
- Well, we gotta find him.
- Tell him what?

368
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,994
Everything's gonna be okay?

369
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,469
The guy's future's trashed.
He's lost everything.

370
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,950
I don't know if he'll
make it back from this.

371
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,797
I can't believe we spent
all day canvassing...

372
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,632
...and we only have,
like, 13 signatures.

373
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,314
Say what you want about Taylor,
the girl's connected.

374
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,916
Cheerleaders, water polo players,
the band.

375
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,833
- When she turned, they turned.
- All right. It's down to us...

376
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,638
...the AV Club, and the comic geeks.

377
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,999
- Actually, Leon's still a bit of a holdout.
- Wait, shut up. Just act positive, okay?

378
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,720
- Hey.
- We are gonna rock that hearing.

379
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,871
- We really are.
- Guys, I don't think I can go.

380
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,233
- What? Why? What happened?
- I appreciate everything you have done...

381
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,311
...but I don't think
I can go back to Harbor.

382
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,515
- Hi.
- Hey.

383
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,389
So I know I didn't feel
like talking about it last night...

384
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,596
...but I owe you an explanation.

385
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,792
- It's Johnny.
- I kind of figured that.

386
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,316
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

387
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,710
It's just, I wanted to
come back to Harbor.

388
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,270
Okay. So, what's wrong now?

389
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,955
PacWest changed their mind. They're
not letting him on the tour after all.

390
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,348
He's really freaked out.

391
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,557
- You gotta stop making this your problem.
- But it is my problem.

392
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,951
I mean, his girlfriend, the accident,
getting kicked off the team.

393
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,795
Are not your fault. You can't give up
your one chance to go back to Harbor...

394
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,871
...just so Johnny
has someone to hang with.

395
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,033
- I never asked you to do this.
- So you're saying we shouldn't have?

396
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,358
No. No.

397
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,397
I don't know. I'm sorry.

398
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,669
Well, we're meeting here
before going to the school tonight.

399
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,670
Just so you know.

400
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,192
My guy came through on your judge.

401
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,557
You don't have to use it
if you don't want to, but it's interesting.

402
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,797
- And not irrelevant to the matter at hand.
- Tell me the short version.

403
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,032
The judge has a son, Nick.
And he's got a drug problem.

404
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,112
Got kicked out of military school.
Nobody's heard from him since.

405
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,553
Case where he and I squared off,
I was defending a kid like that.

406
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,759
Well, if the judge wants to play hardball
with Ryan's friend, you have ammunition.

407
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,194
To what?

408
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,194
Exploit his family's tragedy?
Embarrass him in front of the community?

409
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,669
- I just thought you'd wanna know.
- I do.

410
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,274
Thank you. It's gonna be tricky.

411
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,432
There will be four very disappointed
kids if I make a wrong move.

412
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,276
Free Marissa.
Help Marissa get back into Harbor.

413
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,398
- Sign our petition?
- Sign this, geek.

414
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,916
- I'm not gonna sign his genitals.
- Okay, we are, like, getting crushed.

415
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,550
I don't understand why this is happening.
Even if people don't like Marissa...

416
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,756
What? Whoa. Everybody likes Marissa.

417
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,957
Even if they didn't, they could still sign.
What do they care?

418
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,554
That's the point. They don't.
This school is apathetic.

419
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,792
They need someone who can inspire.
Someone who can intimidate.

420
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,758
- They need Taylor.
- Yeah.

421
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,718
You know, maybe it's better
to be feared than loved.

422
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,950
You have my permission
to do whatever it takes.

423
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,313
- And what is "it"?
- I'm picturing, like, <i>Indecent Proposal.</i>

424
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,598
You're Demi, naturally, and Taylor is the
leather-faced guy who talks to horses.

425
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,194
- You want me to trade sex for signatures?
- Just get her.

426
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,749
I need Marissa back at this school.

427
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,319
I feel so dirty.

428
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,358
- I'm not going to school today, Mom.
- Mom just left for work.

429
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,988
She let me in on her way out.

430
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,400
Marissa told me about the tour.

431
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,279
I'm sorry, man.

432
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,316
- She send you to check up on me?
- Doesn't know I'm here.

433
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,314
But she is the reason I came.

434
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,074
- Is she okay?
- That depends on how you look at it.

435
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,631
She's... She's decided to stay
at Newport Union.

436
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,271
You private school kids find it hard...

437
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,271
First, don't lecture me
about public school.

438
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,752
Second, she's not staying for the quality
of the education. She's staying for you.

439
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,553
- Well, I didn't ask her to do anything.
- You didn't have to.

440
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,309
No matter what anyone says...

441
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,074
...it's still gonna be her choice.

442
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,390
Just wanna make sure
she feels free to make it.

443
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,356
Sandy?

444
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,909
- Hey.
- You have lunch yet?

445
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,870
I was signing a new client at the deli and
I picked you up a turkey pastrami on rye.

446
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,758
- With mustard?
- Spicy Dijon.

447
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,592
My hero.

448
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,558
Bad day?

449
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,517
I've been faced with an ethical dilemma.

450
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,752
Well, if I do say so,
my ethics are excellent.

451
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,990
Try me.

452
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,278
- Judge Mercer.
- Hates you and tried to get you disbarred.

453
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,668
The very one.

454
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,637
Turns out he's the father of a junkie.

455
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,789
His kid got kicked out of school...

456
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,076
...and he fell right off the map.

457
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,310
And you think you can
use this information...

458
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,232
...to shame him into
helping Marissa?

459
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,550
The thought has crossed my mind.

460
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,872
Well, what would you do...

461
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,600
...if you were a public defender
and Marissa your client?

462
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,917
Taylor? Hey, we need to talk.

463
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,277
Well, I'd love to talk to you.
About anything but Marissa Cooper.

464
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,715
I have been sanctioned to
offer you sexual favors.

465
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,438
I swear, Summer said it was okay.

466
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,200
Anything else,
you would be facing a long night...

467
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,433
...involving candle wax, tube socks,
and the new Fiona Apple CD.

468
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,711
But Marissa? I can't.

469
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,952
Well, lucky for both of us,
I've optioned to forgo man-whoring...

470
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,680
...and make an appeal to your heart.
I know you have one.

471
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,400
- Seth, don't.
- Now, I am your friend.

472
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,235
So is Summer, and so is Ryan,
and if Marissa came back, her too.

473
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,958
Okay. You don't get it.

474
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,269
My mom's a sports agent.

475
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,477
A sports agent? I thought
she was just a bored, bitter, Newpsie.

476
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,914
A bored, bitter, ball buster.

477
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,595
Three-hundred pound football players go
to her when they need something done.

478
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,030
- She'll take away my car.
- We'll give you a ride.

479
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,872
- Not pay for college.
- Scholarship.

480
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,193
- I'm sorry.
- Fine.

481
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,999
But as your friend,
I'm gonna beg you to do one thing.

482
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,675
Do not grow up to be like your mom,
because you're too good for that.

483
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,112
I don't want any pigeon pie, Gus.

484
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,715
I think it's terrible
what you do to those little birds.

485
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:41,236
- Neil. Wow. This is a surprise.
- Well, I figured I owed you one.

486
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,433
So this is what one of these
looks like on the inside, huh?

487
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,476
- Pork rinds.
- Yeah, well, when in Rome.

488
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,438
Not dressed for the hearing?
I was hoping you might need a ride.

489
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,470
Thank you, but truthfully,
I don't think I'm gonna go.

490
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,471
Marissa just might be better off
without me.

491
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,108
Well, that's nonsense.
Every girl needs her mom.

492
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,198
And I'm gonna be in your corner.

493
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,999
I give a lot of money to that school.

494
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,589
Give me five minutes.

495
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,517
I'll just take these and I'll be outside...

496
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,150
...trading stock tips
with your friend Gus, huh?

497
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,159
- No word back from Taylor.
- We gotta leave and no sign of Marissa.

498
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,038
Wait. So, what are you guys saying?

499
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,919
- That this was a valiant campaign.
- Yeah. Really valiant.

500
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,832
One any general would be proud of.

501
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,753
Surrender much?
I bet Napoleon never talked like this.

502
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,388
He should have,
right before he was defeated and exiled.

503
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,279
Summer, my little empress,
this is our Waterloo.

504
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,113
We need to retreat
and minimize collateral damage.

505
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,670
Well, can't we just wait a couple minutes
before we raise the white flag?

506
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,992
She's always late. I mean,
maybe she got lost, or something.

507
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,633
Marissa? Aren't you supposed
to be at that Harbor thing?

508
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,679
No. But, hey, have you seen Johnny?
Because I've been looking for him all day.

509
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,034
I know, it's crazy, right?

510
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,316
I gotta go,
we'll be late for the PacWest thing.

511
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,677
- Wait. What PacWest thing?
- You haven't talked to Johnny at all?

512
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,191
It turns out that that fancy surgeon
that you hooked him up with...

513
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,510
...went to med school
with the PacWest doctor.

514
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,116
He convinced the guy Johnny would make
a full recovery. He's back on the team.

515
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,596
- He didn't tell me.
- It's been insane.

516
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,958
They want him to leave next month.
Hired some tutor to help with the GED.

517
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,554
I've hit up my dad for flyer miles
so I could tag along.

518
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,234
- Wait, you're going too?
- It's the chance of a lifetime.

519
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,752
Anyways, it's kind of funny
how it all worked out, huh?

520
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,356
I mean, Johnny and I hitting the road,
you going back to your old school.

521
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,637
Yeah. Hey, I gotta go. If you see Johnny,
will you congratulate him for me?

522
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,392
- I will.
- Okay.

523
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,113
Summer, we can't wait any longer.
Marissa's not coming.

524
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,276
Okay. Fine.

525
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,954
All right. I'll tell Sandy.

526
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,509
Sandy's waiting in the car.

527
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,717
I told him we'd be right out.
You guys ready?

528
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,074
Yeah.

529
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,760
- Thanks so much for doing this.
- Yeah, it means a lot.

530
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,673
Ornery judge, captive audience,
righteousness on my side.

531
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,068
I feel right at home.

532
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,871
This is what you do. You'll be great.

533
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,270
Judge Mercer. Sandy Cohen.

534
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,079
I know who you are.
It will be a cold day in hell, Cohen.

535
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,593
I'm looking forward to this.

536
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,635
Oh, yeah. You gotta bury him.

537
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,351
Sandy. Hi, Kirsten.
Sorry to bother you both, but...

538
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,080
- We're about to start here.
- I know. You wanna hear this.

539
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,630
- All right. Be right back.
- Okay.

540
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,833
Mom, please, if you wanna do this,
it's your decision...

541
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,309
...but don't make me face
my friends while you do it.

542
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,277
You are either with me,
or against me.

543
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,670
Now, which is it?

544
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,991
I have to go to the little girls' room.

545
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,270
- Dr. Kim, may I have a word with you?
- Yes, Veronica.

546
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,036
- I had my guy keep digging.
- I've been thinking. I don't know.

547
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,234
Tell me everything.

548
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,356
- Hey, Taylor. It's Seth...
- And Summer.

549
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,476
Hi, Seth and Summer.

550
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,790
We were hoping
we might see you at the meeting.

551
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,794
Yeah.

552
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,393
No.

553
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,549
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

554
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,832
- I know you must be really mad at me.
- No, it's okay. It's your mom. We get it.

555
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,434
Well, listen, thanks for trying.
We'll just...

556
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,036
- We'll let you know how everything goes.
- Thanks.

557
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,475
That's really nice.

558
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,111
Look. Speak of the devil. Literally.

559
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,079
- Neil, always a pleasure.
- Veronica.

560
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,317
- You know Julie Cooper-Nichol?
- Hi.

561
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,597
Of course. Marissa's a real
chip off the old block, isn't she?

562
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,592
I couldn't agree with you more.
Brains, beauty and a flair for fashion.

563
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,834
Excuse me.

564
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,478
Maybe this was a bad idea.

565
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,313
Good evening. Thank you all for coming.

566
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,711
I see it's a full house tonight,
and I think we all know what...

567
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,440
...or should I say who,
brought in the crowd.

568
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,229
So why don't we just start
with the matter of Marissa Cooper.

569
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,597
Ms. Townsend, you're speaking
on behalf of the Parents' Association.

570
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,352
Would you care to open?

571
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,909
- Where's Dad?
- He'll be right back.

572
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,832
Thank you, Judge Mercer.

573
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,869
As I'm sure you all know,
Marissa Cooper shot a boy in the back.

574
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,476
As head of the Parents' Association,
and a concerned parent myself...

575
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,757
...I can tell you,
this is not what the parents want.

576
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,356
And not what the Harbor students
want either.

577
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,669
Yes, it is.

578
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,879
Sit down, young lady.

579
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,270
Children are not permitted
to address the board.

580
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,637
But they're allowed
to address each other, right?

581
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,315
Taylor, why don't you show us
what you've got.

582
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,273
It's a petition.

583
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,195
With over 300 signatures.
Basically, the entire student body.

584
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,238
Well, this is all well and good.

585
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,992
But Ms. Townsend is correct.

586
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,234
Students do not make the decisions
on these matters.

587
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,592
Well, I am not a student.

588
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,671
And I would like to tell everyone here...

589
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,875
...that Marissa has shown dignity and
maturity throughout this entire nightmare.

590
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,395
Of course you think so.
You're her mother.

591
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,438
You're absolutely right,
so I'll speak on behalf of Ms. Cooper.

592
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,599
Go Dr. Roberts. Right. You... Sorry, sir.

593
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,754
Marissa's been living in my home
for the past few months...

594
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,912
...so I can say without hesitation...

595
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,389
...that this young lady
would make any father proud.

596
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,232
This school would be lucky
to have her.

597
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,952
That's a nice sentiment, Dr. Roberts.

598
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,034
And this student petition
is certainly meaningful.

599
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,351
But I don't think I can advise the board
to break precedent here.

600
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,270
This school has never readmitted
a student...

601
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,398
...who has been expelled
for reasons relating to violence.

602
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,676
That's not exactly true.

603
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,398
- There is precedent.
- He's right.

604
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,797
Ten years ago. A case not all
that different from Marissa's.

605
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,236
It was a knife, not a gun,
but the incident occurred on campus.

606
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,873
And after no criminal charges were filed,
the expulsion was reversed.

607
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,237
The students need to respect
the sanctity of this hearing and shut up.

608
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,556
Unfortunately...

609
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,555
...though this young man
is speaking out of turn...

610
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,954
...he's right.

611
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,230
- But I still don't have to reinstate.
- You don't have to reinstate...

612
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,078
...but you might want to.
- Oh, enlighten me, Mr. Cohen.

613
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,673
Why would I wanna do that?

614
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,514
Because sometimes a good kid
goes through a rough time.

615
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,389
And we might think
by closing a door to her...

616
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,515
...or to him, we're teaching a lesson.

617
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,955
And when the child needs us the most...

618
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,348
...we're not there for them.

619
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,791
There isn't a person in
this room that thinks...

620
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,678
...Marissa Cooper is a threat to anyone...

621
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,073
...or that she wasn't a model student,
or that she wouldn't continue to be.

622
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,753
So, what are we doing here?

623
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,916
Instead of proving a point,
let's right a wrong.

624
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,754
It's so rare in life...

625
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,473
...that anyone gets a second chance.

626
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,472
The board has reached its verdict.

627
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,676
And with only one dissenting vote...

628
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,355
...we have decided to let
Marissa Cooper return to Harbor.

629
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,877
Hello.

630
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,873
Do you guys think that I could
get a ride home?

631
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,917
- Yeah, we can manage that.
- Okay.

632
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,197
A ride? Hell, no.
Sister, you're sleeping over.

633
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,676
- Your Honor.
- This isn't a courtroom, Mr. Cohen.

634
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,559
Right.
Well, I just wanted to say thank you.

635
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,394
I know what you were doing.

636
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,473
But you made your case.

637
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,837
And I appreciate that you've kept
your information just between us.

638
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,471
l...

639
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,430
- I know where he is.
- What?

640
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,513
The private detective tracked him down
to Los Angeles. He's safe.

641
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,511
My friend brought him to this shelter.

642
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,316
He said he'd like to see you.

643
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,038
Thank you.

644
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,117
My hero.

645
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,230
- Thanks for being here, Mom.
- Oh, Marissa.

646
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,436
I feel like I've let you down
in so many ways.

647
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,953
That's really not true.

648
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,315
There is no condo. No renovations.

649
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,394
I live in a trailer park.
I was too ashamed to tell you.

650
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,833
Well, I knew
there was something, but...

651
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,479
I'll come home whenever you want.

652
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,710
Oh, sweetheart.

653
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,353
Thanks, Dad. That was pretty cool of
you, standing up for Marissa like that.

654
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,476
Too bad Gloria wasn't here to see you.

655
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,029
Yeah.

656
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,918
Listen, sweetheart.

657
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,548
I don't think your step-mom's
gonna be coming back.

658
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,632
I'm sorry, Dad.

659
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,395
But you didn't have to be so scared
to tell me. I mean, we do okay, right?

660
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,870
- Right.
- Okay.

661
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,952
I think that we are gonna go to the diner.
We'll see you later.

662
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,997
- Coop.
- Coming.

663
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,718
- Ready?
- Have fun, you guys.

664
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,518
Okay.

665
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,592
You know, all things considered,
I think I raised a pretty good kid.

666
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,228
I think we both did.

667
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,989
- You wanna...?
- Drink?

668
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,469
- Hey.
- Hey.

669
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,834
Hey.

670
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,671
So, what changed your mind
about coming back here?

671
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,674
Well, Johnny got put on the PacWest tour
and Chili said he was gonna go with him.

672
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,956
It seemed stupid
to stay at Union by myself.

673
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,190
All right. It wasn't me?

674
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,588
- No.
- Little bit?

675
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,954
- Okay, a little.
- Okay.

676
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,633
- Coop, Atwood, come on.
- Coming.

677
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,509
- Why don't I meet you at the diner.
- Okay. All right. I'll see you there.

678
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,556
Called your house.
Your mom said you'd be here.

679
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,873
Told her I was really happy for you.

680
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,235
Getting back on the team.

681
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,476
Yeah, well...

682
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,789
...just lucky I guess.

683
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,992
Thank you.

684
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,912
She deserves to be happy.

685
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,233
All right, we'll see you around?

686
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,630
Yeah, sure.

687
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,597
See you.

688
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,758
Harbor rocks!

689
