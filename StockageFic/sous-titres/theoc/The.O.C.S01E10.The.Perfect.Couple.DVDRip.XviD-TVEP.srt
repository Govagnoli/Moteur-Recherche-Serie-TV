1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,710
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- You and Marissa want different things.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,474
- You don't know what she wants!
- I know what she doesn't want.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,596
I wanna live with Dad.
At least for now.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,751
Then train me
in the ways of women.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,037
- Why are you helping him with Summer?
- Seth doesn't see me that way.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,679
And you're gonna let that slide?

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,717
Is this all part of the plan?

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,235
This is a policy-changing,
career-making piece of litigation.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,516
- My wife's company is the plaintiff.
- Her father's company.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,193
- You're gonna take this.
- It's who you married.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,238
If your marriage can't survive this,
what kind of marriage is it?

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,356
I wanna make it work. No matter what.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,956
- Ticklish.
- Sorry.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,436
- What time do you have?
- Almost 11.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,592
What time do you have
to be back at your dad's?

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,274
- Soon.
- How soon?

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,396
Now.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,590
You can't call? Say you'll be late?

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,711
I'm already late.

20
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,916
It's a school night.

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,473
It's too bad you don't still live next door.

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,313
Yeah. But then I'd have
to talk to my mom.

23
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,074
You haven't talked to her?

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,719
No.

25
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,599
She keeps trying to call me,
but there's no way I'm...

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,988
Hey.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,353
Sorry.

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,516
Maybe this weekend,
we could spend a whole night together.

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,270
You know, we could go out,
do something.

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,635
Finally have our first official date.

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,598
No school. No parents. Just us.

32
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,156
Saturday night.

33
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,188
Cool.

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,718
Hey, Ryan. Sandy's stuck at the...
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,553
Hey, Kirsten.

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,872
Hey, Marissa.
I didn't know that you had company.

37
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,828
Yeah. Well, I was just gonna go.
So see you.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,036
- Later.
- Good night.

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,270
Drive safely.

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,799
It's never happened with Seth.

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,110
- You walked in on them?
- Well, at least I knocked.

42
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,158
Ryan and Marissa Cooper.
I knew it. Didn't I tell you?

43
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,231
- No.
- No?

44
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,310
Sandy, maybe you should talk to him.

45
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,193
- About what?
- You know. Sex.

46
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,830
- Sounds like he knows what he's doing.
- I mean, sex in the house.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,639
- We obviously don't believe in that.
- We don't?

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,395
Based on my recent experience,
or lack thereof, I'd have to say no.

49
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,711
Hey, I'm not the one coming home
from the office at midnight.

50
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,472
You come home at 11:45.

51
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,839
I might be coming home earlier
if your firm wasn't suing my company.

52
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,158
Well, look, maybe we'll get lucky
and settle at the conference tomorrow.

53
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,039
Maybe we'll get lucky tonight.

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,589
I'd settle for that. What time?

55
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,876
- How about 8?
- Eight?

56
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,190
- Nine?
- Nine-thirty?

57
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,397
- Lf you're not home by 10:00...
- Yeah?

58
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,074
...I'm gonna start without you.

59
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,712
Morning!

60
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,753
Hi.

61
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,878
- We're all very proud.
- Thanks.

62
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,636
And sorry. I just wanted
to say sorry about last night.

63
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,519
- Sorry about what? What did I miss?
- You should talk to him.

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,069
I appreciate you guys
being so cool about everything.

65
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,674
- Cool about what?
- I'll see you tonight.

66
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,637
We should get going too.

67
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,155
Not till somebody tells me
what happened.

68
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,709
Mom, would you please fill me in?

69
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,077
Mom!
I get it, I'm just here for comic relief.

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,269
So, what exactly did my mom
catch you guys doing?

71
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,113
- Nothing.
- Nothing, huh?

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,919
- So you guys haven't...?
- Haven't even had our first date.

73
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,117
- Last night doesn't count?
- No. We're going out Saturday night.

74
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,077
Good. Great.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,231
But you have before, right?

76
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,995
Okay. That's what I thought.
I didn't want to jump to conclusions.

77
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,072
My experience is sort of limited.

78
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,878
- And?
- And what?

79
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,349
Was it awesome?

80
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,398
Which time?

81
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,437
There were...?
How many times were there?

82
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,037
- Same girl or different girls?
- There were different girls?

83
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,230
How many different girls were there?

84
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,878
I have to sit down.

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,555
- So, what happened? I want details.
- Nothing happened.

86
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,598
- What's his problem?
- There is no problem.

87
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,719
- I just don't know if I'm ready yet.
- But Luke took care of that painful part.

88
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,474
Yeah, and look how well
that turned out.

89
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,950
Look, Ryan and I, we're still
getting to know each other.

90
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,669
- We're going on our first date Saturday.
- That should be romantic.

91
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,798
Sorry, Coop. It's just, what does
Chino know about a date?

92
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,428
Where he's from,
they don't even have a P.F. Chang's.

93
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,399
When you lost your virginity,
I was playing Magic: The Gathering.

94
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,916
- You still play Magic.
- Yeah, but not as much.

95
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,833
- Hey. What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,797
Ryan was telling me about
your big date.

97
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,632
He's got a whole thing happening.

98
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,836
Wow, there's a whole thing happening?

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,629
Yeah, but it's a surprise. It's gonna
be the best date ever. I have to go.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,275
- Summer, I'll walk you to bio.
- I can walk myself.

101
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,192
Great, then you can walk me too.

102
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,238
Best date ever, huh?

103
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,114
The ecological risk assessment
backs up our claim...

104
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,510
...that the land Caleb Nichol
plans to develop...

105
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,831
...should be considered as wetlands.
- Oh, great.

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,150
Great. We'll get into that tomorrow.

107
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,550
What do you got tonight?
A hot date?

108
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,948
Yeah.

109
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,635
Sandy Cohen, you are cheating
on me, with your wife.

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,228
I'm trying.

111
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,834
- What is it, your anniversary?
- No.

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,629
We haven't seen each other
in a while, so we thought we'd...

113
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,678
Go on a date. Why not? Good idea.

114
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,559
It's not like we have
our settlement conference tomorrow...

115
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,156
...where the fate of Orange County's
environment hangs in the balance.

116
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,469
All right. The date will even be better
after the conference. Less stress.

117
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,151
Dad, good news...
I'm sorry, I didn't know you...

118
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,436
- Julie.
- Kirsten.

119
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,398
Your father and I
were just talking about you.

120
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,917
This man just single-handedly saved
the children's hospital benefit.

121
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,719
- I did no such thing.
- He's so modest.

122
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,714
I'd just lost the Buckley yacht,
when he agreed to let me use his.

123
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,440
The man just gives and gives.

124
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,275
I didn't know that you were organizing
the children's hospital benefit.

125
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,797
I wasn't going to, but it's time I stopped
dwelling on my own problems...

126
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,316
...and got back to focusing
on the needs of others, right?

127
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,550
So must be off.

128
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,358
Cal.

129
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,831
I owe you bigtime.

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,991
- Bye, Kirsten.
- Bye, Julie.

131
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,638
- She is something, isn't she?
- She is that.

132
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,995
You know, you are now
the official sponsor...

133
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,720
...of the Julie Cooper Comeback Tour.

134
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,508
It's for charity.

135
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,399
After all the bad press
your husband's been getting us...

136
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,755
...it can't hurt to be involved
in a good cause.

137
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,239
So, what was your good news?

138
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,233
We can have that
working dinner after all.

139
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,188
- Sandy cancelled your date?
- They have some last-minute prep work.

140
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,920
- By "they" you mean Sandy and...
- Rachel, yes.

141
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,958
She's attractive?
And he got in at midnight last night?

142
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,111
- I trust him.
- You know what they say.

143
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,396
The only man a girl should trust
is her father.

144
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,074
They're working together. That's all.

145
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,957
I suggest we do the same.
See you later.

146
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,473
Why don't you just take her
to dinner and a movie?

147
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,868
It's a classic combination.

148
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,679
Because somebody promised her
the best date ever.

149
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,355
I went ahead and did a little recon
on your behalf. I was extremely stealth.

150
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,431
I spoke to Summer, okay?
And I asked her...

151
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,637
...what Marissa would wanna do
on a date, what she'd really enjoy.

152
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,836
- She told me she didn't know.
- How helpful.

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,913
But Summer's three favorite activities
are shopping, tanning and waxing.

154
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,230
Maybe there's something there.
Use that.

155
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,756
And here I thought
Summer was superficial.

156
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,515
I have no car, no money. Whatever
I do is just gonna disappoint her.

157
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,558
- What do you usually do on dates?
- Never actually been on one.

158
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,029
Wait, you just told me that...

159
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,797
Yeah, I've hung out with girls,
but just never really went out.

160
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,634
- Oh, got it.
- I'm gonna go to class.

161
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,109
- I'll keep working on it.
- You've done enough.

162
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,748
Bye. Come on.

163
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,878
What do you think Summer's
three favorite movies are?

164
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,589
<i>Battleship Potemkin</i>,
<i>The Seventh Seal</i> and <i>Shoah</i>.

165
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,876
- Definitely.
- What?

166
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,635
Can we not talk about Summer?
We talk about her all the time.

167
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,552
No, we don't.

168
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,110
We don't. We talk about
all sorts of things. Music, sailing.

169
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,669
Right. About how you named
your boat after her...

170
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,752
...how you made her a CD of songs
with the word "summer" in it.

171
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,514
Sorry. I was under the impression
that we were friends...

172
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,750
...who, I don't know,
talk about our thoughts.

173
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,674
We are. So I guess you're
finally hearing some of mine.

174
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,874
I'm gonna go back for dessert.

175
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,192
Hey, Dad. I'm...

176
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,839
...home.

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,594
- Hi, sweetie.
- What are you doing here?

178
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,435
Your mother was in the neighborhood
and wanted to see how we're doing.

179
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,354
- How are we doing, Mom?
- Why don't you come here and talk to us.

180
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,431
Come on over and sit down.

181
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,677
I'm throwing a party.

182
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,559
I'm hosting the children's hospital benefit
this Saturday.

183
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,632
They're trying to build
a new wing for the children.

184
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,634
I'd love it if you could both be there.
Your father's already agreed.

185
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,597
No. No way.

186
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,716
Marissa, honey...

187
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,714
...this party is a chance for us to show
the community that we still belong...

188
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,871
...that we're still a family.

189
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,033
Yes, we've suffered some setbacks,
your father's business in particular.

190
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,670
But it's important to let everybody know
the Cooper family is back.

191
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,831
Why do you care
what other people think?

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,676
Look, Marissa, no one has fewer nice
things to say about your mother than me.

193
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,831
No offense.

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,230
But she's been pouring
her heart out to me...

195
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,030
...and I think you're gonna wanna hear
what she has to say.

196
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,828
Marissa, I am so sorry for the way
I handled things at the hospital.

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,877
I was scared.

198
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,315
And I was wrong.

199
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,789
Everything I cared about
was falling apart...

200
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,157
...and I was blaming everybody
but myself.

201
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,396
I just want us to feel
like a family again.

202
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,269
I know it's gonna take some time,
and I'm gonna need your help.

203
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,038
Will you help me?

204
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,555
Wow, knocking. It's open!

205
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,754
Bad news.

206
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,391
I know you had Saturday night
all planned, but something's come up.

207
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,993
Oh, that sucks.

208
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,197
We're gonna be spending
a romantic night on a yacht...

209
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,672
...for this charity event
hosted by my mom.

210
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,434
Your mom hates me.

211
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,989
No, she doesn't hate you.
She just doesn't know you.

212
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,639
Now she'll have her chance.

213
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,712
We had a date Saturday night.
There was a whole thing happening.

214
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,429
I know. But my mom came by today
and apologized to me and my dad...

215
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,194
...and it seems like she's changed.

216
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,193
Hey, if my parents got back together,
and my dad found a job...

217
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,353
...then my life could go
back to normal again.

218
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,671
Maybe I should stay away
for a little while.

219
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,434
First-date stuff: Candy, flowers.
It's easy.

220
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,989
- Candy, flowers. Right.
- But it's times like these...

221
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,675
...when a girl
needs her boyfriend the most.

222
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,790
Boyfriend?

223
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,589
Well, I mean, aren't we...?

224
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,518
L... I guess.

225
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,831
I've just never been a boyfriend before.

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,639
- But you've had girlfriends?
- Yeah.

227
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,191
No, not girlfriends,
just girls that, you know...

228
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,753
Your mom. Saturday night.
Can't wait.

229
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,273
Great.

230
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,394
The fact is, yes, I admit it.
I occasionally talk about Summer.

231
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,792
Maybe I even talk about her too much,
but that's not really the point, is it?

232
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,748
Hi.

233
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,719
So get this.

234
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,271
Anna thinks all I ever do
is talk about Summer.

235
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,036
I mean, that's crazy, right?

236
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,430
You want me to lie?

237
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,111
I'm that guy?

238
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,556
Dude, how can I be that guy?
I hate that guy.

239
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,029
No wonder Summer doesn't have
any interest in me...

240
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,997
...because apparently all I do...

241
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,311
...is I talk about Summer.
Although you'd think she'd like that.

242
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,357
- You're doing it again.
- Right.

243
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,429
I'm sorry I had to cancel
our date last night.

244
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,433
- What time did you get home?
- Almost 2.

245
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,912
- What was the last-minute crisis?
- You know I'm not at liberty to say.

246
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,989
Is Rachel's boyfriend
as understanding as I am?

247
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,754
Rachel doesn't have a boyfriend.

248
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,831
Go figure.

249
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,079
Some people who don't like their life
make work their life.

250
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,038
Well, that's not me.

251
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,478
And I'll tell you this, if our settlement
conference goes well today...

252
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,074
...I could be home by 6.

253
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,152
Is that a bribe, counselor?

254
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,078
Hey!

255
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,196
- Did you have the talk?
- No. I like to lead by example.

256
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,274
You and Julie Cooper trapped on a boat?
Can't wait to see how that one goes.

257
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,433
I don't really have a choice,
since she's my girlfriend.

258
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,068
What? Girlfriend?

259
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,151
I thought that you didn't do girlfriends.

260
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,197
Well, you did them, but you,
you know...

261
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,909
I don't, and this is not a good way
to start. At least you'll be there.

262
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,436
I won't. Who'd I bring?
I can't take Summer.

263
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,070
Or I could...
Do you think she'd go? I don't know.

264
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,390
I'm doing it again! Yeah!

265
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,279
You know who you could ask?

266
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,395
I could take a friend. Interesting.

267
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,873
Okay, I'm never gonna mention
Summer's name to you again.

268
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,989
Except for that. From now on, we'll only
discuss things we both have in common.

269
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,720
Like how do you feel
about Newport charity events?

270
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,279
- I hate them.
- Me too.

271
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,510
So, what do you say you come
with me to one...

272
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,557
...and we'll just quietly mock people?

273
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,274
- Is Summer gonna be there?
- I don't know. Who cares?

274
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,589
If anything happens between me
and Summer, you won't hear about it.

275
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,990
I promise. On our friendship.

276
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,751
Okay.

277
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,390
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services'
ecological risk assessment asserts...

278
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,235
...that the land adjacent to the wetlands
should be considered wetlands as well.

279
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,470
Well, why stop there, counselor?

280
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,871
Why not include the land adjacent
to the land adjacent to the wetlands?

281
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,679
Mr. Nichol, I'm sure
your attorney has explained...

282
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,991
...that soon the state will acquire
the land by eminent domain.

283
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,993
It took the state five years
to purchase the Balboa Wetlands.

284
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,912
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

285
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,517
How much is the Land Trust
offering me for Balboa Heights?

286
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,231
Mr. Cohen.

287
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,518
I was beginning to wonder
about your involvement in all of this.

288
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,835
Thank you all for coming.
This meeting is adjourned.

289
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,356
- Where are you going?
- Well, I mean, that's it?

290
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,318
That's your whole dog-and-pony show?

291
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,278
I'm disappointed.
What have you two been doing?

292
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,190
Kiki tells me that you've been
in the office alone together every night...

293
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,191
...till 2 in the morning.

294
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,473
- Feel free to counter, Mr. Nichol.
- Why is she doing all the talking?

295
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,315
Are you just here to ensure that your firm
makes the early edition again?

296
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,951
"Father and son-in-law
fight for the Heights."

297
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,556
Cal, I've dealt with a lot
of shady characters in my work...

298
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,678
...but I've never seen anyone
stoop as low as you.

299
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,957
You'll poison anything, air, water,
even your daughter's marriage...

300
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,795
...as long as you profit.
- You've been living off my profits.

301
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,997
If you think I'm bought and paid for...

302
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,868
...just wait till I get you on the stand.
Don't let my silence here mislead you.

303
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,713
I'm taking you down.

304
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,359
Counselor.

305
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,079
I think I hit a nerve.

306
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,515
- I forgot I had this dress.
- Happens to me all the time.

307
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,831
My mom bought it for me.
It seems appropriate.

308
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,709
I think your mom would understand
if you didn't want to do this.

309
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,996
Except I do.

310
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,469
Right. That's what I meant.

311
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,355
Marissa, this event is important
and on a yacht...

312
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,910
...and whenever I go to these things,
somebody gets into a fight.

313
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,116
You're gonna be fine.

314
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,391
Ryan, hi.

315
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,836
Oh, it's so nice to see you
in your room again.

316
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,629
- You can sleep here tonight, if you want.
- It's okay.

317
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,028
But thanks.

318
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,509
Just thought I'd ask.

319
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,591
Oh, I love this dress.

320
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,479
Remember when we bought it,
we had lunch in Beverly Hills?

321
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,837
- We saw Catherine Zeta-Jones.
- Yeah, I remember.

322
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,558
So much fun.

323
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,869
Well, we should get to the ship and
help out. Will you check on Kaitlin?

324
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,871
Okay, sure.

325
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,910
So I know that you and I
haven't always seen eye to eye...

326
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,639
...but I want to say that I'm sorry.

327
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,997
You've been there for Marissa.
You care about her, I see that now.

328
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,438
And I'm hoping that this party
will be a chance for us to start fresh.

329
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,830
A celebration of a new beginning.

330
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,276
I don't really like boats.

331
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,797
Please?

332
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,073
Okay.

333
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,278
Thank you.

334
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,838
Hey.

335
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,594
Well, let's get to the boat, huh?

336
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,552
Come on.

337
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,835
I can't believe the lit mag won't publish
my limericks. That's censorship.

338
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,274
It's censorship!

339
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,752
- I'll organize a protest immediately.
- Fine, something involving a bra-burning.

340
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,148
Cohen!

341
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,754
- Hey. What are you still doing here?
- Detention.

342
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,433
You live a hard life, Summer.

343
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,229
A Paul Frank sale is more important
than the fall of the Ming Dynasty.

344
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,914
What am I supposed to learn?
That opium is gnarly?

345
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,436
Right.
Because there is no lesson there.

346
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,155
Are you making fun of me? I can't tell.

347
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,790
Most of the time, Summer,
you do my job for me.

348
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,838
Again, not tracking.

349
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,992
So, Cohen, I was wondering if you could
catch me up in history tomorrow.

350
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,550
I can't until Sunday.
I have a charity thing tomorrow.

351
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,109
- The thing for the children's hospital?
- Yeah.

352
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,238
- You're going to that?
- We both are.

353
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,709
- You and her?
- Me and Anna.

354
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,995
Which is my name, by the way.

355
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,039
I'm going too.

356
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,555
Hey. Well, then I'll see you there.

357
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,679
In fact, I'm going with him. Chip!

358
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,235
- Hey.
- All right.

359
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,156
She's going with him?

360
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,599
I don't care.

361
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,309
- There's pot roast in the...
- I ate.

362
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,710
- With Rachel?
- What was that today?

363
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,714
- I'm sorry. He just...
- lf you have a problem, come to me.

364
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,351
You're never here. Who am I gonna
talk to if I don't talk to my dad? Seth?

365
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,149
We're adults with demanding jobs.
You don't go running off to your daddy.

366
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,392
If that's too hard, go give Jimmy a call.

367
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,028
So nice talking to you.

368
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,628
Don't ever get married.

369
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,032
So how's everything going
with your relationship?

370
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,156
Which I need to talk to you about.

371
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,276
Good, I guess. Good.

372
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,908
- It's just hard.
- Really?

373
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,072
Seventeen years later,
it doesn't get any easier.

374
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,831
It's her mom, really.

375
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,116
In-laws.

376
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,590
If you figure it out, let me know.

377
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,277
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

378
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,388
Thanks.

379
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,797
Good evening.

380
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,468
I'll call you.

381
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,956
- Hey.
- Hi.

382
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,551
Just got to get my good pair of shoes.

383
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,838
I know this isn't exactly
the date you had planned...

384
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,309
...but I really appreciate it.

385
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,358
You couldn't have done better
with my mom yesterday.

386
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,114
She's like a different person.

387
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,438
Who knows? Maybe if everything
goes well tonight, then...

388
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,634
I'm really happy.

389
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,837
Which never used to be
an accomplishment.

390
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,674
- And not just about my parents.
- We're gonna be late.

391
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,391
- Yo.
- What up, homes?

392
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,152
- Chilling.
- All right.

393
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,108
- What's that smell?
- Perfume.

394
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,919
It smells like wood chips.

395
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,799
In a rose garden, roses.

396
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,918
So this is your crib.

397
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,597
This is where all the magic happens?

398
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,991
If by "magic" you're referring to
the card game, then sadly, yes.

399
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,594
You have a hot tub. Ever use it?

400
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,991
Hot tub's for the ho's.
I usually hang in the grotto.

401
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,677
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

402
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,877
- I'm just gonna run to the girls' room.
- I gotta go too.

403
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,112
Right. Because girls can't be alone.

404
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,189
What? It's Anna. I could've said "pop
a squat" in front of her if I wanted to.

405
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,157
Sometimes you talk just to make sounds.

406
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,072
Sometimes I do.

407
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,832
So Anna looks good.

408
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,959
Tonight should be fun.
There's gonna be a raffle.

409
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,918
The only thing more fun
than a raffle is anything, really.

410
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,548
- You guys ready?
- The girls are peeing.

411
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,030
- Seth, don't say "pee."
- Where's Sandy?

412
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,553
Don't ask.

413
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,150
- Question.
- Hey. Early-bird special.

414
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,676
I'm gonna soldier on. Trying to get
out of here at a decent hour.

415
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,868
Right. Not all of us have
cocktail parties to go to on yachts.

416
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,718
Right.

417
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,273
So Caleb won't sell.
No surprise there. On to plan B.

418
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,079
- What's plan B?
- I'm working on it.

419
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,915
Come to the floor, Sandy. Everything
makes more sense on the floor.

420
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,877
We've got pad thai on the floor.

421
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,510
- We got work to do.
- Which is why we must refuel.

422
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,636
You got any dumplings?

423
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,356
I'm powerless before dumplings.

424
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,590
Go with gravity, man.

425
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,753
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you. Nice to see you.

426
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,638
- Hi, you're here!
- Hey, Mom.

427
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,308
- How are you doing?
- Good.

428
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,277
- Hi.
- Hi, Kaitlin.

429
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,668
Hi, Ryan.

430
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,795
Kaitlin doesn't trust new people,
but Ryan is very trustworthy.

431
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,110
Marissa, Reverend Donahue
wants to say hello.

432
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,554
Okay, Daddy.

433
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,634
- Can I get a photo of the Cooper family?
- Totally, yes.

434
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,473
- Come on, let's do it. Jules?
- Yes, of course.

435
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,154
<i>Riviera Magazine</i>. It's very exciting.

436
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,515
Ryan, why don't you join us?

437
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,797
No. It's for your family.

438
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,757
Say "cheese!"

439
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,878
I didn't say "cheese."

440
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,600
- Hey, Kiki.
- Hey, Dad.

441
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,030
Where's the Sandman?

442
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,432
- Those earrings are hypnotizing me.
- They're making me seasick.

443
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,632
There he is, built like a pipe cleaner
but looking sharp.

444
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,711
Same to you.
I don't know what that means.

445
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,474
- Who's this little firecracker?
- It's my date.

446
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,393
My friend Anna.

447
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,313
- Clearly, she needs no introduction.
- Nice to meet you.

448
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,268
Seth said you were scary,
but I see an inner sweetness.

449
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,830
- I like your moxie.
- Suddenly we're in a film noir.

450
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,955
The ocean is, like, so vast.
Like, endless.

451
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,510
- I feel so...
- Insignificant?

452
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,908
Go figure.

453
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,389
You know, I'm thirsty.

454
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,394
- Do you want to go to the bar?
- Yeah, you can. Thanks.

455
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,515
You must have met Seth before.

456
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,237
Excuse me.

457
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,638
Hi, Ryan.

458
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,399
- Good party.
- Thank you.

459
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,675
And thanks for not telling Marissa.

460
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,719
She's excited about you maybe
getting back together with her dad.

461
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,469
You may be okay
with lying to Marissa, but not me.

462
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,471
This is my life. My daughter.

463
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,710
My girlfriend.

464
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,113
Ryan, stay out of this.
It's none of your business.

465
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,949
Hey, how goes it with Chip?

466
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,954
He's surprised that the ocean is big.
Smoke another beer, Chip.

467
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,031
Wow, someone's in a good mood.

468
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,237
What is Seth Cohen doing
with Tinker Bell? She's from Pittsburgh.

469
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,038
That's like the 909 of the East.

470
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,555
- Anna's cool.
- She's a little scammer.

471
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,518
First thing she does
is go after Caleb Nichol's grandson!

472
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,477
Have you seen the way
she looks at him?

473
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,077
- No, but clearly you have.
- Only because it's, like, totally obvious.

474
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,549
Yes, it is, that you're jealous.

475
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,915
- You like Seth Cohen.
- No!

476
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,629
- You like him. Like him. Love him.
- Stop it!

477
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,394
Stop! I do not like Seth Cohen.

478
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,597
I can't like Seth Cohen.
He's, like, Seth Cohen.

479
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,230
Well, it's too bad, because he likes you.

480
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,073
Hey.

481
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,318
My parents are totally getting along.

482
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,597
If my dad finds a job soon,
I can be your neighbor again.

483
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,036
- I could sneak over whenever.
- Parents are weird.

484
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,430
I wouldn't count on anything.

485
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,433
Right. You wouldn't.

486
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,831
What's that mean?

487
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,434
If you don't understand
how important this is...

488
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,352
I get it.

489
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,476
I get it, okay?

490
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,710
Too well. My mom, my dad...

491
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,270
Just because that happened to you,
doesn't mean it'll happen to me.

492
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,432
- My parents may get back together.
- No.

493
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,036
They won't.

494
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,192
Why can't you just be happy for me?

495
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,835
- Your mom is seeing Caleb Nichol.
- What? What are you talking about?

496
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,436
I saw them together
in front of your house.

497
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,559
I'm sorry.

498
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,517
At this point, we go to the state
for Proposition 50 funds...

499
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,672
...and hope they've got
a spare $200 million in the budget.

500
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,991
Wait. I have the budget
here somewhere.

501
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,231
It's with the Fish and Wildlife stuff.

502
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,790
No, you put it
with the Land Trust documents.

503
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,031
Feels like Twister.

504
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,557
When I was in college,
that game got me in a lot of trouble.

505
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,631
I can imagine.

506
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,794
However, you and I
are in enough trouble as it is.

507
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,313
Yeah.

508
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,110
Was it me, or did your father-in-law
basically accuse us of having an affair?

509
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,634
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

510
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,189
Where'd he get that idea, right?

511
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,435
I mean, we work together,
and we eat all our meals together.

512
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,991
We talk on the phone
when we can't actually be together.

513
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,677
I got a boat to catch.

514
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,756
Oh, goodness.
Look at that piece right there.

515
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,718
Get a northeasterly breeze,
that toupee's gonna go overboard.

516
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,077
Good thing his wife has surgically
enhanced flotation devices.

517
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,028
- Then she can jump in after it.
- Yeah, and they're also fun to look at.

518
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,794
Do me a favor and go tell
that kid puberty started.

519
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,872
I don't think the pencil-thin mustache
is gonna make a comeback.

520
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,951
Hey, dude, embrace the razor.

521
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,395
Sounds like you're speaking
from experience.

522
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,109
Maybe when I was 13,
my nickname used to be Magnum, P.I.

523
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,590
- Really?
- Yeah. Mothers can be so cruel.

524
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,274
God, there are not people
like this in Pittsburgh.

525
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,911
- You must hate Newport.
- I did. At first.

526
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,470
But now it's growing on me.

527
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,710
Are you thirsty at all?
I'm feeling a little parched.

528
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,077
I think I'm gonna get a couple
of Mountain Dews to take the edge off.

529
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,312
- Sure.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

530
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,231
Wow. Check it out.

531
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,597
It's, like, totally dark but totally visual.

532
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,832
Yeah. Not understanding a word
you're saying.

533
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,560
Finish 'shrooming.
I'm gonna go get a drink.

534
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,838
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt.
Just a moment of your time.

535
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,591
I'm Julie Cooper, the coordinator
of this event. Thank you all for coming.

536
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,992
Through your generous contributions,
we've raised almost $200,000...

537
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,469
...for the children's hospital.

538
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,510
And don't forget, it's tax-deductible.

539
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,118
- Can we talk?
- Yeah. Okay.

540
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,274
I have to say that
we could not have done any of this...

541
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,670
...without Caleb Nichol.
- Let's get out of here.

542
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,910
I should leave and let her
get away with this?

543
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,036
Let's give him a big hand.

544
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,191
Is that what you would do?

545
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,712
Hi.

546
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,076
Oh, God! No.

547
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,198
What's happening here?

548
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,550
I like Seth Cohen.

549
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,199
You...? You what now?

550
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,112
Nothing. I wasn't talking to you.

551
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,590
But if you tell anyone
what you heard here, I'll kill you.

552
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,156
There's my beautiful daughter,
Marissa. Please join us.

553
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,350
Come join us, honey.

554
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,152
Thank you. Now my daughter
Kaitlin will pick the winner...

555
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,550
...of the romantic getaway raffle.

556
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,632
Marissa, would you like to
announce the lucky couple?

557
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,313
Thanks.

558
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,870
And how about another round
of applause for my mom?

559
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,876
And for Caleb Nichol.

560
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,478
After all their work
on behalf of the children's hospital...

561
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,871
...if anybody deserves
a romantic getaway for two...

562
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,679
...it's my mom and Caleb Nichol.

563
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,079
I mean, aren't they
just the perfect couple?

564
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,073
They've been keeping
their romance a secret...

565
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,279
...but tonight, the secret's out.

566
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,115
Congratulations, you guys.

567
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,916
Honey, take this.

568
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,868
- Don't start with me.
- After tonight, I'm done with you.

569
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,032
- You're Caleb's problem now.
- Jimmy...

570
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,432
One more, please.

571
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,795
Excuse me.

572
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,633
And the winner of tonight's raffle is...

573
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,951
...Sandy and Kirsten Cohen.

574
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,599
- What the hell was that?
- You lied to me.

575
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,196
- You said you wanted us to be a family.
- I do.

576
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,636
I was going to tell you,
but this is all so new.

577
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,598
I know you've been through so much.
Marissa, honey...

578
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,117
...this whole party was to show you
that our life could be like it was.

579
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,669
You could move back home.
We could be a family again.

580
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,513
And what about dad?

581
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,356
Honey, I will always love your father.

582
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,358
But because of what he's done,
we have no future together.

583
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,397
Neither do we.

584
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,075
Wait. Okay. What?

585
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,754
Julie Cooper and my grandfather?

586
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,838
If that worked out,
then Marissa would be my aunt.

587
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,389
I can't believe
you missed all the excitement.

588
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,676
Where have you been?

589
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,833
I find raffles to be extremely upsetting.
There's too much suspense.

590
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,918
I don't go.

591
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,716
I trusted you. I told you things
about my life and my marriage.

592
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,235
And you used them against me.

593
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,233
And you tell me nothing about you.

594
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,759
If this is the way you're gonna react...

595
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,717
...do you blame me?

596
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,748
No.

597
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,718
In fact,
outside the office from now on...

598
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,917
...we have nothing to say to each other.

599
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,152
Oh, and good luck
with your new girlfriend.

600
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,117
You're gonna need it.

601
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,475
- I'm here.
- We're leaving.

602
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,232
But I wore a jacket.

603
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,113
I think this party's over.

604
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,388
Want me to take you back to your dad's?

605
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,392
I think I'm ready for our first date.

606
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,676
I think we're way past that now.

607
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,029
So in theory, Julie Cooper
could become your stepmother?

608
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,952
Don't even say it.

609
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,918
- I'm late to one event, I miss everything.
- Not everything.

610
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,595
We won the raffle.
A romantic getaway for two.

611
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,594
- Lf you can get away from the office.
- Yeah. It'll be good for us.

612
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,435
- Spend a little time alone.
- Glad to hear it.

613
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,511
So, what are you doing now?

614
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,993
You.

615
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,431
Glad to hear it.

616
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,309
This is a pretty good date.

617
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,916
- I just wish it didn't have to end.
- It doesn't.

618
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,957
Spend the night.

619
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,235
We don't have to do anything.
We could sleep.

620
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,033
Really? Sandy and Kirsten
are cool with that?

621
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,272
Well, I haven't had the talk yet, so...

622
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,552
Do you snore?

623
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,039
No.

624
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,191
Well, I don't think so.

625
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,318
I've never actually
slept with someone before.

626
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,553
Me neither. I'm usually climbing out
the window or back into the front seat.

627
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,996
- Okay, enough sharing.
- Yeah.

628
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,752
Good night.

629
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,188
I thought you said you wanted to sleep.

630
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,874
Suddenly not so tired.

631
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,748
Best...

632
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,157
...date...

633
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,117
...ever.
