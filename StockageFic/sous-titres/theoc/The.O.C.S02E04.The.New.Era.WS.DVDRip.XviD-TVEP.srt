1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,389
Previously on The O. C:
-You' re not the ideal client.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,913
-Rich. Powerful.
-Guilty.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,275
Guess who no longer works
for Partridge, Savage, and Kahn.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,919
-You quit?
-Or got fired.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,593
-Ryan Atwood.
-Lindsay Gardner.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,318
I owe you an apology.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,152
-I'm sorry.
-Me too.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,512
We agreed we wouldn't tell anyone.
Because you could get fired.

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,511
You know what? I quit.

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,433
As of tomorrow morning,
Julie will be the new CEO...

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,715
...of the Newport Group.

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,556
-Maybe I can't be just friends with you.
-Maybe this is it for us.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,394
-So you won't help me?
-I got a physics quiz. I'm busy.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,675
-Ryan. Please, man.
-What?

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,751
This is a crisis. Zach and Summer.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
They're full-on dating now.
I need a girlfriend. Pronto.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,552
-You'd start dating to show up Summer.
-There's other reasons.

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,199
I can't think of them right now.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,397
Hold on a second.
Let's break bread. Let's discuss broads.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,471
My graphing calculator is in your room.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,598
-You know what else is in my room?
-What? What is in your room?

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,196
My yearbook. Full of new ideas for
fresh-faced loved ones. We can make...

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,635
-...a list of 20 finalists by homeroom.
-Bad idea.

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,394
-Keep my leftovers.
-I'm not dating. That's my plan.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,358
Yes, you absolutely are.
I'm not entering this new era alone.

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,717
It is a new era. Getting the ax
was the best thing that could happen.

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,553
Now the only person I answer to is me.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,999
And my father. All I'm saying
is that he's your only client, isn't he?

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,151
Yeah. And you work for his wife.

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,470
What was your father thinking?

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,234
You can ask him.
You'll be hanging with him all day.

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,198
If I can win this case,
get my practice off the ground....

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,433
You can spend your entire career
defending my father's rich clients.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,071
You're not bringing me down, honey.
No. You heard Seth. It's a new era.

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,913
Sure is. And guess what.
I think I found a new girlfriend.

36
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,230
-ln the kitchen?
-ln the new era, Seth finds...

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,710
-...girlfriends in the yearbook.
-Tina Wu. Part of the a cappella group.

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,598
Co-president of the improv team...

39
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,514
...Shenanigans. She's musical. She's
witty. Hopefully she's free for lunch.

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,113
-Dude. "Shenanigans"?
-I know.

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,034
You sure you're ready to start dating?
After all you went through with Summer?

42
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,269
Better he should mope?

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,513
Don't listen. If it was up to her, I'd still
be at Partridge, Savage, and Kahn...

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,514
-...bitching about high-priced lawsuits.
-Totally. Should I go for the Wu...

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,069
...or keep talking about Summer?

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,270
-Here's to the new era.
-Amen.

47
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,919
All right, so the Tina Wu thing
didn't happen. Just move on.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,277
You know, a simple no from the Wu
would have been sufficient.

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,159
I think the added laughter
was just unnecessary.

50
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,548
-Hey.
-Hey, Seth.

51
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,551
-What about her?
-Tiffany Rosenberg?

52
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,392
No, we have a history.

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,236
Third grade.
Class field trip to SeaWorld.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,675
I tried to sort of talk to the dolphins.

55
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,638
She overheard. There was taunting.
It was really bad.

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,756
The bus ride home was the low point.

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,309
I'll point out a girl.
You tell me if you'd date her.

58
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,313
-I'll tell you whether she would date me.
-Yeah, exactly.

59
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,233
Them. Right there.

60
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,558
-Yeah. And no.
-No?

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,118
-No. Yeah.
-Yeah?

62
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,555
Are you shopping for girlfriends
in the quad?

63
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,278
-Yeah.
-No.

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,194
Classy and not remotely demeaning.

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,388
Lindsay, Seth. Seth, Lindsay.

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,516
-Hey.
-So how does this work?

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,116
Is there a ranking system, or is each girl
judged on her individual merits?

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,510
And by merits,
I mean her rack and/or ass.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,434
-It's a simple yes/no survey.
-Yes/no survey.

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,068
I see. Well, in that case:

71
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,468
No.

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,873
And no.

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,157
I'll see you in class.

74
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,109
-I can't believe I finally met her.
-Lindsay?

75
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,191
Lindsay Cohen.
It's got a nice ring to it.

76
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,998
-Will you hook that up for me?
-No.

77
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,037
Why not? Unless, hey, do you like her?

78
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,555
No, no, no. No, just...

79
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,757
-...she's argumentative, bossy, difficult.
-Yeah, that's my type.

80
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,798
-Believe me, hold out for something else.
-No. I need that one.

81
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,030
I need you make that happen for me.
Can you?

82
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,158
-Can you hook me up? Hook me up.
-I can hook it up.

83
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,231
That's what I like to hear. Thank you.

84
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,119
This is a new era, Summer.

85
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,113
For the first time in my life
I have, like, no boy drama.

86
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,352
That is not possible.
You are a magnet for boy drama.

87
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,512
I'm serious. Ryan and l? Just friends.

88
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,193
And DJ?

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,911
What, with the deltoids
and the trapezoids?

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,435
He wants nothing to do with me.

91
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,036
-Well, did you apologize?
-I have no idea where he is.

92
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,113
After he quit working for my parents,
he went totally MlA.

93
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,272
He can't be that hard to find.
Doesn't he work for the Hendersons?

94
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,750
-See? T otally addicted to boy drama.
-Like you don't have issues.

95
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,036
Actually, my love life is trauma-free.

96
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,758
Lunch went well with Zach
and your dad?

97
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,480
Amazing.
None of that manic Cohen chatter.

98
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,870
Or that incomprehensible
Cohen mumbling.

99
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,591
If Cohen is the virus, Zach is the cure.
He is the anti-Cohen.

100
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,393
-Speak of the devil.
-Cohen?

101
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,159
-Zach.
-Right. Great. Better.

102
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,992
-Hey.
-Hi.

103
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,868
-That's a firm hug.
-Sorry, Duckie.

104
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,439
Duckie?

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,312
We have nicknames.

106
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,036
-We do?
-Yes.

107
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,874
Duckie? That's.... That's cute.

108
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,350
So, Duckie, Marissa is bumming out
because she doesn't have anyone...

109
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,398
-...in her life as perfect as you.
-Thanks, Sum.

110
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,152
I know lots of eligible bachelors.

111
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,437
-You want me to set you up?
-No. That's okay. Really. I'm fine.

112
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,790
You know, this is the start of a new era
for us, Sandman.

113
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,316
Working together on the same side
of the law. Overcoming our differences.

114
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,515
Battling the odds.

115
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,558
Bringing a tear to my eye.
Now let's talk about what we know...

116
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,631
-...at this point in the game.
-You hungry?

117
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,711
They do a delicious frittata here.

118
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,472
-You a frittata man?
-I'm fine.

119
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,473
Now, you've been funneling money
every month to a trust.

120
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,269
The person who runs this trust is an
associate of the city councilman's office.

121
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,034
The same city councilman
that issues building permits...

122
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,714
...to people who build lots of buildings.

123
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,709
-People like you.
-I do build lots of buildings.

124
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,236
I've done well for myself.
Started off with nothing.

125
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,631
And still I strive for more.
Never satisfied.

126
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,355
-What do they call that?
-Greed.

127
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,075
Now, as you can see, on the face of it...

128
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,674
...this looks like bribery.

129
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,956
What about a round of drinks?
What do you say?

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,553
-Manhattans?
-It's 1 0 a.m.

131
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,319
Now, focus.

132
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,871
-Why did you set up the trust?
-Charity, tax benefits.

133
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,600
What about the woman
who runs the trust? Renee Wheeler.

134
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,191
I don't know her.
You're very grumpy today.

135
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,513
I think it's because you're hungry.
Frittata coming right up.

136
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,150
The DA wants you to spend your
twilight years in a 5-by-9 cell.

137
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,312
-All you can think about are frittatas.
-No one is going to jail.

138
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,869
This thing won't even make it to court.

139
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,838
-Phyllis.
-Phyllis?

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,197
Yeah, my old secretary.
She retired three years ago.

141
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,830
-She set up the trust.
-You couldn't tell me this on the phone?

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,470
Then I wouldn't get to see you.
Let's get you that frittata. Excuse me.

143
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,550
-You're lurking.
-Right. Sorry.

144
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,512
Look, for all I know, you have
a boyfriend, so there's no point...

145
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,910
-...in me even asking you this--
-I don't.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,797
-I don't have a boyfriend.
-You don't?

147
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,032
-Yeah. Don't rub it in.
-Right.

148
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,839
Well, I was wondering if you...

149
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,312
...would maybe wanna....

150
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,994
Maybe, and feel free to say no.

151
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,878
Go out on a date.

152
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,951
Okay. Sure.

153
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,678
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

154
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,630
Great. So you'll go out with Seth?

155
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,631
-What?
-You'll go on a date with Seth?

156
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,710
Yes. Seth.
You want me to go out with Seth.

157
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,553
And I said yes, so....

158
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,713
-Yes.
-Great. Great.

159
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,192
-Great. You sure?
-I am positive. Tomorrow night.

160
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,675
-The sooner the better, right?
-Right.

161
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,832
Thanks.

162
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,794
Look who has a new ficus.

163
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,076
I have a ton of work to do.
If you could--

164
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,119
I figure now that I'm in charge, I can
introduce more life into this place.

165
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,077
Yeah, a ficus here, an orchid there.

166
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,630
-Next thing you know we are--
-A rain forest. Thanks for the plant.

167
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,349
But right now this company
is one failed deal away from total ruin.

168
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,829
Which means I have to ficus-- Focus.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,798
Ficus, focus.
Honey, you are all over the place.

170
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,475
But no need to worry. The boss is here.
Let me lighten your load.

171
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,278
What are you reading?

172
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,476
Budget projections for next year.
It's very dense.

173
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,633
-Which you think I am. Dense.
-No. Julie....

174
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,995
No. Look.

175
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,112
The key to good leadership is
delegation, so why not delegate...

176
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,192
-...this stuff to me so you're free to--
-Continue being stupid?

177
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,398
Julie. All I'm saying
is that we have an extremely...

178
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,835
-...important presentation tomorrow.
-Y es.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,993
Clearly, I have a lot of reading up to do
so I can be ready for the presentation.

180
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,357
You know, running this company
is about more than just plant life.

181
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,476
Even you should know that.

182
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,875
Hey.

183
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,313
I saw your truck,
and I thought I'd stop by and say hi.

184
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,871
-How are you?
-Busy.

185
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,719
Right.

186
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,433
You can't be busy all weekend.

187
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,875
The Killers are playing tomorrow.
They're good.

188
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,473
So, what, are we friends now?

189
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,832
Judging by this conversation,
probably not.

190
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,150
But I'd really like to try...

191
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,829
...and be something.

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,719
-How's your boyfriend feel about that?
-He's not my boyfriend.

193
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,792
I guess that explains
what you're doing here talking to me.

194
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,833
When you and l....

195
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,352
I didn't know Ryan was coming back.

196
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,956
-Glad I could help kill time till he did.
-You know that's not what it was.

197
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,950
Bait Shop. Tomorrow night.

198
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,315
I'll be there if you decide to stop by.

199
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,030
-Hi.
-Hey.

200
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,794
I think all this manual labor
is affecting my vibe.

201
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,791
Do I seem tougher to you?

202
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,190
You don't want me to answer that.

203
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,999
Hey, so guess what.
You have a date tomorrow.

204
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,236
-I do? With who?
-Lindsay. The future Mrs. Seth Cohen.

205
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,630
No. Man, I said
I wanted to marry her...

206
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,031
...not date her. I didn't think she'd
say yes. This changes everything.

207
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,919
-Well, I'm not getting you out of it.
-Well, I'm not going.

208
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,753
-Unless you go with me. I will do that.
-You want me to go with you on a date?

209
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,876
-As your chaperon?
-We'll double. I'll set you up.

210
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,951
-With all the single women you know?
-Seth.

211
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,917
Clogged toilet in the men's room.

212
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,069
-Sweet.
-Hey.

213
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,593
Hi.

214
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,949
-No.
-Yes.

215
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,109
-No.
-Yes.

216
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,475
-She wouldn't go out with me.
-You kidding?

217
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,599
Her tattoo, your wristband. That's a
wrong-side-of-the-tracks love story.

218
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,479
You are the Sid to her Nancy,
the Kurt to her Courtney.

219
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,155
-50 Cent to her Mrs. Cent.
-No. I'm done dating. I told you that.

220
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,471
Kids don't date anymore. They hang out
in groups and peel off to hook up.

221
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,153
-You've never done that.
-I know.

222
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,436
But I read about it
in New York Times Magazine.

223
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,989
My guess is that Alex loves
the group hang.

224
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,193
"Group hang "?
That's the lamest thing I've ever heard.

225
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,397
-But later we peel off--
-And do what? Go to Chuck E. Cheese?

226
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,358
Mini golf?
I swear, mentally, you are 7 years old.

227
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,830
-That was last year. Now I'm 8 3/4.
-It's my night off. Why would I want...

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,070
-...to spend it here with you?
-I'll tell you.

229
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,118
Look at me. I'm a youth in need.

230
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,158
Okay? Somebody stomped
on my sand castle.

231
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,629
And my ball rolled out
in the middle of the street.

232
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,756
-My kite is caught in a tree--
-I get it.

233
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,514
And you know what else?
My friend Ryan, he's really cool.

234
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,558
He's anti-establishment.
He enjoys sunset walks on the beach...

235
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,712
-...punching people, and not smiling.
-And that's how you see me?

236
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,639
Yeah, only with less smiling.

237
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,314
-You're out of your mind.
-Maybe I am, Alex.

238
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,549
Maybe...

239
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,918
...I'm so far out of my mind that I'm in
yours. I know what you're thinking.

240
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,834
You're thinking, "l can't wait to go."
That's what you think. Maybe? Is it?

241
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,560
-ls that what you're thinking?
-I'll go just to get--

242
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,759
Stop freaking out. It's okay. I will hook
you up. It's fine. Look, you're smiling.

243
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,150
-I like it. It'll be really fun.
-Get out.

244
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,114
Tomorrow night at 8.

245
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,838
It's gonna be awesome.

246
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,797
So while I can appreciate your
apprehension, let me assure you...

247
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,793
...that the dip in company
earnings is only a temporary one.

248
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,748
Good morning. So sorry I'm late.
I'm glad you didn't wait for me.

249
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,151
Julie Cooper-Nichol,
CEO of the Newport Group. Hello.

250
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,959
Julie, I was just going over
our investment pitch...

251
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,874
...for Mr. Herbert's new mall
development. Feel free to jump in...

252
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,999
-...if you think I've missed anything.
-Don't be so modest. I'll jump in now.

253
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,238
-Are there any questions I can answer?
-This isn't the q & a--

254
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,914
Well, I do have a couple questions,
Mrs. Cooper-Nichol.

255
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,119
Our primary concern is...

256
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,034
...how will Caleb Nichol's potential
indictment affect our development?

257
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,192
It won't. Because we won't let it,
will we, Mr. Herbert?

258
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,671
What I think Julie meant, Mr. Herbert...

259
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,752
...is that the success of the Newport
Group is not contingent...

260
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,036
...on the ideas and opinions
of any one person.

261
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,510
I think Mr. Herbert and I can take it
from here. Will you get me...

262
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,592
...a copy of this document?
I need it on my desk tout de suite.

263
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,034
Julie...

264
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,992
...that's the lunch menu.

265
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,390
Go. Shoo.

266
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,711
Thank you all for your time.
Excuse me.

267
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,348
What's your next question?

268
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,877
How do you explain the company's
failure to hedge its portfolio...

269
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,918
...against the rise
of long-term interest rates?

270
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,113
Yes.

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,592
So Alex said yes to the date, huh?

272
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,150
It's not a date. It's a group hang
with an eye towards peeling off with--

273
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,309
Summer.

274
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,597
-I don't know if I'd be cool with that yet.
-On your left.

275
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,116
-Don't mention the date.
-Right, no, sure. Take the high road.

276
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,476
-Cohen. Hey, Ryan.
-Summer.

277
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,674
I have a date.

278
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,196
Wow. I hope you
and Captain Oats have fun.

279
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,758
-Actually, it's with a girl.
-Hey, guys.

280
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,480
-Hey.
-Coop, you just missed a milestone here.

281
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,394
Cohen has a date
with a real live human girl.

282
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,836
Well, that's great.

283
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,753
-I guess. When?
-Tonight. So you know, don't wait up.

284
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,554
Don't worry. Zach and I will sleep
just fine, thanks.

285
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,317
Good. Because I'll sleep just fine
tonight too, with....

286
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,231
I'd have loved to remember
her name there.

287
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,075
-High road, huh?
-Not my proudest moment.

288
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,034
So if Seth is abandoning you
for his big date tonight...

289
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,510
...then what are you gonna do? Because
if you wanted to do something....

290
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,148
Yeah, well, l....

291
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,393
You have a date tonight too.

292
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,077
No, it's not a date.
It's more of a group hang.

293
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,358
-How are things with you and DJ?
-They're not.

294
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,873
But I should probably get to-- But have
fun tonight on your date. Or "hang. "

295
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,472
-Hey.
-Hey. What are you doing here?

296
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,757
Guess who brought you a lobster roll
from the Crab Shack.

297
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,388
My hero.

298
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,590
My favorite sandwich,
a surprise pop-in....

299
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,395
Yes. It's work.

300
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,996
Don't tell me. You screwed up.
Power went straight to your head.

301
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,352
-You rocked the boat too hard.
-You can stop.

302
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,871
I have found it challenging.

303
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,032
Truth is, being CEO is a bitch.

304
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,836
-You'd think you'd be a natural.
-I tried to Google myself today...

305
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,390
...and crashed the entire computer
network. Our most important investor...

306
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,120
...ran out on his meeting with me,
and I don't blame him.

307
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,353
Wow. I've never heard you admit
to having faults before. This is fun.

308
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,591
I was hoping for a confidence boost.

309
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,150
-I suppose I don't have that coming.
-Sure you do. Listen.

310
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,154
You may not have Kirsten's experience,
or, let's face it, any experience.

311
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,880
-Get to the boost.
-But you are savvy.

312
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,432
That goes a long way in this business.
If I had your instincts...

313
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,831
-...I never would have lost a dime.
-So you think this is fixable?

314
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,629
If there's one thing that you're good at,
it's getting money from rich old men.

315
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,873
You've just got to do it
the Julie Cooper way.

316
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,595
You know I don't mean
sleep with them, right?

317
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,318
You know what?

318
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,668
I think you've just given me
the confidence to execute plan B.

319
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,277
And you have given me
a delightful snack.

320
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,989
I love this new era. We should have
gotten divorced years ago.

321
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,909
Thank you, Jimmy.

322
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,151
Hey, there she is.

323
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,434
Awesome. Hey, why don't you
go talk to her for an hour or five...

324
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,750
-...and just tee me up.
-She's your date.

325
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,559
Details. I'm gonna go find Alex.

326
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,709
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

327
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,518
Chaperoning?

328
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,233
I have a date too.

329
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,915
So we're, what, doubling?

330
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,878
Is this one of those group hangs
I've read about?

331
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,076
I'm not sure what this is.

332
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,588
Look, right there.
That's a good-looking human being.

333
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,910
-He is cute.
-I told you.

334
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,355
But here's the thing, though.
Is he cuter than me?

335
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,034
Should I not have him sit
at the same table as my date?

336
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,519
You're cute too.

337
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,673
Really? But cuter than Ryan? I mean,
I just don't want him overwhelming me.

338
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,195
I don't think that's possible.

339
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,914
You think I'm cute.

340
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,469
-When you're not talking.
-Hey.

341
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,838
Ryan, Alex. Alex, Ryan.

342
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,031
Lindsay, Seth. Seth, Lindsay.

343
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,918
How could I forget?

344
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,871
Well, this should be great.
Really great. And not at all awkward.

345
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,669
Yes, Your Honor. Yes.

346
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,390
-Sandy, what are you doing?
-I've got Judge Hatchett on the TiVo.

347
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,030
Have you ever seen her?
She does not take crap from anybody.

348
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,031
What's going on?

349
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,798
-What do you mean?
-You're in pajamas.

350
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,758
You have orange Cheeto dust
all over you.

351
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,310
What has happened to my husband?

352
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,955
Your father's case is as good as lost.

353
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,270
He's been giving me
the complete runaround.

354
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,069
T oday he sent me to go meet
with his former assistant Phyllis.

355
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,276
-Phyllis died last year.
-Exactly.

356
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,510
Literally, dead ends.

357
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,796
That's the best lead he's given me yet.

358
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,794
Julie seems to be on the same
seek-and-destroy mission as my dad.

359
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,429
As long as she's running the company...

360
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,030
-...I might as well--
-Give up. Why don't we give up?

361
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,958
Give up with me, honey.

362
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,793
We could let the gruesome
twosome destroy our careers...

363
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,111
...or we could sit here and enjoy
obscene amounts of Dr. Phil...

364
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,272
-...and destroy them ourselves.
-Sandy.

365
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,514
If my dad is acting all weird,
he's hiding something.

366
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,033
I know.

367
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,074
Which means it's your job
to figure out what that is.

368
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,757
I'm not your favorite person right now,
but I can make it up to you.

369
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,150
-This can't be good.
-Let's have a party.

370
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,716
Sure. Julie, can we talk
about this tomorrow?

371
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,917
Sure, we can. Unfortunately,
the caterers are here right now.

372
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,071
Come on in, guys. This way.

373
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,435
-What's going on?
-You know, here's the thing.

374
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,068
I knew if I asked in advance,
you'd probably say no.

375
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,553
So I called Mr. Herbert and several other
clients and invited them to a party.

376
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,358
-At our house?
-T onight?

377
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,474
Yeah, Caleb thought it was a great idea.

378
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,790
He went to the club
to meet someone for work.

379
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,711
-Meet who?
-Who knows?

380
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,474
Well, so much to do, so little time.

381
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,077
So The Killers....

382
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,673
Awesome, huh?

383
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,353
Stellar observation.

384
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,711
And one you've made, like,
eight times now.

385
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,393
All right.

386
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,078
So do you like live music?

387
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,993
Not really. You?

388
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,670
It's my passion.

389
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,237
-Dude, I'm dying here.
-My guess is the secret conference...

390
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,119
-...isn't helping.
-The good news is we hit rock bottom.

391
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,272
Although I've redefined rock bottom
several times tonight.

392
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,000
I think we just hit a new low.

393
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,354
There was no way I was
gonna let you stay home tonight.

394
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,273
I know. I wish I didn't have to
third-wheel on your date.

395
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,112
Duckie and I don't mind, do we?

396
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,794
Yeah, how much longer will this
Duckie thing go on for?

397
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,712
Do you want a new nickname?

398
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,110
How about--? Cohen.

399
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,268
I think it's a little soon
to joke about that.

400
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,715
Summer. Oh, my God. Hey.

401
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,348
-How are you?
-Hey, Cohen.

402
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,717
-Ryan.
-Marissa.

403
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,995
This is Lindsay.

404
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,759
This is Alex.

405
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,796
-This is Lindsay.
-Yeah, okay.

406
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,758
-Well this.... This is just....
-This is awesome.

407
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,388
It's awesome.

408
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,509
Maybe we should--

409
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,829
-Watch the band.
-All right.

410
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,989
-Yeah.
-See you.

411
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,639
See you.

412
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,236
So I'm guessing we just met
some ex-girlfriends.

413
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,395
Ryan and Marissa,
that's an epic tale right there.

414
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,438
But Summer and I are just as fascinating.
She was my shorty...

415
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,239
...Iast year, but then
she got served.

416
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,879
Not that that's...

417
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,832
...particularly interesting.

418
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,471
Jimmy, thank God you're here.

419
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,677
Julie invited me. She knows
I can't turn down free booze.

420
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,592
Neither can she.

421
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,789
Look at her.
The giggling and touching....

422
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,630
Oh, God, she just grazed an ass.

423
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,438
The not-so-subtle ass graze.

424
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,836
Yeah, I've been a victim of it myself.

425
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,709
Don't worry about it. She's schmoozing
the crowd at a cocktail party.

426
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,678
This is our star clientele.
Do you know how many years...

427
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,832
...of wooing and cajoling it took
to have a meeting with them?

428
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,992
This is the woman who came from
Riverside to become head Newpsie.

429
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,836
Then landed Newport's biggest tycoon
and took over his company.

430
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,276
She knows what she's doing.

431
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,995
Ten bucks says Cohen is bending that
poor girl's ear about Superman...

432
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,789
...or Batman or Something Man in a
unitard she doesn't give a crap about.

433
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,473
You know what?

434
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,233
I should stop him.

435
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,438
For her sake.

436
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,479
That sounds like it's coming
from a really generous place.

437
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,438
Or we could put off the Cohen
obsession and watch the band.

438
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,149
-I am not obsessing.
-The seething.

439
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,392
The staring. The analyzing of his outfit.
That's not obsessing?

440
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,075
What? That shirt totally accentuates
his bird arms.

441
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,108
I think this is the part
where I go to the bathroom.

442
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,272
I admit that our breakup, to an
outside observer, could seem sad.

443
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,638
But, I don't know, for me, I feel like it's
given me this great gift, this new era.

444
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,635
And this whole new situation, like,
her, Zach, you and l, it works.

445
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,837
-Drinking alone. That's not a good sign.
-What are you doing here?

446
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,073
I tried to talk to Phyllis earlier,
but I left my Ouija board at home.

447
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,956
No more games, Cal.

448
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,274
Who was that woman
I saw leave this place?

449
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,192
You trailed me here?

450
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,191
-Spied on me?
-No, actually, I got lucky.

451
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,511
-I showed up just as she was leaving.
-She was....

452
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,193
She's a....

453
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,994
-An old friend.
-Come on.

454
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,038
You built a fortune on lies.
You can do better than that.

455
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,509
My guess, that was Renee Wheeler.

456
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,432
I told you. I don't know her.

457
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,397
Then that was somebody
driving her car.

458
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,189
I called her license plate number in to
a friend of mine at the police station.

459
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,920
Well played, Magnum, P.I.

460
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,991
Stay away from her.

461
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,710
I'll only ask you this once, Cal.

462
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,436
Are you having an affair?

463
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,434
We're in much deeper water
than that, believe me.

464
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,512
-lf I were you, I'd leave it alone.
-What if I don't?

465
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,035
Well, we could lose everything.

466
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,670
So before you go probing around
into my affairs...

467
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,237
...think long and hard.

468
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,397
Is it worth it to you?

469
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,632
All right, let's hear it for The Killers.

470
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,752
It's like four too. Her over there.
Me over here. Me over her over here.

471
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,356
So the four of us hanging out over
each other, but hanging out together.

472
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,956
I mean apart, but in the same place,
but in different places mentally.

473
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,634
-Something's wrong with you.
-No, that's the best part.

474
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,837
I'm totally fine not talking to her.
I have nothing to say to her.

475
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,828
Except, what I would say
if I said something to her...

476
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,312
...and I don't care at all if I do,
is that I'm fine not talking to her.

477
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,632
-Maybe I should tell her that.
-Well, you'd better hurry...

478
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,597
...because they're leaving.

479
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,998
I'll be right back.

480
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,439
Hey, you came.

481
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,398
Well, my friends got tickets,
and they had an extra.

482
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,039
Right.

483
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,632
I'll see you around.

484
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,831
Maybe you should tell her.

485
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,118
-Tell who what?
-Lindsay. That you like her.

486
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,674
I'm not offended. It's okay.
It's a group hang...

487
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,470
...and, listen, no offense here,
but I'm not really feeling the spark.

488
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,270
Wow. An honest conversation
with a girl.

489
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,078
This is new for me.

490
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,391
I'm gone. Thanks.

491
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,030
I was not talking about Cohen
the entire night.

492
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,235
It sure felt like it.

493
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,516
Well, what, you wanna go
somewhere else?

494
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,877
Maybe you should go home and log on
to some kind of Cohen chat room.

495
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,155
-I've had enough.
-Summer.

496
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,958
Hey. Where you going?

497
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,712
-Look, it's Seth.
-We're going home.

498
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,350
-Can I talk to you? Zach, I'm sorry.
-Okay, I'm gonna go jump off the pier.

499
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,839
Zach, wait.

500
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,595
I just want to tell you I don't want
to talk. I'm fine with this. You and him.

501
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,672
Me and her.
Zach sure is a fast walker.

502
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,353
Just stop trailing us, all right?

503
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,750
-I'm not trailing--
-Zach, will you wait, please?

504
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,196
-I just--
-Just beat it.

505
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,952
Duckie.

506
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,195
Please.

507
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,879
Please.

508
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,439
-lf you promise to stop calling me Duckie.
-I can't make any promises.

509
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,476
-Where you going? Can I give you a lift?
-I couldn't ask any more from you.

510
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,552
Nor thank you enough
for one of the worst evenings of my life.

511
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,280
I know. Seth's not ready to date yet.
It was a bad idea.

512
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,032
It was a colossally bad idea.

513
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,270
Epically bad. The invasion of lraq...

514
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,034
-...Iooks pretty good in comparison.
-Okay. You're right.

515
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,714
-Let me talk to you for a second.
-No, Ryan. You can't.

516
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,072
I've listened to enough talk
for one night, okay?

517
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,237
See you at school.

518
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,750
Come here. You'll never believe this.
Stephen's daughter has a pony too.

519
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,117
-She boards at the same stable as China.
-What a coincidence.

520
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,955
How cute is that little riding park?

521
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,236
At Christmas they string lights
in the trees.

522
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,190
Y es. My daughter and her Shetland
spend all their Saturdays there.

523
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,393
Stephen, about the meeting,
I wanted to apologize--

524
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,836
You know, Kirsten is the one
who renovated the stable and the park.

525
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,231
Then sold it back to the original owners
at twice the cost.

526
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,917
Preservation and profit.
That's your motto, right, Kirsten?

527
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,109
Well, that's every developer's dream.

528
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,113
Funny. Mine's Jude Law
on a zebra-skin rug.

529
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,155
Your drink's looking empty.
Can I get you another?

530
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,908
-Only if you two join me.
-Be careful, Stephen.

531
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,799
Kirsten here's got
a bit of a hollow leg.

532
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,998
-What are you drinking?
-Champagne.

533
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,229
Make it two.

534
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,678
-Done.
-Thank you.

535
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,079
See? I'm not totally useless.

536
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,471
-I never said--
-Apology accepted. I'm going to get...

537
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,997
...Mr. Herbert's contract from my purse.
Make sure he gets another whiskey sour.

538
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,072
-Hey.
-Hey.

539
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,310
-How was your night?
-Not good. You?

540
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,519
Worse.

541
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,797
You didn't like Alex?

542
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,598
And you and Lindsay?

543
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,552
Not even close.

544
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,678
What are you gonna do now?

545
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,078
-Actually, I was gonna go and....
-Go for it.

546
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,753
-Yeah?
-Yes.

547
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,194
What are you gonna do?

548
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,555
-I was gonna maybe--
-Good idea.

549
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,196
-All right. See you.
-All right. See you.

550
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,359
Great show.
I hope you guys come back soon.

551
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,315
So to recap...

552
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,075
...I got discoed by
two girls in one night.

553
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,550
And, unfortunately, that's just not
the first time that's happened.

554
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,508
-Actually, I'm not surprised.
-Thank you. Keep twisting the knife.

555
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,150
-I'm not in enough pain.
-You're hurting? Not Summer or Lindsay?

556
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,470
Yeah, well, at least
everybody's miserable, right?

557
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,030
Anyways, sorry about the whole...

558
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,510
...group hang or whatever that was.

559
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,114
Good night.

560
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,755
-Hard to believe those girls running out.
-Don't make me try and feel better.

561
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,514
What with you being
so bratty and immature.

562
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,913
-Good. You weren't.
-And even...

563
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,037
...sometimes...

564
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,272
...a little...

565
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,039
...charming.

566
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,475
Especially when you're not
talking about Summer.

567
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,509
-I know. I just--
-And knowing is half the battle...

568
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,275
...so perhaps there's a little hope
for you yet.

569
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,472
You want to get ice cream
or something?

570
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,030
-lce cream as a nightcap.
-Yeah.

571
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,112
-You really are 8.
-And three-quarters.

572
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,073
Let's go.

573
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,876
I'll buy, but no more than two scoops.

574
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,799
All right.

575
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,755
-Keeping watch?
-What are you doing here?

576
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,909
I was headed to your house.
I thought I'd surprise you.

577
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,911
So this means...?

578
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,671
I'm not sure exactly, except...

579
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,873
...I guess I better prepare myself
for some drama, huh?

580
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,951
You have no idea.

581
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,474
Hi.

582
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,159
Need a lift?

583
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,353
No, thanks.
The bus will be here soon.

584
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,829
Okay. Did you not understand
the part about me taking the bus?

585
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,116
-All right. Hold on.
-Don't.

586
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,069
It's my fault. I knew it was
gonna be a disaster with Seth.

587
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,232
-Then why'd you say yes?
-I thought you were asking me out.

588
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,958
-I didn't mean to say that out loud.
-What?

589
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,278
I thought that I was saying yes to you.

590
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,757
-Where's that stupid bus?
-You did? Because l....

591
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,030
I mean, you think I'm an idiot.

592
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,070
Yeah, well, I guess that's the twist,
because it turns out I'm the idiot.

593
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,000
No, no, you're not. I....

594
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,437
When I asked you out that day
for Seth l....

595
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,233
Well, l....

596
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,392
Keep talking, Ryan.

597
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,239
I wanted it to be me.

598
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,513
I did. I just didn't think
in a million years you'd say yes.

599
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,988
Then I've been right all along.

600
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,359
You are an idiot.

601
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,679
An idiot you'd go out with sometime?

602
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,719
It's possible.

603
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,314
-Party's over.
-Finally.

604
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,870
I literally had to push Stephen Herbert
out the door.

605
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,998
Deal's back on?

606
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,994
He re-signed his contracts. Hopefully,
he'll remember that in the morning.

607
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,912
Julie Cooper.

608
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,589
Definitely understands
the weakness of man.

609
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,239
You were gone for a while.

610
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,675
Well, I was driving around.

611
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,193
Thinking how I find myself again...

612
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,517
...in a very familiar triangle.

613
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,990
-What triangle is that?
-You. Me.

614
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,838
Your dad.

615
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,318
-He's guilty, isn't he?
-He's guilty of something.

616
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,191
-Something he thinks we shouldn't know.
-Well, you've never been one...

617
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,920
-...to shy away from the truth.
-I can start now.

618
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,639
A man can make a nice life
out of Cheetos and Dr. Phil.

619
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,916
Not the man I love.
