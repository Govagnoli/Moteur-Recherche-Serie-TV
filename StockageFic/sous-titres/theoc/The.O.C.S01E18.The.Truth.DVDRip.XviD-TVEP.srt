<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,318
You gotta let that guy know, back off.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,074
That is Marissa's letter.
That you stole from her locker?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,434
If she finds out, you guys are done.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,875
- The interior design job, I want it.
- We've found our girl.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,076
Am I dating the female me?
Like me, but as a girl?

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,276
People can be really unpredictable.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,714
I can't believe you stole it.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,598
How can you say
he's not in love with you?

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,988
I can't do this anymore.

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,310
You and Marissa aren't supposed
to be together.

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,278
- I am not gonna let this happen.
- Who's gonna believe you?

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,710
Stay away from her!

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,959
You're not having breakfast?

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,072
Not really hungry.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,351
Dr. Kim just called to let us know
that you've been suspended, indefinitely.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,078
Until the disciplinary committee...

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,356
...can figure out whether or not
they want to expel you.

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,398
I know you want me to say I'm sorry,
but I'm not.

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,232
Oliver admitted it. Right to my face.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,868
He told me he wanted me gone
so he could get to Marissa.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,994
Then why would he drop
the assault charges against you?

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,553
- He did that?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,314
I mean, it seems to me
that if he had it in for you...

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,040
...if he wanted you gone,
you'd be back in juvie already.

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,111
I mean, you know that, right?

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,876
Come on, help me out here, would you?

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,110
Tell me what's going on.

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,754
Oliver's dangerous.

30
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,559
This is what I know:

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,590
You attacked him. Period.
You're on probation.

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,593
You knew the slightest infraction would
result in you being taken from us.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,478
And you did it anyway.

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,234
For the life of me,
I can't understand why.

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,913
Talk to me.

36
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,476
Come on, Ryan, talk to me.

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,557
What's the point?
You won't believe me.

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,915
It's not about what I believe.
I wish it was.

39
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,991
It's about what you did.

40
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,510
The next time you feel
like raising your fist...

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,877
...you had better open your mouth
and talk.

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,232
I'm here for that.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,392
What am I supposed to do?

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,711
I can't ground you.
I'm not gonna chain you to the wall.

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,630
You want to go after that Oliver kid?

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,676
Go ahead. The door's open.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,993
But if you want to stay,
if you want to be part of this family...

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,355
...you're not gonna go anywhere
or do anything...

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,512
...you're not gonna see anyone,
unless Kirsten and I say it's okay.

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,318
That's the deal.
Take it or leave it.

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,030
So Ryan just, like,
punched him for no reason?

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,997
That's what Ryan does.
He punches people.

53
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,913
He doesn't talk to them,
and he doesn't listen.

54
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,513
He had to have a reason, though.

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,911
I mean, yeah, Ryan's violent,
but he's not stupid.

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,919
He just...

57
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,959
I don't know. He thinks Oliver's
in love with me or something.

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,553
Well, isn't he?

59
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,039
- A little?
- We're just friends.

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,633
Okay!

61
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,792
I mean, Oliver's, like, the only guy
in my life who isn't jealous...

62
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,520
...and scary and breathing
down my neck all the time.

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,591
And he actually tells me
what he's thinking.

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,113
Unlike some people.

65
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,919
So are you and Ryan...?

66
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,079
We broke up.

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,639
Whoa, Coop.

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,479
So that means that
we're both single now.

69
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,834
Which...

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,877
...rocks! Right?

71
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,189
No more Ryan.

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,318
No more Seth Cohen.
We're totally free. Liberated.

73
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,393
In fact, how about I treat us both to
a little Burke Williams today after school?

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,630
A little facial, a little massage...

75
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,519
I can't. I promised Oliver
I'd help him study after school.

76
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,352
Oh. Well, how about this weekend?

77
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,238
My dad's taking Kaitlin to my grandma's...

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,436
...and I have to spend the weekend
at my mom's.

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,273
Apparently, she's got this
mother-daughter marathon planned.

80
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,555
- Well, then when are we gonna hang out?
- Soon.

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,593
Hey, you coming?

82
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,789
Well, even if Ryan gets expelled,
he's still gonna live with you guys, right?

83
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,554
- Your parents aren't gonna kick him out.
- No.

84
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,233
I don't think so.

85
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,719
Well, is he okay?

86
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,916
He's not the one
who got punched in the face.

87
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,957
I'm talking about
in the larger sense, Seth.

88
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,315
I guess. I don't really know.

89
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,077
- Haven't you talked to him?
- No. What am I supposed to say?

90
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,198
I don't know. "Are you okay?"
"Is there anything I can do?"

91
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,078
That's the thing.
There's nothing I can do.

92
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,277
I begged him to stay away from Oliver,
and he didn't listen to me.

93
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,352
Look, you don't know Ryan that well,
okay? You don't understand.

94
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,158
I'm trying.

95
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,508
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

97
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,072
- How is everybody?
- Good.

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,309
- Good.
- Good.

99
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,072
Good.

100
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,919
Okay, this is really...

101
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,195
- Weird?
- Yeah.

102
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,079
- Just because you and Ryan aren't...
- Doesn't mean we can't...

103
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,514
- Exactly.
- Right.

104
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,557
- So is he okay?
- What up? What up?

105
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,592
So, what are we doing this weekend?

106
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,034
Ski trip? Mammoth?

107
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,714
Six to 8 inches
of fresh powder tomorrow.

108
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,949
Oliver, your lip.

109
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,112
I was hoping it had already made
the transition from scary to sexy.

110
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,714
Not yet, huh?

111
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,678
- Walk you to Western civ?
- Sure.

112
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,229
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

113
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,394
- Wow. Oliver seems almost...
- Happy?

114
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,553
Yeah, well, why shouldn't he?
He has Marissa all to himself now.

115
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,473
What?

116
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,591
I think I made a mistake.

117
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,716
- By leaving Ryan home alone?
- By bringing him home in the first place.

118
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,155
Sandy, he's a good kid.
He's not perfect.

119
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,278
But we'll work it out. We always do.
Everything's gonna be okay.

120
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,670
Who'd have ever thought
you'd be telling me that?

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,672
- Kirsten Cohen?
- Yes.

122
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,353
- You shouldn't be here.
- I'm sorry?

123
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,988
We have a work order from Julie Cooper.
Excuse me, sir.

124
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,831
There must be a mistake.

125
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,675
What are you doing here?
You were going to lunch.

126
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,400
- We ordered in. Deli?
- Oh, hi, Sandy. No, thank you.

127
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,232
Julie, what is going on?

128
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,630
Well, as the Newport Group's
new design director...

129
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,360
...I've decided to give the office
a much-needed facelift.

130
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,592
Wait till you see your furniture, Kiki.
It's very fresh. Very Danish.

131
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,239
- Very "hello."
- I'm sure it is...

132
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,516
...but you can't just initiate a redesign.

133
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,955
- You need approvals.
- Caleb said it was okay.

134
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,951
Oh, if Caleb said it was okay...

135
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,309
My coffee table!

136
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,755
Kiki, what's going on?
Some man in a jumpsuit...

137
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,717
...just made off with my massage chair.

138
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,599
I want my chair. I want my desk.
I want my office back.

139
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,593
By the time we get back from lunch,
you'll have it and love it.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,150
You want to join us to celebrate
my new position?

141
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,953
Oh, I'm not gonna touch that one.

142
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,119
- No, we're okay.
- Okay.

143
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,036
I have work to do.

144
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,637
Don't worry, honey. You said it yourself.
Everything's gonna be fine.

145
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,911
Come on. You have to go.

146
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,469
We both could use the weekend away.
It'll be my treat.

147
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,234
I can't. Besides, I'm the one
who should be treating you.

148
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,630
You wouldn't have gotten hurt
if it weren't for me.

149
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,153
Hey, that was Ryan, not you.

150
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,199
What did we learn in therapy?

151
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,552
Say it with me now.
"We are responsible for our own actions."

152
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,799
Hey, what's up?

153
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,520
Luke, help me convince Marissa
to come to Mammoth with us.

154
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,159
- Who's going to Mammoth?
- Not me.

155
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,709
My dad's out of town,
so I'm gonna be at my mom's.

156
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,236
Which means she'll be next to Ryan,
which is not good for her right now.

157
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,518
- Well, isn't that kind of up to Marissa?
- Look, it's not a big deal. It's fine.

158
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,036
Okay, so let me at least get you
and your mom a suite at the hotel.

159
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,710
That way I'll be there, and you won't
even have to think about Ryan.

160
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,350
Look, this is probably her now,
already checking up on me.

161
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,397
- It's Ryan, isn't it?
- You're not gonna get it?

162
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,028
- She's not talking to Ryan.
- Is she talking to me?

163
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,270
- Or are you doing her talking now?
- Luke, don't.

164
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,237
- Marissa...
- I should probably just go.

165
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,833
Stay.

166
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,236
You two enjoy your lunch.

167
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,752
I am so sorry.

168
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,358
I guess I can just get a little
overprotective sometimes.

169
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,274
- But I would never presume to...
- I know. It's okay. Really.

170
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,269
Why don't I just go get us some dessert.

171
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,873
<i>You have one new message.</i>

172
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,874
<i>Hey, I was hoping maybe we could talk,</i>
<i>face to face, if you want.</i>

173
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,077
<i>So I'll meet you in the library</i>
<i>after school, and I hope...</i>

174
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,310
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

175
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,759
<i>To save the message, press two.</i>
<i>To erase the message, press three.</i>

176
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,676
<i>Message deleted.</i>

177
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,791
So, what's the plan? Comic books first?
Or frozen yogurt?

178
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,315
You think it's cool
if we do the comics run tomorrow?

179
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,119
I thought it'd be better
if I went home to check on Ryan.

180
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,750
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Do you want some company?

181
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,878
- Hey. Where are you guys going?
- Well, we were talking about...

182
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,918
...maybe going to the comic-book store...
- Really?

183
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,358
Can I come?

184
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,079
To the comic-book store?

185
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,435
Yeah. I like comics. Sort of.

186
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,192
You do?

187
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,238
Believe it or not, Betty and Veronica
had a huge influence on me.

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,956
You know what, I do believe that.

189
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,834
I believe it too.

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,753
Besides, Marissa has Oliver now...

191
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,390
...and I have a whole afternoon to kill.

192
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,389
So, great.

193
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,039
- You'll spend it with us.
- Yeah.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,195
Except, don't you have to go
check on Ryan?

195
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,629
Well, I...

196
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,273
Excuse me.

197
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,039
Hey. What are you doing here?

198
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,112
- I'm supposed to meet Marissa.
- Okay, but here? In broad daylight?

199
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,238
- In front of God, Dr. Kim and everyone?
- She's not taking my calls.

200
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,277
This is the only place
I knew I could see her.

201
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,759
Does Marissa know about this?

202
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,356
You'd think you, of all people,
would believe me.

203
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,999
Ryan, Marissa's a big girl.

204
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,594
You can't tell her who
she can and can't hang out with.

205
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,435
Oliver's not stable. He's dangerous. One
girl got a restraining order against him.

206
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,068
Natalie? Either she lives
in Niagara Falls or doesn't exist.

207
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,391
- I'm sure he's not making up girlfriends.
- Seth, he's crazy.

208
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,949
Okay. Okay. Fine. He's crazy.

209
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,076
But this <i>Mission: Impossible</i>
act you're pulling...

210
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,755
...it's not the way to make your case.
- I have to go.

211
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,998
She's not coming.

212
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,829
She asked me to tell you not to call her
anymore and not to try and see her.

213
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,468
If you do, she'll get a restraining order
against you.

214
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,473
- Really? What's that like?
- It's not my fault she won't see you.

215
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,154
I mean, you spied on her.
You stole from her.

216
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,392
- You beat up one of her best friends.
- I'd do it again too. Right now.

217
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,075
I could've pressed charges, but I didn't.
I'm trying to help you.

218
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,437
But if you keep this up,
no one's gonna be able to save you.

219
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,433
Give it up, buddy. It's over.

220
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,152
Hey, Oliver.

221
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,468
It hasn't even begun.

222
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,274
I need my office back
by the end of the day, Brian.

223
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,955
If Julie Cooper asks you to do anything
else, you nod your head and do nothing.

224
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,314
Thanks.

225
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,232
- Have you seen the coffee?
- Very funny.

226
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,597
- In the meantime, I have no place to work.
- Yeah, I have no place to eat.

227
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,196
Her first day, and Julie has displaced
half the staff from their offices...

228
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,114
...and personally alienated the other half.
She's driving everyone crazy.

229
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,953
Including me. Please talk to her,
before I starve to death.

230
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,157
You can't talk to Julie Cooper.
She's Julie Cooper.

231
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,436
Talk to your dad.
He's the reason she's there.

232
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,353
I know, but then he'll think
it's personal or that I'm jealous.

233
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,192
I can't talk to my father.

234
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,874
You don't mind if I work
out of the house, do you?

235
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,758
- Sorry, I thought if there was coffee...
- Oh, Ryan, come on in.

236
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,434
There's coffee and cereal and...

237
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,272
...a model home.

238
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,670
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

239
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,710
He didn't leave the pool house
all day yesterday.

240
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,348
- Maybe we're being too hard on him.
- We gotta hang tough.

241
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,990
- It's for his own good.
- Then why do I feel so bad?

242
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,556
Kirsten. You're not dressed.

243
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,438
- Julie.
- We could carpool from now on.

244
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,989
We're next door.
Have you read the latest EPA figures?

245
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,516
What we're doing to the environment?
Sandy, I can see you hiding.

246
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,830
Not hiding, Julie.
Just making myself presentable.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,275
- Don't go to any trouble for me.
- Don't worry.

248
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,078
Kirsten, you're still not dressed.

249
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,075
Yes, well, I was planning on working from
the house today, since my office is still...

250
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,595
Honey, weren't you supposed
to meet with Caleb...

251
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,228
...to talk about the thing?

252
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,310
- It can wait.
- So can Julie. Grab a shower.

253
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,550
- I can get Julie some coffee.
- I'll help myself.

254
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,517
- Is it flavored?
- No.

255
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,477
Go ahead. Go.

256
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,879
Aren't you late for school?

257
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,997
- I got suspended.
- Oh, what a surprise.

258
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,515
Who'd you beat up this time? Dr. Kim?

259
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,989
I guess you and Marissa
haven't talked in a while.

260
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,151
Well, as a matter of fact,
she'll be spending the weekend with me.

261
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,389
She will?

262
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,075
I guess you and Marissa
haven't talked in a while.

263
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,679
Look, I know you and I haven't always
agreed when it comes to Marissa...

264
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,752
...but I'm asking you, please,
keep her away from this kid Oliver.

265
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,596
He's not well.

266
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,313
Really?

267
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,195
The boy who lives in the pool house
is warning me...

268
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,999
...about the boy
who lives in the penthouse?

269
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,319
He's got this thing that he does.

270
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,994
He locks into a girl,
thinks she'll make everything okay.

271
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,912
And when she can't, he loses it.

272
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,799
I am not getting involved
in the throes of teenage romance.

273
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,155
He cut his wrists last year
because of a girl.

274
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,390
When his girlfriend Natalie
broke up with him...

275
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,915
...he got busted for trying to buy cocaine.

276
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,433
It's true. You can ask Marissa.

277
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,672
- Julie, you ready?
- Yeah.

278
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,552
Stay out of trouble, Ryan.

279
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,429
- What did your mom say about Mammoth?
- I didn't ask her yet.

280
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,359
I'm sorry. I just...

281
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,512
I try not to talk to my mom
as much as possible.

282
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,956
Look, if you don't want to hang out
with me this weekend, that's fine.

283
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,031
- What?
- It's okay if you don't.

284
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,636
Just tell me. Because after
what happened with me and Natalie...

285
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,155
I do want to hang out with you.

286
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,869
Believe me, there's nothing I'd rather do
than just blow everything off...

287
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,793
...school, therapy, my mom,
and hang out with you.

288
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,078
- But I've got so...
- You mean it?

289
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,919
Seriously?

290
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,951
Then let's do it.
Let's blow it off.

291
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,519
All right. We can drive to L.A.

292
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,514
We can have lunch at the Ivy,
do the Getty, swing by the Troubadour.

293
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,391
It sounds perfect,
except my mom would kill me.

294
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,710
I'm supposed to have dinner
with her tonight.

295
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,871
What if I get you back by dinner?

296
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,191
- Come on. You know you want to.
- Stop it.

297
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,749
- What about therapy?
- Oh, you don't need therapy.

298
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,230
From what you told me, your mom's
the one who needs therapy, right?

299
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,596
Promise I'll be back before dinner?

300
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,117
- Where are they going?
- I don't know.

301
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,953
- But I don't trust that dude.
- Stop it. You sound like Ryan.

302
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,438
- You've met Natalie, right?
- Oliver's ex, Natalie?

303
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,953
No. You?

304
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,150
No. Ryan thinks he made her up.

305
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,229
Oliver said she went to Pacific, right?
I've got friends there. I can just ask.

306
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,597
- You don't think that's a little crazy?
- Dude, have you met Oliver?

307
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,268
- Dad, do you have a minute?
- Exactly one.

308
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,153
It's about Julie.

309
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,552
Close the door.

310
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,631
She's driving me crazy.

311
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,598
- Excuse me?
- Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the woman.

312
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,435
But not every living minute of the day.
She's there every time I turn around.

313
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,149
At home, in the office. I wouldn't
be surprised if she wasn't in here now.

314
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,878
Dad, you're the one who hired her.

315
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,714
I gave her something to do,
so she'd stop calling me.

316
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,952
Well, it worked. Now she doesn't
have to call you. She's always here.

317
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,032
Which is why I want you to talk to her.
I know she's your friend...

318
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,909
...but in the interest of the business,
not to mention your father's sanity...

319
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,752
...this has to end.

320
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,592
What are you talking about?
The job?

321
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,838
- You want me to break up with her?
- I knew you'd understand.

322
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,834
Hey.

323
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,830
So Summer and Anna are both here.

324
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,515
Summer is about to read her first comic.
I knew you wouldn't want to miss that.

325
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,318
Let me know how it goes.

326
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,870
Okay. Well, I can see you're busy.

327
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,837
Why don't you invite over Oliver?

328
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,790
- Natalie, if you can find her.
- Yeah. Maybe I'll do that.

329
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,355
- Hey, guys. What are you doing?
- Hey.

330
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,671
Believe it or not, Summer has shown
a latent interest in comic bookery.

331
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,796
- I don't believe it.
- Believe it.

332
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,111
- Where's Ryan?
- I invited him to join us...

333
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,350
...but he's staying
in the Fortress of Solitude.

334
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,715
- <i>Superman</i> reference.
- I knew that.

335
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,790
So I'm gonna start you off
with some basics:

336
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,030
<i>Batman</i>: <i>The Dark Knight Returns</i>.
Very important.

337
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,156
<i>Watchman</i> and <i>The Sandman.</i>

338
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,799
Enjoy.

339
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,189
- Seth?
- Yeah.

340
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,238
Don't you want to start
on something less grim and gritty?

341
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,789
- Like what?
- Like the <i>Archie</i>s?

342
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,674
Anna. The <i>Archie</i>s?

343
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,674
Hey, I'm with Anna. Life's gritty enough.
Comic books are for fun.

344
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,110
Life's gritty enough?
We live in Newport Beach.

345
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,190
- Hey, Mr. Cohen?
- Yes?

346
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,316
Did you read comic books
when you were a kid?

347
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,916
- Oh, yeah. Sure. I mean, not like Seth.
- I know.

348
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,072
You have no idea how rare it is
to find another comic-book person.

349
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,879
Especially one who loves Death Cab
and sailing.

350
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,396
- I thought I was the only one.
- I thought Seth was the only one.

351
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,517
Death Cab is a band, yes?

352
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,911
Guys? Seth!

353
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,436
- Can you help me with the groceries?
- Yeah, yeah. In a minute.

354
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,558
So I guess you and Mrs. Cohen
have a lot in common, huh?

355
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,474
Oh, yeah, sure. We both love...

356
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,836
...Seth. So I guess we don't
have a lot in common.

357
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,671
Well, then what do you think is the key
to a successful relationship?

358
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,990
The sooner we get the bags,
the sooner we eat.

359
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,479
Coming.

360
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,791
Well, I think as far as Cohen men
are concerned, the key...

361
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,679
...is patience.
- Patience?

362
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,749
Hey, Dad. Is it cool if Summer
stays for dinner?

363
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,029
- I'm gonna get the groceries.
- All right. Thanks.

364
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,557
- Come on, man. What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

365
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,358
These are crazy people.

366
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,952
Luke! What are you doing here?
Besides relieving me of grocery duty.

367
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,192
I hadn't seen Ryan in a while,
so I thought I'd stop by and say hey.

368
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,429
Is that okay?

369
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,875
I can't stay.
I have to go have dinner with my dad.

370
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,873
- But there's something you should know.
- What?

371
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,474
I saw Marissa leave school today
with Oliver.

372
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,552
They skipped the whole day.
And I tried her on her cell, but...

373
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,551
- You don't know where they went?
- No.

374
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,556
And I'm sure she's probably fine, right?
But there's something about that kid.

375
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,318
So I went over to Pacific after school.

376
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,152
I know guys
on the water-polo team there.

377
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,799
I figured I'd ask what they knew.

378
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,951
What was he like
when he went to Pacific?

379
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,156
Did they even know him?
Did they know Natalie?

380
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,959
Well, it turns out...

381
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,511
...there is no Natalie.

382
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,914
At least not at Pacific High.

383
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,073
- Are you sure it's okay that I'm staying?
- Oh, absolutely.

384
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,117
We have more than enough
for everybody.

385
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,475
I don't know where
we're gonna put it all.

386
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,835
Eventually, in my belly.

387
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,995
- You go ahead and start without me.
- Okay.

388
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,114
I'll go get Ryan.

389
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,513
What are you doing at my house?
You have to leave. I mean it.

390
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,910
- I have to tell you something.
- You went to my mom.

391
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,231
She called the school. She called
the hotel looking for Oliver's parents.

392
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,356
- Let me talk to you.
- Why do you hate him?

393
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,748
What did he ever do to you?

394
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,953
There is no Natalie.

395
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,634
You're becoming pathetic.

396
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,233
Ask him.

397
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,558
Ask him to show you his yearbook.
She's not there. She's not real.

398
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,914
He made her up.

399
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,911
Marissa, inside.
You're in big trouble.

400
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,674
- Ryan, go home.
- No. You know what, Ryan? You stay.

401
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,989
I'm going.

402
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,357
Marissa. Marissa, get back here!

403
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,878
Get back here!

404
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,436
- Hey.
- Hi.

405
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,954
Do you mind if I stay here tonight?

406
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,072
I thought you might
want some breakfast.

407
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,832
Thanks.

408
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,350
I shouldn't have gone over
there last night.

409
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,798
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Not really.

410
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,713
Ryan...

411
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,078
...I promise I will do everything
I can to help you.

412
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,231
But I can't help you
if you don't talk to me.

413
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,591
You don't tell me what's going on.

414
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,715
Ryan, I thought you might like some...

415
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,913
Coffee.

416
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,674
- Great minds.
- Luke's here to see you.

417
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,712
Thanks, you guys.

418
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,834
Hey, man.

419
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,789
So how did it go last night?
What'd she say?

420
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,393
She didn't believe me.

421
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,028
- Then her mom started in, and she ran.
- To Oliver's?

422
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,713
I don't know.

423
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,355
- So let's go find out.
- And then what?

424
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,988
- She wants to be with him.
- You're just gonna give up?

425
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,913
What else can I do?
She won't listen to a word I have to say.

426
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,469
Well, she's gonna listen to me.

427
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,032
See you.

428
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,591
So if we leave for L.A.
After our massages...

429
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,990
...we can check into my parents' suite
around 2.

430
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,189
Wait. Your parents have
their own suite in L.A. Too?

431
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,555
They have private suites
in all their hotels.

432
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,553
- London, Paris...
- Oh, I wish we could go to Paris.

433
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,075
We can. It's only 15 hours away.

434
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,950
Yeah. As long as we're back
by Monday, right?

435
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,476
Look, if you don't want to go,
just say so.

436
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,154
- We don't have to.
- No, I do. I just can't.

437
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,039
Why not? You've been saying you wanted
to get away from your mom...

438
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,315
...and from Ryan.

439
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,272
This way it'll just be you and me.

440
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,714
In Paris.

441
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,269
Hey, don't answer that.
It's probably your mom.

442
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,079
It's Luke.

443
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,958
- Hey.
- Marissa...

444
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,116
- Where are you?
- I'm at the hotel.

445
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,077
- Why is he calling?
- <i>You gotta listen to me.</i>

446
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,071
There is no Natalie Bishop.

447
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,037
- <i>Ryan was right.</i>
- Luke, don't you start.

448
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,832
<i>I'm trying to help you, Marissa.</i>

449
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,673
You want to help? Go to my mom's
and tell her I'm fine.

450
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,036
- Marissa...
- Luke, please.

451
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,237
I'll be there soon.

452
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,398
He's just dropping off some clothes.

453
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,033
If you don't want to stay...

454
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,394
No, I do.

455
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,233
I do. I just can't fly to Paris right now.

456
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,958
I'm sorry.

457
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,949
Well, it's cold right now anyway.

458
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,678
We'll go in the spring.

459
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,160
- Unbelievable.
- Oh, don't look. It's not finished.

460
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,709
I wanted you to be surprised on Monday.

461
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,479
I am.

462
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,073
Julie, it's gorgeous.

463
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,673
Did you do all this today?

464
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,033
I was supposed to have Marissa
this weekend. That didn't happen.

465
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,713
I haven't heard from your father.

466
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,678
So then I thought, why not work, right?
Take my mind off things.

467
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,638
Have you heard from your father?
Have you talked to him today?

468
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,155
No, no, not today, but...

469
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,674
But what? Is he all right?
Did something happen?

470
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,432
No, he's fine.

471
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,953
- It's just...
- What?

472
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,153
He doesn't like confrontation.

473
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,113
Julie, you want to sit down?

474
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,868
Why? What's going on?

475
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,279
No.

476
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,956
Is...?

477
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,473
Is he breaking up with me?

478
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,509
Or are you doing it for him?

479
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,189
Kiki, I saw your car.

480
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,752
Hello, darling.

481
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,836
- I tried to call you earlier, but...
- Don't bother, Cal.

482
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,756
Kirsten's already done
your dirty work for you.

483
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,996
Because obviously you're not man enough
to do it yourself.

484
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,720
- I'm sorry.
- You should be.

485
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,556
God. I deserve so much better from you.

486
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,758
From both of you.

487
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,870
Enjoy your office. I quit.

488
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,792
Hello, ladies. Seth.

489
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,951
- Dad, don't call me a lady.
- Hey, Mr. Cohen.

490
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,633
Hey, Sandy.

491
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,069
So the comic-book education continues?

492
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,394
<i>Batman: The Animated Series.</i>

493
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,711
Yes. "Girls' Night Out," in which
Batgirl and Supergirl team up...

494
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,713
...to combat the forces of evil
and delight Seth Cohen.

495
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,189
Is Supergirl wearing Doc Martens?

496
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,916
Yes. Yes, she is, Summer.

497
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,675
And a midriff-baring T-shirt
and a miniskirt. It's excellent.

498
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,638
- No wonder you like comics, Super-Perv.
- That's right.

499
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,795
Dad, we were all gonna have lunch.
Is there...?

500
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,714
- Can I see you? Now.
- Okay.

501
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,955
What? What'd I do?

502
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,792
You hurt that poor girl's feelings
out there.

503
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,790
- Who, Dad, Summer? Please...
- No. No, Anna.

504
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,712
- I didn't say a word to Anna.
- Exactly.

505
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,031
How do you think that makes her feel,
you flirting with another girl?

506
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,316
Dad, I was not flirting.

507
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,040
- Seth.
- Dad. Summer and I are friends.

508
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,033
- That's not what it looked like.
- I'm not talking about this.

509
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,839
Of course not. No one's talking
to me about anything lately.

510
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,434
- Lf you want to flirt...
- Why are we talking about this?

511
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,114
Because I'm your father
and I'm responsible for you.

512
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,750
And if I see something's going on
with you, we are gonna talk about it.

513
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,875
Do you think that this is about me...

514
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,439
...or could this be about Ryan?

515
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,074
No. It's about you.

516
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,593
Okay.

517
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,593
But just in case
it's a little bit about Ryan...

518
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,029
...I think he'll come to you
when he's ready.

519
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,877
- Hey, Mrs. Cooper.
- Hey.

520
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,639
You all right?

521
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,233
Hard day. Come on in.
I'll get Marissa's things for you.

522
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,158
Well, I have to say, I'm very impressed
that you and Marissa are still friends.

523
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,992
- Yeah, I'm impressed she forgave me.
- Maybe one day she'll forgive me too.

524
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,832
For what?

525
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,475
Well, I haven't exactly
been the best mom, have I?

526
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,949
Or the best wife, or the best girlfriend,
for that matter.

527
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,433
You and Mr. Nichol?

528
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,750
Yeah. It's over.

529
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,435
Which means that...

530
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,796
...in the past six months...

531
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,191
...I've lost my husband, my daughter...

532
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,715
...my boyfriend and my job.

533
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,198
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be telling you all this.

534
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,918
No, no, it's okay.

535
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,719
The past few months have been rough
on everybody.

536
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,029
Yeah.

537
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,031
Yeah, they have.

538
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,311
Thank you for listening.

539
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,710
I haven't had anyone to talk to in so long.

540
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,670
Well, you can talk to me.
I don't know what good it'll do, but...

541
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,949
Hey.

542
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,718
You should go.

543
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,030
Marissa's waiting.

544
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,436
Hi, I'm Marissa Cooper. I'm staying
in the penthouse with Oliver Trask.

545
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,875
I was wondering if someone
dropped off a bag for me.

546
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,917
Sorry. One moment.

547
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,913
Thank you for calling. This is Natalie.
Can you hold, please?

548
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,270
- Let me check for you, Miss Cooper.
- Natalie?

549
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,512
- Do you know Oliver Trask?
- Yeah, since he was just a little guy.

550
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,036
I used to babysit him.
You don't want to know how old I am.

551
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,359
Your last name isn't Bishop, is it?

552
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,274
Yes, why do you ask?

553
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,708
- Hey.
- Hey.

554
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,598
I was just calling your cell.

555
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,354
Where'd you go? I got out
of the shower, and you were gone.

556
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,432
I just went downstairs to see
if they had my bag, but they didn't.

557
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,114
You didn't have to do that.
They'll bring it up.

558
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,120
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

559
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,508
It's just...

560
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,028
It's just, the weirdest thing happened.

561
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,476
You know the concierge at the
front desk? Her name's Natalie.

562
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,832
Natalie Bishop.
The same as your ex-girlfriend, right?

563
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,515
- It's just, how weird is that?
- I know what you're thinking, but...

564
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,468
- There is no ex-girlfriend, is there?
- Marissa, I can explain.

565
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,278
- I have to go.
- No, no. Please.

566
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,592
Okay. I'm so sorry. I always do this.
Why do I always do this?

567
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,955
- Oliver, stop it.
- Damn it!

568
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,872
- Oliver, stop.
- Okay.

569
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,679
All right? It's okay.
I'm not going anywhere.

570
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,150
So why don't you just go get changed,
and then we can go?

571
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,198
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

572
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,319
- Okay.
- Yeah.

573
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,154
Come on. Pick up.

574
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,278
- Hello?
- Ryan, it's me.

575
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,237
- What's going on? Where are you?
- At the hotel. I can't talk right now.

576
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,597
It's Oliver, he's... You were right.
And now he won't let me leave.

577
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,113
Hang up!

578
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,910
Hang up the phone. Please?

579
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,229
Give me the phone.

580
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,197
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- What's going on?

581
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,476
Please, give me the phone.

582
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,629
Bye, Ryan.

583
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,549
It's too bad that Summer couldn't stay.
We have so much food.

584
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,837
- Never fear, Mom. Anna's here.
- You noticed.

585
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,037
- Hey, Seth, why don't you go get Ryan.
- Okay.

586
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,918
- Hey, will you come with me?
- Yeah.

587
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,629
Sure, maybe then we can be alone
for, like, 10 seconds.

588
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,030
Hey. I'm sorry about the Summer thing.

589
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,634
You know how excited I get
turning people on to comics.

590
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,234
I know how excited you get
turning Summer on, yeah.

591
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,674
Okay. That's not fair.

592
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,559
- I thought we were all friends.
- No. She's your friend.

593
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,792
I am your girlfriend. There's a difference.
Or there should be.

594
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,311
Hey! Food's here.

595
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,869
- Where you going?
- I think Marissa's in trouble.

596
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,792
- Give me the keys.
- I have to go, okay?

597
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,188
Give me the keys!

598
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,035
- You said I could come to you for help.
- Give me the keys!

599
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,278
I'll drive.

600
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,516
I'm sorry, okay? I'm so sorry.

601
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,750
I heard you on the phone,
and I didn't know what to do.

602
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,354
That's okay. So why don't you
just put the gun down.

603
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,471
- We can talk about it.
- No, you'll leave.

604
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,313
- Oliver. I have to go some time.
- What? To him?

605
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,674
To him, right?

606
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,592
- What about me?
- You and I are friends.

607
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,149
- We will always be friends.
- Friends?!

608
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,515
Friends, Marissa?! I'm in love with you!

609
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,558
How could you not know that?
I've always been.

610
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,433
You're the one who gets me.
The only one who gets me.

611
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,229
You're the only thing
in my life that I love.

612
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,755
Then why would you want to hurt me?

613
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,593
I don't. I never would.

614
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,431
This isn't for you. It's for me.

615
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,634
Because if you leave,
I'll have nothing else to live for.

616
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,797
So you have to promise me
you will not leave.

617
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,710
There's no answer.
They're not picking up.

618
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,633
Excuse me. My name's Sandy Cohen.
We got an emergency call...

619
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,633
...from the penthouse 20 minutes ago,
and now no one's answering.

620
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,711
Is there any chance you could let us in?

621
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,519
I'm sorry. Without permission,
we're really not able to.

622
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,434
Please, we have a friend up there
in trouble. If you could just... Wait.

623
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,874
Wait. You're Natalie?

624
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,199
Natalie Bishop?

625
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,151
Are you a friend of Oliver's?

626
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,190
Oliver, you there? It's Natalie.

627
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,794
- Oliver, I'm coming in.
- No, no. That's okay.

628
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,315
I'm fine. I just got out of the shower.

629
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,357
Oliver, please.

630
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,152
I guess he's fine.

631
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,311
Well, thanks for checking.

632
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,913
We'll go.

633
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,469
No, no. Marissa?

634
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,634
Marissa!

635
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,758
All right. Let's go.

636
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,148
Ryan, he's got a gun!

637
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,278
- Let's go.
- Why did you do that?

638
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,998
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

639
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,720
Please just put the gun away
and let them in.

640
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,871
- Sir, don't move!
- Put the gun down.

641
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,268
Or what? You're gonna shoot me?

642
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,071
- Let me save you the trouble.
- Come on, son.

643
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,959
- You don't want to do that.
- Put the gun down. Now.

644
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,392
- I'm sorry.
- Oliver, put the gun down, man.

645
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,915
Why, man? I'm doing you a favor.

646
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,514
Why would you want to do that?
You hate me.

647
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,153
That's right, you do this,
you won't hurt me.

648
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,880
You'll hurt Marissa,
the one person that cares about you.

649
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,110
And I know you don't want to do that.

650
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,992
Oliver, put the gun down, man.

651
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,516
You don't know anything about me, man.

652
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,394
I know what it's like
to be abandoned by your parents...

653
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,836
...your friends...

654
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,919
...to have no one in your life
who believes in you.

655
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,314
But you put the gun down,
you get a second chance.

656
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,198
That's it. Just put it down.

657
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,995
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

658
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,834
Marissa's okay. Her mom's got her.

659
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,834
And the police are taking Oliver
to the hospital.

660
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,512
I'm gonna clean up the pool house
before they get here.

661
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,157
I should give Summer a call.

662
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,311
What? Why?

663
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,552
- To let her know Marissa's okay.
- She doesn't know Marissa's not okay.

664
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,188
- Don't you think she'd want to know?
- You know what?

665
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,631
- Call her. I'm leaving.
- Anna, wait.

666
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,756
Just wait.
This huge thing just happened.

667
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,275
And the first thing you do
is decide to call Summer?

668
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,751
Come on, Seth.

669
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,434
Look...

670
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,316
...I think you're a great guy.

671
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,393
But I'm not gonna stand here and pretend
like I'm your girlfriend when I'm not.

672
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,317
At least not anymore.

673
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,792
I'll see you in school.

674
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,519
Hi.

675
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,113
I was wondering where my copy
of <i>Kavalier and Klay</i> went.

676
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,477
You gave it to me. You said I couldn't
be your friend until I read it.

677
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,039
And have you?

678
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,031
I've been a little distracted.

679
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,112
Well, it's a good story, Ryan.

680
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,317
It's the tale of two young men
who couldn't be more different...

681
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,155
...but they learn to overcome
their differences.

682
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,595
They team up and essentially...

683
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,797
...become brothers,
not unlike you and me.

684
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,038
Except that I blew it.

685
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,080
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

686
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,953
Ever since the day you got here,
you have totally had my back.

687
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:43,752
And I promise you, from now on,
I will never fail you again.

688
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,478
I'm so sorry.

689
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,318
Do you want to tell me
about your night?

690
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,758
Or, since I already heard about it,
could we skip to my breakup with Anna?

691
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,399
Really? Anna broke up with you?

692
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,630
Why would you just assume
Anna broke up with me?

693
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,309
- Seth, come on.
- What does that mean?

694
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,993
What, she didn't break up with you?

695
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,355
She did. But you're supposed
to have my back here.

696
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,432
So the three of us...
