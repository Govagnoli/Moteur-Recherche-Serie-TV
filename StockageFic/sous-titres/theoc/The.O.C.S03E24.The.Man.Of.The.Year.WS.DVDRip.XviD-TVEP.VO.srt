1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,720
<i>- Previously on</i> The O. C:
- There are rumors floating around...

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,950
...about certain improprieties
concerning Griffin and you.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,758
They're gonna call
for a criminal investigation.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,478
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,358
I am not gonna use my alcoholism...

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,953
...as blackmail to save our marriage.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,235
- Are you smoking pot?
- You want some?

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,470
It helps take the edge off,
and I could tell you could use it.

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,598
Seth's napkin confession,
detailing all his lies and deceptions.

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,830
He told me that if he screwed up,
I could show this to his parents.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,116
I promised I'd never lie again
when I gave you that letter.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,309
Oh, my God, the letter.

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,311
Did you think you were gonna
just dress up your bad boy...

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,277
...so your friends
can see how cool you are?

15
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,795
The Ryan I knew would've gotten in
a fight with that guy back at the prom.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,513
The money is gone.
I had the money in my purse.

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,159
I had $5000 in my purse.

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,719
We get some help over here?

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,391
- He get hit with a baseball bat?
- No, no.

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,630
- How long has he been unconscious?
- I got here as soon as I could.

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,439
Do you know them?

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,275
The guys who did this.
You know who they are?

23
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,993
I got jumped.

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,998
Didn't see them.

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,790
Look, I'm okay.

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,349
Glad you're alive,
but we still gotta check you out.

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,318
Police will question you too.

28
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,272
Yeah, okay.

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,351
Meet me at my place tomorrow.
This ain't over.

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,912
- Where's your friend?
- He's not my friend.

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,191
Kaitlin?

32
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,510
- <i>Hey, sis.</i>
- Hey.

33
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,999
You just calling to say hi?

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,111
Totally. So how's your life?

35
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,919
How's Ryan, what did you do last night,
give me the deets.

36
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,875
Well, Ryan and I broke up
and my prom date got with another girl.

37
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,638
Oh, really? That's great.

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,677
I'm actually calling to ask you a favor.

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,711
Your friend Megan
needs another abortion?

40
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,310
I wish. But actually,
my school sent Mom a letter...

41
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,232
...and I need you to get it for me.

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,789
And by "get" do you mean
keep it from her?

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,389
Look, I'm totally all over this situation.

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,516
I just need a little bit more time.

45
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,598
- Oh, Kaitlin.
- Look, Marissa, I'm begging you.

46
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,797
If you have one sisterly bone
in your body, you'll do this for me.

47
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,069
Please.

48
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,198
I'll see if it's there.
But you have to promise to tell me why.

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,635
- Oh, thank you. I love you.
- Okay. I love you...

50
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,393
...too.

51
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,111
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing?

52
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,278
Nothing much. How about you?

53
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,518
Just got off the phone with the guy.

54
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,877
The work guy. How did that go?

55
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,356
Oh, not well. It's kind of hard
for a 28-year-old to understand prom.

56
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,511
I get that.

57
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,194
But you...
You don't regret going, do you?

58
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,918
<i>No, not at all. I had fun.</i>

59
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,759
And after you left,
things got interesting in the limo...

60
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,751
<i>... with Taylor, and the dates, and...</i>

61
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,388
I don't know what
the Korean word for threesome is...

62
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,357
...but I'm pretty sure it was used.

63
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,830
- Ryan?
- Yup?

64
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,474
That thing that you had to
take care of last night...

65
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,439
It's taken care of.

66
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,876
Okay. Do you wanna hang out today?

67
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,355
I have to do something.
I'm not sure for how long.

68
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,950
Well, how about later? For dinner?

69
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,429
- I could bring over takeout.
- That sounds good.

70
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,312
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

71
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,359
Hey, man.
Today's a good day for me, Ryan.

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,080
I finally told the truth
about not getting into Brown...

73
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,630
...and things are great. Life is
so much better when you're honest.

74
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,110
You just mean what you say,
you say what you mean. I feel like you.

75
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,192
Now that you're on a roll,
you gonna tell Sandy and Kirsten too?

76
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,914
I don't think so.
I'm gonna wait a little bit on that.

77
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,192
It'll go down easier with an
acceptance letter to RISD in my hand.

78
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,952
- What if they find out?
- They won't.

79
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,798
Things are finally good with Summer.

80
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,235
Can't this family have one weekend
without crisis?

81
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,071
Hey, Sum.

82
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,073
How are you?

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,870
I wish I could pluck out my eyeballs...

84
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,190
...and rinse them
in a tall glass of ice water.

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,550
Yeah, that's a hangover.

86
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,676
You were pretty wasted last night.

87
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,077
I was, wasn't I?

88
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,913
I don't even remember getting home.

89
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,953
I woke up this morning
and my ears were ringing...

90
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,396
...and then I realized
it was your phone.

91
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,633
Kaitlin was calling me because there's a
letter from school she wants me to grab.

92
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,155
- Something...
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. The letter.

93
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,873
What? How do you know what it is?

94
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,675
No, no. Cohen's confession.
I left it in an envelope on Sandy's desk.

95
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,592
Oh, so call Seth. Tell him to grab it.

96
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,990
I can't. Things are finally normal
between us.

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,718
Once he realizes what I did...

98
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,598
I gotta go!

99
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,109
Oh, my God. Nausea tsunami.

100
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,950
Well, it's a little unexpected.

101
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,476
But l... This hospital project
has been...

102
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,111
It's been complicated.

103
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,353
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

104
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,511
I look forward to tomorrow night.

105
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,954
Thank you.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,433
Well...

107
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,270
You're not gonna believe this.

108
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,476
I am <i>Riviera</i> magazine's
"Man of The Year."

109
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,554
Try not to faint.

110
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,508
Sorry. It's just, given
everything that's happened...

111
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,270
They're calling the hospital phase one
of Orange County's "renaissance."

112
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,228
It could be a model for responsible
development for the entire country.

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,913
Responsible development?

114
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,230
Sandy, the only thing
it's responsible for...

115
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,631
...is a lot of sleepless nights
and Matt Ramsey's black eye.

116
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,512
My father was "Man of the Year."

117
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,154
The irony's not lost on me. Believe me.

118
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,880
But this could mean
that maybe the dark days are over.

119
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,031
That something good
is coming from all this.

120
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,719
I'd like to think so.

121
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,553
- But I honestly doubt it.
- I wasn't expecting a blessing.

122
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,197
But until we have proof to the contrary,
let's try to be optimistic.

123
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,837
- Hey.
- Why don't you say good morning...

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,558
...to Newport's Man of the Year.

125
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,514
It was only a matter of time before
this town recognized my contribution.

126
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,597
Have to be a man first.
Congratulations.

127
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,678
Thank you. Party tomorrow night.
Everybody's gotta dress up...

128
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,159
...and represent.

129
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,959
Just think, I couldn't get you
to wear a tie at cotillion.

130
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,038
College letters, senior prom.
This family's on a streak.

131
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,434
Let's try to enjoy it.

132
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,477
- I gotta go.
- Me too.

133
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,674
You excited?

134
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,191
It'll be good for your father's career.

135
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,237
Oh, my God, Mr. C.
You totally scared me.

136
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,352
Sometimes I scare myself, Summer.
Seth's in the kitchen.

137
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,994
- I'll just go right in.
- All right.

138
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,359
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

139
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,154
- Looking for stamps.
- Are you mailing a letter?

140
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,238
Not without stamps.
Let's go make out upstairs.

141
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,115
Hey. Is everything okay?
You sounded weird on the phone.

142
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,191
Can you give that to Taylor?

143
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,634
What, her after-party money?

144
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,193
It was stolen at the prom.

145
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,073
Kevin?

146
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,789
I can't believe he stole that.

147
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,155
- I should go over there and kick his...
- No, no.

148
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,878
We got the money, so forget it.

149
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,796
And I don't really wanna
talk about it...

150
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,996
...but if you could just give it
to Taylor...

151
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,151
...that would be good.
- Yeah.

152
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,194
You can count on me.

153
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,713
I need to focus on other stuff.

154
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,834
I was gonna take a road trip
this weekend.

155
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,793
So maybe I should just go home
and pack.

156
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,917
Can I buy you breakfast?

157
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,389
Sure.

158
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,755
Where was your dad
going this morning?

159
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,873
You're thinking about my dad?

160
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,590
He had his briefcase with him.
Does he keep important papers in there?

161
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,512
You're turning me on.

162
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,594
I'm sorry. Cohen,
there's something I need to tell you.

163
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,189
- You're using me to get to my father?
- It's serious.

164
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,157
So is this. We just got back together.

165
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,072
The window for a make-up is closing...

166
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,629
...unless you wanna break up again.
- Definitely not.

167
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,389
Okay. So, what did you
have to tell me?

168
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,992
I wanna be on top this time.

169
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,912
But you're always on top.

170
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,394
Of course we'll be there.

171
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,357
Hey, it's something to celebrate.

172
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,750
Okay. Bye, Kiks.

173
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,873
- Hey. Good news?
- Yes.

174
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,032
Sandy Cohen has just been named
Newport's Man of the Year.

175
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,634
There's a party tomorrow night
at the yacht club.

176
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,472
Well, that ought to be interesting.

177
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,148
- What do you mean?
- Well, Sandy's being investigated.

178
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,990
They're filing charges against Henry
Griffin, and Sandy's working with him.

179
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,555
I mean, Sandy's obviously
very involved with the hospital...

180
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,359
...but I can't imagine him
doing anything unethical.

181
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,757
I mean, he can be self-righteous,
pompous and annoying...

182
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,393
...but Sandy is very moral.

183
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,996
Well, we'll find out. I'm sitting down
with the district attorney tomorrow.

184
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,232
- So we have to warn Sandy.
- I already did.

185
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,959
Then why doesn't Kirsten know?

186
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,277
How you doing?

187
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,591
Seven stitches,
couple of broken ribs... I'll live.

188
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,752
I'm glad. I didn't mean to...

189
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,793
Well, not that bad, anyway.

190
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,549
It's not like I didn't ask for it.

191
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,509
So the money's returned, you got
your stitches, and we're good, right?

192
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,195
Not quite. I need some help.

193
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,191
I'm supposed to pick something up.

194
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,749
- No, no, no.
- Just be my lookout.

195
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,480
- Drive, wait in the car...
- Whatever you're into, drugs...

196
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,108
- It's none of your business.
- I don't want it to be.

197
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,748
Right. Because you got
the good life now?

198
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,117
Graduation, college...

199
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,397
You know, all that changes
when you're charged with assault.

200
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,194
Tell the cops about me,
I'll tell them about the money.

201
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,358
Money. What money?

202
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,632
- I don't see any money.
- Nobody's gonna believe you.

203
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,429
I don't care if they do.
Because I got nothing to lose...

204
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,112
...and you got everything.
That's why you're a little bitch.

205
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,438
And that's why you're helping me out
tomorrow night.

206
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,238
No, I can't tomorrow night. Sandy's
Man of the Year. It's a big party.

207
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,039
Then I guess they'll be cuffing you
in your suit.

208
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,034
Look, Daddy, you can't do this to
yourself every time you get the ratings.

209
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,237
It's my dad. You know <i>The Valley?</i>
It's his show.

210
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,115
What do you expect when you've got
the same love triangle for three years?

211
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,510
- Who are you?
- Oh, Marissa. Kaitlin's sister.

212
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,628
Hey, bitch, your sister's here.

213
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,756
Nice to meet you. I'm Hadley.

214
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,673
Dad, I thought I told you
to stay off the message boards.

215
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,799
- Marissa, what are you doing here?
- Waiting for you to explain this.

216
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,197
Thanks for coming by, Kiks.

217
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,954
I didn't wanna talk to you
about this on the phone.

218
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,475
No, of course. No problem.
What's going on?

219
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,676
Sit down.

220
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,279
It's Sandy.
He's being investigated by the DA.

221
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,992
- Let me guess, the hospital.
- Yeah.

222
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,636
Neil is meeting with the DA.
It seems serious. I'm so sorry, Kirsten.

223
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,439
- I just thought you should know.
- No, of course.

224
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,672
With Sandy being Man of the Year,
it'll be in all the papers.

225
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,912
Speaking as someone who's managed
more than her share of scandal...

226
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,150
...you need to contain this ASAP.

227
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,154
Julie, I appreciate the heads up.

228
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,276
Sandy's gonna take this really hard.

229
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,196
Sandy knows.
Neil told him at dinner last night.

230
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,790
So your mom has the baby?

231
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,558
The nanny.

232
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,157
Growing up, stealing our brothers'
empties to buy Sour Patch Kids...

233
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,151
...you didn't imagine me
to have a nanny?

234
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,358
- You've come a long way, is all.
- So have you.

235
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,236
Graduating on Monday,
and Berkeley in the fall.

236
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,840
So last night,
after you left me with Taylor...

237
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,353
Just don't, okay?

238
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,592
Only one thing could've done that
to your hand. Another guy's face.

239
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,512
That kid stole the money...

240
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,432
...and you went to fight him.

241
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,550
Go ahead. Answer it.

242
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,873
Hey. No.
No, no, I cannot right now, okay?

243
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,508
Look, give me a couple hours at least.

244
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,398
Should've told him you'd be there.

245
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,394
Theresa, look, there's things
that I can't tell the Cohens...

246
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,393
...or Seth because
they wouldn't understand. But you?

247
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,028
- My life has totally changed.
- So has mine.

248
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,272
No, there are guys that don't get
into fights. Not ever, not any.

249
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,556
Oh, like the guy at work?

250
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,109
Look, I have a child
to think about now. Okay?

251
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,714
I cannot be with someone
like my brother, or yours.

252
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,394
- I'm not like him.
- Maybe on your good days you're not.

253
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,949
But right now,
my life isn't built for the bad ones.

254
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,278
I will always love you, Ryan.

255
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,635
Keep safe.

256
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,599
You walked into the kitchen
and asked me to be optimistic.

257
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,275
They can't have much of a case,
not against Griffin and not against me.

258
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,876
I'm hoping it'll go away. Maybe
the Man of the Year thing will help.

259
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,318
Well, it's not. Neil Roberts is meeting
with the district attorney tomorrow.

260
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,035
Well, I'll talk to Greg Hodes.
He'll tell me what's going on.

261
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,312
Honey, I promise you
I'll do everything in my power...

262
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,232
...not to let this land on the family.

263
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,157
It already has.

264
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,356
His name is Trevor Knightley.
He's the captain of the lacrosse team.

265
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,351
Yeah, those girls are like his groupies.

266
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,118
Lacrosstitutes.

267
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,035
He's a total perv,
and really into Adderall.

268
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,998
So, what's he got against you?
Or should I even ask?

269
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,709
He gave me a personal invitation
to a lipstick party, and I declined.

270
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,510
Obvie. Lipstick parties are for pervs
and skanks. So heinous.

271
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,831
Lipstick parties and Adderall.
I'm sensing a generation gap.

272
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,871
Next he was telling
the headmistress...

273
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,270
...he saw me taking the crest
above her office.

274
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,670
Well, it sounds like
it's his word against yours.

275
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,150
Oh, obvie.
But he totally hides his evilness.

276
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,198
Straight A's, varsity athlete.

277
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,191
And Kaitlin's, well...

278
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,635
- Not exactly the perfect student.
- You don't say.

279
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,679
Look, Marissa, this is my third strike,
and I don't feel like getting kicked out.

280
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,475
I know it may not be
as bad as shooting somebody...

281
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,551
...but I'm pretty sure
Mom would freak out.

282
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,638
And I really don't feel like
getting locked up during summer.

283
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,553
Obvie. I get so horny
in the summertime.

284
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,994
Honey, you're always horny.

285
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,559
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

286
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,278
Okay. Both of you shut up.

287
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,671
- What's the deal with this crest?
- I'm pretty sure it's in his room.

288
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,479
But there's no way
that he or his army of probably gay...

289
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,950
...and totally-in-Iove-with-him homeboys
would let me in there.

290
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,952
Well, I'm not usually one
to come up with the plan...

291
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,076
...but do you have one of those skirts?

292
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,278
- Hi.
- Hey.

293
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,238
This is Ryan. He's helping me.

294
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,192
I'll leave the door unlocked
when I finish work. It'll be inside.

295
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,078
Thank you.

296
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,189
- Good luck, man.
- All right, man.

297
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,318
That's the address.
Need it for the pickup.

298
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,429
- This is my neighborhood.
- That's why you're driving.

299
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,198
Mom, I'm gonna go get
something to eat with Summer.

300
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,598
Are you decent? If I come in,
am I inviting years of therapy?

301
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,437
Sorry.

302
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,872
Mom?

303
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,189
There you are. You...
Oh, sorry.

304
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,875
Cohen, is your mom sick
or something?

305
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,271
Yeah, she is. I'm gonna have to stay
and take care of her.

306
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,155
Oh. Okay, well, then why don't I just
go pick us up food...

307
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,356
...and bring it back.
Your mom need anything?

308
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,592
Just peace and quiet.
We're gonna have to rain-check dinner.

309
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,354
- Oh. Cohen, you're acting really weird.
- I feel weird.

310
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,431
Maybe whatever my mom has
is contagious...

311
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,479
...and I'd hate for you to catch it
and feel weird too. You know?

312
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,756
Okay.

313
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,230
- Hi. Are you Trevor?
- Yeah.

314
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,868
I'm Marissa,
the new foreign exchange student.

315
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,112
- I just got here from London.
- I love London.

316
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,758
Well, I was hoping you could give me
a tour, starting with your dorm room.

317
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,318
Sounds good. But I did my junior year
abroad at Oxford.

318
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,471
I don't buy that phony English accent.

319
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,389
- Fine. I'm a stripper for your birthday.
- My birthday's not for six months.

320
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,750
Do you wanna see me
take my clothes off or not?

321
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,638
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

322
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,199
Sure.

323
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,913
Oh, you mean right now.

324
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,036
Yeah. Well, you know,
it's just kind of...

325
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,838
Well, can it wait until after...

326
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,197
...because I'm on my way
to a meeting with my group.

327
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,713
Yeah, how's that going?

328
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,713
Well, you know what they say.
One day at a time.

329
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,916
That's why you have meetings.

330
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,189
Greg Hodes, my favorite DA.

331
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,833
Now this is a cozy spot.

332
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,600
Lighting's more flattering
than an interrogation room.

333
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,236
No one's being interrogated.
Dr. Roberts and I are just gonna talk.

334
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,792
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

335
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,911
The courtroom misses Sandy Cohen.

336
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,958
Not as much as he misses
the courtroom. Believe me.

337
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,476
We've known each other
a long time, Hodes.

338
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,631
What am I dealing with here?

339
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,831
The case against Griffin's not strong.

340
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,309
Everyone's got stories,
but not hard evidence.

341
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,995
- And where do I fit in the picture?
- You're in bed with him on that hospital.

342
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,596
Until I have proof otherwise,
his improprieties are yours too.

343
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,835
Well, what if you had receipts,
e-mails, an eyewitness?

344
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,951
That would help a lot.

345
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,511
For my cooperation, can you let the
Newport Group finish the hospital?

346
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,989
Griffin goes down, so does the hospital.
No way around that.

347
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,194
So I could keep my mouth shut
and hope you lose...

348
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,392
Or you could help bury that crook,
say goodbye to the hospital.

349
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,992
Dr. Roberts.

350
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,638
Thanks for your time.

351
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,916
I'm gonna leave you two
to your discussion.

352
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,036
- Good to see you, Neil.
- Sandy.

353
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,793
That's the house.

354
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,988
Now we just gotta wait
for him to leave.

355
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,554
- You said we were picking something up.
- Yeah, well.

356
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,994
He doesn't exactly know it.

357
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,360
- Ryan, is that you?
- Hey.

358
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,116
Just came from my tennis lesson
and I thought, "Is that the Cohens' car?"

359
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,554
- It is.
- Well...

360
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,548
...save me a dance at Sandy's party.
- Will do.

361
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,232
And bring your friend. He's hot.

362
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,192
Neighbor?

363
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,874
Yeah. Told you this was a good plan.

364
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,390
You said my dorm room.

365
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,357
Don't want people to walk in, do you?

366
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,152
- So take off your pants.
- I thought you were gonna strip for me.

367
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,793
Haven't you ever been to Vegas?

368
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,190
Boxers, or I'll give those guys
their money back.

369
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,791
Now, that would be a waste.

370
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,749
- They do this in Vegas too?
- They do everything in Vegas.

371
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,952
Okay. Now I just have to go change.

372
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,799
But you're wearing a costume.
Hey. Come back here.

373
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,479
What do you think you're doing?

374
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,757
- Did you get them? All right.
- Yeah. Let's go.

375
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,399
- Hey.
- Hi, Mr. Cohen.

376
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,755
- Is Seth around?
- No. I don't think so.

377
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,595
Is it okay if I just wait here for him?

378
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,075
Sure, make yourself at home.

379
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,038
Do you mind if I wait here with you?

380
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,717
I'm working, but suit yourself.

381
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,680
So how's Mrs. Cohen?
She feeling any better?

382
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,754
I didn't know she was sick.

383
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,593
Must have been, like, a 24-hour thing.

384
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,757
So, what's this?

385
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,429
That is a card for Seth.

386
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,149
Congratulating him on having a dad
who is Man of the Year.

387
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,318
Even though it's addressed
to Kirsten and me.

388
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,910
Okay, that is actually a really big mistake
and I would do anything to take it back.

389
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,599
"The most recent and troubling lies...

390
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,158
...include..."

391
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,230
- Oh, Summer.
- Seth gave it to me...

392
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,595
...on Valentine's Day
when we got in a fight.

393
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,479
He said if he ever screwed up again
I should give it to you.

394
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,393
- Only he didn't screw up again. I did.
- This is serious.

395
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,834
I did it out of spite.

396
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,678
He told me he wasn't going to Brown.

397
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,674
- And then I saw him there with Anna.
- He said he wasn't going to Brown?

398
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,434
Yeah, because he didn't get in,
but that was before RISD.

399
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,750
What do you mean, he didn't get in?

400
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,991
I thought he only lied
about that to me.

401
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,552
The only thing worse than relapsing...

402
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,393
...is that my husband doesn't know.

403
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,678
He's involved
in this business deal, and...

404
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,476
...it's gotten very ugly, and...

405
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,318
Well, he might even be arrested.

406
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,994
And I'm not blaming anyone.

407
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,948
I'm the only one with the power
to drink or not drink.

408
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,637
I just really need
the man I married right now.

409
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,631
I wanna talk to you.

410
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,151
Good, I wanna talk to you.

411
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,796
I love you. And I'm worried about you.

412
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,393
- Right back at you.
- You smoked pot in our home.

413
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,160
You rather I do it somewhere else,
like my college dorm?

414
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,398
That would require you
getting into college.

415
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,350
Think it's a great idea, me going
to college when Mom's drinking again?

416
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,194
What are you talking about?

417
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,078
If you paid attention to anything
other than that hospital...

418
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,038
...you'd notice Mom's
been passing out before dinner.

419
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,270
Don't talk to your father like that.

420
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,556
That would require you
to act like my father.

421
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,511
That's our guy.

422
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,518
All right, go ahead. I'll be waiting.

423
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,312
Come on, you're my cover.

424
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,989
Besides, I can't go out
with my face like this.

425
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,153
What? You're just taking a little walk
out in your neighborhood.

426
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,838
All right, I'll just be a minute.

427
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,037
You just wait right there.

428
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,558
- All right, let's go. Where is it?
- You're looking at it.

429
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,639
The car? You gotta be kidding.

430
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,917
- A hundred-and-twenty G's is no joke.
- No way. I'm not doing that.

431
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,431
Too late.

432
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,155
Let's go. Let's go, let's go!

433
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,955
- Supposed to be keys, I can't find them.
- There's a patrol car up the street.

434
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,230
I got this.

435
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,597
Hurry up, man.
They're coming, let's go.

436
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,113
- Almost.
- What are you doing?

437
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,038
Shut up.

438
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,553
- Let's go! Come on!
- Get in.

439
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,954
Don't be a little bitch.

440
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,877
Better get that to the headmistress's
office before someone sees it.

441
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,998
Oh, yeah. We will.
And thanks again. It was pretty cool.

442
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,353
Way Kaitlin talked about you...

443
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,279
...I thought you'd be wasted
and have all these problems.

444
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,038
Right. Well, I'm glad you guys
aren't gonna get in trouble.

445
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,236
- I actually kind of had fun.
- Wow.

446
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,109
I suspected as much, but it's actually
kind of nice to hear you say it out loud.

447
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,911
I think we're having a moment.

448
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,954
Oh, my God, my phone
just totally stepped on your moment.

449
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,599
I'll take it outside.

450
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,836
Hey, bitch. You never called me back,
what's up?

451
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,192
Yeah, I liked hanging out too.

452
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,312
It sucks that you're gonna go
to college next year.

453
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,513
We'll see about that.

454
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,995
Oh, well, whatever you decide,
I will miss you.

455
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,034
- And I mean it this time.
- Me too.

456
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,954
I'm sorry I'm late.

457
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,792
- I'll hurry.
- Hey, have a seat.

458
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,191
So...

459
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,395
...have you been drinking again?

460
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,757
No explanation, no judgment.

461
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,399
I just wanna know.

462
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,517
- Oh, I wish you'd talked to me.
- I tried.

463
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,030
That night you called?

464
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,349
- I wish I had known.
- Then you would have come?

465
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,909
The only thing that would
get you to talk to me...

466
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,877
...was the threat of a relapse?

467
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,679
- I hope you know that's not true.
- I don't know that.

468
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,437
Oh, Sandy, I'm sorry.

469
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,837
For everything.

470
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,468
Especially the relapse.

471
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,359
And more importantly,
for keeping it secret.

472
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,670
I'm sorry too.

473
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,074
I know you know about my drinking.

474
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,071
And I assume you know about Brown.

475
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,876
Sorry to rat you out to Dad.
It was a heat-of-the-moment thing.

476
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,519
I'm glad you did.

477
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,238
I know things have been difficult.
But we're still a family.

478
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,396
Yeah, a great family. Mom's drinking,
Dad's about to go to jail.

479
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,552
- Give the Atwoods a run for their money.
- I haven't given up.

480
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,039
Neither has your father.

481
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,749
I'm not gonna apologize to that guy.
I don't even wanna be in the same room.

482
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,239
I'm asking you to.

483
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,591
Attend his Man of the Year party?

484
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,832
That's a hypocritical way
to start the Cohen family clean slate.

485
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,754
Will you do it for me?

486
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,797
Fine.

487
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,393
But I want my own table...

488
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,677
...and my applause for his speech
will be so tepid.

489
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,115
Thank you.

490
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,837
Will you stop by the Newport Group?

491
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,072
There's a concept drawing
your father needs for his presentation.

492
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,437
I'd ask Ryan but he said he'd be late.

493
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,675
- I believe your father's gonna fix this.
- That makes one of us.

494
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,634
- Ryan.
- Hey.

495
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,189
- Where are you?
- I'm driving back from Montecito.

496
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,713
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

497
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,269
Can you...?
Can you meet me at your place?

498
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,792
Yeah, sure.

499
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,791
There's a key under the mat
by the pool.

500
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,951
Just let yourself in
and wait in my room.

501
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,759
- <i>I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>
- Thanks.

502
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,674
- Hey, Ryan...?
- It's okay, it's okay.

503
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,074
Thanks.

504
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,118
Neil, why aren't you ready
for the party?

505
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,239
- We should be leaving.
- I'm not going, darling.

506
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,118
I spent the afternoon with the DA.

507
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,556
Griffin's about to be arrested
and Sandy's future is far from certain.

508
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,915
The more reason to be there
for him and Kirsten.

509
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,953
It's a conflict of interest.

510
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,157
I might have to testify
against the man.

511
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,390
I'm sorry.
But I'm sure they'll understand.

512
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,232
Well, I don't.

513
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,038
The Cohens are like family, Neil.

514
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,191
They're about to become
the black sheep.

515
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,595
Well, I don't know about you,
but I support the people I care about.

516
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,478
I don't judge them.

517
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,278
I'll call a cab.

518
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,234
- Hello.
- Hey.

519
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,960
You have an ETA?
Your father's about to take the stage.

520
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,749
- I'll be right there.
- <i>Did you find the drawing okay?</i>

521
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,715
Okay, I'll see you soon.

522
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,717
- I'm so happy for you.
- He deserves it.

523
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,518
You're sweet to say that. Thank you.

524
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,671
Excuse me, can I borrow
my husband a moment?

525
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,717
Excuse me.

526
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,278
Isn't that Greg Hodes?

527
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,116
Oh, maybe he's here to arrest me.

528
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,034
Wouldn't be the first time somebody
left a Newport party in handcuffs.

529
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,758
I'm gonna go practice
my speech anyway.

530
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,714
- Hey. What's going on?
- I was with you tonight.

531
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,358
If anyone asks, can you say that?

532
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,794
- Ryan...
- Just yes or no.

533
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,555
- Will you do it?
- Yeah, of course.

534
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,310
- You changed your mind?
- No, you changed it.

535
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,794
You're a very passionate woman.

536
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,951
And surprisingly principled.

537
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,839
I'd like to think so.

538
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,869
If you feel so strongly about family,
how could I not wanna be part of yours?

539
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,919
Good evening, everyone. And thank you
so much for coming out tonight.

540
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,312
And thanks to <i>Riviera</i> magazine
for bestowing upon me this...

541
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,754
...this wonderful honor...

542
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,070
...that l... I cannot accept.

543
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,992
I used to think I was better.
I came from outside the bubble.

544
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,599
Thought I was fit to judge it.

545
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,796
When it came time
to run the Newport Group...

546
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,190
...I wasn't worried at all
about losing my way.

547
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,151
But I learned that despite
the wide streets and the sunny views...

548
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:15,077
...you take one wrong turn in this town,
and you can end up totally lost.

549
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,955
Thank you, Seth. Thank you, Kirsten.

550
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:27,319
This drawing is as close to fully realized
as Newport Mercy will ever be.

551
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,711
Because I'm gonna be cooperating...

552
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,952
...with the District Attorney's
investigation of Dr. Griffin...

553
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,475
...and the hospital he and I
were going to build.

554
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,029
- I'm sorry, Cohen.
- No, it's okay. It's for the best.

555
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,069
I'm truly flattered to be held
in such high esteem by this community.

556
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,719
But I'm gonna step aside...

557
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,631
...because I'm gonna pursue an honor
that is closer to my heart.

558
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,714
Father and husband of the year.

559
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,711
Thank you.

560
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,157
- That was quite a speech.
- And you ought to have quite a case.

561
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,197
I'll be in touch.

562
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,398
You were wonderful.

563
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,156
Thanks.

564
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,474
I thought it was wordy, in the middle,
but I think the end was nice.

565
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,835
Yeah?

566
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,474
Maybe I'm too late.

567
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,114
They're here for me.

568
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,670
Well, it's a good thing you were
with me all night then, right?

569
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,956
You're not asking him
any questions without me.

570
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,953
- Who are you, his lawyer?
- I'm his father.

571
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,394
- What happened?
- There was a fire at the Newport Group.

572
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,790
They think Seth did it.

573
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,871
