1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,954
<i>Previously on</i> The O. C:

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,072
- You want to be Social Chair?
- Maybe.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,918
- Don't move.
- I didn't steal anything.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,719
One month detention.
Unless you wanna give up your partner?

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,558
They're reading Caleb's will on Friday.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,196
From what you've said about your dad,
I'd bet he's planned a surprise for you.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,152
- Caleb Nichol was broke.
- Broke?

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,510
Ryan and I don't go
to Harbor anymore, but it'll be fine.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,033
At least you have each other.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,430
If you stick together,
everything will be okay.

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,711
- Deal?
- Deal.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,433
Newport Union.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,637
Orange County's answer
to public education.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,598
- The parking lot looks spacious.
- Yeah. And well-lit.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,318
You know, at night, with the lights.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,596
Plus you're on a hill.
Probably get a good breeze.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,115
That's important.
Good breeze can make the difference.

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,316
Shut up about the breeze.
You're not helping.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,438
You think the lights in the parking lot
are making her feel better?

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,592
- Guys, it's gonna be fine.
- Are you sure this is what you want?

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,193
I don't really have a choice.

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,989
Even if I hadn't got kicked out of Harbor,
my Mom can't afford private school.

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,469
Well, I told you, you can always
homeschool with me.

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,552
I know, but I really think
this is gonna be fine.

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,472
Honestly, it's nice to be somewhere...

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,473
...where everybody doesn't know
every detail about your life.

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,677
- You don't have to be always stared at.
- I could see that.

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,196
- Okay, I'm gonna go.
- All right, I'll pick you up this afternoon.

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,635
Looks like she's in the wrong place.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,556
- Where did she come from?
- Probably one of these rich girls.

31
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,995
Check out Newport Barbie.

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,599
And that was the last
they ever saw of her.

33
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,670
Here you are,
my little Social-Chair maven.

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,912
Thank you. Don't put it there.
That's the catering order for Saturday.

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,790
And that's my calculations
for the streamers.

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,350
You can put it there
on the contract for the DJ.

37
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,353
I'm sure Dr. Bootyopolis
wouldn't mind a little coffee.

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,596
You know, I always thought that
Social Chair was a ceremonial position...

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,478
...like Rose Bowl queen or president.

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,834
How did Marissa do it all?

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,399
Cohen.

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,630
Took a tour of
the boys' locker room last night.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,712
I'm surprised the entire track team
doesn't have trench foot.

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,753
So I'll see you there at 3.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,037
Okay. You sure this is detention?
It's got more of...

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,599
...a work-release feel.

47
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,991
Like I said, you give up the person
who helped you steal the tiki hut...

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,879
...and this can go easier.
On both of you.

49
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,349
Sorry. It was just me.

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,033
Three o'clock.

51
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,918
We'll start with the toilets.

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,271
- You've got to let me tell him.
- No way.

53
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,273
He's upset still because Ryan
humiliated him at the carnival.

54
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,352
This is my call. You plan the dance,
you leave the toilets to me.

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,513
- I was hoping that'd sound more heroic.
- I got it. It's okay.

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,719
Hey, there you are.

57
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,838
I just got off the phone with your tutor.
She's got a great résumé.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,638
Tutored Stallone's kids.

59
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,193
This is awkward timing, but what do you
think about me going to Newport Union?

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,590
Newport Union. With Marissa.

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,398
Private tutor's really expensive.

62
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,552
- I have been to public school.
- Ryan, Ryan...

63
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,153
She's going through a tough time.

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,151
Caleb left them nothing.
Her dad took off.

65
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,118
- Neither is your responsibility.
- Fine, why do I need a reason?

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,669
You need to focus on
getting your life back on track.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,197
You need to start thinking
about college and about SATs.

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,112
All right?

69
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,750
- All right.
- That's it, kid.

70
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,711
- Hey.
- Hey.

71
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,313
A little morning gardening?

72
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,357
Oh, I thought I'd put in
an herb garden.

73
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,118
Dr. Woodruff says we should confront
our fears. Mine is my cooking.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,750
- So is mine.
- We'll confront my cooking together.

75
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,309
If that doesn't work, I'll buy dinner.

76
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,708
I'm gonna take a shower.

77
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,558
You know,
you don't look so clean yourself.

78
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,994
- You think?
- No.

79
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,549
I ju... I just showered.

80
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,830
Did I tell you how glad
I am you're back?

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,468
Yeah. And I like hearing it.

82
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,480
- Julie Cooper-Nichol?
- Yes. May I help you?

83
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,034
This house and its contents
are being seized for repayment of debt.

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,994
You have 48 hours
to vacate the premises.

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,639
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,040
- You did not just walk into me.
- Sorry, I wasn't looking.

87
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,998
Was I supposed to just see you coming
and step aside, princess?

88
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,033
No, it's my first day
and I don't know my way around yet.

89
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,519
Fine, I'll let you go.

90
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,399
- Tell me you think you're better than me.
- What?

91
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,358
Tell me you think you're better than me
and I'll let you go.

92
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,196
- I don't.
- So now you're lying to me?

93
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,839
So you think I'm stupid too?

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,072
Hey, Heather.
You welcoming a new student?

95
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,151
I can take over if you want.

96
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,399
Whatever.

97
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,230
Thanks. I don't know why
she's got it in for me.

98
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,992
My guess is the bag...

99
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,914
...and the shoes.

100
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,631
And the Chanel necklace probably isn't
helping either, but it's just a guess.

101
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,634
Anyways, welcome to Newport Union.

102
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,155
- I'm Casey.
- Marissa Cooper.

103
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,356
You're the first nice person
I've actually met.

104
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,112
And I'm not even that nice.

105
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,274
Hey, Beth, that's supposed
to be an octagon.

106
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,193
Eight sides. Not three.

107
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,274
You need something?

108
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,197
Hi. I thought I'd see if you needed
any help with the dance.

109
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,989
No.

110
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,594
Okay, Summer, look.

111
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,239
I know I can be a pain.

112
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,836
A pain? Taylor, you staged a power play
at the Kickoff Carnival.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,389
You tattled to the dean
and got Ryan kicked out.

114
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,120
- I don't have any friends.
- Well, gee, there's a shocker.

115
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,111
I know. And it's my fault. l...

116
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,953
I don't trust people
and so I try to control them...

117
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,236
...which then drives them away...

118
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,594
...ergo, no friends.

119
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,348
- I'm working on it with my therapist.
- Don't quit.

120
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,829
But I decided that this year
was gonna be different.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,639
I thought if I was Social Chair
then people would like me...

122
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,236
...but I screwed that up as usual.

123
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,472
Okay, is this where
I feel sorry for you?

124
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,030
Okay, look.

125
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,634
I'm sure people write prose poems
in your yearbook...

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,836
...about what an incredible friend
you are.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,197
You know what I get?
"Have a nice summer."

128
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,793
But it's my senior year.

129
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,633
And I wanted more.

130
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,952
I want someone to write,
"I'm glad I finally got to know you."

131
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,951
Go show Beth what an octagon is.

132
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,551
Oh, God, she is a pinhead, isn't she?

133
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,913
Yeah, see, that's the kind of thing
I've gotta keep in check.

134
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,109
Either you're the worst thief ever
or it's your first day.

135
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,396
I can't remember which locker is mine.

136
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,949
Well, it probably isn't that one,
because that's mine.

137
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,031
- Right. Sorry.
- It's all right.

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,078
The vice principal has the assignments.
I'll walk you over there.

139
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,232
I got a lot of experience being sent
to the vice principal's office.

140
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,517
Thanks, but my boyfriend's
gonna show up.

141
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,877
- Well, you can throw your books in here.
- Thanks.

142
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,678
- I'm Marissa.
- Nice to meet you, I'm...

143
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,034
Johnny.

144
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,519
- Hey.
- Hey, Johnny.

145
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,753
What's up?

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,275
- You guys.
- Sorry.

147
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,078
I'm okay.

148
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,279
This is Casey, my girlfriend.

149
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,432
Oh, yeah, actually, we've met.
So I see you survived your first day.

150
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,109
I think I hurt something.

151
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,669
And that's Dennis.

152
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,674
Childress. Everyone calls me Chili.

153
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,714
No one calls him Chili.

154
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,518
Not if you keep telling people that.

155
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,513
I'm trying to get a nickname,
handle, hook.

156
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,148
You wanna come with us?
We're gonna get something to eat.

157
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,515
- Marissa's waiting for her boyfriend.
- Boyfriend?

158
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,274
That's gonna be a problem for me,
because I love you.

159
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,958
- I fall fast and hard.
- On a skateboard.

160
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,791
Hey, what if we just
gave you a ride home?

161
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,838
Yeah, wouldn't you rather
come tomorrow knowing a few people?

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,389
Even if one of them is Chili?

163
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,516
Hey, the nickname's sticking.

164
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,638
Come on, what do you say?

165
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,192
Yeah, okay, let me just make a call.

166
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,512
- Hey.
- It's me. I was gonna see if you'd left.

167
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,557
Some people asked me to get food
and I should try and make friends.

168
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,154
<i>But if you've already left, then...</i>

169
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,428
- Ryan?
- Go ahead. I was just getting in the car.

170
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,192
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

171
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,954
- Just call me later, okay?
- Okay.

172
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,633
Bye.

173
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,914
All right.

174
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,512
Good morning. You have a second?

175
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,989
Yeah. Sure, what's up?

176
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,709
How would you like to stay
with Summer for a few days?

177
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,196
Sure. Any reason?

178
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,793
Oh, it's such a mess.

179
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,394
I told Caleb's lawyer we were
thinking about moving.

180
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,269
He thought that meant we had a place,
so he put this house on the market.

181
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,273
- We're getting kicked out, aren't we?
- Of course not, it's just...

182
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,670
Mom, Caleb was broke.

183
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,389
It makes sense we'd have to sell
everything. You don't have to protect me.

184
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,077
Then would it be okay if you stayed
until we got back on our feet?

185
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,835
We will get back on our feet, and we'll
wear very expensive shoes when we do.

186
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,470
- I trust you.
- You do?

187
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,678
I know we've had our differences...

188
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,513
...but if there's one thing I'll say it's,
you're a survivor.

189
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,875
So if you say we'll make it,
I believe you.

190
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,828
Honey, thank you.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,752
Sure.

192
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,999
Besides, you must've saved
a lot of money over the years, right?

193
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,593
Of course.

194
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,990
- Hello.
- Hi.

195
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,037
- Kirsten Cohen?
- Yeah.

196
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,033
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

197
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,948
Thanks for letting me stay with you
on such late notice.

198
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,680
You know, I always wanted a sister.

199
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,434
Cohen got Ryan as a brother,
it makes sense that I get you.

200
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,715
Oh, God, Ryan.

201
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,836
I'm supposed to be having
breakfast with him.

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,831
I totally forgot.

203
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,874
- Hey.
- I am a terrible girlfriend.

204
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,548
- No.
- Hey. This is my top.

205
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,153
I knew you had it.

206
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,034
- Are you with Summer?
- Yeah.

207
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,475
- My mom and I are getting kicked out.
- What?

208
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,076
We found out this morning, which is why
I had to pack and move into Summer's.

209
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,196
I just totally forgot about breakfast.

210
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,511
It's fine. With everything you're going
through, don't worry about me.

211
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,636
Just...

212
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,996
I don't know,
I'll pick you up this afternoon.

213
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,798
Okay. Thanks.

214
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,270
What else of mine
do you have in here?

215
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,671
- Hello.
- Kirsten, it's Charlotte.

216
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,637
Oh, hey, Charlotte. How are you?

217
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,349
I'm sitting here staring at the lake and
wishing my friend was here to share it.

218
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,596
- The flowers were beautiful, thank you.
- <i>Oh, I'm glad you like them.</i>

219
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,228
I'm gonna be in the area,
I was hoping we could meet.

220
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,799
Lunch or coffee?

221
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,473
<i>Oh, lunch sounds great.</i>

222
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,074
Great. How about
the Newport Bay Yacht Club?

223
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,629
Sounds great. I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's say 1:00?

224
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,677
Perfect. Bye.

225
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,278
Finally.

226
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,832
She better come through
with that money.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,718
Trust me, she will.

228
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,077
- And she loved her flowers.
- Right.

229
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,348
I really don't have time to tutor you
right now at the moment, but...

230
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,750
- Summer.
- Wait, just a second.

231
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,956
I was up all night going over
the dance budget.

232
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,997
I don't know how the school
expects us to...

233
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,196
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

234
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,512
Okay, if I tell you this,
you did not hear it from me, okay?

235
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,033
I mean, this has to be secret.

236
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,715
I'm talking Deep Throat before he went
public to cash in on the fat book deal.

237
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,233
What are you talking about?

238
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,955
I was walking by the teacher's lounge,
and I heard Dean Hess telling Dr. Kim...

239
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,475
...that he knew Seth hadn't
stolen the tiki hut alone.

240
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,312
Which, by the way, I forgive him for.

241
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,833
- Taylor.
- Okay.

242
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,596
But if Seth didn't tell him by the end
of the day who the other person was...

243
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,034
...he was gonna suspend him.

244
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,430
- Oh, my God. Are you serious?
- What's the matter?

245
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,513
Oh, hey.

246
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,309
Taylor was just telling me...

247
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,148
...that Dr. Bootyopolis was found
on a pedophile website.

248
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,629
We've got to replace him.
Taylor, you know, good job.

249
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,472
Yeah, no problem. I'll see you later.

250
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,517
- Okay.
- Okay.

251
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,916
I still can't believe
you're letting her help.

252
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,839
You know, she's not so bad.

253
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,433
A pedophile website?

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,911
What was she doing on it?

255
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,914
Just give me a few minutes.
The quiche is almost ready.

256
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,957
The quiche? For lunch?

257
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,870
I could get used to this.

258
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,870
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

259
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,916
Listen, I put this off
as long as possible...

260
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,868
...but we really have to make a decision
about the Newport Group.

261
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,359
Okay.

262
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,794
What's the situation?

263
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,951
I've done my best
to stay on top of things...

264
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,715
...but Caleb's financial troubles
have left a huge hole in the company.

265
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,075
Pretty soon all that will be left
is the name.

266
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,310
How long before we default
on our loans?

267
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,836
Six weeks. It's not too late
to rescue it, if that's what you want.

268
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,037
We could sell off some assets,
restructure the debt.

269
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,919
- Option two?
- Sell everything and walk away.

270
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,559
I'm behind you either way.

271
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,837
And just so you know,
this family is fine financially.

272
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,878
So don't make this decision
thinking that we need your income.

273
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,268
We don't.

274
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,516
It's time to let it go.

275
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,710
I'll handle everything.

276
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,078
Come in.

277
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,158
Dean Hess?

278
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,438
Hi.

279
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,032
Look, I...

280
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,630
I helped Seth steal that tiki hut.
Or borrow it. Whatever.

281
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,190
- I had a feeling you helped out.
- Helped out? Please, I did all of the work.

282
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,511
Old noodle-arms, he couldn't even lift
a palm-tree leaf without...

283
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,436
Anyway, that's the truth.

284
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,036
You know, Summer,
with this on your record...

285
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,476
...I can't very well allow you
to remain as Social Chair.

286
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,669
Wait, look, please,
I really have grown to love that job.

287
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,991
Wait a second,
who would replace me?

288
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,593
Taylor?

289
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,758
Well, Taylor is pretty qualified
for the position.

290
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,558
I'll let her know you suggested her.

291
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,554
I'm such an idiot.

292
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,951
You were never gonna suspend Seth,
were you?

293
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,519
You're late for class, Summer.

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,877
- Sandy.
- Julie.

295
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,190
Have a seat. What can I do for you?

296
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,069
Oh, it's such a small thing,
really, just...

297
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,312
What exactly are the rules
about loans to company officers?

298
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,710
In this case, former officers?

299
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,552
You want a loan
from the Newport Group.

300
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,679
I could pay it back within a year, tops.
Two, outside.

301
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,991
Well, first off, you can't take
personal loans from a company.

302
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,513
People go to jail for that.

303
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,073
Secondly, in a few weeks, there isn't
gonna be a Newport Group anymore.

304
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,393
- What?
- Kirsten's not coming back to work...

305
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,028
...so we're gonna
liquidate the company.

306
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,871
It's... It's...

307
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,315
It's all really ending.

308
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,952
Hey, forgive me for asking...

309
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,760
...but where do you stand?
Kirsten and I could lend you...

310
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,478
No, no.

311
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,556
The loan was just for convenience,
to put a down payment on a house.

312
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,950
I found this really great place
on the beach.

313
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,839
I'll just sell some stock, you know.
I have too much anyway.

314
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,519
You get back to your liquidating.

315
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,513
Please, tell Kirsten I'll stop by soon,
I promise.

316
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,272
Sure.

317
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,314
- Summer.
- No.

318
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,517
So you know, you and your friend,
the dean, may have won this round...

319
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,352
...but the war is not over.

320
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,510
Well, unless you have an exit strategy,
don't even get out of the boat.

321
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,432
I am a human quagmire.

322
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,956
What's a quagmire?

323
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,356
Hello? Anyone?

324
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,794
Quagmire?

325
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,119
- and she said just meet her here.
I don't know if I...

326
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,351
You thinking of going?

327
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,110
- I don't know. Does it have a theme?
- Theme?

328
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,397
Yeah, like "Winter Wonderland"
or "Under the Sea."

329
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,398
I think the theme is...

330
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,950
...school gym, bag of pretzels
and Chili spikes the punch.

331
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,396
- Pretty much the same theme every year.
- I don't think I'll be going then.

332
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,838
Not because it doesn't have a theme.

333
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,390
No, look, I know I made it sound
like not much fun...

334
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,869
...because it isn't,
but you should go, really.

335
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,952
Dennis and Casey and I are going.
We'll all not have fun together.

336
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,232
Excuse me.

337
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,960
Hey, I just wanted to apologize
about yesterday.

338
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,953
- l... I was acting like a jerk.
- Don't worry about it.

339
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,317
So then you're not gonna shoot me?

340
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,634
Isn't that why you got kicked out
of that private school?

341
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,438
Because you shot someone?

342
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,231
Marissa.

343
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,233
Don't listen to her.

344
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,391
Why? She's right.

345
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,677
That's why I'm here,
and now everyone's gonna know.

346
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,392
Yeah, well, everyone already
kind of knew.

347
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,313
I just thought if I came here,
then maybe I'd get a second chance.

348
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,114
Look, I saw the news.

349
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,840
I know you did what you had to do.

350
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,638
They said you saved
someone's life that night.

351
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,678
Not a lot of people would do that.

352
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,194
Come on, let's go find Casey.

353
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,430
- What's going on?
- Ryan.

354
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,511
Hey. What's wrong?
What did you do to her?

355
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,875
Nothing. I'm fine.

356
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,792
- This is my...
- Boyfriend, I'm guessing.

357
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,798
Okay. I'll see you guys later.

358
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,190
- Johnny.
- It's cool.

359
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,998
He was just trying to be nice.

360
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,429
- Hey.
- Hey.

361
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,116
<i>Dead or Alive's</i> playing at the Lido.
You, me, yakuza bloodbath. We're there.

362
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,833
Yeah, I can't.

363
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,639
Miss Reed really loaded me up
with a lot of work, so...

364
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,712
Not buying it. Looks like we got
an emotional thing going on.

365
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,075
All right. Come on, buddy, get ready.

366
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,470
A little old-fashioned Seth-Ryan time.

367
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,349
All right, fine. So yesterday
I went to pick up Marissa at school...

368
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,158
Marissa. Didn't see that one coming.

369
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,389
- Continue.
- Thanks.

370
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,711
- and I thought I saw this guy...

371
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,632
I misjudged the situation.

372
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,598
And I overreacted...

373
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,038
...and I might have
maybe embarrassed her.

374
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,994
I embarrassed her.

375
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,152
Now you're tearing yourself apart...

376
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,788
...wondering if you've damaged
her standing at school...

377
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,598
...but also your relationship.

378
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,354
- More or less.
- Well, that is a pickle.

379
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,038
- That's it? No advice?
- What advice?

380
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,953
Call her. Apologize.
It's not rocket science.

381
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,714
Man, you homeschool kids
are pathetic.

382
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,878
- Why aren't you going to the dance?
- Gee, I don't know.

383
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,635
Because I went from being the girl no one
knows to the girl who shot someone.

384
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,836
You said the surfer guy
was cool about it.

385
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,831
- Yeah, he was. But...
- But nothing.

386
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,117
- Call and tell him that you're gonna go.
- Well, what about Ryan?

387
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,597
He looked like
he wanted to kill Johnny.

388
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,228
- And it's not like I'd go without him.
- You have to.

389
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,874
Harsh, I know.

390
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,508
But you're at a new school,
and there is a dance.

391
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,352
It's like Social Survival 101.

392
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,436
- It's Ryan.
- Okay, time to go Mystic.

393
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,477
I need to even out.

394
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,033
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

395
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,235
Good.

396
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,437
Good. Listen, about yesterday...

397
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,989
It was my fault.
You know, I was just upset.

398
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,513
Your reaction was normal.

399
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,352
Okay.

400
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,235
So you wanna go to the movies
later tonight?

401
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,597
I could beat up the usher,
get us some free Milk Duds.

402
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,668
Actually, I was thinking
of doing my homework.

403
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,274
It's the first week
and I wanna make a good impression.

404
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,278
Sure.

405
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,071
But I'll probably need a break,
so we'll talk later, okay?

406
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,674
Yeah. Yeah, sounds good.

407
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,394
- Hey, you.
- Oh, hey.

408
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,551
- It's great to see you.
- Oh, you too.

409
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,234
- You look amazing.
- Oh, thank you. So do you.

410
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,834
- It was all that time at my dad's.
- Such a wonderful place.

411
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,117
How lucky were we? I mean,
to be able to go someplace so peaceful.

412
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,111
It's a shame everyone can't stay there.

413
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,794
Well, what if there was a place,
like the lake house...

414
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,111
...where women could go
between rehab and the real world.

415
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,872
That would be amazing.

416
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,996
That's what investor friends
of mine thought.

417
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,673
I've pitched the idea to people.

418
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,115
I started looking at properties.
I'm thinking Sedona.

419
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,556
And then I realized,
"Kirsten has to be a part of this."

420
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,278
- You mean invest?
- It would just be a couple million to start.

421
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,752
I'll assume most of the risk and you'd
get it all back within the first few years.

422
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,673
Well, I'm flattered,
but I don't have that kind of money.

423
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,558
Oh, please, don't be so modest.

424
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,714
I wish I was.

425
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,996
When my father died, he left nothing.

426
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,999
Really? I...

427
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,479
I'd just assumed...

428
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,633
I mean, after the reading of the will,
everything was great.

429
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,156
Everything is. Things with Sandy
and my kids have never been better.

430
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,757
Well, that is so wonderful
that you've got your priorities in place.

431
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,949
So, what about the Newport Group
as a silent partner?

432
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,754
I'm selling it.

433
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,832
It's riddled with debt and unpaid loans
and I just figured...

434
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,719
Better to rid yourself
of every last vestige of your dad.

435
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,670
- Well, I don't know if I'd put it that way.
- It's classic, Kirsten.

436
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,995
You're hoping that by closing up shop,
your issues with your dad will disappear.

437
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,628
- It's not like that.
- I've been there.

438
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,273
It's so great that you're trying
to put the past behind you.

439
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,477
It's just not that easy.

440
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,790
I'm sorry, I don't want you
to be disappointed...

441
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,428
...when the issues remain
even after the company's sold.

442
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,916
Well, anyway, invest or not,
you are welcome anytime.

443
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,433
Sedona's beautiful.

444
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,398
So, what's good here?

445
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,670
Oh, no, not you again. Hey!

446
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,479
Please don't make this
more difficult than it has to be.

447
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,279
More difficult? Who are they?
Wha...? What are they doing?

448
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,274
If you haven't done so, I suggest
you pack your personal belongings.

449
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,035
The deputy is here to see
you don't interfere with the movers.

450
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,757
Oh, my God.

451
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,560
Sum, your door.

452
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,112
Summer?

453
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,273
- Surprise.
- Hey, what are you guys doing here?

454
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,955
- We're taking you to the school dance.
- Oh, thanks, but I'm not going.

455
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,430
- You could be my date, Marissa.
- Way to bait the hook, Dennis.

456
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,431
It's a school dance, you gotta go.

457
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,478
If you don't show, people might talk.
You'd hate for that to happen.

458
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,076
Besides, since we're not leaving without
you, you'd be ruining our night too.

459
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,391
- Yo.
- Hey.

460
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,677
- Stocking the larder?
- Mom's making lamb ragout, it's French.

461
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,229
Now, where you headed...?
Where are you headed?

462
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,913
A dance. There's a beach theme.

463
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,436
I'm gonna drop in on Marissa, see if
she needs a break, maybe grab a bite.

464
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,909
- Well, you're welcome to join us.
- You two have fun.

465
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,868
Enjoy.

466
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,673
I got everything on the list, including
Chunky Monkey, but that's mostly for me.

467
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,400
All right, it's all for me.

468
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,752
Thanks, sweetie.

469
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,672
Is everything okay?

470
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,910
If you're not up to cooking,
we can order in.

471
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,834
- It's a lot safer.
- No, no, it's just...

472
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,994
I'm doing the right thing,
closing down the Newport Group.

473
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,674
- I'm not hiding, right?
- Hiding?

474
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,035
No. You're putting
the past behind you.

475
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,076
What is it?

476
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,037
Nothing.

477
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,274
We forgot the oregano.

478
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,237
I'll be right back.

479
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,233
- You never mentioned oregano.
- I forgot. I'll be back soon.

480
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,034
All right, here we go.

481
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,839
- Check you out, girl.
- It's about time.

482
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,274
- I thought Marissa was studying.
- So did I.

483
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,716
See, that's the problem
with the surprise pop-in.

484
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,431
Ryan, hey.

485
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,952
- He looks kind of mad.
- Yeah, I think that's his look.

486
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,359
I'm gonna go get Summer
before things get awkward.

487
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,275
- I thought you were studying tonight.
- I was.

488
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,269
- He your lab partner?
- There's this dance in Newport Union.

489
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,512
- I was gonna tell you, I just didn't...
- Is this about yesterday?

490
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,319
No, I swear.

491
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,231
Hey, I wish I didn't have to go to this.

492
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,634
Being there every day alone...
I mean, I really need these friends, Ryan.

493
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,952
You're right. You should go.

494
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,314
She's coming. All right.

495
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,876
- You okay?
- Fine. Have fun.

496
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,754
Hey, man, I'm sorry about
all the confusion.

497
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,558
A heads up would've
been great, woman.

498
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,434
- Don't worry, I'm gonna take care of her.
- Sure. See you.

499
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,749
Time to add a little flavor to the punch.
Get this party started.

500
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,950
Now it's officially a school dance.

501
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,393
Hey, you know what?
Will you just excuse me.

502
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,040
- Marissa, wait.
- What am I supposed to do?

503
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,474
They're all staring at me.

504
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,392
That is exactly
when you get in there...

505
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,710
...throw down a little cardboard,
make it happen.

506
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,231
- Cut a little rug. That's what I'd do.
- Yeah, but I'm not you.

507
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,550
Yeah, you got that to be thankful for.

508
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,358
A little hurtful, but a good point.

509
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,829
Look, public-school kids...

510
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,278
All kids, really.
- they're like dogs.

511
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,753
They smell fear.

512
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,229
And they like Frisbees.

513
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,398
You just gotta go back
and act like they're not looking at you.

514
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,830
- Come on, what do you say?
- Come on.

515
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,554
Come on.

516
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,075
If it'll make you feel better,
I'll show you some moves.

517
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,708
I'm just worried about Ryan.
I feel like...

518
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,440
...he's feeling left out...
- Yeah.

519
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,156
Well, do you like it?

520
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,629
I know it's not like
Marissa's dances, but...

521
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,711
Summer, it's incredible.

522
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,678
- Yeah?
- It's like you've brought the ocean to us.

523
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,070
- You're my little human tsunami.
- Thanks.

524
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,151
Hi, everybody.

525
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,548
Everyone, hi.

526
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,473
I'm Taylor Townsend,
your Social Chair...

527
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,710
...and I would like
to thank you all for coming.

528
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,317
- Relax. She's not taking credit for it.
- Thank you.

529
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,948
So this dance has been my baby now
for quite a while.

530
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,757
Okay, she's taking credit for it.

531
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,069
I am going to kill her.

532
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,879
But there is one person
without whose help...

533
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,871
...none of this could ever
have happened:

534
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,473
- See, she's gonna...
- Dean Hess.

535
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,111
- Thank you.
- I am going to kill the both of them.

536
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,396
- Wait.
- So everyone have fun...

537
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,996
...because this really is
the end of summer.

538
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,596
You kind of set yourself up
for that one.

539
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,512
I knew it. I knew this plan was crap.

540
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,910
Spending 30 grand
to go to rehab to find a mark?

541
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,640
It made sense. Every woman there
was vulnerable and rich.

542
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,074
Except the one you picked.

543
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,559
What are we
supposed to do now?

544
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,838
Listen, this woman is the princess
of Orange County, okay?

545
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,197
I will find a way to use her.

546
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,074
Okay?

547
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,312
I am not gonna let
Kirsten Cohen get away.

548
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,989
I didn't know you kept oregano
stashed in here.

549
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,675
- Hey.
- Hey.

550
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,593
- Recognize this?
- Sure.

551
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,273
It's the Groth building on Ocean.

552
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,836
Built in 1922.

553
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,070
It was gonna be torn down...

554
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,438
...and I convinced my father
to restore it. It was my first project.

555
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,996
All those years...

556
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,233
...he was on the other side of that wall,
and no matter how hard I worked...

557
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,118
...I was never gonna reach him.

558
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,669
Honey, we can keep the company.

559
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,838
No.

560
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,311
I just needed to say goodbye.

561
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,359
- I guess it's too late for dinner.
- How do you feel about a picnic?

562
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,234
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

563
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,072
I just wanted to see how you're doing.

564
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,434
I'm great. How's the dance?

565
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,437
Good. I sent Summer for a cool-down lap
around the building.

566
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,795
Listen, I just wanted to make sure...

567
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,633
...you're not taking this
Marissa thing too seriously.

568
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,472
Seth, it's fine. I get it.

569
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,551
Yeah. Okay.

570
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,269
I just wanna make sure you don't think
she's pulling away or, you know...

571
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,476
<i>... you're gonna look back</i>
<i>on tonight and say:</i>

572
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,837
<i>"That's when I started losing her,</i>
<i>I should have done something. "

573
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,196
I'm here to tell you
it's not gonna happen.

574
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,430
I'm talking, like, zero chance.

575
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,279
Right.

576
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,758
Okay. Well, I just...

577
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,433
I wanted to make sure
you knew that.

578
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,394
Yeah, look, I gotta go.

579
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,229
Yeah, okay, I'll talk to you later.

580
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,517
Can I get the check?

581
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,514
Ryan. Hey.

582
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,035
- Seth, what are you doing here?
- I'm here to stop you.

583
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,316
If that means getting between
you and the gym...

584
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,436
...I'm only gonna ask
that you spare my face.

585
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,589
It's okay.

586
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,959
You're not gonna rush in?

587
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,068
I'd just ruin it.

588
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,433
You're doing the right thing, man.
You're not gonna lose her.

589
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,239
Can you give me a ride?
My left leg's really tired.

590
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,835
<i>This is Seth. It's 2005,</i>
<i>you know how these things work.</i>

591
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,234
Co-hizzle? Where are you? You said
you'd only be gone like 10 minutes.

592
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,073
Oh, my God.

593
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,555
Get off me.

594
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,678
No, I'm not about to go there...

595
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,988
<i>This is different, my lord.</i>

596
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,991
- <i>It begins here...</i>
- <i>Different in what way?</i>

597
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,754
<i>I've just brought treasure back</i>
<i>to Egypt that was stolen...</i>

598
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,515
<i>... from a tomb like this</i>
<i>three nights after the crypt was sealed.</i>

599
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,915
<i>Are they all like these?</i>

600
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,314
Summer, hey.
Sorry, Ryan, he need...

601
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,199
Seth, shut up. There's something
important I have to tell you.

602
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,868
Summer.

603
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,034
Enjoying the dance?

604
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,068
- What's so important?
- Nothing. Just dance with me.

605
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,434
What?

606
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,559
What?

607
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,753
Hey.

608
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,638
Hey.

609
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,193
I just wanted to tell you how important
it was for me to go to the school dance.

610
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,749
- I know.
- But...

611
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,630
...I spent the whole time
wishing you were there.

612
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,995
My life just doesn't work without you.

613
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,310
And it always goes so smooth
when we're together.

614
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,753
Thanks.

615
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,752
- So I'll make you a deal.
- Yeah?

616
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,832
Whatever song comes on the radio next
will be our song, okay?

617
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,673
Okay.

618
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,110
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I like it.

619
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,157
- This is definitely us.
- No.

620
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,234
Hey.
