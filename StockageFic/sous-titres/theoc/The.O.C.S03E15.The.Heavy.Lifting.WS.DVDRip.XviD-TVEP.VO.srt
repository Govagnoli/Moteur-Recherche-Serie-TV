00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,313
<i>Previously on</i> The O. C:

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,392
- Why wouldn't she date him?
- He's using her.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,875
- When I'm not around you, I miss you.
- You do?

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,519
That was <i>Save the Last Dance?</i>

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,672
That dance number at the end
was so inspiring.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,400
Me and you,
we got unfinished business.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,152
- Where's Kaitlin?
- You're in love.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,673
Just be careful of that girl.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,990
I love you.
And I think you love me too.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,229
About Johnny?

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,755
- I'm with you.
- That's not the whole story, is it?

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,480
- Just come down, Johnny, please?
- Just be careful.

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,553
Johnny!

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,712
Well, you know what they say,
no news is good news.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,394
I'm not sure that's true
about severe head injuries.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,597
- We should've stayed at the hospital.
- Nothing we could do there.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,320
The doctors told us to go home,
sleep, eat.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,438
Yeah, except I can't sleep,
and I'm definitely not hungry.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,190
- Hungry?
- Come on. Everyone needs to eat.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,237
Johnny's gonna need you
when he wakes up.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,719
- lf he wakes up.
- Marissa.

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,075
- You were there.
- Yeah, I was.

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,555
You guys, he's probably
gonna be fine.

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,553
Trey was unconscious for, like, months,
and he was fine.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,709
And he was shot.

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,711
We waited around like this
once before...

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,110
...after a certain OD in TJ.

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,955
I'm gonna go check on Kaitlin
in the pool house.

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,200
- How you doing, Ryan?
- She's right.

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,954
I mean, the way the doctors
were talking, you could tell.

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,157
- They didn't wanna get our hopes up.
- Well, doctors are idiots.

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,392
- You tell that to your dad?
- It's their job to be negative.

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,156
It's called managing expectations.
That's why it's our job to be positive.

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,311
- Johnny's mom.
- You think you ought to...?

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,517
- I don't know.
- Do you want me to?

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,592
No, no. It's all right.

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,195
Mrs. Harper. Hey, it's Ryan.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,479
What happened?

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,713
Hey.

40
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,353
- Thanks for coming by.
- No, I'm glad you called.

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,713
- Where's Gwen?
- I finally got her to lie down.

42
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,839
She started talking about the funeral
and just lost it.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,197
- Well, what does she wanna do?
- Who knows.

44
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,636
She said no priest, no body,
nothing depressing.

45
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,235
It's a funeral.
Isn't it supposed to be depressing?

46
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,870
Well, I mean, we could do something
during the day.

47
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,237
You know, maybe by the water.
No one allowed to wear black.

48
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,038
Or shoes.

49
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,192
Sounds like what he'd wanna do.

50
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,550
- I gotta take this to Mrs. H.
- Hey, I'll do it.

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,439
Thanks.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,238
It doesn't seem real, man.

53
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,868
Listen, man, you can't blame yourself.
You tried.

54
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,318
- Yeah, and I failed.
- Well, don't beat yourself up.

55
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,074
Ryan Atwood versus himself
is a very ugly cage match.

56
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,629
I'm gonna shower,
try and get some sleep.

57
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,149
So I guess you won't worry about Johnny
coming between you and Marissa.

58
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,110
Because...
Sudoku? Fun to say, fun to do.

59
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,277
Too soon? Okay.

60
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,908
Too soon.

61
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,195
It just feels wrong. The kids
are going through this awful thing...

62
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,079
...and we're planning
a Valentine's Day dance.

63
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,232
All the more reason for them
to focus on something good.

64
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,518
I mean, it's not like we can cancel
this dance now if we wanted to.

65
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,832
Although, the thought
had crossed my mind.

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,068
- He hasn't asked you?
- Who? Dr. Neil Roberts?

67
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,231
Why, no, he hasn't.

68
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,470
- Think he has plans with someone else?
- No.

69
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,471
- That I'm not valentine material?
- Julie.

70
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,950
That I'm just a fun hang, not worthy
of chocolates and nice underwear?

71
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,111
Sandy's no fan
of Valentine's Day either.

72
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,754
We should just concentrate
on hosting a great event...

73
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,150
...and worry about
our love lives when it's over.

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,677
Or I could invent a fake reason to go
to his house and fish for information.

75
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,229
Julie, the last time you went
on a stealth mission...

76
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,675
...you toppled a dessert tray.

77
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,712
Yeah, but it got his attention.

78
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,997
- There you go.
- Thank you.

79
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,556
Hi. Are you a friend of Johnny's?

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,550
- I'm his cousin, Sadie.
- Hi. I'm glad you're here.

81
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,029
My mom thought it would
be a good idea if I came...

82
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,952
...and stayed with my aunt
for a while.

83
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,792
How's she doing?

84
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,349
Not so good, you know,
but finally sleeping.

85
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,511
You look like you could use
a few hours.

86
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,989
Oh, I'm okay.

87
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,912
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I should probably go.

88
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,991
I just got a lot of stuff to do.

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,631
- Hey, are you Marissa?
- Yeah.

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,155
Well, I wish it was
under better circumstances...

91
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,709
...but it's nice to finally meet you.

92
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,589
You too.

93
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,910
- Justin. What are you doing here?
- Winter break is almost over.

94
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,196
I thought you might want
a ride back to school.

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,272
- Should've saved your gas money.
- It's a hybrid.

96
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,477
Gets pretty good mileage,
so gas isn't an issue.

97
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,915
Last time you came to town
you wanted me arrested.

98
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,435
That was my brother.
And I was thinking...

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,388
I was hoping that we could talk.
About our relationship.

100
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,234
Our relationship?

101
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,192
- Today's not a good day.
- Is there another day that'll be better?

102
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,353
- I want you to leave, right now.
- Kaitlin, are you okay?

103
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,276
I'll see you then. Thanks.

104
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,349
- Hey, boss.
- Hey.

105
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,239
- You wanted to see me?
- Got off the phone with Dr. Griffin.

106
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,188
The board has vetted the Brea proposal.
They're ready to put a hole in the ground.

107
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,396
But I'm gonna to meet with him
one more time.

108
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,473
Do you think you could call Maya?
I mean, with a few caveats.

109
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,632
- Name them.
- Don't lie. Don't lead her on.

110
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,153
That's not a problem.

111
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,232
The reason I went out with her
is, actually, I really like her.

112
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,152
Oh, boy likes girl.

113
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,838
Girl has access to influential father
boy's boss needs to close a deal.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,470
Has all the makings of a great romance.
I'm glad you like her.

115
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,438
Well, I'll give her a call. Let you know.

116
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,511
- Hey, Marissa.
- Hi.

117
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,032
Marissa.

118
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,315
- How are you holding up?
- I'm okay.

119
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,549
I was wondering...

120
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,917
...there's all these forms
from the hospital and, well...

121
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,275
...Johnny's mom can't really
deal right now.

122
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,873
It doesn't need a lawyer...

123
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,349
You know, I actually know
just the guy for the job.

124
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,717
- I practically majored in paperwork.
- Are you sure you don't mind?

125
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,589
When it comes to mind-numbing
bureaucratic busywork, Matt is an ace.

126
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,833
- And here I thought you never noticed.
- All right, well, I should get home.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,274
You know, shower.

128
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,908
I've been in these clothes since
you don't wanna know.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,629
- I think you're doing great, kiddo.
- Thanks.

130
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,154
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, what are you doing?

131
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,629
Nothing.

132
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,914
Well, if it's nothing,
then you won't mind me looking, right?

133
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,072
- That's not porn.
- It's a list of my yakuza DVDs...

134
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,676
...sorted alphabetically by title
and also by director.

135
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,956
Making my inventories is
one of those things...

136
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,111
...like masturbating
or flossing my teeth...

137
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,477
...where even though you know I do it,
I'd rather you not witness it.

138
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,029
Cohen, I found something
in your drawer.

139
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,719
- You're not mad?
- Oh, no. I'm mad.

140
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,236
I'm livid. Not about the pot, because,
I mean, whatever, it's pot, right?

141
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,789
And while Marissa and I
were hotboxing Luke's car...

142
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,475
...you were at home making a manger
for Captain Oats out of Lincoln Logs.

143
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,631
You were a late bloomer, I get that.

144
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,519
But, Cohen, you lied to me for, like,
the gazillionth time.

145
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,309
- About something important.
- Summer, I don't know what I can do...

146
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,029
...except say I'm not gonna lie again
and then not lie.

147
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,634
- You just have to trust me.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

148
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,189
So you better think of something else.

149
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,031
- What happened to the Crock-Pot?
- It broke.

150
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,278
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

151
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,829
- Let me give you guys some privacy.
- It's all right.

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,276
- You don't have to leave.
- I've tried talking to her.

153
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,079
Well, give her some time.
How you doing?

154
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,037
You know...

155
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,879
Hi, Mrs. Harper.

156
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,795
Sorry, hi.

157
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,234
Yeah, I guess. Sure.

158
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,954
- Hi.
- Hey.

159
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,637
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure. No problem.

160
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,634
- So you visiting?
- Yeah. From Ashland, Oregon.

161
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,554
- You taking some time off school, or...?
- No, actually, I just graduated.

162
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,598
I started my own little
jewelry-making business.

163
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,231
So I've just been traveling,
trying to get stores to carry my stuff.

164
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,389
You know, I really need to be
with my boyfriend right now.

165
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,154
- Your boyfriend?
- Yeah. Ryan.

166
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,399
He was with me,
with Johnny, when it happened.

167
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,156
Oh, yeah, my aunt mentioned that there
was another kid there, I just thought...

168
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,671
This is really awkward. I thought
that Johnny was your boyfriend.

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,956
Why would you think that?

170
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,429
Because last week he called me,
and he asked me...

171
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,512
...if I would make something for you
for Valentine's Day.

172
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,113
Here, I brought it with me.

173
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,109
That there is your birth stone,
and that's his.

174
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,714
And in the middle there's an angel.

175
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,318
- An angel?
- Yeah.

176
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,436
He was afraid you'd think
it was cheesy...

177
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,194
...but he said that's what
you were to him.

178
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,790
Johnny and I were pretty close
growing up.

179
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,394
A couple of years ago,
I spent a summer in Newport...

180
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,279
...and I have to say, it was
the best summer of my life.

181
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,477
Johnny had this pair
of Power Ranger pajamas...

182
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,358
...he absolutely refused to take off.

183
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,871
I mean, he would literally wake up
in the morning...

184
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,031
...put his clothes on top
of his pajamas...

185
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,033
...and go about his day
wearing his two layers of clothing.

186
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,838
Ryan, there's Kaitlin.

187
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,437
- I should probably...
- No, it's all right. Let me.

188
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,231
- Hey, what are you doing up here alone?
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

189
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,233
Just go down there
and introduce myself?

190
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,790
"Hey, I'm Kaitlin,
the girl who killed him."

191
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,633
You didn't make him climb that rock,
didn't make him fall.

192
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,838
That's right. That was you.

193
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,396
You know what? I'm not gonna
do this with you.

194
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,677
- Everybody's upset. Come on.
- No, you know what, Ryan?

195
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,671
You can't fix this.

196
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,912
So just save the speeches
for my sister, all right?

197
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,349
All right, here you go. This is your
fourth-quarter bonus, by the way.

198
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,476
And next time, I pick the sport.

199
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,029
Hey, did you ever get
in touch with Maya?

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,673
Yeah. But I kind of wish I didn't.

201
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,868
When I didn't call her back, she took
that as a sign of my lack of interest.

202
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,429
She's a smart girl,
and now she's an angry one too.

203
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,875
It's not a typo.
I need 10,000 cinnamon hearts.

204
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,474
And please don't make them stale.
Thanks.

205
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,153
Hey, honey, are the kids home?

206
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,515
No. They're going
to The Bait Shop for the wake.

207
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,875
- Hey, Matt, how's it going?
- Woman troubles.

208
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,715
- Oh, well, maybe I can play cupid.
- That's a great idea.

209
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,872
Really, Sandy? And what is it
that you say about Valentine's Day?

210
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,191
That it's vacuous, a commercially-driven,
hollow shell of a holiday?

211
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,079
Sometimes we need a vacuous,
commercially-driven diversion.

212
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,629
- This would be one of those times.
- What's her name?

213
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,995
- I'll have a ticket delivered.
- Maya Griffin.

214
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,596
Whose father's the head
of the physician's board?

215
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,030
- I don't know.
- lf anybody can do it, you can.

216
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,794
She doesn't need my help
getting a date. It won't work.

217
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,030
You know what, Kirsten,
don't worry about it.

218
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,919
I'm sure that we can come up
with something else.

219
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,473
I'll get Maya to the party
if you try and embrace the holiday.

220
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,475
No whining, no snarky comments.
Candies, candles, lingerie. Nice lingerie.

221
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,235
Nothing red, see-through,
or remotely edible.

222
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,197
Not even a little see-through?

223
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,638
Death and Valentine's Day,
there's an unbeatable combination.

224
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,837
This is the first one where Marissa and I
are actually together.

225
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,037
- Should be all-time.
- Pressure's on for me to deliver.

226
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,953
- Summer found my stash.
- You don't have any visible bruises.

227
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,873
- She go for the kidneys?
- I wish.

228
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,474
You and Atwood make V-Day plans?

229
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,551
Actually, we haven't even
talked about it.

230
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,994
Really?

231
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,631
It's the first Valentine's Day you guys
aren't fighting or kissing another girl.

232
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,759
- It could be special.
- This is special.

233
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,069
All I'm saying is, Valentine's Day
might be cancelled this year.

234
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,717
Hey, Sadie.

235
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,831
- What do you want?
- I just wanna see how you're doing.

236
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,636
- I mean it, okay?
- When's the last time you meant anything?

237
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,598
- Is there a problem here?
- Hey, man.

238
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,070
- This is a private party.
- It's okay, he was just leaving.

239
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,033
Yeah.

240
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,630
- So you know him?
- Used to.

241
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,351
Sadie, right?

242
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,869
I liked what you said
at the beach today.

243
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,237
Thanks. Speaking at funerals
is something of a specialty.

244
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,397
- Not that it's anything to brag about.
- No one close to me has ever...

245
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,994
- Ever died.
- Really?

246
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,789
Feels like everyone close to me has.

247
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,154
I mean, not everyone.
But my dad, cancer when I was 14.

248
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,594
My dog, Rocky,
like a month after that.

249
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,232
- My best friend, last summer.
- I'm sorry.

250
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,239
- For your cousin too.
- I see that.

251
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,556
It's a funeral. People say sorry
before they say hello.

252
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,951
But you really are, so thank you.

253
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,116
- Ryan, there you are.
- Hey.

254
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,872
- Hey, Marissa.
- Hi.

255
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,474
So Seth and Summer
were looking for you at the car.

256
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,073
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, sure.

257
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,708
So maybe we'll see you again
before you leave.

258
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,949
Sure.

259
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,552
Yes, well, I think I might have left it
somewhere around here...

260
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,790
...at Kaitlin's birthday party.

261
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,757
I haven't seen a cake knife
anywhere...

262
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,354
...not that I'd know
what a cake knife looks like.

263
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,113
Are you really gonna be baking?

264
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,191
Don't you have your party
tomorrow night?

265
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,032
Frankly, Neil...

266
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,634
...I'm surprised you remembered
about my little dance.

267
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,075
Or Valentine's Day.

268
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,395
So are you working this weekend?
On call? You're such a busy man.

269
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,199
No, I thought I'd stay in
and catch up on some reading.

270
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,399
Because you're behind on work?

271
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,313
New techniques must be developed
every day. Gotta keep up.

272
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,789
Well, I thought I would get into
<i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

273
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,789
- Have you read it?
- I'm waiting for the movie.

274
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,715
Well, I don't see that knife anywhere.
I suppose I should be going.

275
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,189
Well, it's always good
to see you, Julie.

276
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,278
- I'll see you out.
- It's okay. I know the way.

277
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,952
Hey!

278
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,351
Happy Valentine's Day.

279
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,273
I figured you could use something
to hug.

280
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,558
Or at least, if you throw him,
he won't break.

281
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,990
- Trouble at home?
- Shockingly, no.

282
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,230
It's a boy.

283
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,591
I mean, not like that.

284
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,478
He...

285
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,354
He died.

286
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,079
And I was with him.

287
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,036
And sort of helped it happen.

288
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,594
- What do you mean?
- We went to the beach.

289
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,799
Drinking, a bonfire.
I thought it'd be fun.

290
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,351
But he was really messed up.

291
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,637
And by the time I called for help,
it was too late.

292
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,719
He slipped. Fell on some rocks.

293
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,675
- Then it was an accident.
- Yeah, but accidents don't just happen.

294
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,159
People let them happen.

295
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,034
I understand why it probably
feels that way...

296
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,192
...but if he were here,
he'd be the first to take responsibility.

297
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,989
And he'd thank you
for trying to help him.

298
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,639
You're like an adult.

299
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,517
My parents are therapists.

300
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,240
They're annoying but pretty smart.

301
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,356
Well, thank you.

302
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,112
So I will see you
back in Santa Barbara?

303
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,714
- Yeah.
- Okay.

304
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,954
Bye.

305
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,831
- Dude, I can totally see you.
- Dude. Right.

306
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,473
Hey, how was the...?
How was the memorial?

307
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,950
Can we talk about something else?
Why are you reading Victoria's Secret?

308
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,272
You know what, speaking of underwear,
I think I have sand in mine. Excuse me.

309
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,592
Well, no, your mother gave it to me,
with items marked and sizes circled.

310
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,671
That mean you're embracing
Valentine's Day?

311
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,034
Thought you weren't a fan.

312
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,713
I made a deal with your mother...

313
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,871
...and I'm holding up
my end of the bargain.

314
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,352
It's just, like, what's even
the point almost, you know?

315
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,193
I'm gonna have to borrow that later.
Thanks.

316
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,995
We'll see.

317
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,949
- So, what do you wanna do?
- I'm doing it.

318
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,638
No, I mean tomorrow.
For Valentine's Day.

319
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,396
- Can we talk about tomorrow tomorrow?
- Not if you wanna do something.

320
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,354
I don't wanna do anything.

321
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,993
You mean you don't wanna
do anything specific...

322
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,991
...or you don't wanna
do anything at all?

323
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,071
You've never liked
Valentine's Day before.

324
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,357
Okay, so don't suddenly act
like it's your favorite holiday.

325
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,118
I'm not.

326
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,637
- This is just really hard for me, okay?
- Well, it's hard for me too.

327
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,871
- I can't explain it.
- I was there, Marissa.

328
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,315
What is it you think
I don't understand?

329
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,196
I'm gonna go.

330
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,112
Come in.

331
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,829
So your girlfriend decided
to cancel Valentine's Day?

332
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,714
Small town. Very good cell service.

333
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,349
Yesterday it seemed like
we were having a good day.

334
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,078
- At a funeral?
- Not a good day...

335
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,878
...but, you know, we were good.

336
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,314
Then she just freaked out.

337
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,311
Sudden death can do
odd things to people.

338
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,038
Remember my mom
at Grandpa's wake?

339
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,714
- That was Kirsten's dad.
- Johnny was Marissa's friend.

340
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,950
- Her good friend.
- Too good.

341
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,473
Well, the guy's dead, Ryan.

342
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,394
I think you can cut Marissa
at least a weekend's worth of slack.

343
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,871
She told me
she didn't wanna see me today.

344
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,873
Ignore her. She was out of her mind
with exhaustion and grief.

345
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,439
- Seemed lucid to me.
- Trust me.

346
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,670
No girl wants to be alone
on Valentine's Day.

347
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,912
- And you know this because...?
- Because inside my manly exterior...

348
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,833
...there beats the heart
of a 14-year-old girl.

349
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,511
Hi. Sandy gave me your address.

350
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,716
Thought you'd want these
as soon as possible.

351
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,440
Thanks. I'm sure Johnny's mom
will appreciate it.

352
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,637
Yeah. So are we gonna see
you and Ryan tonight at the party?

353
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,072
Oh, I don't think so.
We got in a fight.

354
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,271
I got in a fight. It was my fault.

355
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,796
Well, I'm sure that Ryan
will accept your heartfelt apology.

356
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,190
I was more gonna give him
a cooling-off period.

357
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,636
Well, hey, if you need
anything else paperwork-related...

358
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,831
...or just to talk, let me know.
- Thanks.

359
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,150
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- You too.

360
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,793
<i>Hey, it's Ryan. Leave a message.</i>

361
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,198
Well, as I mentioned on the phone...

362
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,399
...my friend Julie and I have
a dating service, and... Thank you.

363
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,152
- we're having a party tonight.

364
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,788
As I mentioned,
I don't need a service to get a date.

365
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,509
Oh, I know. It's us who needs you.

366
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,396
It would mean a lot
to have someone like you...

367
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,393
...young and active
in Newport's business and social life...

368
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,278
...to be a part of the event.

369
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,996
Of course, if you have plans
with someone special...

370
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,757
You mean someone like Matt Ramsey?

371
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,751
I know who your husband is, Kirsten...

372
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,230
...and I seriously doubt this
last-minute invitation is a coincidence.

373
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,476
Maya, I'm sorry.

374
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,473
So just how badly
does Matt wanna go out with me?

375
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,509
- You're not upset?
- I was...

376
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,796
...when I first realized
why you were calling.

377
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,871
But I've liked Matt since college.

378
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,156
And as much as I won't
admit it to him...

379
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,880
...I was disappointed he didn't
ask me out after dinner.

380
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,871
Well, he regrets his decision.

381
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,871
Fine. I'll go.

382
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,913
I see you picked up a little something
for your lady, and I for mine.

383
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,594
Your lady's my mother,
and I don't wanna talk about it.

384
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,830
Women's underwear
has gotten very complicated.

385
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,718
Thongs, bikinis, briefs.

386
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,949
Who knew women's panties
were such a minefield?

387
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,553
Don't say "panties."

388
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,474
- So you and Summer good?
- We will be.

389
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,755
What'd you do this time?

390
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,749
A certain circumstance
was not fully disclosed...

391
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,388
...and my omission was discovered.

392
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,391
- You got caught in a lie.
- In a nutshell.

393
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,677
But why's she making a big deal?
Not like it's the first time.

394
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,798
Well, maybe she thinks of you
as a man, not a kid.

395
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,639
Kids lie all the time.
A man's only as good as his word.

396
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,239
Summer deserves a good man.

397
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,828
Summer has a good man.

398
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,111
- She does?
- Yeah.

399
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,953
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Just show her.

400
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
Well, I gotta pick up
a few more things for your mother.

401
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,634
I promised her
the best Valentine's Day ever.

402
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,279
- Hey, let me give you a hand.
- No, I got it, thanks.

403
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,789
It's you. What are you doing here?
What do you want?

404
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,598
Thought I'd stop by,
pay my respects.

405
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,149
I didn't get a chance
to say anything to Mrs. Harper.

406
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,515
She wanted to thank you
for trying to help him.

407
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,830
- She's inside if you wanna go in.
- Let me help.

408
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,479
I got it, it's cool.

409
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,398
- Not cool. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

410
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,670
I guess it's
kind of an automatic reaction.

411
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,753
You're carrying groceries or moving
something, so someone offers to help.

412
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,195
And, sure, it's nice
to share the heavy lifting...

413
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,158
...when you're carrying a futon
up three flights of stairs.

414
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,312
Is it really worth enduring
the awkward conversation?

415
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,119
And they're doing you a favor,
so you have to be all nice.

416
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,555
So being nice,
that's an effort for you?

417
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,757
Kind of, when I'm carrying
a futon up three flights of stairs.

418
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,388
- What're these for?
- Packing up Johnny's room.

419
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,118
So my aunt won't have to.

420
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,999
- All done?
- All done.

421
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,914
I might have to rethink my position
on not accepting help from strangers.

422
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,913
- Okay. Upstairs.
- Yeah.

423
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,678
This isn't awkward.

424
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,193
This isn't awkward at all.

425
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,673
For you.

426
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,193
Too bad you're already dressed.

427
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,795
I was hoping you'd wear this.

428
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,875
It's the black with beige,
or the beige with black?

429
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,155
Find out.

430
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,512
- This is a fantasy I'm not aware of.
- I didn't buy that.

431
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,238
I didn't buy that. I can explain.

432
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,755
- Think this can be fixed with lingerie?
- No.

433
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,390
Not even if it's very sexy
and it says so right here on the tag.

434
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,630
The point is, I made a mistake,
I will fix it.

435
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,673
Cohen, our problem
cannot be fixed with underwear.

436
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,354
Even age-appropriate underwear
with the right cup size.

437
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,398
How can I prove I'm not gonna do
something I say I'm not gonna?

438
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,913
Well, the pressure was on.

439
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,675
And you needed to come with
a revolutionary idea and rock my world!

440
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,156
- I think Valentine's Day is off.
- Fine.

441
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,435
I got you a card.

442
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,674
<i>Deal with it, Ramon.</i>

443
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,513
<i>Death Cab for Cutie's playing,</i>
<i>and Jake asked me to go.</i>

444
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,477
They're playing Death Cab
on <i>The Valley?</i>

445
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,950
- Never listening to them again.
- I know.

446
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,239
You look nice.

447
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,152
Mom forcing you to go out?

448
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,470
Well, I sharpened my bamboo sticks.

449
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,234
Turns out no force was necessary.

450
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,789
I'm just glad to get out of this trailer.

451
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,270
You know, Marissa, honey,
it's not too late to change your mind.

452
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,351
Fresh air?
All the baked clams you can eat?

453
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,354
Yeah, that sounds tempting,
but I think I just need to be alone.

454
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,593
Okay.

455
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,509
Hey, I wasn't expecting you.

456
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,719
- Hi.
- Hi.

457
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,117
I was hoping I could convince you
to join me at the party.

458
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,031
- Maybe we'll see both of you.
- Yeah.

459
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,838
- Good night.
- All right, good night.

460
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,951
Got you something.

461
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,232
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah. Well, put it on, get dressed.

462
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,874
Or not. Or not.
Fine, forget it. Just hang here.

463
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,792
I know you're only trying to be nice.

464
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,513
But I really need some time.

465
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,517
That's fine. I get that.

466
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,876
But is it more than that? I mean...

467
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,159
...when's the last time we actually
hung out together, alone?

468
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,713
What, you mean without Johnny?

469
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,278
You're glad he's gone, aren't you?

470
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,754
No, I'm not even gonna answer that.

471
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,748
So did Summer
give you back the bag?

472
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,117
The conversation kind of went
in a different direction after that.

473
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,999
- Hey. No Marissa?
- Yeah. No Summer either?

474
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,713
She's over there with her date.

475
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,436
Valentine's Day,
it's too much pressure.

476
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,471
There's Matt. Has his date shown up?

477
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,551
Cool. Another dude.
I gotta do something.

478
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,800
You gonna try to act
like this is a strange coincidence?

479
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,314
Not anymore.

480
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,438
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I don't know, can you?

481
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,594
Still got that fake ID?

482
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,079
Happy Valentine's Day, sir.

483
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,511
I was wondering if I could maybe
borrow your daughter for a moment.

484
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,278
I'm right here. What do you want?

485
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,155
I wrote you something.

486
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,033
- A cocktail napkin?
- It's a confession. Read it.

487
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,751
"To whom it may concern:

488
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,151
My name is Seth Cohen,
and I have problem with flying."

489
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,470
It says "lying." Pen shook.

490
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,754
"I have lied about many things
over the years.

491
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,913
The most recent and troubling lies include
but are not limited to the following:"

492
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,389
There's a complete list
on the back of the napkin.

493
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,790
All my sins. Very detailed.

494
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,632
- Cohen, I know all of this.
- I know.

495
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,439
But if I ever screw up again,
you give that to my parents.

496
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,391
That's pretty smart.

497
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,472
You may have just rocked my world.

498
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,075
A half-court shot at the buzzer.

499
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,356
Is that a sports metaphor?
I don't follow.

500
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,110
I'm wearing the thong.

501
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,635
Yeah, that's my mom's.

502
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,512
- What are you doing?
- Getting wasted.

503
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,875
You and me, Marissa.

504
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,031
We're the only people who understand
what we're going through.

505
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,919
You might be right about that.

506
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,032
This emotional connection
might be a really good platform...

507
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,519
...for a more physical one.

508
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,229
I'm not gonna
make out with you, Chili.

509
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,753
It's not Chili anymore.

510
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,592
I'm going back to Dennis.

511
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,432
Johnny never liked that nickname.

512
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,553
Care for some oysters, ma'am?

513
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,676
Oh, no. I don't do oysters.

514
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,831
If I'm gonna swallow something
disgusting...

515
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,070
...there better be something
in it for me.

516
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,676
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh, hey, baby. How are you?

517
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,354
I was thinking about leaving.

518
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,317
Oh, then I'll see you
back at the house.

519
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,789
No, I mean leaving Newport.

520
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,670
Going back to school. Tonight.

521
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,229
Justin, he offered to give me a ride.

522
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,234
Hello. Julie Cooper-Nichol,
Kaitlin's mother.

523
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,676
Very nice to meet you.
You have a lovely daughter.

524
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,674
I'll drive under the speed limit,
make sure she buckles her seatbelt.

525
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,149
Stop for coffee several times.

526
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,595
Thank you, Justin. I appreciate that.

527
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,757
Well, I'll see you at parents' weekend.

528
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,876
Promise me you're definitely
coming back.

529
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,474
I promise.
You'll be seeing a lot more of me.

530
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,598
Kaitlin, I'm so sorry if this trip
wasn't everything you hoped for.

531
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,399
I'm a Cooper, Mom. I'll survive.

532
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,038
Okay, bye.

533
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,000
- Hey.
- Hello there.

534
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,515
- You look radiant tonight.
- Thank you.

535
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,715
Hoping we could talk.

536
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,348
- You don't have to explain.
- No, I think I do.

537
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,671
All this back and forth,
coming together, pulling away again...

538
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,559
...I think it's happening for a reason.

539
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,039
We don't belong together.

540
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,430
We both have very complex lives...

541
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,068
...which will make this
very complicated.

542
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,152
Right. I mean, who's looking
to make life any more complicated?

543
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,119
Did you say "will"?

544
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,669
I'm sorry it's taken me
this long to ask you this...

545
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,797
...but I lost my nerve
and I wasn't trusting my instincts.

546
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,232
But, Julie...

547
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,399
...would you be my Valentine?

548
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,875
All alone tonight?

549
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,629
That's to be expected
under the circumstances.

550
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,394
Marissa and I have been fighting a lot.

551
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,518
Mainly about whether Johnny
was just a friend.

552
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,274
- Or if it was more than that.
- She says it wasn't.

553
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,317
I don't think she's lying to me...

554
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,995
...but she might be lying to herself.

555
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,757
And now that he's gone,
I don't know how we move forward.

556
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,794
- Or if.
- Well, the night's not over.

557
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,679
Maybe there's a pit stop
you can make on the way home.

558
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,310
Yeah, actually, there is.

559
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,832
How's Ryan?

560
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,039
Oh, he has a lot on his mind, as usual.

561
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,073
Matt and Maya
seem to be getting along.

562
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,800
- Think they're talking about business?
- Yeah.

563
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,078
I think right now he's saying
how our design offers more space...

564
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,869
...for emergency care
and outpatient services.

565
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,750
I think she's more concerned
about wheelchair access in the lobby.

566
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,718
Oh, she's a good soul.

567
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,116
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

568
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,748
Don't cry or anything.

569
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,992
Look, I know this wasn't
the best vacation you've ever had...

570
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,757
...but I really am sorry for everything.

571
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,593
Don't be. Just figure it all out.

572
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,709
- Figure what out?
- What you really felt for Johnny.

573
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,196
What does it matter now?

574
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,318
Keep telling yourself whatever you want,
but it does matter.

575
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,959
I'm really glad you came back.

576
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,711
I kind of sort of maybe
might believe you.

577
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,639
- Hi.
- Hi.

578
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,711
I was wondering if I could
give you a hand?

579
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,394
No, no, I got it. Thank you.

580
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,754
- Okay, I'll just...
- I mean, really?

581
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,992
Yeah, yeah.
Figured you could use the help.

582
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,911
I can make the conversation
more awkward.

583
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,150
Well, in that case, please.

584
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,189
Hey, Kait, I think
there's something in your eye.

585
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,191
It couldn't be. Is that a tear?

586
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,191
Shut up.

587
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,070
You know, as weird as it may sound...

588
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,110
...I think I'm actually
gonna miss this place.

589
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,558
What are you thinking?

590
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,713
If I could've done or said anything...

591
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,790
...that would've saved him.

592
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,229
Well, I think it's a hard thing
to accept...

593
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,436
...that life's completely
out of our control.

594
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,833
But you were there for him.

595
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,719
End of the day, that's all
we can really do for each other.

596
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,991
Just be there.

597
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,831
And I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me.

598
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,189
Go away.

599
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,351
- I just wanna talk.
- There's nothing to say.

600
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,795
You wouldn't have come
if you didn't wanna see me.

601
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,952
Got nothing to do with you.
Leave before I scream for the cops.

602
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,917
We both know
you're not gonna do that.

603
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,075
What the hell is he doing here?

604
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,071
Everything okay?

605
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,551
It is now.

606
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,039
You want tea?

607
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,996
