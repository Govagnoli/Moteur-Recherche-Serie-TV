00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,034
<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,239
If you ever wanna kick it or hang out
or something, I'm around.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,311
Would you maybe wanna
go to prom with me?

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,152
All right.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,839
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,113
- Let's go! Come on!
- Get in.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,912
Don't be a little bitch.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,639
Will you stop by the Newport Group?

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,758
There's a concept drawing
your father needs for his presentation.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,599
There was a fire at the Newport Group.
They think Seth did it.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,395
<i>- Thirty-one cents a share. Also to recap</i>
<i>what I told you earlier coming out...</i>

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,159
Hey, man. So how'd it go?

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,198
He denied everything. Stopped by,
picked up the drawing, left.

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,999
Well, that's a good thing.
Except you don't believe him.

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,434
I didn't know what to say.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,551
- It was an accident. I swear.
- All right, so tell your dad.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,631
Ordinarily, I'd believe him.
You know that.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,439
In light of revelations about
his behavior, I don't know.

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,434
He's hiding something.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,115
Dad, remember when I called you
the worst father ever?

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,316
Right after,
I swung by your place of work...

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,755
...I smoked a joint,
I forgot to put it out...

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,037
...and now your office
fits into an ashtray.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,117
Security camera in the garage has him
as the last person to leave.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,874
If he's telling the truth
and you accuse him of lying...

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,999
I've disappointed him enough already.
I don't need to give him any more ammo.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,795
This is shaping up to be
a hell of a graduation.

28
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,913
I can't do hard time, Ryan.

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,038
Well, lying to Sandy Cohen,
what's harder than that?

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,190
I'm gonna go to the car, get my iPod,
listen to sad music for a change.

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,793
- Which car?
- My mom's.

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,393
You know what? I'll get it.

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,154
- It's okay. It's just in the garage.
- No, it's not.

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,517
I parked it on the street.
I've been meaning to move it. I'll get it.

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,477
Yo, yo, yo.

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,989
- What are you doing here?
- I bailed out and ran.

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,833
- Yeah? What about the cops?
- They got a good look at me.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,878
I can't go home.
I gotta get out of town.

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,237
- Yeah, well, have a nice trip.
- I need your help! I need your help.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,914
- I'm not gonna help you. I'm done.
- I need money.

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,514
- I've got graduation, family.
- You don't get it.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,030
If I go down,
you are going down with me.

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,077
You know?
And not on some assault charge.

44
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,515
That was a $ 120,000 car we stole.

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,477
You stole.

46
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,155
Yeah, tell it to the cops.

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,631
Or your mom when she gets here.

48
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,668
I'm sure she'll be real proud.

49
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,955
I can't believe we're gonna be
on that stage in our cap and gowns.

50
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,395
Except for Seth,
who may be in an orange jumpsuit.

51
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,232
- Taylor!
- Sorry, Summer.

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,834
I'm just really nervous
about my valedictorian speech.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,470
Well, it's not like Cohen got charged.
He didn't burn the entire building.

54
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,791
- He just damaged a couple of offices.
- It sounds like Ryan.

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,999
Sounds like the smoldering passion
we unleashed in Seth needed an outlet.

56
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,392
Think again, Taylor. I don't think
Cohen's the one that needs to get laid.

57
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,989
Have I told you about my after
after-prom party...

58
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,639
...with Seung Ho and Young Nam?

59
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,199
It was hot and spicy...

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,751
...and let's just say I had my very own
Korean barbecue.

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,111
I am so off kimchi.

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,191
- Marissa.
- Hey, Mom.

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,511
- Isn't it a bit early to be saving seats?
- I brought you something.

64
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,910
It's from Dad. A gift maybe.

65
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,715
He wanted you to have it for graduation.
I thought you'd want it right away.

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,828
- Yeah. Yeah, thanks.
- Okay.

67
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,235
- I'll see you in a bit. Bye, girls.
- Bye.

68
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,673
- That was nice of him to think of you.
- Yeah. I'm gonna...

69
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,879
- Dawn.
- Kirsten.

70
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,753
- Come on in.
- Oh, thank you. Thanks.

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,753
Wow, it seems like forever
since I was last here.

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,353
- Give me your bags.
- Thank you.

73
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,715
Of course, maybe
I was too drunk to remember.

74
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,472
Kidding. I'm doing good.

75
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,551
It seems that way.

76
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,870
- Hey, Mom.
- Graduate.

77
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,156
How you doing?
I'm glad you could make it.

78
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,633
- Well, Kaitlin, hello.
- Dr. Roberts.

79
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,876
- We weren't expecting you.
- Well, you know...

80
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,554
...since my grades went
from B's to A's...

81
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,951
...I was actually wondering
if you could change me A's to B's.

82
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,951
Well, Kaitlin,
I think that augmentation...

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,715
...is something to be discussed
with your mother when you're older.

84
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,199
Dude, I'm totally kidding.

85
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,952
I just love graduations.
I thought I might stop by.

86
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,156
- Kaitlin? Sweetie, hi. What...?
- Hi.

87
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,550
- Is everything okay?
- Totally.

88
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,036
I figured it was a safe bet, you know,
Dad wouldn't come here.

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,430
So I thought maybe
you'd have an extra seat.

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,999
Yeah, great, okay.

91
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,309
All right, well, I'm just gonna go to the
hot tub because I am so stressed out.

92
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,630
Finals, you know.

93
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,678
Okay.

94
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,072
That's very nice of her
to come home to support her sister.

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,879
Yeah, really nice.

96
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,793
- Father.
- Son.

97
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,393
I just wanted to make sure
you had the camera charged.

98
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,269
I do. Although you'll have to explain
to your nana the whole Ofoto concept.

99
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,510
- She's not good with the Internet.
- Sure.

100
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,591
And when they announce my name...

101
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,036
...could you not do that cheer
you did for me...

102
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,919
...when I won Capture the Flag
at Parents' Weekend?

103
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,511
Which cheer was that?

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,990
<i>Check out my boy, Cohen</i>
<i>Can you believe how he's grown?</i>

105
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,832
<i>The competition, away he's blown</i>

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,515
That's the one.
Please, don't do that ever.

107
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,468
Despite everything,
I'm still very proud of you.

108
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,189
Yeah. Damn it, why does Sandy Cohen
have to be the best father ever?

109
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,634
This is too hard.

110
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,758
Dad, I smoked a joint,
I forgot to put it out.

111
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,195
That's what started the fire.

112
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,550
I appreciate you coming clean.

113
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,753
- What I can't forgive is all the lying.
- Yeah, I know.

114
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,878
You smoke dope, you didn't tell me
the truth about Brown...

115
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,951
...and that you couldn't come to me.

116
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,470
Well, I was embarrassed.

117
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,154
What? We're your parents.

118
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,675
- We specialize in embarrassing you.
- Yeah, I know.

119
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,990
But I felt like
I couldn't really talk to you.

120
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,354
I tried a couple of times,
but you were busy with work...

121
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,272
...and I was afraid of upsetting Mom.

122
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,430
I understand that.

123
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,191
And I'm sorry.

124
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,669
- Well, we both screwed up.
- We're both usually so awesome.

125
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,831
Well, this is still very serious, isn't it?

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,594
Couple of hundred of thousands
of dollars in damages...

127
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,957
...offices that have to be rebuilt,
and I need to speak to the police.

128
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,509
Yeah. Yeah, I figured.

129
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,477
But you know what?

130
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,389
I don't want any of that
standing in the way of today.

131
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,872
Your mother and I have been looking
forward to this moment for forever.

132
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,434
No cheer.

133
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,515
No cheer. How about a hug?

134
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,791
Sure.

135
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,396
- Thanks, Dad.
- I love you, kid.

136
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,677
I can't say "I love you"
to another man.

137
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,718
But I have much affection
for you as well.

138
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,709
- Hey!
- Hey!

139
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,110
- Is everything okay?
- Can you sit?

140
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,555
Oh, okay.

141
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,438
- Well, how's your dad?
- Really good, actually.

142
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,318
He's not getting beat up
by anyone...

143
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,550
...and he's not in charge
of anyone's money.

144
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,073
That's good.

145
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,800
He's actually sailing
really nice boats for rich people.

146
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,555
- Sounds like fun.
- I know. That's what I thought.

147
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,109
Oh, you wanna, like, rent a yacht?
We totally should.

148
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,191
More like work on one.

149
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,357
See my dad's captain of a yacht
that's sailing to the Greek islands...

150
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,080
...and he says they need
extra crew members.

151
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,549
So he asked me if I wanted to go.

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,270
- You don't know how to sail boats.
- This would be more like, you know...

153
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,670
...peeling potatoes, washing dishes.

154
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,479
Oh, yes, much more
in your area of expertise.

155
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,272
But it's just for a year.

156
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,595
- What about college?
- What about college?

157
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,150
I'm not meant for college.
Not now, anyway.

158
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,599
You guys are all leaving.
I'm gonna be stuck here alone.

159
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,473
I need a new life. I need a change.

160
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,313
Well, scrubbing decks
would definitely be a change.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,195
But it's kind of
the perfect graduation present.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,072
And you know, this way
I can hang out with my dad.

163
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,754
He seems to have turned it around.

164
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,831
- When would you leave?
- Well, that's the only thing.

165
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,679
The boat's leaving Hawaii
in the middle of the week...

166
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,310
...so I'd have to fly out
tomorrow night.

167
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,630
My dad also kind of included
the plane ticket.

168
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,637
If you promise to sail up
to Rhode Island, I'm in.

169
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,312
- I love you.
- Me too.

170
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,718
Wherever you're going,
hopefully they have a Laundromat.

171
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,269
- What about the cops?
- I didn't see them.

172
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,829
- Maybe you're just being paranoid.
- No, no. I just...

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,309
I gotta get out of here.
I'm waiting for some cash.

174
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,756
You can make that money in no time.
If you want to go, go.

175
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,668
Unless it's not money
you're waiting for.

176
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,154
Get in. Let's go.

177
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,478
You're still thinking about Marissa,
aren't you?

178
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,597
I mean, you cheated on her and now
you can't stop thinking about her.

179
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,990
I asked you for clothes, okay,
not opinions.

180
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,515
God, you chicks
and your opinions, man.

181
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,274
So this girl's the best thing
that ever happened to you.

182
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,351
You freaked out, ruined it...

183
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,590
...and now you regret it.
- You could walk.

184
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,594
And now what? You think that you're
gonna convince her to go to Mexico?

185
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,757
This is it. Never gonna have
to step foot in this stupid school...

186
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,753
...this stupid student lounge again.
- Nostalgic already, huh?

187
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,196
Never gonna have to see any
of these shoe-peeing, shallow...

188
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,998
...water-polo playing...

189
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,152
Get out of my way, geek.
What is that? A dress?

190
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,554
It's a graduation gown.
You're wearing one too.

191
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,551
Queer admitted to wearing a gown.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,353
Hey!

193
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,998
Hey, you guys look so cute.

194
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,037
Is everything okay at home?

195
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,191
Sandy and I got
a little man-boy love going.

196
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,634
- Hey.
- Hey.

197
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,519
Graduates, let's step outside
for the processional.

198
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,592
- Ryan, can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure, yeah.

199
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,155
So, what do you think?

200
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,874
You think it's
the stupidest idea ever, right?

201
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,589
No, it sounds great.
It's what you need.

202
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,919
That means a lot to me.

203
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,598
You know, who would've thought
you'd be going to college?

204
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,591
And you'd be doing manual labor?

205
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,513
Well, everyone's doing exactly
what they need to.

206
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,750
Yeah.

207
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,674
Hey, this is gonna sound weird,
but can I drive you to the airport?

208
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,478
You're the first person I met here.

209
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,234
I'd kind of like to be
the last person to say goodbye.

210
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,433
You know, it's funny,
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

211
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,158
Hey!

212
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,028
Let's go graduate. Come on!

213
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,593
They say there's no one older
than a high school senior.

214
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,112
But no one younger
than a college freshman.

215
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,869
Well, I guess now we'll find out
as we begin our journey.

216
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,793
Daniel Aaron.

217
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,950
Ryan Atwood.

218
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,519
<i>But as Cicero said:</i>

219
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,871
"I hope the memory of our friendship
will be everlasting."

220
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,314
Seth Cohen.

221
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,119
All right, Sethy! All right!

222
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,876
- Marissa Cooper.
- Yeah!

223
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,678
<i>And just because we're leaving Harbor,</i>
<i>does not mean that our learning is done.</i>

224
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,876
We must learn as long as we may live.

225
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,718
Alex Petsovich.

226
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,080
Summer Roberts.

227
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,994
<i>But if I can leave you all</i>
<i>with one final word of advice:</i>

228
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,600
Don't let the bastards get you down.

229
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,479
Thank you.

230
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,753
And it has been my pleasure
to teach you, to watch you grow...

231
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,672
...and now enter the world.

232
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,676
Good luck.

233
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,229
It is my honor to present to you...

234
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,712
...the Harbor School class of 2006.

235
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,078
There's no such thing as a little racist.

236
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,879
- Okay.
- Come on. You're kidding!

237
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,878
Excuse me. Forgive me,
but I'm a very proud father...

238
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,632
...and I wanna say a few words.

239
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,509
I think I can speak for Kirsten
and the other parents here tonight...

240
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,557
...when I tell you
how thrilled we are...

241
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,234
...to share this wonderful
touchstone with you.

242
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,197
We love you guys.

243
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,873
I know the last few years
have been a roller coaster...

244
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,909
There's been tragedy and comedy...

245
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,550
...and first loves and broken hearts.

246
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,832
Family members lost and found.

247
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,719
It hasn't all been perfect,
but we're all family here.

248
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,992
So cheers.

249
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,509
Cheers.

250
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,793
His speech wasn't that moving.

251
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,838
No, it's just so sad, you know?

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,468
I mean, it's all over. No more Harbor...

253
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,153
...Atwood's going to Berkeley...

254
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,551
...Marissa's sailing around the world,
I'm going to Rhode Island.

255
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,312
- I'll be there.
- We don't know yet.

256
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,517
- We haven't heard form RISD.
- Well, whatever happens you know...

257
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,079
...we'll make it work.

258
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,595
- We will?
- Yeah, of course.

259
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,115
That's sweet.

260
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,840
Are you gonna do this all summer?

261
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,229
Hey, can I talk to you?

262
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,358
Yes, of course. Oh, I have
to give you your graduation gift.

263
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,310
Honey, what's wrong?

264
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,519
I kind of have some big news.

265
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,233
- Sweetie, I know.
- You know?

266
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,879
Your father called me last week.

267
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,396
Ran the idea by me,
wanted to know what I thought.

268
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,312
And what do you think?

269
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,677
I think that I will miss you terribly...

270
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,955
...and that if you really want to leave,
I need to let you go.

271
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,272
I knew about it too.

272
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,634
- You did?
- You did?

273
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,670
Dad, he called me. Threw the idea
by me, asked my opinion...

274
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,230
...and also told me that you might need
another daughter to worry about.

275
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,794
So that's why I decided
to come home.

276
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,473
For good.

277
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,275
Oh, my God.

278
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,391
Cooper family hug. Come on.

279
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,755
- Mom, okay.
- Mom, okay.

280
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,990
Oh, your gift. Here.

281
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,038
I don't know how much good
it'll be on a boat.

282
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,478
Oh, Mom, it's beautiful.

283
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,916
Maybe you'll get attacked by pirates.
You can barter it.

284
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,749
- So where are we going, huh?
- Just trust me.

285
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,514
I trust you but...

286
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,159
What?

287
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,358
You got me a car?

288
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,710
You got me a car?
You got me a car?!

289
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,189
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

290
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,669
I love it. Are you kidding?
How did you...?

291
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,671
I've been saving up for a little while.

292
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,116
And Ron, my boyfriend, he knows
this guy who restores old cars...

293
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,669
...so that helped pay for the parts.
But I got the bow.

294
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,315
Car and bow. Amazing.

295
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,559
I don't know what to say.

296
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,314
Come here. Come here.

297
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,431
You wanna drive me home
in your new ride?

298
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,795
- Sure. Yeah.
- Okay. I'll get my purse.

299
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,598
Okay.

300
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,992
And here.

301
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,679
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

302
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,273
I stopped by to say farewell.

303
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,953
You're leaving for the Sorbonne?

304
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,715
Not quite. Seung Ho and I decided to
spend the summer in his family's village.

305
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,632
We're diffusing land mines
in the DMZ.

306
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,950
That's a way to spend
your summer vacation.

307
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,917
What about the after-grad party?

308
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,675
As a gift to the class of 2006.

309
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,757
So my work here is done. It has been
a pleasure being second-circle core.

310
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,912
- I think you can join the inner circle.
- I can?

311
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,430
Oh, my God! The fab five.

312
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,752
- I'm so happy and so sad.
- I know. Me too.

313
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,396
This is awkward. I was sort of kidding
about the inner circle thing.

314
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,072
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

315
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,435
- Why are you calling me?
- Look, I'm really sorry, okay?

316
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,990
And I wanna make it up to you.
So I got a plan.

317
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,470
Oh, yeah? Well, I've got a plan too.
It's called never seeing you again.

318
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,358
If I don't get a chance to see you...

319
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,478
...then I'm gonna make life real bad
for your friend Ryan.

320
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,596
Don't threaten me or Ryan.

321
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,309
No, no, no. It's not a threat.
Ask him about the car that we stole.

322
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,192
- This is cool.
- Yeah, yeah. It's a gift from my mom.

323
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,238
Oh, yeah?
So it's not the one you stole.

324
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,114
Volchok called me.

325
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,475
- Look, the whole thing is...
- Complicated?

326
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,549
- What does he want?
- Money to get out of town.

327
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,356
- And you have this money?
- Not yet, but...

328
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,590
- Let me help you.
- It's all right. I got it.

329
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,594
Ryan, I brought Volchok on us.
It's only fair I help get rid of him.

330
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,234
Come on.
We're in this together, okay?

331
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,390
- One last time.
- One last time.

332
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,957
Thanks so much. I mean it.

333
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,957
- You're welcome.
- For everything.

334
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,873
- For the cab.
- Oh, God, no.

335
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,473
- Oh, come on.
- No, I got it.

336
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,318
- All right. Thank you.
- Thank you.

337
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,550
- Okay.
- Good to see you.

338
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,994
My turn.

339
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,754
Okay, I'm gonna try and say goodbye
without losing it.

340
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,992
Mom, why don't we just not say
goodbye. How about see you soon?

341
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,554
- See you soon.
- See you soon?

342
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,756
- See you soon, babe.
- All right.

343
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,197
- Love you.
- Love you too.

344
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,352
Hey, Seth.

345
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,596
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

346
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,478
It means a lot that you made it down.

347
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,796
I was being sincere.

348
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,996
- Okay, so...
- And thanks again for the car.

349
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,152
- You bet.
- Ryan got a car?

350
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,153
Really? I've been waiting three years
for a car.

351
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,512
I'm supposed to be the spoiled one.

352
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,955
- See you, kid.
- All right. Bye.

353
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,831
Hey. Marissa, easy on the bass.

354
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,316
Oh, Kaitlin. What are you doing?
Where's your sister?

355
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,948
Oh, Marissa went to go
rendezvous with Ryan.

356
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,435
And you thought you'd do
some renovations for her?

357
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,955
Well, yeah, she said
I could have her room.

358
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,112
I left some paint chips in the kitchen,
if you wanna go look.

359
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,031
Oh, is this going to be
a permanent picture?

360
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,071
Well, I worked really hard on that.

361
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,470
Seems like you and Marissa
are on good terms now.

362
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,110
Yeah, figures.
Just as she's about to set sail.

363
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,151
Pretty cool that you're letting her go.

364
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,635
Pretty cool that you came back
so she can leave.

365
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,671
Well, I don't love Marissa that much.

366
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,714
Just, all the older kids, they just
see me as Marissa's little sister.

367
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,959
They've graduated,
and now I can rule Harbor.

368
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,039
Hey. Your mom left, huh?

369
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,958
- It went well.
- Yeah, really well.

370
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,232
We get this out of the way,
we'll have nothing left to worry about.

371
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,836
- I don't know what I'll do with myself.
- Oh, I'm sure you'll figure it out.

372
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,514
Your mom won't be offended?

373
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,708
Well, I feel bad, but she did say
I could use it to barter with pirates.

374
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,030
- This seems to fit the bill.
- Yeah, definitely.

375
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,031
So, I'll navigate us to the pawn shop.

376
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,918
No, I'll go. Give me the directions.

377
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,237
- I thought we decided I was coming.
- I'm gonna handle this myself.

378
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,434
Okay, if you come, you stay in the car.

379
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,757
- You know what?
- What?

380
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,957
I'm really gonna miss you
bossing me around.

381
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,270
- You'll get used to it.
- Nope, nope.

382
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,714
- Yes.
- The rest of my life...

383
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,757
...I'm gonna be sad about it.

384
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,031
- Hey. Yeah.
- Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

385
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,873
If you came to haggle me
on the Ramirez plea, forget it.

386
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,237
- I'm up to my ass in unhappy ADAs.
- No, no, I'm just passing through.

387
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,398
What, did you come to
admire the wainscoting?

388
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,709
- This is my old office.
- You're Sandy Cohen?

389
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,714
My reputation precedes me?

390
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,356
- Self-righteous, arrogant, a little nutso?
- I see that it does.

391
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,239
- Jason Spitz.
- Nice to meet you.

392
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,032
Nice to meet you. You're a legend.

393
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,590
Not to mention, I heard about your
post-victory karaoke bar performances.

394
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,392
Defend the poor, sing the classics.

395
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,437
I had a reputation and a routine.

396
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,596
You went to some
high-powered private firm?

397
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,509
Oh, for a minute. Then I went into
the private sector, into big business.

398
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,280
Why did you want to leave this dump?
Long hours, no pay.

399
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,716
Not to mention, the worst coffee
in Southern California.

400
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,668
Believe it or not, working here
were the best days of my life.

401
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,837
Yeah, right.

402
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,874
Grass is always greener.

403
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,951
- Coffee's always fresher.
- Sandy Cohen.

404
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,997
- Greg.
- Back at the PD's office, huh?

405
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,589
- Thanks for meeting on neutral ground.
- Ready to talk?

406
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,233
Yeah. Spitz.

407
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,319
- Nice meeting you.
- Hey, what are they asking for?

408
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,988
With a B and E with no priors?
You gotta be kidding.

409
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,838
Come in.

410
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,832
Hey, what are you doing?

411
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,470
I'm in my third month on this book.
I'm hoping to have it finished by fall.

412
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,076
Hard to believe you're done with school.
You're not a kid anymore.

413
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,271
Let's be honest.
I was never very kid-like.

414
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,277
You always were an old soul.

415
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,319
- Mom, I want you to know...
- You don't have to apologize.

416
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,114
That fire was the best thing
that could have happened.

417
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,550
Well, then I did it on purpose.

418
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,999
Your father's talking to the lawyers,
and hopefully, you'll be free and clear.

419
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,390
Okay, good. Just have to wait and
hear from RISD.

420
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,030
Speaking of which, I think there's
some mail you might be interested in.

421
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,356
The pearls would have
looked good on you.

422
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,239
- Hey, funny kid. You got the money?
- Yup.

423
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,990
- Can use it to start over.
- Thanks, Ranger Rick.

424
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,516
- Save your speeches for the Boy Scouts.
- Ranger Rick. That hurts.

425
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,358
- Whatever, man, we're done.
- Not yet.

426
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,192
- I wanna talk.
- Send her a postcard.

427
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,759
- Marissa?
- Come on, let's go.

428
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,679
I just want to talk to you, okay?
Wait. Wait!

429
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,472
I just want to talk to you. Don't...

430
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,477
Wait!

431
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,554
Hey, honey.

432
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,111
So, I guess this is it, huh?

433
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,398
Yeah. I guess so.

434
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,149
Marissa, I just want you
to know that...

435
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,713
...everything I ever did,
good, bad, or otherwise...

436
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,194
...I did it for you.

437
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,311
So you could have
a better life than I had.

438
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,190
And I know I wasn't perfect.
I mean, the thing with Luke...

439
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,719
...and trying to frame Ryan...

440
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,996
...for attempted homicide...
- Mom.

441
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,559
I love you. Okay? Just know that.

442
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,435
Oh, sweetheart, that's all I wanted.
I love you too.

443
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,396
Besides, you know the strength it takes
to start over, to go out on my own?

444
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,791
That has to come from being
Julie Cooper's daughter.

445
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,517
- I am spirited, aren't I?
- Yeah.

446
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,432
Hey, Ryan and Seth are here.

447
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,871
All right. I guess I better go.

448
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,237
You gotta promise to keep things
interesting for Mom next year, okay?

449
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,000
- Oh, that won't be a problem.
- Wait.

450
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,196
One more Cooper family hug.

451
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,912
Do you know where this party is?

452
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,277
I think it's in the flower streets.
It could be in the number streets.

453
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,510
- I'll check the Evite.
- Can I ask a question?

454
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,511
Why are we going to
a lame Harbor party?

455
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,199
Yeah, it's Marissa's last night.

456
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,198
Well, we always wind up just
talking to each other.

457
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,153
- All right, so Bait Shop? Diner?
- Yeah.

458
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,909
Wait, I know somewhere
where we could go.

459
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,914
You're gonna have to follow
in your car.

460
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,633
It's a little something,
just because I love you.

461
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,155
- Flowers usually means bad news.
- Oh, ye of little faith.

462
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,954
No, I spoke to the DA,
came clean about the accident.

463
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,270
Since we're not gonna press charges,
the whole thing will blow over.

464
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,994
Then it's back to the Newport Group?
Business as usual?

465
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,230
Well, how about not?

466
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,150
Went back to my old office.
The place looked worse than ever.

467
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,756
The guy in there was beaten down,
exhausted.

468
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,350
It was a thing of beauty.

469
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,754
You wanna go back.

470
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,510
- Where are the kids?
- At some party.

471
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,188
And then Ryan's taking Marissa
to the airport.

472
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,832
So this is what it'll be like
all next year, huh?

473
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,351
Empty nest.

474
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,278
What does one do in an empty nest?

475
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,837
Oh, I have a few ideas.

476
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,639
- Okay, this looks familiar.
- Yeah, well, it shouldn't.

477
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,076
They rebuilt it completely
after you burned it down.

478
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,911
- Model home.
- Yup.

479
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,430
It's for sale and
it's completely deserted.

480
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,914
Ever wonder what life would
be like if Atwood never came?

481
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,793
- I never would have talked to Seth.
- Hell no, me either.

482
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,519
See, you owe me one, buddy.

483
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,917
Me? She'd still be dating the dude
who shaves his chest.

484
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,916
I can't believe it for a minute
I was actually interested in Atwood.

485
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,314
Wait, no offense.

486
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,272
- None taken.
- It was only until...

487
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,152
...you found out he was from Chino.
- Exactly.

488
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,675
You actually invited me to
Holly's beach house.

489
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,675
- Oh, my God.
- You said she invited me.

490
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm not fairing well in
this trip down memory lane.

491
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,476
Well, as fun as it usually is
making fun of Seth...

492
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,949
...I think it's time I should go.

493
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,194
Here come the waterworks.

494
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,596
I can't believe
I'm saying goodbye to you.

495
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,472
I know.

496
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,753
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

497
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,751
You're my best friend forever, okay?

498
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,629
If you hook up with
some hot, Greek shipping heir...

499
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,354
...I'm so your maid of honor.
- I know.

500
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,832
- See you.
- All right. See you later.

501
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,036
Guys, hug!

502
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,878
All right.

503
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,390
Bye. I'm gonna go get changed.

504
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,276
- All right. See you in a while.
- Okay.

505
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,876
- You okay?
- Yeah.

506
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,153
So weird talking about that night.

507
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,313
Last time we were here,
I was leaving, and now you are.

508
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,758
That night, did you ever think
we'd end up together?

509
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,196
You saying it's over?

510
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,631
You never know, right?

511
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,797
I'm sorry for all the craziness.

512
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,554
I wouldn't have done it
any differently.

513
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,674
Except maybe Oliver.

514
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,038
Me too.

515
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,757
Okay. Showing me a fun time,
stalking rich kids.

516
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,034
Maybe I should drive.

517
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,511
No.

518
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,473
- Whoa, what is this?
- Your graduation present.

519
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,353
Oh, my God, it's a 60-inch,
high-def flat screen.

520
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,192
Maybe.

521
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,189
- It's empty.
- No, it's not.

522
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,431
What is this?

523
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,679
"Dear Mr. Cohen, while your application
arrived too late for our fall semester...

524
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,198
...we are happy to announce that
your application has been approved."

525
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,913
- You got in!
- Yeah.

526
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,399
I start in January.

527
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,155
Let me just say again how sorry I am
for messing up the college thing...

528
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,238
...and lying to you and hurting you...
- Hey.

529
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,198
It's okay. Everything happened
the way it was supposed to.

530
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,270
Well, then I did it on purpose.

531
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,637
Okay, so, I'll go to Rhode Island and
I'll get the lay of the land.

532
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,070
Thanksgiving, Christmas,
then we'll be together.

533
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,959
- I think I might cry again.
- Tears of joy?

534
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,433
- Come on. Come into the box.
- This is so romantic.

535
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,069
What are we doing?

536
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,318
So are you okay?

537
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,916
Are you ready for this?

538
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,599
I have no idea.
I mean, what about you?

539
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,109
You're leaving the Cohens,
doing the college thing.

540
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,191
- I'm terrified.
- Me too.

541
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,999
So if you ever wanna talk or e-mail,
if they have that...

542
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,715
- I don't know how boats work...
- I'll find a way to stay in touch.

543
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,880
- What's that?
- This guy's following me. Go ahead!

544
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,957
Go ahead, pass.

545
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,753
What is he doing?

546
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,834
- What the hell?
- All right, hold on, hold on.

547
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,310
Oh, my God. It's him.

548
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,395
What are you doing?

549
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,678
- Okay, pull over.
- Where?

550
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,950
Stop! What the hell are you doing?

551
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,316
I'm gonna get him to pull the car over
so I can finally finish this.

552
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,752
- Get away, okay...
- Pull over!

553
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,231
Stop it!

554
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,958
Ryan! Look out!

555
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,396
Hold on!

556
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,917
Marissa.

557
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,270
Marissa.

558
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,910
Marissa.

559
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,997
Marissa. Marissa. Marissa.

560
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,671
Ryan. Ryan. Ryan.

561
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,435
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm gonna go get help, okay?

562
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,953
- Gotta get help.
- Don't leave.

563
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,912
- Yeah, I gotta get help.
- No. No.

564
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,192
No. Stay.

565
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,072
Don't leave.

566
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,794
Okay.

567
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,238
Hold on. Hold on, okay? Okay?

568
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,034
Hold on, hold on.

569
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,111
You're gonna be okay.

570
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,037
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

571
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,634
It's gonna be okay.

572
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,350
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

573
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,954
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

574
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,192
Marissa.

575
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,513
Marissa.

576
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,953
Marissa!

577
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,795
No. No.

578
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,831
