1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,989
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,195
So how was Berkeley?

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,396
- Was it amazing?
- Could be, if I was ready for it.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,272
I'm not looking after her anymore.
Treat her right.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,675
I saw Theresa at the airport.
She had a baby with her.

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,791
- Say hi, Daniel.
- Hi, Daniel.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,673
- He's not yours. Eddie's the father.
- You wanna grab a bite?

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,235
- You can tell me about him?
- Yeah, I'd like that.

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,954
To Sandy Cohen,
who has told me countless times...

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,276
...how important
this hospital is to him.

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,596
They say when you grow up, you marry
your father. I thought I'd escaped that.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,713
All my sins. Very detailed. If I ever
screw up again, give that to my parents.

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,148
- Cohen?
- Anna?

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,912
So you are going to Brown.

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,192
- You just didn't wanna come with me.
- You're probably confused right now.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,113
No. Everything you've done
up until now finally makes sense.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,914
- Rhode Island School of Design?
- You'll be in the same state.

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,350
Seth is going to Brown,
and he's dating Anna?

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,199
It's senior prom. It's mythic.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,193
Yeah, well, it's ties and dresses
and photos with parents.

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,557
- Sounds like any other dance.
- It's not. It's the romantic capstone...

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,792
...to your entire adolescence.
If Summer and I don't go together...

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,269
...it's over.
- Well, ask her.

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,079
She's still not talking to me.

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,674
You told her nothing's going on
between you and Anna?

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,031
I try, but every time we get close,
she blows her rape whistle.

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,077
- Rape.
- Well, you know, I'm not going.

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,356
So if you wanna hang out,
rent a movie...

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,597
Ryan, I love you, but if I have
to spend my senior prom playing...

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,389
...video games with you, I'll kill myself.
Besides, I left Summer a message...

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,755
...telling her I'll meet her.
- She'll show?

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,634
I kind of pretended
I was a Brown admissions guy.

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,995
- It's prom, anything goes. Hi.
- What will it be?

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,474
- Chicken.
- I'll have beef.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,272
Why aren't you gonna ask someone?

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,273
What about Tina Wu?
She's been looking really hot lately.

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,636
- What about Theresa?
- Yeah, I don't think so.

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,549
- You've been spending time with her.
- I have. She's coming to the house.

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,035
The baby thing's resolved,
the pressure's off.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,231
- It's perfect. Do it.
- She still has a baby.

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,949
- She can't just, you know...
- They have things called babysitters.

42
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,635
I'm just saying, it's senior prom,
she's your childhood sweetheart.

43
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,360
You have to respect
the romantic symmetry.

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,840
I'll think about it.
I appreciate you not bringing up...

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,390
...Marissa and I going as friends.
- Well, I get it, it's in the past.

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,989
Plus, I assume she'll be going
with the surf-Nazi...

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,118
...unless he's selling crack
to blind kids...

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,275
...or fondling some girl
at the end of the pier.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,991
Maybe that's his cousin.

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,031
His really dirty cousin.

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,478
- Hi. Leave.
- Okay, Summer...

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,114
- No, I'm meeting someone. You, leave.
- The Brown guy?

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,913
How did you know that?

54
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,113
I'm sorry, it's the only way
I could get you to meet me.

55
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,436
You are sick, you know that? Deranged.

56
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,397
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,118
No, our kiss was on Halloween.

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,794
It was my sixth birthday.
My mom let me have dancing.

59
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,157
- You didn't know how, so you hid.
- You tracked me down and kissed me.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,312
- How did I ever block that out?
- I don't know.

61
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,320
This is crazy, do you wanna
go to prom with me?

62
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,949
What?

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,634
Okay.

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,268
Wait, that's not why I'm here.

65
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,196
So you're gonna
think I'm really lame...

66
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,393
...but would you maybe wanna
go to prom with me?

67
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,753
You're serious?

68
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,957
Give me two minutes. I ordered
pancakes for you, chocolate chip.

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,154
- Fine, two minutes, but that is it.
- Okay.

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,393
Somebody wrote "prom"
on my pancakes. That is so weird.

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,959
- Weird.
- Oh, my God.

72
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,755
Yeah, it's tomorrow night.
So it's kind of late notice, but...

73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,511
Or not.
You know what, it's a bad idea.

74
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,911
No, Ryan, it's just that
there's this guy that I work with.

75
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,036
And we're not really dating,
or anything...

76
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,270
...but we've become close.
- No, I understand.

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,193
- I should probably get ready for school.
- Okay.

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,157
So, what, you just hate prom?

79
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,438
Pretty much.

80
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,757
Why? Did you have
a bad prom experience?

81
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,475
I've heard there's support groups
for things like that. You could recover.

82
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,269
I haven't spoken to you in four days. You
think pancakes will make me forget...

83
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,158
...you and Anna went
behind my back?

84
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,158
- We did not...
- Or that I saw you guys at the airport...

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,515
...in your long, tearful goodbye.

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,359
- You know...
- What?

87
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,876
Did I ever tell you how much
my mom loves babysitting?

88
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,076
l... I never actually made it to prom.

89
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,754
I...

90
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,394
I didn't get that close to graduation.

91
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,669
Well, all the more reason to go now...

92
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,638
...because you'll have me there
to protect you.

93
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,273
Okay?

94
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,793
All right.

95
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,310
Not only will I not
go to prom with you...

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,751
...but if you and I were on an island,
I'd take the nourishment...

97
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,152
...that your meager frame has to offer,
then I'd feed your bones to the sharks.

98
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,394
- So did she like the pancake?
- Yeah, she loved it.

99
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,915
Then she said if we were
stranded on an island...

100
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,675
...she'd feed my bones to the sharks.
I think it's hopeless.

101
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,549
- Wait, she doesn't really think that we...
- She saw us hugging in the airport.

102
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,320
Oh, my God, this is all my fault.

103
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,391
<i>- No, it's not your fault.</i>
- Yes, it is.

104
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,120
If I hadn't been there,
then you would have made up...

105
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,192
...and you would be going
to prom right now.

106
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,955
- You have to tell her the truth.
- I tried, but...

107
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,874
<i>No, not about us. You have to tell her</i>
<i>that you lied about getting into Brown.</i>

108
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,190
- I don't think I can do that.
- But you have to.

109
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,430
You've no choice.
You've done everything else.

110
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,353
I know, but last time I lied...

111
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,318
...I had to write this confession,
everything I'd done wrong.

112
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,029
<i>- My whole drug phase and...</i>
- You had a drug phase?

113
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,959
I smoked a couple of joints.
I promised I'd never lie again.

114
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,352
- I don't think she's gonna forgive me.
- She wants to feed your bones to sharks.

115
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,752
- You have nothing to lose.
- <i>Listen, Anna, I appreciate your help...</i>

116
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,434
<i>... but, I don 't know, it's over.</i>
<i>I give up.</i>

117
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,199
Anyways...

118
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,915
<i>... I'm gonna talk to you later.</i>

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,272
Man.

120
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,632
You off?

121
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,997
I should be home in time for dinner.
Hey, isn't this prom weekend?

122
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,993
Weren't you talking about
having everybody over for pictures?

123
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,474
We did.

124
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,916
Ryan doesn't have a date. Seth and
Summer seem to be in some fight.

125
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,119
That's too bad.
It's senior prom. It's a milestone.

126
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,551
Maybe we should try
and convince them to go.

127
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,631
Okay.

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,711
When are we gonna talk about us?

129
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,150
In public again,
or were you thinking about...

130
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,357
...something more private this time?
- I'm sorry I attacked you.

131
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,919
- But at least I got you to listen.
- I'm sorry I made it so difficult for you.

132
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,878
- So, what do we do?
- We should give the boys the weekend.

133
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,077
They're gonna be gone
in a few months.

134
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,473
And then you and I can figure out
how best to proceed.

135
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,478
- I'm gonna go.
- Sandy, there's something else.

136
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,590
At the end of that dinner, I...

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,879
- I just wish I'd apologized then.
- Oh, that's okay.

138
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,392
We'll be fine.

139
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,876
- Oh, Summer.
- Hey, Taylor.

140
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,554
Summer, wait.
I have a big surprise for you.

141
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,234
But first, here are yours
and Marissa's prom tickets.

142
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,432
I need 50 bucks each for the after-party.
I rented The Bait Shop.

143
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,919
It is gonna be such a rager.

144
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,072
- You know what, I don't think I'll go.
- You were queen last year.

145
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,310
- You have to go.
- Well, the queen is dead.

146
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,829
I see. Well, perhaps you would like
to hear who your date is.

147
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,834
- What are you talking about?
- I got you a date.

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,514
Quiet. Now, you know
how I'm going with Seung Ho?

149
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,193
The guy from the Korean barbecue?

150
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,999
We totally found each
other at the sweatshirt party.

151
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,555
He's got this wonderfully
hairless body.

152
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,278
It's like hooking up with a seal.

153
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,311
- I have to go.
- So it turns out...

154
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,071
...his cousin, Young Nam, is visiting from
Seoul. His English is a little <i>gju grae.</i>

155
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,754
But Seung Ho says he's huge
on the K-Pop scene.

156
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,516
- What the hell is K-Pop?
- Korean pop. K-Pop.

157
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,399
Anyway, his band's called Big Korea,
and he's a model too.

158
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,676
They based a couple
of anime characters on him.

159
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,274
I'm not gonna go to prom
with some Asian pop singer...

160
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,199
...that barely speaks English.
- Summer.

161
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,073
Cohen deceived you.
It is your duty as a woman...

162
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,748
...to make him pathetic
and small by going to prom...

163
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,837
...with the hottest guy you can find.

164
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,273
That's a good point.

165
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,840
- Are you sure he's hot?
- At his last concert...

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,594
...a gang of crazed schoolgirls
torched a cop car.

167
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,633
Big Korea.

168
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,076
Hey. How you doing?

169
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,071
Hey. Good.

170
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,994
- Are those prom tickets?
- Yeah. I asked someone.

171
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,950
Theresa, actually.

172
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,032
Well, that's great.

173
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,519
- Yeah.
- So the baby...

174
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,478
Really cute, but not mine.

175
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,593
What about you? Are you going?

176
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,274
I can't remember whether you
and Volchok are together...

177
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,879
Yeah, on both counts.

178
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,316
- Yeah?
- He wasn't exactly enthusiastic...

179
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,118
...but he said yes.

180
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,233
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah.

181
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,271
- I should be getting to class.
- Right.

182
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,158
Congratulations on the Theresa thing.

183
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,196
- See you.
- See you.

184
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,552
- <i>Hey, it's Summer, leave a message.</i>
- Summer, hey.

185
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,790
I just wanna apologize
for what happened...

186
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,997
...in the girls' bathroom today.
I didn't mean to follow you in...

187
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,798
...or spook Mrs. Rushfield.

188
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,918
I was just trying to explain
that the idea of a romance...

189
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,038
...between me
and Anna is so insane that it...

190
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,873
- Hello, Seth.
- I gotta go.

191
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,597
Yeah, yeah. All right, all right, all right.

192
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,829
- Well, well, look who's here.
- I wanna talk to you.

193
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,799
- I'm not in the mood to talk. Try later.
- You can listen.

194
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,949
- I saw you on the pier last night.
- Last night, last night...

195
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,351
- I don't remember that far back.
- You remember the girl you were with?

196
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,393
Long hair, tattoos,
not much like Marissa.

197
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,152
You know, you are something else.

198
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,999
But tell me this,
why would I cheat on Marissa?

199
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,670
I mean, that girl is hot, right?

200
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,798
In every way.

201
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,471
But then you already knew that,
didn't you?

202
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,915
You wanna see how far
you can push me? Keep at it.

203
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,556
I already fell for that
<i>Lethal Weapon</i> psycho bit once.

204
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,359
- It's not happening again.
- Hey, Kevin, I think there's...

205
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,512
...like, a snake in the shower...

206
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,469
- What are you doing here?
- Yeah, Ryan.

207
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,471
What are you doing here?

208
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,594
Kirsten called. She's having people over
for photos tomorrow...

209
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,792
...and I just thought I'd invite you.
- Oh, that's really sweet.

210
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,033
- Yeah, so sweet. So sweet.
- Okay, ignore him. We'll be there.

211
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,154
Yeah.

212
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,599
Hello.

213
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,194
- Hey.
- Hi. Anna.

214
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,272
Seth said you were in town.
Hey, how are you?

215
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,431
I'm good.
And you look much more grownup.

216
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,751
- Don't we all. You staying with parents?
- My aunt and uncle.

217
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,918
Last year, my parents switched houses.
We're a quirky family.

218
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,038
- Are you going to prom?
- Yeah. Actually, I'm going with Theresa.

219
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,232
There she is.
Look, a true friend, Ryan.

220
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,960
- Two thousand miles she flies.
- In a middle seat.

221
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,196
All to make sure
Summer and I go together.

222
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,828
- Tell me, would you do so much?
- Let's not test it.

223
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,632
Guilt can be a powerful motivator.

224
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,513
I'd tell you it's not your fault,
except I wanna hear this plan.

225
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,269
- In phase one...
- Hear that, Ryan? Phase one.

226
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,158
That suggests multiple phases.

227
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,437
In phase one, I am going to
go over to Summer's right now...

228
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,239
...and tell her that there
is nothing going on between us.

229
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,593
Okay, out of curiosity...

230
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,389
...what do you got for phase two?
- In the off chance that phase one fails...

231
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,516
...phase two, you take me to prom.

232
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,838
I brought a dress. Yeah,
I better get going. I'll call you.

233
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,434
- See you later. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

234
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,797
I don't know, I kind of like it.

235
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,110
- I'm going to kill Taylor.
- Why?

236
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,397
- Come on, he's cute.
- How can you tell? He's in a space suit.

237
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,994
So do you think Kevin will like this?

238
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,077
Yeah, if it rips off easy.

239
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,913
This was supposed
to make Seth jealous.

240
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,716
- What's that?
- Just Seth's napkin confession...

241
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,714
...detailing all his lies and deceptions,
including his pathetic stoner phase.

242
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,957
I think it is time for Sandy and Kirsten
to know their son better.

243
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,559
What? You can't do that.

244
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,230
I can. We had a deal.
He told me that if he screwed up...

245
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,118
...I could show this to his parents.

246
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,197
Yeah, but what would be the point?

247
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,039
- Revenge.
- Don't you think that maybe...

248
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,629
...he's telling the truth
about him and Anna?

249
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,598
I mean, do you really think
that they would do that to you?

250
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,872
Hi.

251
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,199
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

252
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,676
- Oh, my God.
- No. Hi, Anna.

253
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,559
- It's good to see you again.
- You too.

254
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,591
I'm gonna go try this on.

255
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,910
What...? I need you.

256
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,755
- What are you doing here?
- Summer, I wanted to talk to you.

257
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,269
You have to believe me,
there's nothing going on...

258
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,873
...between me and Seth.

259
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,395
- You are still my Blanche, you know.
- Nice try.

260
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,473
- I saw you guys hugging at the airport.
- That was not what you think it was.

261
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,029
- We were celebrating.
- Celebrating what?

262
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,992
The future.

263
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,913
If I flew 2000 miles,
I'd come up with a better story.

264
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,634
- It's the truth. Seth...
- My date's gonna be here soon.

265
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,190
He's kind of a rock star.
You may have heard of him, Big Korea.

266
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,710
Well, I'm not surprised.
Thanks for coming by.

267
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,353
Summer...

268
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,069
Look, Summer, I'm sorry
that you don't believe me...

269
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,068
...but if you're going with someone,
would you mind if I went with Seth?

270
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,232
Why would I mind?

271
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,869
- Okay, then, see you there.
- See you.

272
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,479
So how exactly does
this plan go again?

273
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,240
Summer sees me
with Anna at the dance...

274
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,551
...and confronted with the reality
of a world without Seth Cohen...

275
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,518
...she comes to her senses.
- Because a world without you...

276
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,554
Is a world without sun, Ryan.
It's a world without warmth.

277
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,079
I don't get it either,
but we should trust Anna on this one.

278
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,391
She has more knowledge of the female
psyche than we could hope for.

279
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,352
That's so true.

280
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,074
Aren't you guys ready yet?
People are gonna be here.

281
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,915
- What is it? What's wrong?
- No, you look... I'm getting ready still.

282
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,072
- Hello. Welcome.
- These are my parents.

283
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,276
How are you? Oh, nice to see you.

284
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,829
- Come on in.
- Good to see you again.

285
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,718
You look beautiful.

286
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,916
Good to see you.

287
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,799
Thank you.

288
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,029
Hey, check it out.

289
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,312
That's Summer's date.

290
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,031
- Looks like the guy in <i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>
- Here are the Yangs, Elena and Tom.

291
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,719
Hey. How are you?

292
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,751
Hey. Oh, my God, you look beautiful.

293
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,388
You too. It's good to see you.

294
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,756
Glad you could make it.

295
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,472
Ryan, I'm so glad that you
and Seth found dates.

296
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,871
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna need 50 bucks...

297
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,430
...from each of you for the after-party.
- I'll take care of that. Here.

298
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,393
- Thank you, Mr. Cohen.
- You're welcome. Attention, everybody.

299
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,472
The limos are waiting, so, ladies,
put your purses and wraps...

300
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,474
...and things on the bar so we can
all go out to the pool and take pictures.

301
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,712
All right?

302
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,238
- Yeah, yeah.
- Where's the bathroom?

303
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,431
Down the hall.

304
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,869
Okay, you guys, we all need one
with all of the kids.

305
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,672
Get together.

306
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,557
Hey, has anyone seen Kevin?
I think he's still in the bathroom.

307
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,030
All right, I'll get him.

308
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,356
The parents wanna
take a photo of everyone.

309
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,312
We're waiting on you.

310
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,512
Fine.

311
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,597
Look.

312
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,399
What now?

313
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,109
- You gonna tell me I can't drink?
- I don't have a problem with drinking.

314
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,471
But if you screw this up for Marissa...

315
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,438
...I'm gonna kick your ass.
- Okay.

316
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,269
- Oh, my God, you know what this is?
- What?

317
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,398
This is the cave from <i>Goonies.</i>
I've died and gone to heaven.

318
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,278
Taylor, this is amazing.

319
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,074
Yeah, this is way better
than any dance I ever designed.

320
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,151
Marissa, that means so much to me.

321
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,437
You know, I've been saying that,
but no one listens.

322
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,554
Wow, you and I at prom together.
Who would've thought?

323
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,359
I know. I guess sometimes
things just work out.

324
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,515
Laughing boy. Hi. Where's that flask
you're always whipping out?

325
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,314
- You wanna spike the punch?
- Read my mind.

326
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,671
- All right. Come on over here.
- That's so unlike you.

327
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,956
Big Korea. Hi.

328
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,998
Hi. Come on. Go.

329
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,360
I'll put my purse down,
then we can hit the dance floor.

330
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,397
- Great.
- Okay.

331
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,197
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes, Seth, you just have to trust me.

332
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,669
Come on, let's go take a picture
with Captain Hook.

333
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,592
- All right.
- Come on.

334
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,192
- Oh, hi, Lisa.
- Hi.

335
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,749
- So glad you made it back for prom.
- Thanks, Taylor.

336
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,071
I wouldn't have missed it for anything.
Or almost anything.

337
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,435
- I thought you did great on <i>Idol.</i>
- Thanks.

338
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,068
Do you know where Simon
gets those skin-tight V-necks?

339
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,549
I totally wanna get one for Seung Ho.

340
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,035
Have I thanked you yet for coming?

341
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,718
- About 40 times.
- Is something wrong?

342
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,950
You're little friend
walked off with my flask.

343
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,390
Yeah, well,
I'm sure she'll bring it back.

344
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,073
All right, well, I'm gonna go smoke
some cush. Wanna come?

345
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,997
You know,
I actually want to enjoy prom.

346
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,594
But come find me
when you get back then.

347
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,554
Did I hear something about smoking
certain substances?

348
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,115
Because I know someplace private.

349
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,839
Lead the way.

350
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,879
Maybe I'm being sentimental...

351
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,110
...but watching the kids
head off to prom...

352
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,840
...I can't help but think,
"Where did the time go?"

353
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,434
I remember the first day
Summer went to kindergarten.

354
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,358
She changed her outfit three times...

355
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,274
...and she came home crying because
another girl was wearing the same top.

356
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,113
- The other girl was Marissa.
- Of course.

357
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,750
Wasn't it kindergarten that Seth
would only answer to Boba Fett?

358
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,959
Gosh, Boba Fett. That was fourth grade.
No, it was fifth grade.

359
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,872
Oh, gosh, I just can't believe...

360
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,350
...I was only a year older than
Marissa is now when I married Jimmy.

361
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,270
It's amazing
the surprises life brings you.

362
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,596
- Some good, I hope.
- Very good.

363
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,314
I'd like to propose a toast
to the two of you.

364
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,189
We haven't thrown you an engagement
party, but we couldn't be more pleased.

365
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,078
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

366
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,198
Wouldn't you know. I'm sorry.

367
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,113
I have to take this. It's a colleague.
I'll be right back.

368
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,439
- Such a busy man.
- Yes.

369
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,031
Well, I just hope Neil and I are as happy
as you and Sandy.

370
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,675
No, actually, I'm having dinner
at his home right now. What's up?

371
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,711
Well, can I tell him?

372
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,232
Right. Okay.

373
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,952
All right, I feel good about that.

374
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,998
- How about a dance? Let's dance.
- Thank you.

375
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,636
- I'm just gonna go talk to her.
- No, Seth, you can't.

376
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,673
Well, look at her. She looks miserable.

377
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,469
- Let alone, kind of plastered.
- Well, that's the point.

378
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,912
At least, the miserable part.

379
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,310
- I don't think I can do this.
- Seth, the plan is working.

380
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,956
It was easy for her to doubt you when
you're all begging to get back together.

381
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,918
But now that she might have
really lost you...

382
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,072
...she's thinking,
"Maybe I should've really believed him."

383
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,029
Really?
Because it looks like she's describing...

384
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,796
...how she'd use my body for food,
then feed my bones to the sharks.

385
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,715
Excuse me,
can I have your attention, please?

386
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,838
Hi. I would like to welcome you all
to the Pirate's Ball.

387
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,279
Thank you.

388
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,559
Okay, now, before I announce
your pirate king and queen...

389
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,598
...I would just like
to take this moment to say...

390
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,593
...that it's been an honor
to be your social chair this year.

391
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,115
Just open the envelopes!

392
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,874
Well, excuse me,
if I have slaved away all year...

393
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,237
...just so you could have a good time.
- Boring!

394
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,679
Fine.

395
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,796
Oh, just so you know...

396
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,872
...I thought it was only fair
to take myself out of the running.

397
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,031
So no calling for a recount.

398
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,517
Okay, your 2006 queen is...

399
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,030
Oh, my God!
Two years in a row, Summer Roberts!

400
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,912
Oh, my God.

401
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,319
Go, Sum!

402
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,076
Oh, my God. I didn't think
you're boring. I love you.

403
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,599
Thank you so much.

404
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,797
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Oh, God.

405
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,871
You guys, thank you so much.

406
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,718
You guys... What's going on?

407
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,554
- Tiara.
- Oh, tiara.

408
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,597
Okay. Thanks.

409
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,632
Yeah, so thank you so much,
because being your queen is just...

410
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,633
- Is it a million degrees in here? It's hot.
- You know what...

411
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,916
...perhaps we should find out
who your king is.

412
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,593
Screw that!

413
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,673
You know what? Actually,
let me introduce you to my date.

414
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,476
Hold this.

415
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,359
He's right here. This is my date.

416
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,637
He's the number one pop star
in Korea.

417
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,916
Anyways, I promised him
that if I won...

418
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,550
...that I would give him a big, fat kiss!

419
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,599
- That's not part of the plan.
- She's just fighting it. This is good.

420
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,789
How do you like that, Cohen?

421
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,911
Man overboard! Man overboard!

422
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,112
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

423
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,555
What idiot made that stage so short?

424
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,075
- Summer, are you okay?
- Back off!

425
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,912
You know, just...
Everyone, leave me alone. Okay?

426
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,839
She needs a moist washcloth,
or maybe, like, a towelette.

427
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,228
- Cohen.
- What? What?

428
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,436
Is there a no-towelette clause
in your plan?

429
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,716
Because right now I'm thinking
phase two sucks.

430
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,314
Does anyone have a towelette?
Anyone have a towelette?

431
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,834
Hey, is she all right?

432
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,309
Yeah. Maybe it's time to go
to the after party.

433
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,948
- That's a good idea.
- Hey, I couldn't find Kevin.

434
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,236
- He just disappeared.
- Okay, I'll find him.

435
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,719
Hey, where's my crown?

436
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,190
- All right, I'd better...
- Who stole my crown?

437
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,078
Who is it?

438
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,796
This is the guy. I told him
I was coming here tonight, and...

439
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,839
I should probably take this.

440
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,549
- I'm sorry. It's gotten a little crazy.
- Yeah, a little crazy.

441
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,551
Little bit.

442
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,233
But there's no place
that I would rather be.

443
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,270
And that's what I'm gonna tell him.

444
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,113
I'll see you in a minute.

445
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,758
Ryan?

446
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,393
Hey! What are you doing?

447
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,030
So Seung Ho and his cousin got Summer
in the limo. Have you found Kevin?

448
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,078
- No. Let's look inside.
- He might have come out here to smoke.

449
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,832
- Nope. I checked.
- You checked?

450
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,709
Why are you being weird?
Are you sure he's not out here?

451
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,035
Oh, my God.

452
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,589
- Get out of here.
- What?

453
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,553
- Get out of here.
- Jerk.

454
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,519
Is that it? Can I go now?

455
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,557
- Why?
- What did you expect, huh?

456
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,399
Did you think you were gonna
just dress up your bad boy...

457
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,791
...take him to your party so your friends
can see how cool you are?

458
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,996
- You know it's not like that.
- Oh, please.

459
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,675
You just wanted to turn me
into a little bitch boy like him.

460
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,798
You're nothing like him.

461
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,760
Clearly, I was wrong about you.

462
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,158
Finally, you're learning.

463
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,114
Honestly, Kirsten,
I'm so glad you guys are doing better.

464
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,998
You really scared me last week.

465
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,549
I even scared myself.

466
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,673
Julie...

467
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,349
...last week at dinner I had a drink.

468
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,159
- What? Oh, my God.
- Now, it was the first in 11 months.

469
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,551
It was only one glass. I've been
going to AA meetings every day.

470
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,153
But it happened.

471
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,834
- Have you talked to Sandy about this?
- No, I tried...

472
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,468
...even before,
when I could feel it coming, but...

473
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,312
Kirsten, you have to tell him.

474
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,080
That the stress of our marriage
triggered my drinking?

475
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,832
Yes. That's exactly what you say.

476
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,629
I am not gonna use my alcoholism
as blackmail to save our marriage.

477
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,270
If he can't value it for what it is,
then what is the point?

478
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,635
Well, what are you gonna do?

479
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,714
I don't know.

480
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,473
The way things are between Sandy
and I right now...

481
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,518
...I just feel like one push
could send us over the edge.

482
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,394
Yeah!

483
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,358
Hello! Trashcans exist for a reason!

484
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,875
- All right, let's get some more beer.
- Yeah. Yeah!

485
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,553
- This party's awesome!
- Excuse me.

486
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,473
I have a security deposit on this place.
I'd like it back.

487
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,875
Hey. So the guy at the door's gonna
let me know if Volchok tries to get in.

488
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,951
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

489
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,078
- I think I'm just gonna go home.
- Marissa, this is your prom.

490
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,472
Yeah, it was prom before my boyfriend
hooked up with another girl.

491
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,155
Okay, I'm gonna go get a drink.

492
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,558
Summer, it's us. How you feeling?

493
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,917
Go away. Let me die alone.

494
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,470
I think it's time for phase three.

495
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,428
There's a phase three?
Why didn't you mention that?

496
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,238
There's always been a phase three.

497
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,836
The other two were just to make you
realize that you don't have a choice.

498
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,230
You have to tell her the truth,
about everything.

499
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,753
What is she talking about?

500
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,549
I bet you think it's really smart,
because she's the smart girl.

501
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,239
I'm gonna go. I fly back tomorrow,
but I'll see you both in Providence.

502
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,515
Summer, feel better,
and remember, Seth loves you.

503
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,073
Anna, thank you.

504
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,519
Bye.

505
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,828
You know what? I don't think she's
that smart. I think that she is dumb.

506
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,594
She got a dumb name and dumb hair.

507
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,275
Listen, I don't expect you to respond
or even remember this...

508
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,000
...bur the truth is
I actually didn't get into Brown.

509
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,709
What?! Way too fast.

510
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,270
I knew you weren't gonna go if I didn't,
and I didn't want you to do that.

511
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,477
I didn't want you to miss
the opportunity, so I broke up with you.

512
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,598
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

513
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,830
Then I realized
I couldn't be without you.

514
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,752
I flew there to try to talk my way in.

515
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,310
Okay, now that is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

516
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,036
But it's very romantic. Did it work?

517
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,519
No, it didn't. But Anna got me
an interview at RISD.

518
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,069
They read my comic book.
They really like it, so...

519
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,312
So that's why you were hugging her
at the airport? Oh, my God.

520
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,109
Listen, I know I promised I'd never
lie again when I gave you that letter...

521
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,589
- Oh, my God, the letter.
- What?

522
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,668
Cohen, I have a confession.

523
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,314
Wow, that's impressive.

524
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,394
- I love you.
- I love you too.

525
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,836
We can kiss later.

526
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,230
All right. You want me
to hold your crown, Sum?

527
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,550
- No!
- All right.

528
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,951
Hey, rigatoni. Nice.

529
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,392
What's going on?

530
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,514
Listen, that call I got was a friend
of mine on the hospital board...

531
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,591
...and there are rumors
floating around...

532
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,275
...about certain improprieties
concerning Griffin and you.

533
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,989
Monday morning,
the board is gonna suspend Griffin.

534
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,551
They're gonna call for a criminal
investigation into the both of you.

535
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,829
Neil, it's getting late.
I think we should be going.

536
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,116
Right. Kirsten,
thanks for a lovely evening.

537
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,679
My pleasure.

538
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,438
We'll walk you out.

539
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,274
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

540
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,229
Well, she's not here.
She must have gone home.

541
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,594
I think she'll be okay.

542
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,274
You know, you probably don't see it,
but she's changed.

543
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,192
She's gotten stronger.

544
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,551
- So have you.
- Yeah? Think so?

545
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,349
The Ryan I knew would've gotten in
a fight with that guy back at the prom.

546
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,159
I know part of you still wants to,
but you didn't.

547
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,629
That's what matters.

548
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,594
- So you like the new me?
- Well...

549
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,355
...you're still not much of a dancer.
- What?

550
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,914
You're right, I'm not.

551
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,188
You know, nothing between us
could ever be casual.

552
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,238
- There's too much history.
- Yeah, I know.

553
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,836
I don't think anything should
happen tonight.

554
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,595
- Absolutely not. Absolutely.
- Okay, good.

555
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,990
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

556
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,196
- Taylor, what happened?
- The money is gone.

557
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,669
I had $5000 in my purse, it's gone.

558
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,559
I brought it down at prom.
Someone must have taken it.

559
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,233
We should call the police.

560
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,150
Know what, don't bother.
I know where it is.

561
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,629
What do you mean you know?
I'm gonna hyperventilate.

562
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,394
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it will be.

563
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,998
What do you want?

564
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,391
You decide how this is gonna go.

565
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,358
Prom, huh? Hell of a night.

566
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,470
You probably think I'm an idiot, huh?
Screw things up with Marissa...

567
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,870
...steal money when everyone
will know I took it.

568
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,871
I don't think about you.

569
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,837
But, yes, you're an idiot.

570
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,514
Or maybe it wasn't gonna
work out with Marissa.

571
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,636
And at least now...

572
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,390
...you and I can settle this.

573
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,835
- I'm not here to fight you.
- Sure you are.

574
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,992
Otherwise you'd have called
the police. Come on.

575
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,550
You know you're dying to. Just give in.

576
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,517
All right, all right. All right.

577
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,477
I get it. It's about the money.

578
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,111
But tell me this,
a week from now, if I wanted to...

579
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,910
...I could have her on her back,
on that mattress.

580
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,230
Now, how does that make you feel?

581
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,151
