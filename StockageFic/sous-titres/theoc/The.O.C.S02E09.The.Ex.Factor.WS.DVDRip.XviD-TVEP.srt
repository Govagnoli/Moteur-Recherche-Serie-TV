1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,279
-Previously on The O. C. :
-You' re a tough kid from Chino...

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,830
...with an ex-girlfriend who's the
most beautiful girl ever in high school.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,788
-Yeah. But right now I'm here with you.
-He snuck out to see his girlfriend.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,951
-What are we doing?
-I call it "prepping the oven. "

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,190
What are we doing
in the larger sense?

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,350
I'd like to place an order for delivery.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,310
Can I get the crispy noodles
with shrimp and the calamari salad?

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,029
Get the Vietnamese rolls.
And the chicken with the spicy curry.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,636
No, just one. And Vietnamese rolls
and chicken with spicy curry.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,030
You guys want something
from Thaiphoon?

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,713
Yeah, some pad thai, please.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,997
Y eah, Mom, will you order
a couple gallons of the tom yum soup?

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,152
And then the salmon with the
chili-lime sauce. And dumplings.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,551
Okay, can we get some pad thai,
some tom yum soup...

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,029
-...salmon with the chili-lime sauce--
-Dumplings.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,509
And the steamed dumplings.
Yeah. Great.

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,629
-We ordered enough for a small army.
-I got an idea.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,791
Why don't you ask
your female cohorts over?

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,350
Lindsay's with her mom. Family therapy
and to a Truffaut retrospective.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,149
That's a hell of a double-header.
What about Alex?

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,394
-Howdy.
-What are you doing here?

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,792
Okay, that's not the warmest greeting
I've ever received, but I will take it.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,316
I didn't expect to see you here
right now. I'm kind of busy.

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,994
I wanted to invite you to have dinner
with the family.

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,718
I don't think it's a good idea.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,997
My ex is in town.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,350
Actually, in my office.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,591
Waiting for me.

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,756
Your ex.

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,072
Well, part of the ABC's of the ex is
to step aside for the I and the U.

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,118
But the ex isn't technically an ex.

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,238
We never really broke up, officially.
It's part of what we need to figure out.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,676
But I really do wanna come
have dinner with your family...

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,070
...so maybe we can do it
after the ex leaves.

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,118
Okay, so the ex is leaving.
When? Later tonight?

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,910
Staying the night. That's cool.
Staying the week?

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,470
I don't know. I didn't know
this was gonna happen, and now it has.

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,191
I have to deal with it. It would be great
if you could just let me figure it out.

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,999
Just, in other words, stay away
while the ex is in town.

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,714
Unless you're cool
with the three of us hanging out.

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,952
Okay, well, I'm gonna have
to get back to you on that.

42
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,431
I like the new club.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,958
-You ready to get out of here?
-ln a minute.

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,835
-So what if Alex has an ex?
-Most people do.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,639
That's right. He's probably just
some meathead thug...

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,872
...with her name tattooed
on his bicep.

47
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,031
Well, no threat to you.

48
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,519
Unless...

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,956
...he's a thug with a heart.

50
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,350
He's done his time,
1 8 months for robbery.

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,351
It was wrong. He understands that.

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,956
He's mature, he's sensitive, seasoned.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,235
-So you're not okay.
-Not at all, Ryan. Not at all.

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,429
-He's spiraling, huh?
-Seth? He hasn't even begun.

55
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,113
-Hey.
-Hi, guys.

56
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,833
Marissa, that's an amazing skirt,
and I love your shoes.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,310
Thanks. I really like your....

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,272
Your backpack.

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,238
Where's it from?

60
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,029
L.L. Bean.

61
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,190
Well, I'm late for class. But maybe
this weekend we can all hang.

62
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,238
-See a movie or go to Balboa lsland?
-Yeah, sounds great.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,390
Every day, she looks like she could
be on the cover of a fashion magazine.

64
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,710
Yeah? I guess.

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,390
-Good thing I'm not competitive.
-What are you talking about?

66
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,632
Nothing. It's just, you know, you said it.
Everyone has an ex...

67
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,031
...and you seem to hang out
with yours a lot.

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,270
-We do?
-You do.

69
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,398
-Like, constantly.
-Maybe you two should become friends.

70
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,074
We can all hang out,
and it wouldn't be weird.

71
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,949
Yeah, me and the Cosmo Girl.
Yeah, that wouldn't be weird at all.

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,916
A massage.

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,952
-You must really need something.
-Favor. Tiny.

74
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,552
Ask me while you're giving me the
massage. I'm more inclined to say yes.

75
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,872
It's about work.

76
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,508
As you know, the Newport Group's
reputation is pretty much in the toilet.

77
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,399
-It's well-deserved.
-The board wants us to come up with...

78
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,394
...a plan to improve the company's
image. I figured who better to ask...

79
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,519
...than you, the man who practically
invented hating the Newport Group.

80
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,148
Well, I was doing it
long before it was trendy.

81
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,390
Yeah. So any ideas?

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,393
Yes. As a matter of fact, this is perfect.

83
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,676
-Perfect's good.
-I just got a call to work...

84
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,230
...with the Newport Housing lnitiative.
They want low-income housing.

85
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,995
-I was gonna petition the city council.
-The Newport Group can find the money.

86
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,355
Exactly. The housing board
gets a development.

87
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,195
And the company could do something
good for a change. Honey, that's perfect.

88
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,436
You've earned more than a massage.

89
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,230
Where I come from,
that only means one thing.

90
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,555
Hey. I have a surprise for you.

91
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,269
I love surprises. Especially when
they're named Jimmy Choo.

92
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,999
Am I about to get whacked?

93
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,031
Hey, a cupcake.

94
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,760
It doesn't have stiletto heels,
but I'll eat it anyway.

95
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,399
You know it's not my birthday.

96
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,711
Yes, and I also know
it's our six-month anniversary.

97
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,832
Oh, my God, it is.
God, it's been six months?

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,116
-Holy mack.
-I know, it's amazing.

99
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,635
I've never been in a relationship
this long.

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,270
-Neither have l.
-Well, I think we should celebrate.

101
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,513
I would like to take you to a romantic
anniversary dinner at The Arches.

102
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,159
What do you say?

103
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,395
So, what'd you say?

104
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,518
You know, that I'm fasting
for an upcoming colonoscopy.

105
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,875
I'm sure that was the answer
he was looking for.

106
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,316
Yes. Look, Zach is so unbelievably great.
But six months?

107
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,436
I did not even date Cohen that long.

108
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,512
When did we get so old?
When did life get so complicated?

109
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,036
I know. Remember when we were little,
and it was just you and me...

110
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,792
-...and the boys had cooties?
-Yeah.

111
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,793
And we had sleepovers and watched
Full House and Step by Step.

112
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,996
Oh, my God. I loved Full House.

113
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,232
But my favorite character was named
DJ, so I guess that's ruined.

114
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,436
No. Look, forget DJ.

115
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,716
Forget Cohen and Zach and Ryan.
You know what?

116
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,758
-We need a break from the boys.
-You mean a girls' night out?

117
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,753
I do. You telling me you couldn't use
a night without boys?

118
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,957
-Well, Full House is on Nick at Nite.
-Really?

119
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,439
Thanks.

120
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,558
So great news.

121
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,633
Sandy has an amazing idea to kick-start
an image makeover for the company.

122
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,872
-I have better news and a better idea.
-You haven't heard his yet.

123
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,316
It would be hard for Sandy's idea
to top the best idea ever.

124
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,119
-You ready?
-Probably not, no.

125
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,277
Oh, my--
There's so much you here.

126
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,633
A magazine, Kirsten, about Newport life,
restaurants, events, gossip.

127
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,077
Selling Newport Beach
as an aspirational brand.

128
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,357
Well, Sandy's idea,
which is in a different direction...

129
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,910
...involves funding
a low-income housing development.

130
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,674
That's kind of cute. I guess.

131
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,559
But, Kiki, we're trying to appeal
to the Newport elite.

132
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,756
We need to think about
who these people are:

133
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,036
Bored, rich gossipmongers
who like to shop.

134
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,792
They're me. And I don't care
about low-income housing.

135
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,512
You have a point.

136
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,880
-This is as far as I go.
-Thanks for walking me.

137
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,474
Have fun at your emergency
comic-book meeting.

138
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,438
Why do I get the feeling
Seth won't be talking about comics?

139
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,079
Yeah. You okay?

140
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,630
-Yeah, sure. I like eating alone.
-You know who you could sit with--

141
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,832
No. That's okay, really.

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,117
Get to know her, she'll stop being
my ex and become your friend.

143
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,238
Ryan, don't. Okay, please.
I'm sure they don't even eat.

144
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,435
-Hey.
-Hey.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,638
You guys mind if Lindsay joins you?

146
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,598
-I gotta meet Seth.
-No. Emergency comic-book meeting?

147
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,352
-Zach was summoned too.
-You heard.

148
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,350
-Have a seat, Lindsay.
-Great. Thanks, you guys. See you.

149
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,715
This is so good. Great idea
hitting the drive-through for lunch.

150
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,316
It'll probably be hours on the elliptical
trainer working those off, huh?

151
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,676
Coop exercising? Now, that's funny.

152
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,318
So you guys can just eat cheeseburgers
and look like you?

153
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,199
No. Well, sometimes we get
chili fries too.

154
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,032
Why? What are you eating?

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,879
It's a Zone meal.
It's low-carb.

156
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,759
So we were planning our
girls' night out for this weekend.

157
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,792
Do you want to join us?

158
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,188
Me?

159
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,599
What do you say?

160
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,352
Okay. Sure.

161
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,717
So break it down for me, guys.
And don't afraid to be honest.

162
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,395
Well, what you should've done is
tell her, "Take all the space you need.

163
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,312
I know this must be hard. "

164
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,152
Boom! You're a hero.

165
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,436
You look confident,
but like you still care.

166
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,989
Yeah, that is so the way
I should've played it.

167
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,832
When do we discuss
The New Avengers?

168
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,552
Philip, your membership has been
revoked. You're not there for me.

169
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,234
-I'm not there for you. Beat it.
-He doesn't mean it.

170
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,994
-He's just upset.
-I don't care if you're in junior high.

171
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,391
I think you're onto something. I like it.
You know what? I'll call her.

172
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,279
-Tell her I'm giving her some space.
-Dude, don't do that.

173
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,111
-What's happening?
-He's calling her.

174
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,511
-Give me that.
-I'm leaving a message.

175
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,591
No, you are not.

176
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,799
Jeez, man. Fine. Whatever.

177
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,837
-Forget calling. I'll go down there.
-No.

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,434
If I'm losing her,
I wanna see who I'm losing her to.

179
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,831
-You are not going down there.
-I have to. My paycheck's down-- Yes.

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,436
Yes. That's perfect. She owes me $38.
I have to go down there.

181
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,511
Okay? How can I live
without that money?

182
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,432
-I gotta eat.
-What if I go down there?

183
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,670
-I come with you. Okay.
-I'll go down there.

184
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,150
I'll say I'm picking up your paycheck,
sniff around for the ex.

185
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,672
Okay. Check him out. Report back
to me. Maybe snap a few photos.

186
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,478
-Sure. What do you say?
-All right.

187
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,632
Listen. You gotta apologize to Philip.
He took that really hard.

188
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,314
Philip. He's always been the weak one.

189
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,995
Hey. Come on. I'm sorry what
happened back there. Heat of passion.

190
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,357
You know how it is? Sorry, sometimes
Bruce Banner turns into the Hulk.

191
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,639
Hey, I talked to the housing initiative.
They are on cloud nine over there.

192
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,789
Good.

193
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,748
They're gonna draw up a proposal
for you to bring to work. Okay, honey...

194
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,959
...I don't want to alarm you, but there is
a giant Julie Cooper on the table.

195
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,271
It's Julie's idea for an image makeover.
A magazine.

196
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,431
I'm assuming you nipped this one
in the bud.

197
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,036
Well, she did her homework.
Ran the numbers.

198
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,397
-The proposal wasn't bad.
-You're not considering this, are you?

199
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,353
Well, there's a lot of ideas
on the table, Sandy.

200
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,034
Well, when you shoot down hers,
be sure to toss this.

201
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,872
It's giving me the willies, okay?

202
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,431
Hi. Hi.

203
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,239
I'm here to pick up a paycheck.
Name's Cohen.

204
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,678
So you must be Alex's new guy.
The famous Seth Cohen.

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,039
No. I'm his friend, Ryan.
I'm just doing him a favor.

206
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,835
I really wanted to meet this Seth.

207
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,117
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I'm Jody.

208
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,875
You're the ex.

209
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,074
So you didn't see anything
at the club?

210
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,915
I mean, there were no shady guys
hanging around Alex's office?

211
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,071
Definitely didn't see any guys.

212
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,708
Are we meeting Zach here
or at the comic-book store?

213
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,916
Here. Now, you must have
seen someone.

214
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,311
Tell me this. Who gave you the check?
Tell me everything that happened.

215
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,234
In fact, better yet,
reenact it word for word. Go.

216
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,957
Zach. Hey.

217
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,917
How are you? So good to see you.

218
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,753
-How are you?
-Good. I'm good.

219
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,395
I'm terrible, actually.
I think I freaked Summer out.

220
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,596
I don't know. She bailed on our date.

221
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,433
Now she's doing a girls'-night-out thing
at the Bait Shop.

222
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,791
She's not returning
any of my phone calls.

223
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,235
I don't know. Maybe new comics
will ease the pain.

224
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,119
I feel that pain. Let's go down
to The Bait Shop tonight...

225
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,033
-...and talk to the girls.
-Or we could forget the girls.

226
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,156
Do our own thing.
Have a guys' night out.

227
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,839
-I like my plan.
-We spend every night with the girls.

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,356
-Let's try one night without them.
-lt could be kind of fun.

229
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,513
It could be just what I need.
A reinvestment in my manhood.

230
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,990
A timeout to reflect
on what it means to be a man.

231
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,354
-Seth.
-Yeah, I'm in.

232
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,914
Sanford.

233
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,197
Kirsten here? I was hoping
to have a bit of a chat with you both.

234
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,712
It's about this ungodly magazine
of Julie's. You heard about it?

235
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,872
Heard about it?
I got an 80-foot mock-up in my kitchen.

236
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,555
-It's gonna haunt me in my sleep.
-I don't intend to let this thing go ahead.

237
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,508
If Julie launches it, she'll embarrass
herself, the company, the family.

238
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,837
So how you gonna break it to her?

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,912
The woman's a warrior, Sanford.
I'm not facing her alone.

240
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,636
-So that's where we come in.
-The three of us form a united front.

241
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,679
Tell Julie that the magazine
is a terrible idea, that she'll regret it.

242
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,592
-What do you say?
-How about that?

243
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,398
I actually agree with you.

244
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,193
-Relax. You're gonna have fun.
-Yeah. Definitely.

245
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,669
Not only am I spending the night
with Marissa...

246
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,116
...but I'll get to see my dad,
who barely acknowledges me.

247
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,238
No. He's gonna be out at dinner.
I checked with Marissa.

248
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,391
So when did you guys meet?

249
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,710
How did you start going out
in the first place?

250
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,075
-Me and Marissa? Come on.
-What?

251
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,198
I mean, were you guys lab partners?

252
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,557
-Fire-drill buddies?
-No, no.

253
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,594
Actually, it was my first night
in Newport. I was....

254
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,197
I was sitting in Sandy's car waiting to
see if Kirsten would let me in the house.

255
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,239
And I walked down to the end
of the driveway...

256
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,352
...and there she was.

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,355
We started talking, and....

258
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,914
I don't know, we just...

259
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,397
...connected.

260
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,674
She wasn't like anybody
I'd ever met before.

261
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,433
Until you.

262
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,628
Right.

263
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,554
Have fun.

264
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,394
Hey, do me a favor.
Take care of her tonight, all right?

265
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,120
Okay, Ryan. I'm not 8.

266
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,878
I promise I'll take care of her, Dad.
Or I'll try, anyway.

267
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,233
Please don't feel like
you have to babysit me.

268
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,030
No. That's just Ryan.
He gets very protective. You'll see.

269
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,435
So Summer should be here any second.

270
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,148
Cool.

271
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,912
So this is where you live.

272
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,752
I mean, of course it is.
I mean, it's....

273
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,558
It's really nice.

274
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,994
Thanks.

275
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,110
Yeah. Sit.

276
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,276
Hey, you know what?

277
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,311
How about an icebreaker?

278
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,635
-I don't really....
-Sorry.

279
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,473
-That's totally cool.
-Not that I judge anyone who does.

280
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,835
-It's not something I do.
-Don't worry about it.

281
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,479
Okay.

282
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,713
That must be Summer,
so I'll just go grab the door.

283
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,519
You know, hang out.
Make yourself comfortable.

284
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,599
What am I doing here?

285
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,394
Okay. It is 0700 hours.

286
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,189
Let the record show that guys' night out
has officially begun.

287
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,670
Okay, Seth, 0700 means it's 7 a.m.

288
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,638
Okay, nobody cares that you
were in ROTC. Now, listen to me.

289
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,472
Tonight, Newport is our bitch.

290
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,791
Okay? So let's go out there,
and let's do what guys do.

291
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,589
-Yeah.
-Ryan, what do guys do?

292
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,671
We could head up to L.A. You know?
Hit a club. Go to Vegas.

293
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,673
-Road trip to Tijuana.
-That didn't work out well last time.

294
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,308
But these are good shapes of ideas.

295
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,713
-You want to play video games.
-So bad.

296
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,713
This Summer thing's got me
tied in knots. I vote we stay in.

297
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,157
We should get you out of the house.
It'll take your mind off things.

298
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,551
We can let the fun come to us.
We have all we need for a perfect night.

299
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,280
We've got a working television,
a bevy of comic books.

300
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,474
Lamps. Right? Okay.

301
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,555
That's all you need for a rollicking good
time, so my proposal is guys' night in.

302
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,357
Guys' night in.

303
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,789
-Well, here we are. Just us.
-Right.

304
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,350
This is so much fun.

305
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,391
So, what happens now?

306
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,559
Well, we could walk by the bar,
see if anyone checks us out.

307
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,792
Hello? No boys tonight.
That's the whole point.

308
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,469
Okay, well, we can at least
talk about them, right?

309
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,995
Let's face it. Without that,
we got nothing.

310
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,720
So boy talk. Who wants to start?

311
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,355
You know...

312
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,956
...I'm rethinking
the whole sobriety thing.

313
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,997
You read my mind.

314
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,474
Maybe some tonic and lots of ice
would help.

315
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,992
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, burned me a little.

316
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,720
Do what you want
if you need to call him so bad.

317
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,952
What? I had no idea that you were gonna
show up out of nowhere.

318
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,111
I didn't have a chance to tell him
about us.

319
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,874
Why? Are you embarrassed about us?

320
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,314
Sorry to interrupt...

321
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,075
...but there's no paper towels
in the girls' bathroom.

322
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,718
I'm all over it.

323
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,399
Thanks. That was a conversation
I did not wanna have.

324
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,155
Yeah, I know all about those.
I have them with my mom all the time.

325
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,437
The nerve of Alex. She has a secret
boyfriend the whole time...

326
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,034
-...and never gets around to telling me?
-I know, man.

327
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,988
I wanted to celebrate our six-month
anniversary. Summer heads for the hills.

328
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,709
-You've been going out six months?
-This isn't how I imagined our night out.

329
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,155
-Let's go the club and put up a fight.
-Bad idea.

330
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,116
Why? Our girlfriends bailed on us
to go drinking at a club.

331
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,271
Have you seen Girls Gone Wild?

332
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,510
-This is exactly how it begins.
-He's right.

333
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,669
-l' m going.
-Me too.

334
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,354
Seth, l' m telling you as your friend.
Don't do this.

335
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,640
-You know something.
-No. No, I don't. Don't ask me.

336
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,518
Dude. I am a man in the desert.

337
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,274
I'm dying of thirst.
You have a thermos full of Kool-Aid.

338
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,431
Come on, give me a sip.
Did you meet the ex?

339
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,716
-I know you did.
-All right. Yes, I did.

340
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,513
-And who is he?
-He....

341
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,357
-He's a she.
-What?

342
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,152
Who needs a little more?

343
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,436
-Somebody's gotta drive.
-Not me.

344
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,433
Why don't I go track down some coffee?

345
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,477
You're not scary.

346
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,869
-Thanks, I think.
-I mean, before you were, like, scary.

347
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,837
Not like bogeyman scary, you know--

348
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,958
Lindsay, you've got nothing
to worry about.

349
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,235
-Ryan really likes you.
-Y eah.

350
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,238
Can a guy ever get over a girl like you?

351
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,591
Summer, right?

352
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,237
-We're in Comp Lit class together.
-Right.

353
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,315
-I'm sorry. I'm usually asleep.
-Matt Miller.

354
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,874
So where's Zach?

355
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,400
I don't know. It's girls' night out.
You know about me and Zach?

356
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,915
We're on the water-polo team.
Happy anniversary.

357
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,593
You know about our anniversary?

358
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,673
He brought it up in the locker room. Six
months is big. We were talking about it.

359
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,230
So Zach's turning the locker room
into a Lifetime movie.

360
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,789
The water-polo team is very sensitive.

361
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,439
-It's tough to see from here.
-Yeah, always tough to see from here.

362
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,478
You wanna try upstairs?

363
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,598
Yeah. Sure, why not?
I haven't scoped it out yet.

364
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,549
So Alex hooked up with a girl.
It's not a big deal.

365
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,678
My girlfriend dated a girl.
It's a very big deal.

366
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,389
-Only one thing can make it okay.
-You're gonna hook up with a guy?

367
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,553
I repeat. There's only one thing I can do
to make it okay. I need to see this girl.

368
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,109
Because right now my imagination's
just running wild.

369
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,590
-Dude, so's mine. She's hot, right?
-Listen.

370
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,398
I know I'm supposed to be attracted.

371
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,120
I'm supposed to be turned on.
I've read Maxim and Stuff.

372
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,795
But you know what? It makes me feel
like Alex is even more out of my league.

373
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,235
Maybe you should talk to her
when you calm down.

374
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,277
Nope. Got testosterone
pumping right now.

375
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,115
Testosterone being the key ingredient
missing from Alex's previous relationship.

376
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,158
I just need to remind her of that.
Come on!

377
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,518
-This should go well.
-I hate traffic.

378
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,638
You have to think big picture.
This magazine could go national.

379
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,554
America would be fascinated with
the lives of O.C.'s rich and fabulous.

380
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,950
We're all beautiful,
we're all dysfunctional.

381
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,272
Surf, sex and scandal. It's a recipe for
a cultural phenomenon, don't you think?

382
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,836
Well, I would rather hear
what Sandy and Kirsten have to say.

383
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,718
Let's not talk about work anymore.

384
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,189
Kirsten. Why don't we put her
out of her misery?

385
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,790
Julie, it's a lousy idea.

386
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,360
Thanks for rushing to my defense.
Really very touching.

387
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,751
It's my job to remain impartial.

388
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,990
-Objective.
-And cowardly?

389
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,312
Fine. I'll just sit here and get insulted
by a man so ignorant about business...

390
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,311
...he chose as a career
to work for free.

391
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,313
I don't work--
That's pro bono work, Julie.

392
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,155
Why am I defending myself? If you want
a business perspective, ask Kirsten.

393
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,073
I did. She called Newport Living...

394
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,471
...just the thing to keep
the Newport Group living.

395
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,234
-She said that?
-I wasn't that poetic.

396
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,871
Honey, I did some research.

397
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,759
This has promise. I' m so sorry
it had to come out this way.

398
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,708
No. It's my fault. I once again let myself
get caught up in the middle...

399
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,440
...of this nasty game
of Hungry Hungry Hippos.

400
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,955
Well, this time, I'm out.
You're all on your own.

401
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,233
Waiter. He'll take the check.

402
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,036
-I'm gonna check the bar.
-I'll look upstairs.

403
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,679
Seth, we can still turn around.

404
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,229
-Yeah, that's a good idea, Ryan.
-Yeah?

405
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,391
You take the lounge.

406
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,917
-Thanks.
-Hey. So where is she?

407
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,277
-Because I'll totally fight a girl.
-I have a job I'm busy doing.

408
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,115
If you came here for some big, dramatic
confrontation, it's gonna have to wait.

409
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,669
Fine. I will wait.

410
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,753
I don't know what my problem is.
I just get so claustrophobic.

411
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,956
Sounds like maybe
you don't want a boyfriend.

412
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,112
Well, if he's not right for me,
then nobody is.

413
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,830
Zach. What are you doing here?

414
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,072
-Tonight was girls without the boys.
-lt doesn't look like it.

415
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,477
What are you doing here with
Matt Miller? That guy'll hit on anything.

416
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,868
Thanks for the news flash.

417
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,759
-Are you making your rounds?
-Yeah. That's what I'm doing.

418
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,195
-I'm checking up on you.
-Then why are you here?

419
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,999
I don't know. Bad idea.

420
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,950
-Hey. There you are.
-Hey. There you are.

421
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,630
My numb is tongue.

422
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,233
You're drunk?

423
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,672
-I think that I need some fresh air.
-That's a good idea.

424
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,478
Let's get you out of here.

425
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,719
Bye.

426
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,395
-Julie took off?
-She insisted on me putting her in a cab.

427
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,075
Apparently, it is my husbandly duty
to support her ideas.

428
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,471
She's got a point.
Support each other no matter what.

429
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,437
It's the name of the game.

430
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,920
Which is why I'll support Sandy
at the board meeting.

431
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,469
Putting the marriage
ahead of the company.

432
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,430
-Bold move.
-Go with Julie on this one.

433
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,712
You won't regret it.

434
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,476
You know, you're not as stubborn
as everybody thinks you are.

435
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,836
Yeah, it's just too much wine.

436
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,388
So how you feeling?

437
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,350
-I feel so great.
-Yeah?

438
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,319
Let's go swimming.

439
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,790
-Come on.
-Hey, swimming in the ocean at night.

440
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,757
Yeah, what's the matter?
Are you scared?

441
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,399
No.

442
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,113
You all right?

443
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,829
Jeez.

444
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,950
-How much did you drink, huh?
-I don't know. As much as Marissa.

445
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,032
-That's a lot.
-Well, I am on a liquid diet tonight.

446
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,474
No dinner too, huh?

447
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,268
Well, in that case...

448
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,318
...you hang tight for a minute.
I'll go grab some greasy fries.

449
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,792
And a lot of coffee.
The Dawn Atwood special.

450
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,032
-Fries sound so good.
-Don't they?

451
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,031
And then we'll go swimming.
It'll be fun.

452
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,714
Because when the weather is cold,
the water is warm.

453
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,713
All right. We'll talk about it
when I get back. All right?

454
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,394
-Okay.
-All right. Stay there, okay?

455
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,473
You all right?

456
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,595
Are you trying to wait me out?
It's not working.

457
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,228
Yeah, it is working.
That's why you're not waiting.

458
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,628
Let's get this over with.

459
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,234
Come in and tell me everything
I've done to wrong you.

460
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,591
-Okay. For one, you lied to me.
-I did not lie to you.

461
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,672
I told you that my ex was in town,
and you filled in the blanks.

462
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,472
Blanks that you left blank.

463
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,310
You know, it's part of your move.
It's kind of part of what you do.

464
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,592
You got your too cool Jem-
and-the-Holograms thing happening...

465
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,995
...and blowing me off
is part of your act.

466
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,918
-You think it's an act.
-It's a crutch.

467
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,839
The hair and tattoos,
whiskey and cigarettes for breakfast.

468
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,316
I've actually seen The Banger Sisters.
Part of it, on cable.

469
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,999
And I know how the story ends.

470
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,313
I'll make sure to Netflix that so I can
be up to speed on your little theory.

471
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,357
Great, you do that. The point is...

472
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,115
...this was really fun for a while,
but it is just not worth it...

473
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,236
...so I will see you.

474
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,469
So, what are you gonna do?

475
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,200
I don't know. Maybe find a new girl
to walk all over me.

476
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,999
Or maybe even be cool to me.

477
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,438
Lindsay!

478
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,553
Lindsay!

479
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,598
Lindsay!

480
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,794
Lindsay!

481
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,638
Lindsay!

482
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,793
Lindsay!

483
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,912
Lindsay!

484
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,352
Lindsay!

485
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,795
Lindsay!

486
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,878
Ryan! What are you doing?

487
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,436
Lindsay! She's out here somewhere!
Get help!

488
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,393
-Lindsay's fine!
-What?

489
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,754
I just saw her.

490
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,276
She's fine.
She's passed out in Alex's office.

491
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,596
She went looking for you, ran into
Marissa, who was doing the same thing.

492
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,432
Yeah? I can't wait to see her.

493
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,351
What happened to you?

494
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,117
-ls she okay?
-She'll be fine. She's just sleeping it off.

495
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,197
-I should get her home.
-I can do that.

496
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,152
-I think you've done enough.
-Okay.

497
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,276
This is the part
where you blame it on me?

498
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,392
You're right. It was Lindsay's idea
to pound vodka and pass out.

499
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,239
-Good to see someone else messed-up?
-lt was her idea.

500
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,109
-Okay, so it got a little out of control--
-lt always does with you.

501
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,392
You spent last year trying to
drag me down with you. And now her?

502
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,554
You want to make a mess
out of your own life? Fine!

503
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,631
Doing a good job of it, if you ask me.

504
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,796
-No one asked you.
-What did you say?

505
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,958
-Hey, Ryan, let's-- Let's go.
-I'm not leaving her here.

506
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,711
-I'll take care of her. You go.
-Yeah, come on. It'll be fine.

507
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,198
Ryan, let's go.

508
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,037
Just call and let us know she's okay.

509
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,157
Let's get her out of here.

510
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,115
Yeah.

511
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,079
Hey.
Black-and-white milk shake, please.

512
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,473
One.

513
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,638
Zach.

514
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,193
So...

515
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,319
...I'm sorry for being
Ultra Bitch 2000 tonight.

516
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,432
-Tonight?
-Fair enough.

517
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,429
It's just that
my whole dating experience...

518
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,718
...amounts to a six-month angst-fest
with Cuckoo for Cohen.

519
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,874
So when I'm with you,
someone who is sane and normal...

520
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,077
...it's like I was raised by wolves.

521
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,117
-Do you need the drama?
-Well, if by that you mean...

522
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,352
...do I miss the wolves? No.

523
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,351
See, wolves, they pee all over the place
marking their territory. Gross.

524
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,994
But while I'm learning
how to not howl at the moon...

525
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,876
...I need to take baby steps.

526
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,878
-Like this anniversary thing--
-I got it.

527
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,393
And don't worry.

528
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,348
If we're still together when we hit
one year, I'm gonna totally blow it off.

529
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,195
I think that is the sweetest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

530
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,077
Alex called. Lindsay's home.

531
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,519
Everything okay?

532
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,351
I assume so.
We didn't really have a long talk.

533
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,431
She hung up on me.

534
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,077
Which was maybe a hint
that I really screwed things up tonight.

535
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,750
I don't think me and Marissa
will be hanging out any time soon.

536
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,909
I was probably too hard on her, huh?

537
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,795
There were flashes
of the old Ryan Atwood.

538
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,310
It just brings back old issues,
you know. Marissa, my mom--

539
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,670
You don't have to lump Lindsay
in that category.

540
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,871
She was probably just trying
to let loose.

541
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,792
Or Marissa pressured her into it.

542
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,319
I think if Lindsay was feeling pressure,
it was probably coming from you.

543
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,513
I mean, you kind of shotgunned them
into that relationship.

544
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,195
But, I mean, the girlfriend
and the ex as friends?

545
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,591
I think that goes against nature.

546
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,676
-Someone could follow their own advice.
-Y eah.

547
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,312
Y eah, I should apologize.
It's just my pride.

548
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,709
What pride?

549
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,678
-There's nothing standing in my way.
-You wanna drive or me?

550
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,989
-You.
-All right.

551
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,998
And now my wife has given us all
the opportunity to find out.

552
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,278
Ghosts, et cetera, being only
creations of hysteria....

553
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,192
-Hey.
-Hi.

554
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,355
I think everyone wonders
what they would do if they saw a ghost.

555
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,909
If you' re still angry,
you have every right to be.

556
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,710
No, well, that-- That's good to know.
But here's the thing.

557
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,279
I' m not angry at all.

558
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,991
Since I left the law firm, your father's
been grooming me to be his henchman...

559
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,197
...and I've been letting him.

560
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,873
I think, in some way...

561
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,869
-...I've been postponing the inevitable.
-And that is?

562
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,551
Figuring out what to do next.

563
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,313
Sandy, we can still
make your housing idea work.

564
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,074
I'm gonna go on record
recommending the project.

565
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,271
I appreciate that.

566
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,476
But I'd rather you didn't.

567
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,119
Julie's magazine will always
give me the heebie-jeebies.

568
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,073
And business-wise,
it's probably your best bet.

569
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,439
Besides, if I work with you...

570
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,876
...your father will ambush us
every time we try to have a date.

571
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,913
That was the worst date
we've ever had, wasn't it?

572
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,708
A double date with your father
and Julie Cooper.

573
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,713
Sounds like the plot of this movie.

574
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,393
Maybe we shouldn't both be here.

575
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,552
It's potentially too much apology
for one doorstep.

576
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,029
-We're not doing it at the same time.
-That's good.

577
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,998
I don't think the synchronized apology
would work.

578
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,353
It's like you're stalking me.

579
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,512
Yeah. But I'm stalking
with good intentions.

580
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,872
-I came to apologize.
-So did l.

581
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,391
-Marissa's inside.
-Thanks.

582
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,716
And so is Jody. So you and me...

583
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,917
...are outside.

584
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,038
Hey.

585
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,472
Look, I don't know. I--

586
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,477
I was hoping this could be easy.
For you and me to stay friends...

587
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,076
-...you and Lindsay to be friends--
-We all live happily ever after?

588
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,948
Yeah, something like that.

589
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,792
I know it seems like a million years ago
we dated. But it wasn't.

590
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,037
-I know that.
-And, okay, maybe you're over it.

591
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,038
Maybe it doesn't mean anything
to you anymore.

592
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,877
Maybe it never did.

593
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,836
But it meant a lot to me.

594
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,431
You meant a lot to me.

595
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,591
You still do.

596
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,596
It's not like that. I....

597
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,150
I don't know what it's like. Thinking
you and Lindsay should be friends...

598
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,392
-...was a bad idea.
-Why? I like her.

599
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,714
And if you do the math,
she's my stepsister, so....

600
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,079
I guess.

601
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,919
Clearly, it's gonna be strange for us
for a while.

602
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,031
Yeah, I know. You're right.

603
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,830
I'm sorry.

604
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,959
That's what I came here to say.

605
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,752
I'm sorry too.

606
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,790
So you and Jody?
You getting back together?

607
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,869
I doubt it.

608
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,960
She's kind of a pain in the ass.

609
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,993
-But maybe that's my type.
-Right.

610
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,274
So then, I mean, does that mean
we can go back to before? Because...

611
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,715
...I can forget this ever happened.

612
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,356
Okay. I'll wait.

613
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,240
Because that's what adults do.
They wait. So I'm waiting. Adult style.

614
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,873
Hey.

615
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,713
You ready?

616
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,153
Yeah.

617
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,117
I guess so.

618
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,709
Thanks for coming by.

619
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,357
And I'm sorry too.

620
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,596
At last, you've got it all.

621
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,756
Everything I have.

622
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,110
-Even my life.
-Hey.

623
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,709
-Jody went to sleep.
-Cool.

624
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,077
-I think we've seen the last of the guys.
-I wouldn't be so sure.

625
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,596
There's still, like, what,
four minutes of girls' night out left?

626
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,034
I've had enough of girls and guys.

627
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,550
There's an old horror movie on.

628
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,037
Works for me.

629
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,191
Are you cold?
