1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,237
- <i>Previously on</i> The O. C:
- You drink a lot?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,038
I guess. I mean, what's a lot?

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,800
Have you ever had so much to drink
that you blacked out?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,316
How much is the Land Trust
offering me for Balboa Heights?

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,596
That's it?
That's your whole dog-and-pony show?

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,677
- What are you doing Saturday?
- What are you doing Saturday?

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,230
- I have a date with Summer.
- What are you doing Friday night?

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,631
So, what's it gonna be, huh?

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,873
You want your menorah or
a candy cane? Christmas or Hanukkah?

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,915
Don't worry about it, buddy, because
in this house, you don't have to choose.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,159
Allow me to introduce you
to a little something I like to call...

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,710
...Chrismukkah.
- Chrismukkah?

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,110
That's right.
The new holiday sweeping the nation.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,430
- Hey, fellas, we got the tree.
- Hey.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,558
- Or at least the living room.
- Guys, a little help.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,951
I saved a spot for you right there.
Put your muscle into it.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,315
Excellent. To the right a little.
Don't hurt it.

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,357
Those needles are brittle.
That's perfect.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,917
You guys, you guys. A-plus. A-plus.
I love the holidays. I love them all.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,992
- We didn't really know how to raise Seth.
- So I raised myself.

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,197
In doing so, I created the greatest
superholiday known to mankind...

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,069
...drawing on the best that Christianity
and Judaism have to offer.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,879
And you call it Chrismukkah?

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,149
Just hearing you say it makes me feel
all festive. Allow me to elaborate.

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,233
You see, for my father here, a poor,
struggling Jew growing up in the Bronx...

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,158
...Christmas meant
Chinese food and a movie.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,356
For my mom here,
Waspy McWasp...

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,034
...well, it meant a tree,
stockings and all the trimmings.

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,872
- Isn't that right?
- We're very proud.

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,268
- I'm not a Wasp.
- Sure.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,228
Highlights include eight days of presents
followed by one of many presents.

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,038
So, what do you think?

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,877
- Sounds great for you guys.
- For you too.

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,952
Hey, dip a toe in the Chrismukkah pool.
There's room for all of us.

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,317
Isn't there an Atwood family tradition
you'd like to incorporate...

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,630
...into Seth's  Êber-holiday?
- Yeah.

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,193
Atwood and holidays
is not a good combination.

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,591
- What did you guys do?
- No, seriously, thanks, but...

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,796
Come on, man,
there's got to be something.

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,512
My holiday memories pretty much
consist of my mom drunk...

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,398
...and me getting my ass kicked.

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,034
Well, this year will be entirely different.

43
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,760
New memories. It'll be great.

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,396
Yeah. Well, I'll do
whatever you want me to.

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,676
That's the spirit. Come here.

46
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,280
- <i>Oy</i> humbug.
- It's a big holiday for anyone.

47
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,432
Yeah, I'm still wrapping my head
around it. Give him some time.

48
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,909
Why don't we trim the tree?

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,039
You know what, you guys? Soon Ryan
will learn the magic of Chrismukkah.

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,476
Worry not. I will convert him.

51
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,797
I was gone five minutes.
How did this turn into Santa's workshop?

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,077
I see someone took down the wreath
I hung on the door.

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,878
It fell. What are you wrapping?

54
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,316
Two Seth Cohen starter packs. We got
Death Cab, Bright Eyes, The Shins...

55
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,038
...<i>Kavalier & Clay</i> and <i>Goonies.</i>

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,795
It's not just for kids, Ryan, it's not.
I don't care what they tell you.

57
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,428
Summer and Anna
are gonna love them both equally.

58
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,158
You're getting them the same thing?

59
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,959
Yes, I am. Sometimes I'm so crafty,
I surprise myself.

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,678
No good can come of this,
you know that.

61
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,068
Nope, I don't.

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,958
- You're gonna have to choose, man.
- Hey.

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,271
Not on Chrismukkah, I don't. Okay?
There's no choosing in Chrismukkah.

64
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,716
- Well, you didn't get me anything, right?
- No.

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,636
Come on, man, lighten up.

66
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,430
Okay, fine. Stay dark. Dark works too.

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,239
- Oh, Ryan, what is your shoe size?
- Why?

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,439
- No reason.
- Might that be a Chrismukkah list?

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,192
- No. Why do you ask?
- Okay.

70
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,033
- Let me just see it, then, real fast.
- It's work.

71
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,078
- I love your work. It fascinates me.
- I thought you said no gifts.

72
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,233
- Well, we did. As in, no gifts for us.
- All right. All right.

73
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,432
Well, Chrismukkah's ruined.

74
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,395
Don't even say it. It's unruinable.

75
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,596
It's got twice the resistance
of any normal holiday.

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,194
Your father refused our settlement offer.
He wants a trial.

77
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,193
That's not what he said yesterday.
He said if you met his offer...

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,749
As of this morning,
Scrooge wants to go to court...

79
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,957
...which means I have to spend
the holidays preparing for trial.

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,235
Because with Rachel
out...

81
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,393
Chrismukkah is ruined. Sooner or later
we will get through a holiday around here.

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,629
Stop it right now, okay?

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,793
Don't give up on the miracle that is
Chrismukkah. What is happening to you...?

84
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,676
You'll see. You'll see too.
You'll all see. You'll all see.

85
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,115
- You're starting to scare me.
- I'm okay with that.

86
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,432
Okey-dokey, here we go.
Which tie? What are you thinking?

87
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,388
This one? All right? Or...

88
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,030
- The second one, definitely.
- All right.

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,231
- So you have a job interview today?
- It's just a meet and greet.

90
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,790
But we gotta dress for success, right?

91
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,630
Look, I'm working on it, kiddo.

92
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,396
I'll find a job. I know there's a lot
of extra pressure on the holidays.

93
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,152
There doesn't have to be pressure...

94
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,233
...because there doesn't have to be
any holidays. Really.

95
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,039
- What do you mean?
- We can skip Christmas. It's not like...

96
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,239
...it's not gonna happen again next year,
and holidays just make people depressed.

97
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,471
Are you? Depressed?

98
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,359
You were supposed to go
to therapy after Mexico. We never...

99
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,750
- I'm great. I'm just saying.
- Okay. Good.

100
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,912
Because we're not skipping
Christmas. Come on.

101
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,277
I'll find a job, we'll figure out
a way to make this whole thing work...

102
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,908
...and we're gonna have
lots to celebrate about, okay?

103
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,913
Come on. Skipping Christmas.

104
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,038
- You sure about this tie?
- Yeah, definitely.

105
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,956
- All right.
- You look great.

106
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,588
Skipping Christmas.
What are you, the Grinch?

107
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,480
So Summer and Anna
are both coming to this party?

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,676
- But neither one's my date.
- They know that?

109
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,671
Yeah, in theory they both know that.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,116
Come on, man, relax.
It's a big party, okay?

111
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,635
You might be all doom and gloom,
but me? Check it out.

112
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,473
I'm snowflakes. I'm latkes.
Chrismukkah is coming.

113
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,517
And when Chrismukkah ends?

114
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,554
- I hate when Chrismukkah ends.
- Cohen.

115
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,838
Hi, Ryan. I wanted to know
what the deal was for tonight.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,150
If you were driving,
or should I pick you up?

117
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,193
Hey, Seth. So, what time
are you thinking for tonight?

118
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,190
- Hey, Summer.
- Hey, Anna.

119
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,798
You guys. I was thinking that
we should all probably meet there.

120
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,236
How about that? At whatever time
you choose, by whatever means.

121
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,117
- Sounds great.
- Yeah. Perfect.

122
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,594
You'd better pray
for a Chrismukkah miracle.

123
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,875
I've got Jesus and Moses
on my side, man.

124
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,552
Yeah, make sure all that
goes all the way around the bottom.

125
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,032
Now, guys, the balls are the key
to the whole tree. They need to breathe.

126
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,472
Hey, Kirsten, what do you think?

127
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,518
- It's really something.
- You don't like it?

128
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,595
It's not that. It's just that my mom used
to put the Christmas tree in the foyer.

129
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,309
- It's just a tradition that we have.
- Yeah, Caleb told me.

130
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,199
But then I thought, "You know,
the holidays are hard enough."

131
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,794
Your father doesn't need
to be reminded of the past.

132
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,916
Caleb needs to enjoy this Christmas.

133
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,355
And did Caleb tell you
we need to borrow your office?

134
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,956
We're doing the Santa thing for the kids,
and we need a holding area for the elves.

135
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,439
What are you doing here?
Your father said...

136
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,636
...you're working from home.
- He did?

137
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,109
He's just
full of surprises.

138
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,279
I changed my mind. If the Land Trust
can come up with $200 million...

139
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,079
...then surely they can come up
with $300 million.

140
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,753
I thought this was over.

141
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,876
You can always get more blood
from the stone.

142
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,235
But the stone is my husband.

143
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,197
Let's spend the holidays working.

144
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,989
- That sounds good. You have fun.
- What are you talking about?

145
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,799
I'm gonna do something
that I haven't done in...

146
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,955
...ever.

147
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,795
- I'm taking Christmas vacation.
- Don't be ridiculous, Kiki.

148
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,157
- You hate sitting around.
- Not as much as I hate fighting with you.

149
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,595
So you spend two weeks
buried in legal documents.

150
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,034
I'm gonna be wrapping gifts.

151
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,072
- I hate Christmas.
- Well, Chrismukkah's not much better.

152
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,118
You don't wanna know.
Holidays make what's bad even worse.

153
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,713
I just wish my dad
would drop the act.

154
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,314
I don't need it.
And I don't need Christmas.

155
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,039
Who do you have to spend it with?

156
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,760
Christmas Eve with my dad,
Christmas Day with my mom.

157
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,753
Plus, she's making me go to a stupid
Newport Group party tonight.

158
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,230
- The Cohens are going too, so...
- So at least we'll be miserable together.

159
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,837
- Deal?
- Deal. So am I seeing you after school?

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,436
I got some stuff to do,
some shopping. South Coast Plaza.

161
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,558
You're going to South Coast Plaza?
Alone?

162
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,835
I don't think
you're ready for that.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,230
You need a seasoned expert
to protect you.

164
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,718
Well, you know someone?

165
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,878
So no luck, huh?

166
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,600
There's a 99-cent store down the street.

167
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,157
I guess I can't really afford
this place anymore.

168
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,038
Why did we come?

169
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,796
I know it sounds stupid,
but I like it here.

170
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,554
Everything is so perfect.

171
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,551
You walk around feeling
like your problems...

172
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,359
...can be solved by
the right nail polish...

173
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,158
...or a new pair of shoes.

174
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,594
Miss, I'm gonna have to ask
to see your purse.

175
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,479
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I can't let you leave the premises.

176
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,677
If you don't hand over your purse,
I'll have to call the police.

177
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,193
Look, back off, all right?

178
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,510
- Ryan, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

179
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,398
Your purse. Now.

180
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,230
What are you doing?

181
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,312
What are you doing?
Working from home?

182
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,550
- I'm on vacation.
- Yes. Clearly.

183
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,315
- I find reviewing accounts to be relaxing.
- I hope that's a recessive gene.

184
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,351
You should be so lucky.

185
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,991
Look, I haven't taken a vacation
in a while, and I'm easing into it.

186
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,879
- I don't judge. I only mock.
- That you get from your father.

187
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,031
Oh, my God, they're coming in?

188
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,829
Oh, the... I got you. What are those?

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,072
They came for Ryan
from his mom and his brother.

190
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,355
You know what he said
about the holidays?

191
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,239
When he talks like that,
I have no idea what to say.

192
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,153
Me neither. You just have
to be yourself.

193
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,719
Yeah, because that
always works so well.

194
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,838
Being a family is hard
under any circumstance.

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,551
Creating a new one?
That's gotta feel weird sometimes.

196
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,393
Feeling weird is
right in my wheelhouse.

197
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,556
What is it? Is Grandpa going crazy
with the company credit card again?

198
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,513
What is it this time? Hookers?
A little blow, perhaps?

199
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,511
Grandpa likes to dance
with ye white lady?

200
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,070
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know. What is it?

201
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,593
It's... Hopefully, it's nothing.

202
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,433
You should go get ready,
because we have to be there soon.

203
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,079
I'll go put on my face.

204
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,520
Hi. This is Kirsten Cohen
from the Newport Group.

205
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,559
My father ordered a survey of
the Balboa Heights and I've lost my copy.

206
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,589
I really need to see the document.
Is it possible for you to fax it over to me?

207
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,993
- I cannot believe this. Marissa?
- Julie.

208
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,197
Look, I have to host the most important
event of my career tonight.

209
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,157
At least your priorities are in order.

210
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,676
You know, it's amazing how these
calamities keep happening on your watch.

211
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,910
Oh, so I'm to blame for this one too?

212
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,957
- Where did she learn to steal?
- Stop it.

213
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,829
I'm the one who stole, remember?
I'm the one to blame, not Dad.

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,072
Look, we're lucky the store
is not pressing charges.

215
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,238
Okay? Marissa and I were deciding
what an appropriate punishment...

216
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,428
Oh, really? Well, way to rule with
the iron fist, Stalin, but it's not up to her.

217
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,195
- No car, no allowance, no weekends.
- So I can stay home tonight?

218
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,036
Starting tomorrow. I won't have my
party ruined by your little sticky fingers.

219
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,033
Look, sweetie, I know that this time of
year makes everything bad seem worse.

220
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,519
But why did you do this?

221
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,228
I thought it would be...

222
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,631
Look, I wasn't...

223
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,149
It was stupid.

224
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,157
I called the therapist
on the way over.

225
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,276
- Mom.
- She's right, kiddo.

226
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,476
Therapy was part of the deal
of you moving in.

227
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,837
Okay, look, I've been doing
way better since Mexico.

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,719
4.0 first quarter.
Charity League, social chair.

229
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,270
I scheduled you an appointment
tomorrow with Dr. Milano. He's great.

230
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,394
I'm sorry, but I can handle it.

231
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,235
This. L... I won't do it again, I promise.

232
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,753
Honey, I love you.

233
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,155
But I don't believe you.

234
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,156
You might actually find it helpful.

235
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,515
Yeah. Whatever. I need to get ready.

236
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,557
And, Mom, you have your
big party to throw.

237
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,792
I'm sure you don't want to keep
Caleb waiting.

238
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,351
Hey. What's up, man? You're back.

239
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,035
So that's pretty cool, right?
Your mom and brother got you something.

240
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,033
Yeah. Except now I have
a total of eight gifts to buy.

241
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,519
I only saved enough for one.

242
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,912
Ryan, that sort of reminds me
of the story of Hanukkah, dude.

243
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,596
Check it out. The lamp... You know what?
I think you get the gist.

244
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,389
- How was the mall?
- Weird.

245
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,033
You've really painted a picture for me.
I feel like I was there.

246
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,953
Marissa picked up a few things
without paying for them.

247
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,469
- What? As in...
- Shoplifting.

248
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,273
Yeah.

249
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,155
- Yeah, that's weird.
- It's the time of year.

250
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,788
And with everything that's going on
with her family...

251
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,633
- Yeah, I'm sure it's gotta be hard for her.
- Yeah.

252
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,998
I just wish there was something
I could do or say.

253
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,389
Oh, I got you something.

254
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,633
- No, no, no. We had an agreement.
- But this is different, this is a requirement.

255
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,828
I know it's a bit minty, but, you know,
we all have one, so we just thought...

256
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,793
No, that's cool.

257
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,793
Well, good. Maybe it'll meet
a kinder fate than your wreath did.

258
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,269
But, if not, we still
wanted you to have it.

259
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,158
- Thanks.
- All right.

260
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,588
I'm gonna go
make magic happen.

261
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,672
I feel like my hair's
working for me tonight.

262
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,708
I'm late. I know. I know.

263
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,513
I'll hurry.
You're not gonna believe this...

264
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,069
...but your father and I
reached a settlement today.

265
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,277
He gouged me a little.
Well, you know, he gouged me a lot.

266
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,275
- He asked you for more money?
- Just $250 million.

267
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,509
But we closed the deal.

268
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,717
- He claims that he did it because of you.
- Is that what he told you?

269
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,474
It seems your vacation
really hit him hard.

270
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,428
Because he says he wants
to spend the holidays as a family.

271
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,874
You know, maybe...
Maybe he's changing.

272
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,909
Or maybe he is a truly fantastic liar.
What's wrong?

273
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,074
I found something today.

274
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,069
And I don't know if I can give it to you,
but I don't know if I can't.

275
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,677
- Okay, well...
- He's gonna know that I gave this to you.

276
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,400
And he's gonna have
every right to fire me.

277
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,152
You have got to be kidding me.

278
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,873
This changes everything.

279
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,919
And I'm gonna have to learn how to relax,
because I'm gonna have a lot of free time.

280
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,278
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Not as sorry as he's gonna be.

281
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,958
- You still wanna go to the party?
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

282
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,753
- Anna. Hey.
- Mistletoe.

283
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,757
That's very festive of you.

284
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,672
I thought we were meeting there.

285
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,671
I was thinking maybe
we could go together.

286
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,393
I would love to.
You know I would.

287
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,357
But don't you think
that would violate...

288
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,556
...our little Geneva Convention
of dating we have?

289
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,790
Because I told Summer
I'd meet you both there.

290
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,996
Well, how is Summer ever gonna know?

291
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,752
- Mistletoe. What is she doing here?
- What are you doing here?

292
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,229
- I thought we had a deal, Cohen.
- Which you violated.

293
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,958
- As did you.
- She's got a point.

294
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,237
- You're on her side?
- No. There are no sides, you guys.

295
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,712
There's only rides. With my parents.
We'll all go together.

296
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,511
- Fine.
- Fine.

297
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,750
So I have a gift for you.
I'll give it to you later.

298
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,278
I have a present for you too.
I'll also give it to you later.

299
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,476
I can't wait.

300
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,551
For either.

301
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,312
For both.

302
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,838
Seth, are you ready?
Come on, let's go.

303
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,792
Hi, Summer. Anna.

304
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,552
Ladies.

305
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,312
Oh, this is gonna be some party.

306
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,992
You know, maybe it's not
such a bad idea.

307
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,717
What does that mean?

308
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,871
It might be good
to have someone to talk to.

309
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,430
- You're someone. I can't talk to you?
- You can talk to me, it's just...

310
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,956
What? I need the help of a trained
professional because I stole a lipstick?

311
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,874
- It's not about the lipstick.
- Then I guess I don't see what it's about.

312
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,672
- You should do what you want.
- I will.

313
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,037
If no one's making my parents
go to therapy, then no one's making me.

314
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,351
You know, I'm the only
normal one in this family.

315
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,033
Sorry.

316
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,555
I think I left my wrap upstairs. Could you
grab it for me? I need to get my purse.

317
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,517
Sure.

318
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,876
Mushroom crescent?
Crab and brie phyllo?

319
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,235
Come on, buddy.
Change it up a little bit.

320
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,197
Enjoy the party.

321
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,359
Come on, Seth. I'm going this way.

322
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,590
I'm going this way.

323
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,389
Oh, you guys are?
I'm gonna go look for Ryan. Excuse me.

324
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,636
Kirsten, Sandy, welcome.

325
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,233
- Kiki.
- Hey.

326
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,034
Great to see you.
Did Sandman give you our good news?

327
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,078
- He did.
- I need to follow up...

328
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,832
...on some things with you,
if you don't mind...

329
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,274
Come, Sanford, it's a party.

330
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,512
Look back on your Berkeley days.
Maybe you can smoke the tree.

331
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,876
Smoke the tree. Funny.

332
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,996
I'm gonna nail him now.

333
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,110
- So, what do you think?
- About?

334
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,396
The party. You haven't said anything.
Like it?

335
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,198
I mean, I know how you feel
about the tree...

336
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,952
...but if you can get past that.

337
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,838
- It's great.
- And what did Caleb think?

338
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,834
- I mean, has he said anything to you?
- I haven't had a chance to talk to him.

339
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,077
I just want this to be
a party that he'll never forget.

340
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,595
I think you have a shot.

341
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,910
- You okay?
- Yeah. Why?

342
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,549
I don't know.

343
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,438
Today's been kind of intense...

344
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,234
...and I know you don't
really wanna be here.

345
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,278
I wanna be where you are,
and you're here, so...

346
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,074
Marissa.
Oh, you wore the Chanel. How pretty.

347
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,754
Ryan. You haven't said hello to Caleb yet.

348
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,912
He was talking to other people,
and I didn't want to interrupt.

349
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,877
- He's ready now, so...
- I'm not.

350
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,758
- Marissa.
- Mom.

351
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,275
- You are a guest at this party.
- You made me come.

352
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,352
- You're in enough trouble.
- Then I guess I've got nothing to lose.

353
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,671
- This is the way it's gonna be?
- I don't know. I'll ask my shrink.

354
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,994
You know what,
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

355
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,875
- I hate the holidays.
- Right there with you.

356
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,918
Caleb. You have time to talk?

357
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,389
- No.
- Come on, make some.

358
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,040
- What is this?
- A geological survey of the Heights...

359
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,590
...which you commissioned and somehow
failed to turn over to my office.

360
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,512
- I've no time for this.
- I think you do.

361
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,432
Allow me to summarize what you know.

362
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,910
The Heights are seismologically unsound,
the whole area is uninsurable.

363
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,958
- It's worthless.
- As is your theory.

364
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,475
There's no way
you'd have gotten a building permit.

365
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,596
- And you knew that.
- What do you want, Sandy?

366
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,910
I wanna buy back the Heights.

367
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,638
For a dollar.

368
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,116
You cannot be serious.

369
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,196
Merry Christmas.

370
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,719
So are you ready for your present?

371
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,190
Yeah, I'm ready. Hand me the keys.
I'll learn to drive stick eventually.

372
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,430
Very funny, Seth.
Always have to ruin the mood.

373
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,635
That's what I do.

374
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,959
Ready?

375
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,792
<i>The Adventures of Seth Cohen</i>
<i>and Captain Oats.</i>

376
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,951
<i>Volume 1: "Confidence."</i>

377
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,793
- You made this?
- No, I bought it on eBay.

378
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,394
I can't believe you did this.
This is amazing.

379
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,358
Hey, this Seth in the story
seems really handsome and awesome.

380
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,638
- I guess I took some liberties.
- You dumbed him down a little bit.

381
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,756
- This is fantastic.
- Thanks.

382
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,390
- So how's Seth doing?
- He's fine, I think.

383
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,757
It's hard to tell
with him sometimes. Why?

384
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,030
Does he ever do things that sort of...

385
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,272
...make you question yourself
as a parent?

386
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,673
Well, there was the model home
and Tijuana...

387
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,273
...and a thing with the Range Rover...

388
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,034
...and an IMAX movie that
I didn't quite buy.

389
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,034
But they're kids. I mean, they do stuff.
They get in trouble, right?

390
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,078
Our parents would've had a heart attack
if they knew what we did.

391
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,677
Come on, we were good kids.
We were. Weren't we?

392
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,592
- We were good kids.
- Yeah.

393
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,274
And we have good kids.

394
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,155
Okay, hang on for a second.
What are we doing here?

395
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,392
Because Anna went to get drinks.
She'll be back in, like, one second.

396
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,551
- Come here.
- Why?

397
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,153
- Just come here.
- Okay.

398
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,434
Stay there.

399
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,751
I hear you like comic books, Cohen.

400
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,151
This is true.

401
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,150
Merry Christmas.

402
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
Good Lord, I think I'm gonna pass out.

403
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,796
- You're not going anywhere.
- Okay.

404
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,314
- Yes?
- What's this?

405
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,797
That's Anna's present.
She made it for me.

406
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,874
- She made it?
- Yeah.

407
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,872
It's amazing.

408
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,793
I know, but your present's amazing too.
It's really amazing.

409
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,997
Hey, there you...

410
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,593
...are.

411
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,716
Hey, Anna, Summer was just
giving me her gift. It's cool.

412
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,077
- You're Wonder Woman?
- Yeah. So?

413
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,236
I mean, you look...

414
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,152
...amazing.

415
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,197
Is that my story?

416
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,912
My God, I made you a comic book.
What am I, 8?

417
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,273
Way to go, Wonder Whore.

418
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,396
Hey, Wonder Woman's not
a whore, okay? Stop.

419
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,835
- What are we doing?
- I don't know, this is nuts.

420
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,592
Hold up, you guys, one second.

421
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,672
Let's not have one speed bump
derail the whole train, okay?

422
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,308
Let's not throw the baby out
with the bath water.

423
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,791
- Let's make some more metaphors.
- Look...

424
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,636
...I'm not into talking about, like,
feelings or whatever...

425
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,949
...but I like you.

426
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,350
Okay, and so does she.

427
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,470
- Lf we don't put an end to this soon...
- Someone's gonna get hurt.

428
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,114
You gotta choose, Cohen.

429
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,112
Did you miss me?

430
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,199
- Come on, let's dance.
- You know how I feel about dancing.

431
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,999
You know how I don't care.
Come on, it's a party.

432
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,912
Yeah, an office party.

433
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,153
I thought you wanted to have fun.
Don't make me make you have fun.

434
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,551
I'm guessing that's not eggnog.

435
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,759
So what? Come on, if you don't wanna
dance we could just get out of here.

436
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,436
- I didn't see you with a cocktail.
- Well, maybe I brought my own.

437
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,272
Want some?

438
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,393
What's going on with you today?

439
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,038
- What's the big deal? You drink.
- Not alone in the bathroom.

440
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,553
I'm just having fun.

441
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,029
When I met you,
you were passed out in your driveway.

442
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,509
Then it was an alley in Mexico. It's like...

443
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,193
It's like my mom all over again.

444
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,471
Shut up.

445
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,835
- We're getting out of here.
- No, I am.

446
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,513
- Enjoy the party.
- You can't drive.

447
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,958
Get your hands off of me. I have enough
people in my life telling me what to do.

448
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,837
See you.

449
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,431
- Come on, let me drive.
- Get away from me.

450
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,795
Hey.

451
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,359
Hey.

452
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,229
I'm fine.

453
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,389
And so, effective immediately,
I'm transferring the title of the Heights...

454
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,791
...to the Balboa Land Trust
for the very reasonable price...

455
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,313
...of $ 1.

456
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,475
And I couldn't have done it without
the help of my son-in-law, Sandy Cohen.

457
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,915
Thanks, Cal. But I can't take credit
for this. You did this all on your own.

458
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,629
To Caleb Nichol, the most generous
man in Newport Beach.

459
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,590
Thanks.

460
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,516
Happy Hanukkah, Sandy.

461
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,032
- Great.
- What? You're driving.

462
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,760
- Yeah, because you're drunk.
- I'm not...

463
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,519
Fine.

464
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,276
- Where is it?
- Come on, put it away.

465
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,237
- I'm trying.
- I'm still on probation.

466
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,550
I said, I'm trying.

467
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,115
Of course this is happening.

468
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,791
Oh, God.

469
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,395
Happy holidays. License. Registration.

470
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,031
You got a broken tail light,
you know that?

471
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,872
It just happened. I'll get it fixed.

472
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,759
- You kids haven't been drinking?
- No, sir.

473
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,110
- Everything all right here, miss?
- Yeah, fine. Thanks.

474
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,878
- Miss, would you...?
- <i>We got a 459...</i>

475
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,758
<i>... at 1508 Cornwall Lane</i>
<i>in West Cliff.</i>

476
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,036
<i>All cars in the area</i>
<i>please respond immediately.</i>

477
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,277
Copy that.

478
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,510
I've got a call I need to get to.

479
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,514
I'm gonna let you go with just a warning
for that tail light. You get that fixed.

480
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,477
- Drive straight home.
- Yes, sir.

481
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,997
Stop, okay? You're scaring me.

482
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,515
Good. You're scaring me.

483
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,479
There's drinking, crying, cops.
Well, it must be Christmas.

484
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,870
I left this behind.

485
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,313
I am not doing it again.

486
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,278
Okay.

487
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,718
Okay.

488
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,716
Well, the ladies laid down the law.
It's over.

489
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,269
- What are you gonna do?
- I have no idea.

490
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,750
I don't know. No female's
ever really offered me a choice.

491
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,798
I really only know
how to handle rejection and ridicule.

492
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,077
I have a really good handle on ridicule.
How was your night?

493
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,074
Marissa got drunk, and we got pulled over
by the cops with an open bottle of vodka.

494
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,959
Hey, that Marissa's really
making life interesting for you.

495
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,953
- Yeah. We got in a fight.
- What about the cop?

496
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,750
Got a radio call. Let us off
with a warning for a busted tail light.

497
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,276
- Now you see why I hate Christmas.
- Hang on a second, Ryan.

498
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,230
It seems to me that what we have here
is a Chrismukkah miracle.

499
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,836
Thank you. Think about it for a second.
The old Ryan, what would've happened?

500
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,675
He would've got busted. For sure. But
this time, you had Jesus working for you.

501
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,149
And you had Moses.
Working together. The super team.

502
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,676
Fighting for you, to keep you safe
and give you a second chance.

503
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,592
Touched by an angel.

504
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,639
That's nice. It's got a good ring to it.
I believe my faith has been restored.

505
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,674
I should go get ready.

506
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,513
- Anna will be here soon.
- What are you going to tell her?

507
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,477
I'm sure the words will come.

508
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,476
All right, I just think that...

509
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,949
...considering everything...
Actually, wait, hang on.

510
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,918
Let me actually try another approach.

511
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,437
I think you're awesome,
and you're hilarious, and you're <i>caliente.</i>

512
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,873
And I think, you know,
you're extremely witty, and you're wise...

513
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,555
...and I kind of can't believe
I'm actually gonna say this.

514
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,837
But...

515
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,389
...actually, I think
we should be friends.

516
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,632
And I want you to have this.

517
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,279
I don't wanna be your friend.

518
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,997
I don't wanna be your friend.

519
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,113
You can never have
too many copies of <i>The Goonies</i>.

520
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,549
That was corporate espionage.
I could've fired you.

521
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,358
Even sued you for breach
of confidentiality.

522
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,274
Dad. You were extorting the county,
putting the company at huge risks.

523
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,431
One day this was gonna come out.
Then what?

524
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,673
When you found that report,
you could've shown me.

525
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,831
You could've shown me
when it started.

526
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,070
I'm sorry, but I just didn't see
any other way.

527
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,519
It was dishonest,
calculating and ruthless. Kiki...

528
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,308
...we just might make
a real-estate mogul out of you yet.

529
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,071
Well, that's something to look forward to.

530
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,118
Your mom's ornaments.
The tree looks nice.

531
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,960
There may be a gift under there for you.

532
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,039
Maybe.

533
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,911
Hey, where you going?
We were thinking about getting a movie.

534
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,911
Marissa's going to see her therapist.

535
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,958
- She's going through a lot.
- Yeah, I thought I'd go with her.

536
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,631
Yeah, you could...

537
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,756
...or not.

538
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,031
Marissa's gonna have to figure this
out by herself, and you gotta let her.

539
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,998
You're here with us now.
You don't have to be the parent anymore.

540
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,472
- A movie, huh?
- Yeah, but it's my pick.

541
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,518
The selection of a movie
is something of an art.

542
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,794
I came here three times before I
actually walked through that door.

543
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,312
I know you. You go to Harbor, right?

544
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,111
Marissa Cooper. Hi.

545
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,996
You're the girl at school who
organizes things. Parties and stuff, right?

546
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,030
Social chair is what that's called.

547
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,239
- You go to Harbor?
- No. No, I go to Pacific.

548
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,073
Oliver Trask.

549
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,509
For a social chair... Well, I don't
find you to be very social at all.

550
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,717
Gonna have to talk
to somebody about a recall.

551
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,431
This is a psychiatrist's office.
It's kind of embarrassing.

552
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,878
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
This is totally embarrassing.

553
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,677
So let's address the obvious and move on.

554
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,630
What's wrong with you?

555
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,674
What is wrong with you?

556
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,634
Well, if I knew, I wouldn't be here.

557
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,234
You're not an alcoholic yet.

558
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,799
You've OD'd at least once.

559
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,949
Pills, I'd say.
Muscle relaxants, definitely.

560
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,873
Painkillers.

561
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,991
You didn't really want to hurt yourself.

562
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,038
Kurt Cobain, yeah,
he wanted to hurt himself.

563
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,036
You know, coming here wasn't my idea.

564
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,554
Maybe not. But you wouldn't be here
if you didn't want to be.

565
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,234
You want to know
why you are the way you are.

566
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,399
That's you. I'm waiting on the next door.

567
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,437
See you next week.

568
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,196
How did it go with the girls?

569
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,875
- Seth Cohen starter pack?
- I think I'm past that now.

570
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,789
- Is that what I think it is?
- Figured I'd hang it.

571
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,397
All right, man,
another Chrismukkah convert.

572
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,549
Nice.

573
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,998
I never doubted it for a second. Check it
out, I already put the hook up just in case.

574
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,793
- Hey.
- All right, what'll it be?

575
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,155
<i>Fiddler on the Roof,</i>
<i>It's a Wonderful Life...</i>

576
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,039
...or my selection,
Sylvester Stallone's <i>Over the Top.</i>

577
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,909
- Isn't that the arm-wrestling movie?
- Arm-wrestling classic.

578
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,200
- Hey, merry Chrismukkah, you guys.
- Thank you.
