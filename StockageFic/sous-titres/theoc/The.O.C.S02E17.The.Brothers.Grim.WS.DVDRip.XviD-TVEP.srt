1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,754
-Previously on The O. C. :
-Carter Buckley. What's he done?

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,831
He published a magazine
called Revolution.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,758
I read it. I'd love to meet him.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,188
-Where'd you find this?
-My husband.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,038
Well, I'll have to meet him.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,993
This is not the moment when you want
your reputation undone.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,474
You got three days...

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,558
...or everyone is gonna see
a lot more than your face.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,399
-I can't do it. I'm really sorry.
-You can't fight fate.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,434
You and I are back together, maybe
Marissa and Ryan might get it together.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,154
-So who are you?
-Whoever you want me to be.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,158
All right, dinnertime!
How do you feel about chicken parm?

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,992
That is simply unacceptable.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,674
Hey, don't look at me.
I'm the one who wanted Thai.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,070
Carter, I am gonna
have to call you back.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,719
Okay.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,472
I barely recognize you without a wire
coming out of your ear.

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,428
Honey, I'm sorry. It's just that we're
unveiling the magazine to advertisers...

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,479
...in 67 hours. At which point, I will
have some semblance of a life back.

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,914
Well, here's hoping.

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,196
And every time I do that,
you pause it.

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,079
Oh, yes.
I thought I smelled Al Forno's.

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,630
-Thank you. I'm starving.
-Thanks. Nice.

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,149
-See you later.
-Whoa, no, no. Sorry.

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,316
This is a family dinner.

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,875
No. The sneak-attack family dinner.

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,076
-We walked right into it.
-I have to work.

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,152
Ryan and I are in the middle
of a very crucial PlayStation game.

29
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,231
-It's like our Super Bowl.
-I don't care.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,233
Nobody here eats unless we sit down
and eat as a family.

31
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,638
No excuses. Tonight and together.
Now sit down. Everybody. Come on.

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,199
Great.

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,238
You too.

34
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,152
Family time's always best
when it's forced.

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,079
You're not gonna be invited
on the family trip I'm planning.

36
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,948
Ryan, you ever seen Mount Rushmore?

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,280
-Could be work.
-Summer gets mad if I'm not available.

38
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,000
-Marissa's supposed to call me.
-I'll get the phone.

39
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,515
Nobody's taking any calls.
It is dinnertime.

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,598
Hello?

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,631
Just a second.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,592
It's for you.

43
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,439
What? Ryan gets to talk on the phone
during dinner...

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,591
...and I can't play PlayStation?

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,519
Hello?

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,073
Hey.

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,158
Really? When?

48
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,510
Yeah. No. All right.

49
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,798
Yeah.

50
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,359
See you then.

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,911
That was Trey.

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,271
-Your brother?
-Yeah.

53
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,158
He's getting out of jail tomorrow.

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,348
-He wants me to pick him up in Chino.
-There's that family trip you wanted.

55
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,717
Hey, what are you doing in here?

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,996
There's bagels and cream cheese
in the kitchen.

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,276
-Yeah, I'm coming.
-And yet you're sitting.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,037
I guess I just needed a second
to brace myself for today.

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,719
Yeah.

60
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,236
Picking up your brother from prison.
That is not not intense.

61
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,677
Have you talked to him
at all, since--?

62
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,634
Last Thanksgiving when he tried
to get me to steal a car? No.

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,633
I kind of thought he was
out of my life for good.

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,791
Do you want him out of your life?

65
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,434
I don't know. Maybe.

66
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,558
He's my brother, but....

67
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,109
-The guy is trouble.
-lf you want my advice....

68
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,958
I mean, l....

69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,549
Who am I kidding?
I'm totally out of my league.

70
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,870
I will say this, though.
As your brother...

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,789
...your other brother who's less related
to you, I officially have your back.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,468
-Thanks, man.
-All right. Let's go. Put your shoes on.

73
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,073
-The bagels are waiting.
-Yes.

74
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,038
I know Trey is the only family
that Ryan has...

75
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,997
...and I think we should help him....

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,670
But you're scared I'm gonna want
to adopt him? Honey, don't worry.

77
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,628
Trey is 20 years old and an ex-con.
I don't think he wants to be adopted.

78
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,673
-Don't you think we gotta help?
-We don't know what effect...

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,274
...this will have on Ryan.
He's been doing so well.

80
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,153
Morning. You might wanna switch
to a more neutral topic.

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,591
-I was just about to get you. You ready?
-Sure.

82
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,360
Look, I appreciate you driving me
down to Chino...

83
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,954
...but this shouldn't
have to be your problem.

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,720
Hey, if it's a Ryan problem,
it's a Cohen problem.

85
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,593
-Here you go. For the road.
-Thanks.

86
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,758
Dad, I think I should head down
to prison with you guys...

87
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,751
...and take the day off school.

88
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,071
We all know I've had some,
well, behavioral issues this year...

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,596
...and I think prison might be
just the thing to scare me straight.

90
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,113
Nice try. Get to school.

91
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,070
Seth just said that Ryan went
to go pick up Trey from jail.

92
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,673
I wish I could've known.

93
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,355
So you could've gone? The last time
you two went to jail, it didn't go well.

94
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,431
Well, at least I could be there for him.

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,068
Coop, you sound extremely
girlfriend-y right now.

96
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,279
I'm just trying to be his friend, which is
the part we skipped over last time.

97
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,989
Besides, Ryan and Trey have
a very complicated relationship.

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,879
Speaking of which....

99
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,072
Zach? Oh, my God.
I'm having a panic spiral.

100
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,798
-That's Zach on the Vespa?
-Yeah.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,399
He was in ltaly for so long...

102
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,199
...I assumed he bought a villa
and opened an espresso bar.

103
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,072
-Are you gonna say hello?
-I can't.

104
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,118
I ditched him at the airport
in front of his family.

105
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,113
-Say something. He's coming.
-I'm about to get bitch-slapped.

106
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,311
-Hi, Zach. Welcome back.
-Hey, guys.

107
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,715
-Hey.
-Or, wait:

108
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,876
-How was ltaly?
-Oh, it was amazing.

109
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,758
Probably the best vacation
of my life.

110
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,713
Oh, I'm gonna be late.
Listen, great to see you guys.

111
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,514
Catch up with me at lunch.
I got some awesome pictures.

112
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,951
-Okay.
-Okay. All right.

113
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,758
-Later.
-Cool. Bye.

114
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,070
Somebody totally spiked
that guy's gelato.

115
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
I guess you don't have to worry.
He seems pretty okay.

116
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,951
Yeah, a little too okay.

117
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,190
I'm not buying it.
He's hiding something.

118
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,958
Flashback?

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,711
-A little bit.
-lt feels like 1 00 years...

120
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,155
...since I got you out of juvie,
doesn't it?

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,514
And he's been in here the whole time.

122
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,075
What would you say
if Trey stayed with us?

123
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,276
At least for a little while.

124
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,196
I don't know.

125
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,955
If no one helps him, statistics say
he's back in jail within a year.

126
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,509
Trey's old enough to take care
of himself.

127
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,631
Little brother.

128
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,709
Good to see you, man.

129
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,918
-I'm Sandy Cohen.
-Nice to finally meet you.

130
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,437
-You hungry?
-Starving.

131
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,710
All right. Let's go.

132
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,118
So I think we hold on this shot of
the coast just a bit longer, just until....

133
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,919
-See, into this shot.
-What are you two doing?

134
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,270
Cutting a video for the showcase:

135
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,590
"An lntroduction to Newport Living. "

136
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,433
Your magazine?
The one with you on the cover.

137
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,196
Right, right. I'm sorry. I'm just....
I'm a little distracted.

138
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,710
Kirsten, could I talk to you
for a moment in private?

139
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,438
I'm going to get some air.

140
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,080
I made a mistake, Kiki.

141
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,312
-A naked mistake.
-Excuse me?

142
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,478
A hundred years ago,
a boyfriend convinced me...

143
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,155
...to let him film me in the act.

144
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,635
I was young, living on ramen,
I needed the money.

145
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,758
I told him he could never show it
to anyone or release it...

146
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,070
...which he didn't, until now.

147
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,636
-Unless I give him half a million dollars.
-Did you talk to a lawyer?

148
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,753
Sandy was able to negotiate the rights
from him, but we still need the money.

149
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,392
Well, if Sandy can't help you,
you're gonna have to tell my dad.

150
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,116
This is it.

151
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,270
-Who are you staying with?
-My buddy, Rick.

152
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,598
I think it's his brother's house,
but they said it's cool if I stay there.

153
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,719
Good to see you.

154
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,399
-Take care of yourself.
-Yeah.

155
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,758
-Thanks for lunch again, Mr. Cohen.
-Take care.

156
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,032
I'll call you.

157
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,755
What do you say we give it a try?
Just for a few days.

158
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,312
Hey, Trey!

159
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,872
Wanna come with us?

160
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,078
Hey, man, you came back.

161
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,953
-People never leave and come back.
-Long time no see.

162
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,835
-How you been?
-Good. Dude, things are really good.

163
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,430
Listen, about what happened
with you and me and Summer--

164
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,238
No, no, don't worry about it.

165
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,796
You two belong together.
I should've clued into that a while ago.

166
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,759
Actually, I did clue into that
a while ago.

167
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,837
-Whatever, man. I'm fine with it.
-Yeah?

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,036
-Yeah.
-You seem different.

169
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,272
-You seem like--
-Like I'm vibrating at a high frequency?

170
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,953
-Sure.
-lf I tell you something...

171
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,429
-...do you promise not to tell Summer?
-Yeah, okay.

172
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,592
My track record with secret-keeping
hasn't been that good...

173
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,275
-...but it's gotta turn around sometime.
-Look, man, when I was in ltaly...

174
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,396
...I met someone.
Her name's Francesca.

175
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,353
-Yeah? What's she like?
-Tall. Blond. Gorgeous.

176
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,516
Doesn't speak English,
but she's learning.

177
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,399
When we met, it was, like,
we just clicked.

178
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,875
Are you guys still clicking?
Across the globe?

179
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,516
We've got webcam. We got e-mail.
We got instant-message date.

180
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,637
-Long-distance dating is so hot.
-Do me a favor, all right?

181
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,673
Don't tell Summer. It might hurt her
that I moved on quickly.

182
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,871
Y eah, yeah. My lips are sealed.

183
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,150
-Cool. Great.
-Okay.

184
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,759
Bye.

185
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,040
Well, this is the crib.

186
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,273
You gotta be kidding me.

187
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,109
If it's any consolation, I felt
the same way the first time I saw it.

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,991
Bet you get used to it, huh?

189
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,910
Trey, why don't you stay
in the pool house.

190
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,469
-Ryan, you take the guest room.
-Y eah, okay.

191
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,791
Wait. Did he just say pool house?

192
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,553
This is where you've been living?

193
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,115
You got hooked up.

194
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,077
Yeah.

195
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,468
Towels are in the linen closet. You can
borrow whatever shower stuff you need.

196
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,039
Thanks.

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,676
And sorry I'm kicking you out
of your little cabana mansion here.

198
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,115
It's only for a few days.

199
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,635
Don't worry.
I won't get too comfortable.

200
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,992
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean--
-I know I'm crashing your party here.

201
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,438
But you got a good thing
going on here...

202
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,431
...and I'm not gonna screw it up.

203
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,832
I promise.

204
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,231
Okay.

205
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,279
-See you later.
-See you later.

206
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,469
Hey, man, I want some details.
Does Trey seem different to you?

207
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,269
I mean, has he found Jesus?
Does he have a Chinese tattoo?

208
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,715
Did he shave his head?

209
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,352
-Oh for 3.
-Oh, hi.

210
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,353
-You're not Ryan.
-Nope. Trey.

211
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,118
Yeah, well, I was close.

212
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,272
You're still an Atwood.
Only a slightly more edgy...

213
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,357
...darker version, I think.

214
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,034
But some people think
Ryan's gotten a little softer--

215
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,595
-Ryan said you talk a lot.
-Yeah, it's a problem.

216
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,389
But hopefully one you'll come
to find endearing.

217
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,319
So how does it, you know,
feel to be...

218
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,959
...Iike, out?

219
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,074
-Good.
-Yeah. Cool.

220
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,232
Monosyllables run in the family.
That's awesome. Hey!

221
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,398
Oh, good. You two have met.
Trey's gonna be staying with us.

222
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,272
Just until I can find my own place.

223
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,477
You might need to go shopping.

224
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,353
This is just to get started.
For clothing, toiletries....

225
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,596
You know, all the basics.

226
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,079
-You sure?
-Of course.

227
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,636
-You can show Trey where to go, right?
-Yeah.

228
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,950
Want me to come? I got a knack for
picking out the post-prison wardrobe.

229
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,957
-You coming?
-Yeah.

230
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,076
Call Marissa. Have her meet us.

231
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,840
-It's a better job for Cosmo Girl.
-Yeah.

232
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,792
Not like you to drop in for lunch.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

233
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,475
With all the hustle and bustle
of this showcase, I've barely seen you.

234
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,272
It's crawfish, your favorite.

235
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,079
I thought we should check in.
Have a state of the union.

236
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,078
Well, sounds fair enough.
What's on the agenda?

237
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,755
We ought to replace the showerhead
in the one guest bathroom upstairs.

238
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,474
Oh, and you really have to fire
that new gardener.

239
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,029
Those are some sorry-looking
hydrangeas out front.

240
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,998
Fine.

241
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,832
Was there anything else?

242
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,239
I made an adult film
in the '80s with an ex-boyfriend...

243
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,631
...who's threatening to release it
unless I pay half a million dollars.

244
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,876
And I really would like
to redo the kitchen.

245
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,914
-Are you saying you did porn?
-lt was erotica. T asteful, at times.

246
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,559
You're in quite a bind.

247
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,395
See, I knew it. I knew that you would
react this way. Absolutely no sympathy.

248
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,279
And this from a man who
kept an illegitimate child hidden--

249
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,510
It's all right. I'll pay the money.

250
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,276
-You will?
-Well, your dignity's at stake.

251
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,238
I'd say that's worth
half a million dollars.

252
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,717
Oh, thank God.

253
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,077
You have no idea how much damage
this could've caused the magazine...

254
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,835
-...and Marissa, me.
-I'll call my financial advisor.

255
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,116
-You should go back to work.
-Right.

256
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,589
Because I have a magazine to launch.

257
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,233
Cal...

258
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,591
...thank you.

259
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,071
-How can Zach act so normal?
-And here we are again.

260
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,954
I ditched him at the airport. It's not what
you'd call letting him down easy.

261
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,311
I'm not certain on this,
but I thought you and I were dating.

262
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,876
I know. I just didn't expect him
to get over me so fast.

263
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,354
Well, Zach's resilient.

264
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,559
Under all that floppy hair and goofy
smile, there's, like, a layer of steel.

265
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,354
You talked to him today, right?
Did he say anything?

266
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,273
Any footnotes
to the whole "l love ltaly" story?

267
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,999
-No. I mean....
-Spill it, Cohen.

268
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,350
He made me promise
to keep it a secret, okay?

269
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,755
-Have you ever kept one?
-He has a girlfriend.

270
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,269
Already? He's only been back,
like, one day.

271
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,590
He met her in ltaly.
Her name's Francesca.

272
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,351
She's tall and beautiful,
and he's way into her, okay? Great.

273
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,472
I say we get burgers
and two vanilla milk shakes and fries.

274
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,399
She's tall?

275
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,839
Two hundred dollars for this watch.
Do you believe that?

276
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,718
-These stores are pricey.
-Yeah.

277
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,078
I bet you got a closet full of this stuff.
Shirts with alligators, topsiders...

278
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,071
...the whole deal.

279
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,189
We should go. You won't find
anything you need here.

280
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,954
You kidding? I got cash to spend.
I'm not going anywhere.

281
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,750
-Hey, I found you.
-Hey, Marissa.

282
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,359
-Trey.
-Hey, Trey.

283
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,198
We've met before. Marissa Cooper.

284
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,795
Oh, yeah. You're Ry's girlfriend.

285
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,831
-Well, no. Well, not anymore.
-Yeah, we're just friends.

286
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,112
Not just friends. But friends. Right?

287
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,269
Right. I heard Ryan was taking you
shopping, so I figured you needed help.

288
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,273
Why don't you try this,
and I'll grab you some more stuff.

289
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,834
-Seth said you might need some backup.
-Yeah. Thanks for coming.

290
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,952
Look at this. Yeah.
This has you written all over it.

291
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,397
Yeah, that looks really adorable
on you. Because you're so cute.

292
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,275
I thought ugly hats were your thing.
It looks really good on you, honestly.

293
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,839
Really?

294
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,194
Yes.

295
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,078
So to my utter shock...

296
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,834
...he agreed to pay in full.
Crisis averted.

297
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,639
Oh, well, I guess my dad's softening
in his old age.

298
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,071
That, or he has a porn tape
buried in his past too.

299
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,470
I'm speaking metaphorically, of course.

300
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,832
Hello? Kiki?

301
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,919
-I'm talking about erotica.
-Oh, I'm sorry. What were you saying?

302
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,876
-You like Carter.
-Excuse me?

303
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,311
You have a thing for Carter.
Kirsten Cohen crushes Carter.

304
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,636
-That's ridiculous.
-I've been so preoccupied...

305
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,831
...with my sex scandal,
I hadn't noticed.

306
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,395
-That's enough.
-Sandy's off in strange motels...

307
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,876
...with that fugitive ex-girlfriend,
so you turn up the heat at the office?

308
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,277
Julie, stop it.
I do not have feelings for--

309
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,431
-Sandy.
-Surprise.

310
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,273
Julie and I were just going over
some magazine stuff.

311
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,879
Launch fever.

312
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,634
Well, I'll let you two talk.

313
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,994
So, what's up?

314
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,717
-I invited Trey to stay for a few days.
-Okay, sounds good.

315
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,957
Sounds good? I thought you were
gonna have a five-alarm freak-out.

316
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,513
Well, I trust you.

317
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,830
I mean, you were right about Ryan,
after all.

318
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,510
I'll see you tonight.

319
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,837
Hey, now where's this famous
Carter Buckley? I'd love to meet him.

320
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,799
Oh, tonight....

321
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,279
It's-- It's not a good time.

322
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,754
He's up....

323
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,478
Up to his ears in the launch.

324
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,275
All right, well, some other time then.
I'll see you tonight.

325
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,638
Man, am I tired.

326
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,270
That's shopper's fatigue. Shop enough,
and you'll become immune. Trust me.

327
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,953
If anyone should know.

328
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,348
-Excuse me.
-That's funny.

329
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,317
Can I check your bag?

330
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,238
Why? I didn't do anything wrong.

331
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,479
-I saw you handling that watch before.
-I didn't take your damn watch.

332
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,477
We have the right to look.
Hand it over.

333
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,069
I don't see you giving
other people a hard time.

334
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,111
-He didn't take anything.
-Let him check.

335
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,793
Hey, man, I'll handle this.

336
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,031
-Get out of my face.
-Send someone to the front entrance.

337
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,071
Yeah? You know what?

338
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,391
Don't bother.
Because I paid for all of this!

339
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,355
If we hadn't gotten Trey out of the
store, he would've taken the guy out.

340
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,074
So he's got rage issues like....

341
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,357
-Like Summer, or--?
-He's just got a lot of pride, you know.

342
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,751
When something sets him off,
it's like he can't control himself.

343
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,713
Well, it's comforting
to have him staying here.

344
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,757
-Have you told my parents?
-No, I can't.

345
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,871
I know I should, but....

346
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,077
Oh, hey, Ryan.
I finally met your brother.

347
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,714
-He seems to be adjusting well.
-Y eah, smooth sailing.

348
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,752
Well, here's one.
A barista at a local coffee joint.

349
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,399
-Barista?
-That's a fancy word...

350
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,677
-...for a guy who makes coffee.
-That I can do.

351
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,070
We were just checking out
the classifieds.

352
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,958
Yeah. The job hunt begins today.

353
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,112
-Feel like coming with me?
-I'll pass, thanks.

354
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,791
Seth, why don't you come out and clear
the patio furniture with me for the party.

355
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,599
I believe, son, that's code
for "let's get out of here. "

356
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,320
If I help set up for the party,
will you let me skip it?

357
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,629
That would be a no.

358
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,192
I'm sorry about yesterday. I just didn't
like the way the guy was looking at me.

359
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,072
So you trashed the store.

360
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,356
Look, my old ways aren't
gonna work here. I need to change.

361
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,909
Do it soon.

362
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,876
-Zach.
-Hey.

363
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,156
I brought over some of your stuff.

364
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,228
-Things you left at my house.
-Post-breakup stuff exchange.

365
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,593
I won this for you
at the Kickoff Carnival. It was a gift.

366
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,638
I'll always remember how you owned
that Whack-a-Mole.

367
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,151
I don't feel like it's a good idea
to have reminders of you around.

368
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,397
I get that you've moved on,
but do you have to totally erase me?

369
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,352
What do you mean, moved on?

370
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,233
-Cohen.
-He let it slip, okay?

371
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,392
I just didn't want you to know,
in case it hurt your feelings.

372
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,749
Why would it hurt me?

373
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,911
Just because 20 minutes
after we broke up...

374
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,958
...you were scootering around ltaly
with a 6-foot-2 Euro-chick?

375
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,908
-Hey, you left me.
-I know. I know that, but....

376
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,751
The cast of The Valley are guest VJs on
Music Video Nation. I have to see that.

377
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,831
-I'll drop off your stuff soon.
-Wait!

378
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,793
Well, how do you like this?

379
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,394
Caleb Nichol showing up
in my lowly hotel room.

380
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,556
Let's get this over with.

381
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,478
Thank you.

382
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,671
The video's right here. It's all yours
if the money's in that case.

383
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,034
Five hundred thousand. As requested.
I'm assured this is the only copy?

384
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,997
This is it.

385
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,753
So...

386
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,595
...how's it feel to get a little glimpse
into your wife's past?

387
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,479
I didn't get where I am today
by being a fool.

388
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,029
I knew what I was getting
into when I married Julie.

389
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,037
You expect me to believe
she told you?

390
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,113
Because Julie keeps her past
pretty tight to the vest.

391
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,876
I have some very thorough
and talented Pls on my staff.

392
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,953
I'd venture to say there's nothing Julie's
ever done that I don't know about.

393
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,752
Allow me.

394
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,515
-What the hell is this?
-Some friends of mine...

395
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,274
-...who want to get to know you.
-You son of a bitch.

396
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,438
That's your cue to hand me
the briefcase.

397
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,558
Lance.

398
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,077
Pleasure doing business with you.
Thanks for the tape.

399
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,155
I'd like those flowers delivered by 5.
Thank you.

400
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,912
What do you think for tonight?

401
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,595
I want Donatella-Versace-meets-
Martha-Stewart-before-the-scandal.

402
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,637
Don't look now.
Boyfriend, 2 o'clock.

403
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,912
Hey. I brought you something.
Pinot Noir. Russian River Valley.

404
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,833
-Hi. The one you said you loved.
-Hey.

405
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,273
-Thank you. How thoughtful.
-I thought we'd pop the top...

406
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,351
...have a few glasses
before the madness.

407
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,073
We have a lot riding on this.

408
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,993
I think it would be unprofessional
to drink wine beforehand.

409
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,868
Are you kidding? We average a bottle
a night around here.

410
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,431
You can celebrate at the party tonight.

411
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,878
Okay. Y eah, okay. I'll....
I'll see you later.

412
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,759
Completely focused and totally sober.

413
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,035
Kirsten and Carter
Sitting in a tree

414
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,998
I' m just kidding. Unless l' m not.

415
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,800
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

416
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,112
Summer. I thought we'd seen
the last of you.

417
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,475
-ls Zach home?
-He's at water polo practice.

418
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,473
-He'll be home in a few minutes.
-Can I leave this with you?

419
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,552
He left it at my house
when we were dating.

420
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,674
So it's really over
between the two of you?

421
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,952
Mrs. Stevens, I am so sorry about
what happened at the airport.

422
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,189
You should be.

423
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,635
But at least something good
came out of it. Right?

424
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,234
-I mean, Zach met Francesca.
-Who?

425
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,109
You know, 6-foot-2 ltalian supermodel.
Zach's new girlfriend.

426
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,319
And when would this have happened?
While he was sulking over you?

427
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,074
He never left the hotel room, Summer.

428
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,518
Hey.

429
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,993
How'd the job hunt go today?

430
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,597
Not so good.

431
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,796
I tried five or six places...

432
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,033
...all turned me down on the spot.

433
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,359
That sucks.

434
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,392
You hungry? We could grab a bite.
Catch up.

435
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,388
Yeah, that'd be great.

436
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,674
Cool.

437
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,797
We should head by the pier. You'll like it.
They've got, you know, boats and stuff.

438
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,430
After you clean this place up.

439
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,989
Jeez, man. We do have closets,
you know.

440
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,878
Yeah, who's funny?

441
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,429
-This is from that store.
-I went back and bought it.

442
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,158
Don't lie to me.

443
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,833
I'm not.

444
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,036
You're never gonna change.

445
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,869
This family is taking a chance
on you, Trey.

446
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,792
You know what?

447
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,552
It makes no difference what I say.

448
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,790
You'll believe the worst,
no matter what I do.

449
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,439
-You blame me?
-I guess I don't.

450
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,716
Why don't I do us both a favor
and take off?

451
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,915
Fine!

452
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,799
Oh, and I bought it as a gift for you.

453
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,714
To thank you for helping me out. And
before you go calling the cops on me...

454
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,350
...here's the receipt.

455
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,918
Well, the party's starting soon.
Are you hiding out in here?

456
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,718
-Yeah, good guess.
-Where's Trey?

457
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,554
Oh, I see. Well...

458
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,280
-...we knew it was gonna be bumpy.
-Yeah.

459
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,115
-This is harder than I thought it'd be.
-ls there anything I can do?

460
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,836
Hey, can I borrow the car?

461
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,514
Be careful.

462
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,717
Zach. Hey.

463
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,270
I realized, I forgot to give
your sweatshirt back. I was going to--

464
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,115
-I know you talked to my mom today.
-Brief conversation. Brief.

465
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,353
And I know she told you
about Francesca. Or lack thereof.

466
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,591
-You don't need to explain.
-No, I do.

467
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,110
When I came home, I knew that
I was going to see you and Cohen.

468
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,113
And I didn't want things
to be tense between us.

469
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,990
And I figured the only way to do that
was if I was with someone too.

470
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,112
Zach, I'm sorry.

471
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,759
And you told Cohen because...

472
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,639
-...you knew it would get back to me.
-Within minutes.

473
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,832
God, that is so typical of Cohen.

474
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,231
-He knew it would make me jealous.
-Summer, remember, she's a fake.

475
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,994
Yeah, but still. Cohen could not wait
to tell me...

476
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,869
-...about your smoking new girlfriend--
-This is between you and Cohen.

477
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,277
Which has nothing to do with me...

478
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,715
...finally.

479
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,629
Look, Zach...

480
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,793
...I am so sorry that
I made a mess of everything.

481
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,909
As for Francesca,
unlike some loudmouth geeks...

482
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,431
...I can keep a secret.

483
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,479
-Hey, Ryan, where you going?
-T o get Trey. He took off.

484
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,914
Well, I'll go with you.

485
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,911
Remember the last time
you came to Chino?

486
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,355
Yeah, I saved your ass. Come on.

487
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,637
Do you realize that in a couple of days,
your face will be...

488
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,631
...on every coffee table in this town?

489
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,394
Frankly, I'm surprised
we even got it off the ground.

490
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,313
-Well, I'm not surprised at all.
-Hi, Dad.

491
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,953
I know this magazine is going to be
an enormous success.

492
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,157
-Absolutely.
-I take it everything went smoothly?

493
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,992
Everything's taken care of, Juju.

494
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,950
Hey, you made it. I was starting
to get worried. Thank you.

495
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,556
Well, I came for Newport Living.
I do live in Newport.

496
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,314
Is that what this party's for?
I didn't....

497
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,071
-What's the deal? Is it something I said?
-Something you weren't supposed to say.

498
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,035
Right. I guess I did something wrong...

499
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,239
-...so I should probably just apologize.
-Well, yeah, if you mean it.

500
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,197
That's hard if I don't know what it is.

501
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,635
It's hard to forgive you
if you don't mean it...

502
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,109
...because you don't know
why you're apologizing.

503
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,159
I'll wait in your room for 20 minutes. If
you can't figure it out by then, I'm gone.

504
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,759
-Hello, everybody. Julie, congratulations.
-Thank you.

505
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,634
-May I speak with you for a moment?
-Sure.

506
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,997
-What is it?
-Have I said something to you?

507
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,673
Have I done something wrong?

508
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,037
Because all day,
you have seemed angry at me.

509
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,958
Look, whatever it is,
I hope you can talk to me about it.

510
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,631
We are liable to be working together
for a long time. So I don't want to--

511
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,271
On second thought,
let's just focus on the presentation.

512
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,835
I hope it goes without a hitch.

513
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,517
-Excuse me. Is that chardonnay?
-Yes, ma'am, it is.

514
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,238
Thank you.

515
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,955
We used to hang out
at this place all the time.

516
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,957
There he is.

517
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,793
Yeah. I'll be back in a second.

518
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,110
What the hell are you doing here, man?

519
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,915
-I came to find you.
-I'm not looking to be found.

520
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,753
-Trey, listen--
-Beat it, little brother.

521
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,315
-I just want to talk to you, all right?
-Why? You're in your pool house and....

522
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,198
-And I'm here.
-I'm sorry, all right.

523
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,069
Why are we kidding ourselves here, Ry?
You knew it couldn't work.

524
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,196
We are who we are.

525
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,595
I'm not going back
to Newport without you.

526
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,273
Fine.

527
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,994
Stay here. See how well you fit in
after being away two years.

528
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,111
I'm gonna go out and get some air.

529
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,079
Okay, I thought about it.
I thought about why you're angry.

530
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,196
-And?
-I have nothing.

531
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,920
I do not know what I did wrong.

532
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,277
But listen, I am totally willing
to apologize. Extremely sincerely.

533
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,193
Why did you tell me about Francesca?

534
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,793
Because you begged me to.

535
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,554
That is not why. I have begged you
to do plenty of stuff.

536
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,598
Like give up comics, stop mumbling.
You don't do any of that.

537
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,435
Are you actually angry with me for being
jealous of you being jealous of Zach?

538
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,158
No.

539
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,914
-You were jealous?
-Gee, why would that be, Summer?

540
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,395
Hearing you go on and on
about Zach's new woman.

541
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,869
-Because you told me about her.
-Yeah, I did.

542
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,153
I saw the high road there, and I did
not take it. You wanna know why?

543
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,553
I was a little bit worried.

544
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,429
Here we had this big, great kiss in
the rain upside down, and I don't know.

545
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,797
I thought maybe, what if after that
everything was a letdown for you.

546
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,952
You had buyer's remorse or something.

547
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,718
Cohen...

548
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,917
-...you are so neurotic.
-Exactly.

549
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,550
Unlike Zach, who's anxiety-free,
with his big smile...

550
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,790
...and natural athleticism.

551
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,754
-That guy makes me feel very Jewish.
-I know Zach looks great on paper.

552
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,117
Son of a congressman,
sweet, selfless....

553
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,750
-Hey, and even, well, boring.
-Yeah, he's a touch bland.

554
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,790
And you, with all your little flaws
and your little quirks...

555
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,315
...somehow you keep
drawing me back in.

556
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,348
Yeah? So, what you're saying
to me is then...

557
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,398
...that the more neurotic
and insecure I am...

558
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,551
...the more you're attracted to me.

559
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,393
Well, then. Do I look fat in these pants?

560
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,470
Hello, everyone. I'm Carter Buckley,
managing editor.

561
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,837
And on behalf of everyone
at Newport Living...

562
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,878
... I'd like to thank you all
for coming tonight.

563
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,190
Now I would like to introduce the woman
who has made all of this possible.

564
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,316
Julie Cooper-Nichol.

565
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,599
Thank you, Carter.
I can't believe this night is finally here.

566
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,633
Well, what is Newport Living?

567
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,598
-Wow, so that's Carter Buckley.
-You haven't met him yet?

568
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,036
No. He's been more of a phantom
presence. I thought he'd look...

569
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,555
-...more like Jerry Garcia.
-Who?

570
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,150
But if you really want to know
what Newport Living is all about...

571
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,550
...take a look at this.

572
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,554
If I've never had sex before...

573
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,790
... why do I feel so horny?

574
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,910
- You 're turning me on.
-Dear God.

575
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,798
-Oh, my God.
-Give me the remote.

576
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,991
Come over here, pizza boy.

577
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,828
Give me that.

578
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,758
-You son of a bitch.
-Sorry about that, everyone.

579
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,273
T echnical difficulties.

580
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,758
Please, everyone help themselves
to a drink or two.

581
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,354
Lord knows, I'm going to.

582
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,356
Don't worry, Juju.

583
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,590
It'll all blow over.

584
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,116
I don't understand. I mean,
you gave him his damn money.

585
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,829
It just goes to show,
it doesn't pay to give in to these people.

586
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,117
You meet their every demand,
and they ruin you anyway.

587
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,589
Well, ruin's the wrong word.

588
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,150
You can go on with your life, Cal,
but I am never leaving this room.

589
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,073
My Howard Hughes phase starts now.

590
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,157
We could go to Europe.

591
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,791
Paris, Vienna, anywhere you like.
By the time we get back...

592
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,714
...something else will have exploded
to make this whole thing look silly.

593
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,833
I guess you can always count on
this town for a new scandal.

594
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,758
Paris?

595
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,633
Carter. Sandy Cohen.
You throw a hell of a party.

596
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,109
-It's great to finally meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

597
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,032
I'm sorry I haven't introduced
you two.

598
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,192
Oh, no problem. You sound like
you have a wonderful family.

599
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,034
I do. Including my mother-in-law,
the porn star.

600
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,839
If it makes you feel better,
I think it livened things up.

601
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,911
Here's hoping everyone
was drunk enough...

602
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,435
...they black out and
don't remember anything tomorrow.

603
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,556
Here's hoping.
Can I get you two anything?

604
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,637
-Thanks. I'm good.
-No, thanks, I'm fine.

605
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,074
All right.

606
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,439
Listen. About before...

607
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,149
-...I have to apologize.
-You do?

608
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,437
Yeah, you know, we have been working
together for a few weeks now...

609
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,670
...and I just want you to know...

610
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,799
...that if there has been a tension
between us....

611
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,712
I don't know
what you're talking about.

612
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,156
If there's been a vibe between us...

613
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,791
...it's me, okay. And I'm sorry.

614
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,713
-Carter--
-Let's just leave it at that, all right?

615
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,713
Ryan, I don't think he's coming back.

616
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,550
All right. Let's go.

617
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,157
We should go find him.

618
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,156
Hey, feel like playing some pool?

619
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,390
-No, thanks.
-Then let me buy you a drink.

620
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,594
-I don't think she wants anything.
-Was I talking to you?

621
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,954
We should get out of here.

622
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,190
I want to buy you a drink.
Why you being rude?

623
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,277
-I don't want anything.
-Leave her alone.

624
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,829
Listen, rich boy.
I ain't buying the act, all right?

625
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,230
-Let's get out of here.
-Hey, hey! Let go of her.

626
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,711
Come on, you want some more?

627
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,798
Stop it, please!

628
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,075
Can I help you? Let's dance!

629
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,674
-Tell them to let go of my brother.
-Take it easy.

630
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,398
Let him go.

631
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,275
-Wild kid!
-I haven't done that in a while.

632
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,989
-You looked good.
-Thanks for coming back for us.

633
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,910
Yeah, well, I was gonna say
the same thing to you guys.

634
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,399
You want a ride?

635
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,392
-Yeah, sure.
-Well, where are we dropping you?

636
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,471
Just come home with us, man.

637
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,793
-Thought you didn't want me over there.
-Yeah, well, people change.

638
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,159
All right.

639
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,834
-But I get to drive.
-Oh, no, no.

640
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,954
I've seen you drive. Back seat.

641
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,119
I'll drive.

642
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,118
-Hey.
-Hey.

643
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,396
You guys were gone a while.
Everything okay?

644
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,318
-Fine.
-Yeah, nothing to report.

645
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,391
-How was the party?
-Good.

646
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,709
Uneventful.

647
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,352
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

648
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,200
-Great party, okay?
-Well...

649
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,033
...if you're hungry, we got leftovers.

650
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,156
Look, Dad, we're all having
a family dinner.

651
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,551
Well, how about that? Look at that.
Now, this is not so painful.

652
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,354
-Gotta tell you, it seems pretty great.
-Y eah...

653
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,750
...wait till the novelty wears off,
right, Ryan?

654
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,956
You know what? It still works for me.

655
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,509
