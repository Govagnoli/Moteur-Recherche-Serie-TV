1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,800
I'm pregnant.

2
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:01,301
What ?

3
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,700
Previously on The O.C.:

4
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,900
Sandy, we're having a baby.

5
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,900
I just want you to find something
that you really care about.

6
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,300
I could be a critic.
You mean spending your whole life watching movies

7
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,300
and telling people
how terrible they are ?

8
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,600
You want to go rent
An Inconvenient Truth ?

9
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,800
So what'd you tell Frank ?

10
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,800
I told him right now
I need to be spending

11
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,200
some time with my daughter.

12
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,500
Well, let's put it all on the table.

13
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,300
I love you

14
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,300
and I don't want to lose you.

15
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,700
Mom !
It's okay, it's just...

16
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,800
It's an earthquake !
Get in there !

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,600
Mom !

18
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,600
Kirsten ?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Ryan.

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,600
Oh, my God. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's all right.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,100
Uh, okay, I'm going
to count to three

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,000
and you're going to get
out of here, okay ?

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
No, no, no, you're going
to hurt yourself.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't have a choice.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All right, one, two, three.
Okay, okay.

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,800
Go. Go, go, go, go.

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,700
Ryan ?

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,900
Ryan ? Are you okay ?

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,400
Yeah. Yeah.

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,200
You ?

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,900
Yeah.

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,900
I'm fine, thanks to you.

33
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,900
Hey, Ryan ?
Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,300
I'm sorry I was all,"Oh, my God, Oh, my God."

35
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,700
'Cause usually I'm very
good in a crisis.

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,800
But I just started
thinking about

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,100
if anything happened to you

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,900
and I don't know
what I would do.

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,700
It's okay, we're both okay.

40
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,300
It's just that grace under fire
is a very important quality

41
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,700
and I don't want you to think
that I'm lacking in it,

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,100
because we might encounter
all sorts of crisis

43
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,000
when we're away
together, like, at college.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,100
Oh, my God, is that blood ?

45
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,600
I faint at the
sight of blood.

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,400
Oh, no, no,
no, it's just glitter.

47
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,500
Taylor.
I'm okay.

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,400
All that stuff we put on
the table just now,

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,700
let's, uh, let's talk

50
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,300
about it later, okay ?

51
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Right, yeah.
That's probably a good idea,

52
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,600
when, you know,
the power's back on

53
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,200
and we're not sitting in rubble.

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,700
Um, I'm going to call
Kirsten and Sandy.

55
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,600
Where's my jacket ?

56
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, gross.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,400
Sorry.

58
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,100
You know, I've
actually stockpiled

59
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,000
some rudimentary
supplies in case of,

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
you know, the Apocalypse

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,800
or whatever.

62
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
I got all sorts of
stuff in there.

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,100
Got extra tennis shoes

64
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,500
and flashlights and canned goods and...

65
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,500
A space heater...

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm not...

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,900
Hey... getting good
reception here.

68
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,300
I'm going to step
out in the hall.

69
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Okay...

70
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,800
Yes, Orange County, as you
probably figured out,

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,300
that was an earthquake.

72
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,000
So far, no reports
of fatalities,

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,300
but power is out,
cell lines are jammed

74
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,900
and the roads are for
emergency vehicles only.

75
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,300
As more information comes in
we'll relay it to you.

76
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,200
So if you're safe,

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
stay calm and stay put.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So we got our marching orders
and our staying put orders.

79
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,800
So no one's to leave the plaza
unless they have to.

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,900
What are we going
to do with everyone ?

81
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,600
People are scared.

82
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,300
They'll get hungry.

83
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,600
And what about looters ?

84
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,100
We just have to get organized.

85
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,400
Also, keep the radio on

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,100
and gather up anything
you think might be useful...

87
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,300
flashlights, blankets, water,

88
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,800
batteries, you'll be fine.

89
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,200
I can't get through
to either of the boys.

90
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,400
Well, keep trying.
How about you ?

91
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,900
We should get you
to the hospital.

92
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,500
I'm fine, it's just
a bump on the head.

93
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,100
Mine. Not his or hers.

94
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,800
Hello.

95
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,100
Ryan, where are you ?

96
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,500
They're at the Cooper
house with Taylor.

97
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,600
Tell him to stay there.

98
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,900
Okay. Just stay there, okay.

99
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
All right.

100
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,800
Seth ?

101
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,400
Hey, Dad.

102
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,900
Yeah, yeah, we're okay.

103
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,400
I wish I could say the same
for Ryan's car though.

104
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,800
How's Mom ?

105
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,000
Mm-hmm.
And Ryan ?

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ryan and Taylor are
at your house.

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,800
Yeah, sounds good,

108
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,400
we'll do that.

109
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,200
All right, take care.

110
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,500
Found a flashlight.
I can see that.

111
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,900
Which is good,
'cause we can use it.

112
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
We're going to have to get

113
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,000
My dad thinks we should
get off the streets.

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,700
Why ? Did he hear something ?

115
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,400
About aftershocks
or looters or...

116
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,600
Zombies ? I know, that was
my first thought, too.

117
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,700
But no, it's just
a precaution.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,600
It's Ryan.
Is everyone okay ?

119
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,900
Yeah, we just have to make
a little change of plans.

120
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Hmm ?

121
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,800
* California, here we come *

122
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,200
* Right back where
we started from *

123
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,700
* California...
California... *

124
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
Your dad said to go home.

125
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,800
But I think we should
all be together.

126
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,300
This is a bad idea.

127
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,400
We're almost there.

128
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,300
No, we're not.

129
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
It's just a few
more minutes.

130
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,100
Well, I know where my
house is okay ?

131
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,100
Look, I command you
to stop this bike.

132
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,800
I'm sorry, okay but I'm starting
to get a little creeped out.

133
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,300
Not that I don't want to play
Pictionary by candlelight

134
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
and raid Taylor's
Apocalypse kit,

135
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,300
but I think we should
just go to your house.

136
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,700
Okay, but I'm still awaiting
on news of Pancakes.

137
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,300
Pancakes ?

138
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,700
You said Ryan said
everyone was fine.

139
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,900
I know, but I don't know
that he included rodents

140
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,800
in his head count,

141
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,200
so I texted him
to be sure. And ?

142
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,200
And I'm still waiting
on the reply.

143
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,400
Maybe I should pedal.
You look a little tired.

144
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,400
Fine.

145
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Go !

146
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,100
Frank, hi, it's Julie.

147
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
I hope you're okay.

148
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,400
Caitlin and I are fine,
I mean, we're trapped

149
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,200
at the ice cream store
on the pier, but we're fine.

150
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,800
I guess help is
probably on the way.

151
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,900
Okay, well...

152
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,800
take care, bye.

153
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,000
Look, I understand why you keep
on calling Summer

154
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,100
and the Cohens,
but why Frank ?

155
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,100
I mean, weren't you guys

156
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,000
supposed to take it
down a notch ?

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,300
Caitlin, just because we're
pulling things back a little bit

158
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
doesn't mean that we've stopped
caring about each other.

159
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,700
I'm sure wherever Frank is,
he's worried about us,

160
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,700
just like I am about him.

161
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,700
And I am about myself, because
we're stuck here with him.

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,900
The back door is stuck, too.

163
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,500
Looks like there's
no way out.

164
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,600
We're trapped.

165
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,500
Figures.

166
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,400
We can't just sit here
waiting to be rescued.

167
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,800
Totally.
No, we should start eating

168
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,600
all the melting ice cream.

169
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,700
I want a gold medal ribbon
on a...

170
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,300
Sugar cone, I know.

171
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,100
Creepy, but convenient.

172
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay, ice-cream guy,
start scooping.

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,400
It's Gary, my name.

174
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,900
Okay.

175
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,100
I'm thinking the roof,
or where the roof

176
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,000
used to be.

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,400
Ice-cream guy, got a ladder ?

178
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,000
You can't climb up there.

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,100
I'm not going to,

180
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,100
you are.

181
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,000
And this is my personal
safety device.

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,500
It's a flashlight, it's a radio,

183
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,600
it's a cell phone charger,

184
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,900
it's a siren and
it's a compass.

185
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,200
Hmm. North is that way.

186
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Handy.

187
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,500
Also got canned goods,
batteries, water,

188
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,000
ooh, a gas mask and-- that's
right... North Korean currency,

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,200
because you just
never know.

190
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,300
Hey, why are you
wearing a jacket ? Are you cold ?

191
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,700
Let me get my
space blanket.

192
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,600
It preserves up
to 80% body heat.

193
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,400
A bit of bad news just in.

194
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,700
Our first fatality.

195
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,900
Not a lot of information,

196
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,900
a pedestrian hit
by a downed power li...

197
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,700
No reason to think
its anyone we know.

198
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,700
Yeah, of course not.

199
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,400
Still, aren't families

200
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,700
supposed to reach out to each other

201
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,800
in times of uncertainty ?

202
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,900
I know the phones are messed up,

203
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,300
but you were able to get
through to Sandy

204
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,300
and he was able to get
through to Seth.

205
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,400
Uh, right, you're worried
about your mom.

206
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,700
Yeah.

207
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,700
She gave birth to me.

208
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,900
If I'm worried she may be hurt,

209
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,300
then shouldn't
she be worried about me ?

210
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,700
I think we need to go over
there and check on her.

211
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,800
To her house ?

212
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,300
Yes, Ryan.

213
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,200
I know my mom is a total bitch,
but she's still my mom,

214
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,400
and she doesn't drink
a lot of milk

215
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,900
so her bones are probably
very brittle

216
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,900
and she's always been kind
of scared of the dark...

217
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,100
Taylor, Taylor,
we can't go over there.

218
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Seth and Summer are
coming over here.

219
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,000
What ? Since when ?

220
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,600
Since Seth texted me.

221
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,800
He said that they were.

222
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,100
I thought Sandy said
it was safest for us

223
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,300
to stay where we are.

224
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,500
No, no, no, Sandy said

225
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,500
that it's safer for all of us
to be together.

226
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,300
All right, folks,
we got to remain calm

227
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,500
and we got to remain here.

228
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Anyone in need of medical attention,

229
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
please identify yourself
to this gentleman,

230
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,800
and everyone who is willing to
help anyone who might need it,

231
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,900
please come over and introduce
yourself to me.

232
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,000
The good news is, we got
everything we need here.

233
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,100
We got shelter, we got food,
we got water.

234
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,200
We got fine literature,
chips and salsa,

235
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,000
so if we all stay together, we
can get through this no problem.

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
All right ?

237
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,300
This is like Berkeley 1989.

238
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,700
Oh, you say that so warmly.

239
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
Not that I'm fond of natural disasters,

240
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,500
but there is nothing sexier

241
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,900
than your husband calming
an angry mob.

242
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
Now, are you okay ?

243
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,300
Yeah, I know I've been complaining

244
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,400
about Newport a lot lately,

245
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,800
but it just breaks my heart
to see it like this.

246
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
I'm going to pass these out.
All right.

247
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,100
Hello ?

248
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,600
Oh, hey, Sandy, I'm glad
I finally got a hold of you.

249
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,400
Are you with Ryan ?

250
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,700
Oh, no, Frank, but he's at
the Cooper house with Taylor.

251
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,500
He's fine, we're all fine.

252
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
That's great news.
And Julie and Caitlin,

253
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,400
they're at the house too, right ?

254
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,300
That I don't know.

255
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,600
Do you have any idea
where they might be ?

256
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,400
I'm sorry, I don't,
but I'm sure they're

257
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,300
going to try to get
in touch with you,

258
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,800
and if I hear anything at all,
I'll call you.

259
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I... yeah, yeah, thanks, Sandy.

260
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,200
Great.

261
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,800
Okay, Gary, how's it look up there ?

262
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,400
Can you climb down and get some help ?

263
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Um... not really.

264
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,000
Why not ?

265
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,800
What's going on ?

266
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,500
We're on an island, all alone.

267
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,300
Look, we appreciate the imagery
and all that,

268
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,500
but this is no time
for existential metaphors.

269
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,100
No. Really.

270
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,100
The pier's been washed out.

271
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,000
Summer, you're okay !

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,800
I am so glad to see you.

273
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,500
Hey, where's Ryan ?

274
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,200
He's...

275
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,900
Hey.

276
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,400
Hey, Atwood.
I got to look for Pancakes.

277
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,100
Oh, my God ! Pancakes !
I'm gonna go with you.

278
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,800
Great. While you guys do that,
Ryan and I will, uh...

279
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,400
Go.
Yeah, we're gonna go.

280
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,200
Where are you gonna go ?
Yeah, we just got here.

281
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,100
Well, we need supplies.
I have supplies.

282
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,200
No, I know, but, uh, who knows
how long those will last.

283
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,900
Yeah, and there'll
probably be a run,

284
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,400
especially when
the zombies come out.

285
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,500
Seth.
Ryan.

286
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,800
Look, guys, we'll be fine.

287
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,800
Just stay here, lock the doors
and don't open them.

288
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,300
Summer,

289
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,700
Pancakes needs you right now.

290
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,100
Be careful.

291
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,500
'Kay, come back soon.

292
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Okay.

293
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,600
What's up ?

294
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,100
Don't you think the boys

295
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,900
were acting weird ?

296
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,600
The shifty looks,

297
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,400
finishing each other's sentences

298
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,000
like they're composing
a lie on the spot ? Yes.

299
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,300
Totally normal for them.

300
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,100
I don't know, I feel like
they're hiding something.

301
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,900
If it's not the location

302
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,600
of Pancakes, I'm not interested.

303
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Oh, no.

304
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,600
He was in his cage.

305
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,700
He's gone !

306
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,500
Oh, no.

307
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,100
Pancakes ?

308
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,500
Pancakes ?

309
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,100
Okay, I didn't want
to worry Taylor.

310
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,600
She's pretty upset, and she's
got this thing about blood.

311
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,900
Blood ?
Yeah. Don't freak, okay ?

312
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,400
I-I-I need you to not freak.

313
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Okay. Why would I freak out ?

314
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,900
It's not that bad, is it ?

315
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Dude, it's bad.

316
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,400
Seth, the hospital is,
like, a mile away.

317
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,500
I know, which is why I'm taking

318
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,000
the secret back roads way
that's only a half mile.

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,300
That was sarcasm.

320
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,300
I'm pretty sure my
shortcut got us lost.

321
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,100
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

322
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,400
That was sarcasm, too. Sorry.

323
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,300
No, hey, so you're
a little on edge.

324
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,800
A giant glass spear in the back

325
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,600
will do that to a guy.
It's not a spear.

326
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,500
What is it, more of
a spike or a skewer ?

327
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,800
Dude, you're doing
a terrible job

328
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
of trying to keep
my mind off the pain.

329
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,100
You're supposed to talk about
something else, not the thing

330
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,000
causing the pain.
True, but the real question is,

331
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,800
what are you doing to keep
my mind off of your pain ?

332
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,500
'Cause right now
you're not looking too good

333
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,500
and I'm starting to feel...

334
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,900
What was that ?

335
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,100
Uh, seems like we hit something.

336
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,400
Oh, God, not a body.

337
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,900
All right, well,
pull over or something.

338
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,200
All right, go out and check,

339
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,200
I guess. With the zombies ?

340
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,400
* I used her *

341
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,300
* She used me,
but nobody cared *

342
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,600
* We were getting our share *

343
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,200
* Working on the night moves *

344
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,500
* Uh, uh, uh *

345
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,100
* Trying to lose those *

346
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,500
* Awkward teenage blues *

347
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,900
* Working on our night moves *

348
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,400
* Mm, mm, mm *

349
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,300
* In the summertime *

350
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,400
* Mm, mm. *

351
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,900
You guys are amazing.

352
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,100
Uh, no. We're not. No.

353
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,300
It's just something we do.

354
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,400
I used to sing that

355
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,300
to Kaitlin when she
was little and scared.

356
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,700
Isn't that, uh,
kind of inappropriate ?

357
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,000
I mean, given the sexual
content of the lyrics.

358
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Well, it was the only song
she knew all the words to.

359
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
That and "Pour Some Sugar on Me."

360
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,500
Ah. Well, this is really fun.

361
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,600
Staying up late, eating sweets,
singing songs.

362
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,400
It's like summer camp.

363
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,300
Coed summer camp with
really hot camp counselors.

364
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,700
No offense, Gary, but this
is barely entertaining me.

365
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,400
Yeah, Gary,
young guy in Newport, cool job...

366
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,800
you must have a lot of fun.

367
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,100
Not really.

368
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,100
No friends ?
No girls ?

369
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,000
Well... there is one girl.

370
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, well, you only need one,
as long as it's a good one.

371
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,200
She's an amazing one.

372
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,500
Well, are you guys serious ?

373
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,800
Pretty serious.

374
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,300
You know, thinking about
taking it to the next level.

375
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,200
Oh, the next level.

376
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
That's very serious.
Yeah, you haven't

377
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
asked her out yet, have you ?

378
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,400
Not yet, no.

379
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,900
Well, what's the holdup ?

380
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,800
I mean, if she's
as hot as she sounds.

381
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,200
It's not her. It's me.

382
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,600
She's a great girl.

383
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,200
And I'm...

384
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,200
the ice cream guy.

385
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,800
Oh, what the hell...
we have nothing better to do.

386
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,700
Yep, today is your lucky day.

387
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,800
Awesome !

388
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,600
I mean, wait, what do you mean ?

389
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,400
Well, first, we have to get rid
of that dorky bow tie.

390
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah, and an apron
is friend to no man.

391
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,500
Surely we can do something
with this hair.

392
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,700
I think
I have some

393
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,900
nail scissors in my purse, hmm ?

394
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
I can't get anyone on the phone.

395
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,500
Eh, that's okay, I'll, uh,
I'll walk you through it.

396
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,000
Just open up the back door.

397
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,100
It's easy, don't worry about it.

398
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,300
Ryan, you're asking me
to use tools and exert myself physically.

399
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,700
I think we both know where this is going.
Yeah, okay, well,

400
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,600
uh, start by putting
the jack under the frame

401
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,200
by the, uh, by the
door there. Yeah.

402
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,800
The jack is this thing
with the handle, right ?

403
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,700
Yeah.

404
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,000
Actually, wait. First, um...

405
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,800
loosen the bolts
with that wrench.

406
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,500
All right.

407
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
There we go.

408
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Okay.

409
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,800
All right, you may find this
hard to believe, Ryan,

410
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,400
but when I was younger,
I used to be a bit of a worrier.

411
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,400
You don't say.
To distract myself from worrying,

412
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,900
I would sometimes make lists.

413
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,000
Didn't matter
what the lists were.

414
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,900
They could be anything...
every cereal

415
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,900
I've ever eaten, or...

416
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,400
uh, the names of every planet
mentioned in Star Wars.

417
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Whatever.Anyways...

418
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,600
You want to make a list, Seth ?

419
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
Huh ? Oh, yeah, whatever.
I mean, sure, if you want to.

420
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,700
We could start with everyone
you've ever punched

421
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,200
in the face
since moving to Newport.

422
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,300
First would be...

423
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Luke at Holly's beach house.

424
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,100
Yeah, and number two
would be Luke. Right.

425
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,800
At the diner.
Yeah, and again at the mall.

426
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,200
What about Holly's dad at Cotillion ?

427
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,300
That was more of a tackle.
Which takes us back to Luke.

428
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Yeah, in T.J.

429
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Summer, do you really think
Pancakes is in the attic ?

430
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,500
Like he pulled down the ladder,
hopped up and-and then

431
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,300
put it away ? Hmm.

432
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,300
Well, we have checked
everywhere else.

433
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,000
Light.

434
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,900
Be careful.

435
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh... gross.

436
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,100
It's okay.

437
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,400
What is that ?

438
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,500
That's Uncle Alistair.

439
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,200
That's your uncle ?
Yeah. No.

440
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
It's, uh, my dad's skeleton
from med school.

441
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
He called him Uncle Alistair.
I don't know why.

442
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,800
God, well, I don't want to meet
any of your other relatives,

443
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,300
so let's just find Pancakes and go.
Okay.

444
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Pancakes.
Pancakes.

445
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,600
Don't be afraid.
It's just me.

446
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,400
Summer, you're such a good mother.
Thanks.

447
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
When I think of the lengths
that you're going to

448
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,300
to save your adopted rabbit son,
and my own mother

449
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
can't even pick up the phone
and send me

450
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,900
a text message saying,
"Hi. Are you alive ?"

451
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,500
That's okay... you have us now.

452
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,400
Seth and I rode on a bicycle

453
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,500
just so we could
be here together,

454
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,800
and Julie and Kaitlin
left a message

455
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,300
and the Cohens asked about you.

456
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,500
Yeah, I know... you're right.
You know, if there's one thing

457
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,300
I've learned over the years,
it's you make your own family.

458
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,500
It seems to me that
you've scraped together

459
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,200
quite an awesome one.

460
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,900
Wait.
What ?

461
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,200
You hear that ?
Where ?

462
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,600
In the vent.
It's Pancakes.

463
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Pancakes ? Pancakes ? Here.
Pancakes ? Pancakes ?

464
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Um, stay there, Pancakes.

465
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Let's pry this open.
Okay.

466
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,500
Pancakes ?
There he is !

467
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Come on ! Good boy !

468
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,900
Hey.

469
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,900
Come on.

470
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,800
It's an aftershock...
it'll stop in a second.

471
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,300
Pancakes !

472
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
Oh, my God.

473
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Kirsten ?

474
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,000
Kirsten ?

475
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Over here, Mr. Cohen.

476
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Sandy.

477
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Something is not right.

478
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,100
Nothing works.

479
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,800
It's like an
information blackout.

480
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,700
Well, the aftershock probably

481
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
took out a power line
or something.

482
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
So listen, I'm going

483
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,800
to go on foot and get help, I think.
No, no, no.

484
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,700
Well, we can't stay here.
I don't even know where here is.

485
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,900
Well, I'm going with you.

486
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,400
No, it's cool.

487
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,800
Listen, I'm going to come
back as soon as I can. Promise.

488
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,800
What about the zombies ?

489
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,500
That's a really
good point. Okay.

490
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,000
All right, buddy. We have to
keep you alert and on your feet.

491
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,600
Now, when last
we checked the list...

492
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,700
Need some help ?

493
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,600
Yeah.

494
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,800
...we were on Trey. Mm-hmm.

495
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,700
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,
but I believe we went from Trey

496
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,700
to a lengthy Volchok period.

497
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,500
Hey, thanks for this.

498
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,200
Yeah. Now, unless
you hit that Chili guy...

499
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,700
or Johnny... I know a lot of
people were rooting for that.

500
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,400
Well, I did punch Johnny's dad.

501
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,100
Or a bounty hunter
who worked for him.

502
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,200
Johnny's dad
was a bounty hunter ?

503
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Oh, yeah. I never
told you that ?

504
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,200
Excuse me, Doctor.

505
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,700
My wife needs to see
someone right away.

506
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
What happened ?
I fell down some stairs.

507
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,600
You break anything ?

508
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,200
I don't think so, but...

509
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,300
She needs help.

510
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,200
Everyone here
needs help, sir.

511
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,000
You can fill out this form

512
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,500
and wait your turn.
She's pregnant.

513
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,400
Any bleeding ?

514
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,300
No, but something isn't...
isn't right.

515
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,300
I'm sorry. Try to make
yourself comfortable.

516
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,400
Hang on a second.
Sandy...

517
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,300
Hang on one second, all right ?

518
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,300
I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Doctor.

519
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,300
My wife would never complain.

520
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
She would never put her needs
in front of anybody else's.

521
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,000
But I am not that proud.
I am not that selfless.

522
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,600
I am begging you,
please, please,

523
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,500
to give her
and our baby priority.

524
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,000
I'd like to help, really, but...

525
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,200
You can have my spot.

526
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,100
Richard White.

527
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,100
That's me. Go.

528
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Thank you.

529
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,200
Honey.

530
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,800
Oh, great. We're out of candles,
and now the ice cream is melted.

531
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,900
Honey, please. Stop worrying.

532
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Stop worrying ? We're about
to be washed out to sea.

533
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,300
I'm sorry. You're right.

534
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,800
I'm... I'm right ?

535
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,500
I thought I was exaggerating.

536
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,700
I'm going up there.

537
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,400
To do what ?

538
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,300
To go swim out to shore ?
I don't know.

539
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,900
Assess the situation...
figure it out.

540
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,300
I'm your mother. It's my job.

541
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Wait.

542
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
You can't do that. Why not ?

543
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,400
Because... I'm having
an asthma attack...

544
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,300
from the stress !

545
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,500
Oh, my... Oh, my God.
Do you have an inhaler ?

546
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,400
Or like an Epi pen ?
I could stab you.

547
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,800
Maybe... we could just...
sing "Night Moves" ?

548
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,100
I think it might calm me.

549
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,900
Really ? Please.

550
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,700
Uh.. uh... uh...

551
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,500
* Little too tall,
could have used a few pounds *

552
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,500
* She was a black-haired beauty
with big dark eyes *

553
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,300
That's good.
That's good. That's good.

554
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
* Working on the
night moves *

555
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,400
Okay, I think he needs,
like, CPR or something.

556
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
I learned this when
I was in Junior Lifeguard.

557
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,300
* Trying to lose
them awkward teenage blues *

558
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,300
Oh ! Gross !

559
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,000
He tried to kiss me !

560
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,500
I'm sorry.

561
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Young man, what is going on ?

562
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,600
Oh, my.

563
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,500
The girl you like ?

564
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

565
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
Pancakes !

566
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
I think I hear something
this way.

567
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,300
Summer, how come we keep looking

568
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,500
for Pancakes when there's

569
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,700
a giant elephant in the room ?

570
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,900
We walk around the elephant.

571
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,600
It may be big,
but we are crafty.

572
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,300
The boys should have been back
over an hour ago.

573
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,000
Aren't you worried ?
No, I'm not worried.

574
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,100
I'm freaking terrified, okay ?

575
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,300
That's why I'm focusing
on just finding Pancakes

576
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,500
and not about the fact that
my boyfriend could be laying

577
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,700
on the side of the road
ravaged by zombies.

578
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,000
Okay, well, let's go look for them.

579
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,600
In what ? They took the only car.

580
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Have you thought of that ?

581
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,000
Well, let's listen to the radio
and see if there's any news.

582
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,800
The radio stopped working
with the aftershock.

583
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,800
What was that ?

584
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Pancakes ?

585
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,900
Maybe it was Ryan and Seth.

586
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,200
Why would they need
to break a window ?

587
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
I don't know. What do we do ?

588
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,100
Quick, hide !

589
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,900
Shh ! No, no, no.

590
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,100
Summer, wait. I've got a better
idea. Summer, come here.

591
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,500
Shh !

592
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,200
You received a makeover
under false pretenses.

593
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,900
You lied about
having asthma.

594
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,400
Do you even like Bob Seger ?

595
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,700
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did it.

596
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,600
I mean, I do know,
but I'm embarrassed.

597
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,200
Kaitlin, you come
in here all the time,

598
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,200
and you look right through me
like I don't even exist.

599
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,800
I'm sorry.
Don't be.

600
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,200
I mean,
why would a girl like you

601
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,400
pay any attention
to a guy like me ?

602
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,200
I know the only
reason you'd ever

603
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,000
get to know me is if
you had no choice.

604
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Tonight, that happened,
and it felt like fate.

605
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,700
I didn't want it to end.

606
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,700
I guess, I mean,
that's understandable.

607
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,600
But what do you mean,
you didn't want it to end ?

608
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,300
What the... ?

609
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Mom...
It's okay.

610
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,000
Frank !

611
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,100
Just got your message.

612
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,000
I was so worried.
Oh, me, too !

613
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Go for it.
There was a flipping earthquake.

614
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,900
But wait. How did you get here ?
What about the pier ?

615
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,900
What about it ?
The pier is fine.

616
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,600
There's a heartbeat.

617
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,200
Thank God.

618
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,600
The baby is under stress

619
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,600
and, after a fall,
there can be a rupture.

620
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,400
Separation.

621
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Can you treat that ?

622
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,900
We still have
some more tests to run.

623
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,400
Okay, I've always wondered this.

624
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,400
In your opinion, who is a better
food industry server ?

625
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,500
Chloe, the magical waitress Chloe

626
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,100
from Albuquerque,

627
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,100
or Donny, the angry
busboy who shot Luke ?

628
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,300
I'll go with Chloe
on that one.

629
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Good. That's what I figured.
That's what I figured.

630
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,400
Okay. Okay. Desert island.

631
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,800
Sadie, the tough as nails
yet soulful jewelry maker

632
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
or Lindsay, my grandfather's

633
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,700
illegitimate, bookish love child ?

634
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,500
I can't, Seth.

635
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,900
Sure... sure you can.
It's very easy.

636
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,000
Go on. Just go.

637
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,300
I'm not going to go alone.

638
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,700
We need help, man. I need help.

639
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,200
Just sit me down, okay ?

640
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,200
All right.

641
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,700
Okay, but I'm going
to come right back.

642
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,700
I know.

643
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
Do you hear that ?

644
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,500
No.

645
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,300
Exactly.

646
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,900
It's quiet now.
Maybe they moved on.

647
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,900
Or... maybe they're
just faking us out.

648
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,300
There we go. Locked and loaded.
Just how mama likes it.

649
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,900
Taylor, a gun ? Where did you
get that ? Are you crazy ?

650
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,100
It's Jimmy Cooper's flare gun.

651
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,300
I found it in the hall closet

652
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,500
when I was looking for rain gear.

653
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Yeah, but it's not raining.

654
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,300
Well, this was last November.

655
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,100
What ?

656
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,400
Jimmy doesn't need it anymore,

657
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,700
and it's cold, and it's shiny,
and it feels so good in my...

658
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,000
Here. You try it.

659
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,600
Eww ! I'm not touching your pistol.

660
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,600
That is stupid and dangerous.

661
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,200
Oh, my God.

662
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,400
Go 187 on that zombie ass.

663
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
It's in the kitchen.

664
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Follow me.

665
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,200
Stop or I'll shoot !

666
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,400
Oh, my God !

667
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,300
I've been hit ! Mom ?

668
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,300
Taylor... you shot me !

669
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,200
sorry

670
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,900
I came here because
I was worried about you.

671
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,400
I know, Mom, and it really means
a lot to me that you did.

672
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,600
Save it... that's the last

673
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,800
maternal instinct I'll ever have,

674
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,100
since you shot me.

675
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,700
It was just a toe nick.

676
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,800
You're totally fine.

677
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,400
Until sandal season !

678
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,800
Taylor, I'm going to have to see

679
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,600
a plastic surgeon right away.

680
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,700
I already told you, there's no
way to get you to the hospital.

681
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,000
You're just going
to have to tough it out !

682
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,200
Pancakes is hurt !

683
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,900
What ? Oh, no ! A rabbit ?

684
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,900
I found him in the garage,
and he was limping.

685
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
Let me see. Careful.

686
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,900
Baby, come here.

687
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,700
Let me see.

688
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,200
You know, he seems
like he's okay.

689
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,100
Maybe it's just a sprain.

690
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,000
No, I can't take a chance, okay ?
I have to go get him help.

691
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,500
Summer, you can't.
It's too dangerous.

692
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,200
I cannot wait here
any longer, okay ?

693
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,400
I have a missing boyfriend
and a sick rabbit.

694
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,400
I cannot listen to any more
of your mother's whining.

695
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,900
Okay, I'll go with you.

696
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,800
We'll brave the zombies together.

697
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,000
Mom, we're going to need to
take Pancakes to the hospital.

698
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,800
Wait. This carrion gets help,
but not me ?

699
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,600
We don't have a car,
you can't walk.

700
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,500
There is no way to get you there.

701
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,900
Taylor, I risked my life
and hoofed it all the way

702
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
from Emerald Bay,
and you're just going

703
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,600
to leave me here to rot ?

704
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
I have an idea, but I don't think

705
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,600
you're going to like it.

706
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,000
This is not okay with me.

707
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,300
Well, I told you
you wouldn't like it.

708
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,800
Mom, it's not that far
to the hospital,

709
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,600
and it's kind of this or nothing.

710
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,100
Fine, but I'm not holding
the rabbit...

711
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,800
unless you promise I can make
a vest out of him.

712
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,400
Okay.

713
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,400
I'll carry Pancakes.

714
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,100
Caitlin, if you'll
just listen...

715
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,700
I heard you, you're sorry.
I get it.

716
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,400
Truthfully, I'm not sorry.

717
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Tonight was the best
night of my life.

718
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,800
Gary...

719
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Given the chance, I'd do
everything exactly the same.

720
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,600
Caitlin, honey, you coming ?

721
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,700
Oh, yeah, just give me one second.

722
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,700
Okay, we'll wait for you
in the car.

723
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,300
Look, I should go.

724
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,200
But I am into ice cream,
and you're obviously hooked up

725
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,000
as far as that goes.

726
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,900
And the makeover
was pretty successful.

727
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,100
And the asthma attack had me
completely fooled.

728
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,500
Sweet.

729
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,600
So I guess once you guys get
this place back up and running,

730
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,100
I'll come stop by.

731
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,100
Gold Medal Ribbon on the house.

732
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,300
Best... earthquake... ever.

733
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,600
Dr. Harris, are those
my wife's tests ?

734
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Oh, no, Mr. Cohen,
it's going to be awhile

735
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,500
before we get the results.

736
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,400
Oh, of course, it's just
a little bit too soon for that.

737
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,800
I know you have your hands full.

738
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,000
Yes, we have a pretty
full house right now.

739
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,900
Well, as soon
as you know anything,

740
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,200
you know, good or bad...

741
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,700
if you could please let me know.

742
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,500
I will, of course.

743
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,800
Let me know first,

744
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,900
just so I can prepare my wife.

745
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,100
Of course. Thank you.

746
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,100
I mean, it's kind of crazy
in that we have two other boys

747
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,800
that are just going off
to college,

748
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
so we were expecting
to have an empty nest, you know,

749
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,900
when then, all of a sudden,

750
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,300
this unplanned,
miraculous event

751
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,400
and, well, uh, the fact
of the matter is,

752
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,600
I can't imagine anything worse
than an empty nest,

753
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,900
so, uh...

754
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,600
Anything you can do for that,
uh, for that little baby,

755
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,700
please, do it.

756
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,400
I'll get out of your hair
right now, okay ?

757
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,600
I'll come find you.
I'll be right there, all right ?

758
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,600
Okay. Thank you.
Yes, of course.

759
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,400
You feel that ?

760
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,000
Darryl ?

761
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,300
Hey, Seth.

762
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,700
How's the earthquake
treating you ?

763
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,800
Uh, not too well.

764
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,200
I need to ask for your help.

765
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,300
Sure, but how can I help you ?

766
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,000
Well, I'm guessing you don't
have a, uh, like, a car

767
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,700
or a walkie-talkie ?

768
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,900
This shopping cart's

769
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,500
my only worldly possession.

770
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,900
Okay, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you for it.

771
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,600
Sorry, no way.

772
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,200
I'll give you my pants.

773
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,000
No, no, they look better on you.

774
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,500
Listen.

775
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,800
It has a flat tire

776
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,100
and possibly
a broken axle, but it's

777
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,000
a $70,000 car
and it's all yours

778
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
in exchange
for the cart. Sweet.

779
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Stay here, I'll come back
to draw you a map.

780
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,800
Because...

781
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,900
it's a rabbit.

782
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,200
It's a he, and I'm aware
of his species.

783
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,600
but that doesn't mean
that he doesn't feel pain

784
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
and that he isn't hurt.

785
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,300
Please, if you have
a shred of humanity,

786
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,500
or animality in your body,

787
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,500
you won't deprive this poor,
little, adorable bunny

788
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,500
of quality medical care.

789
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,100
Well, I did do a year
of veterinarian school.

790
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,600
Really ?

791
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Maybe if there's an
X-ray machine free, I'll...

792
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Thank you. Thank you.

793
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,400
I still can't believe

794
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,700
that guy kept us there
for no reason.

795
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,600
I don't know. I think his
reasons are pretty good.

796
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,400
When a guy gets around a girl
he's crazy about,

797
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,700
sometimes reason goes
out the window.

798
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,700
He forgets to take things slow.

799
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,000
Well, sometimes, when a girl

800
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,100
gets around a guy
she's not too crazy about,

801
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,400
she does some
pretty stupid things, too.

802
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,500
I'm sorry for posting your mug
shot up in the ladies' room

803
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,100
at Taylor's birthday.

804
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,300
Well, it showed a lot
of creativity.

805
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,500
Speaking of creativity,
Caitlin... clown porn ?

806
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,400
I'm not even going to ask
where that came from.

807
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,400
I found it
in Dr. Robert's study.

808
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,500
You guys will believe
absolutely anything.

809
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,000
Hey, Frank, have you ever
considered cutting your hair ?

810
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Is that Seth ?

811
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,700
Oh, my God, pull over.

812
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,800
Mom, I'm really
sorry I shot you.

813
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,100
I know we don't always get along,

814
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,100
but... I really love you.

815
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,300
I love you, too.

816
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,700
I...

817
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,300
don't think I've ever
heard you say that before.

818
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,300
Taylor, that's why
I went to Julie's.

819
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,500
After the earthquake happened,
all I could think about was you.

820
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Oh, my God, Mom, me, too.

821
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,600
I was shot because I was such
a total failure as a mother.

822
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,900
It never even
occurred to you

823
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,000
that I would come looking for you.

824
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,500
But you did.

825
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,500
So...

826
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,200
So.

827
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,200
Mom...

828
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Hi.

829
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,400
I guess this is the point where
I'm supposed to tell you

830
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,300
that you gave us all
quite a scare,

831
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,900
except I was never scared.

832
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,800
Oh, yeah, I know that.

833
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,900
Me, on the other hand...

834
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,700
The doctors say
you're going to be fine.

835
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,000
Although you're going to have to
wrap your head around the fact

836
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,800
that we're really brothers now.

837
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,700
We're blood brothers.

838
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,200
You donated blood ?

839
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,600
Ah, I had an extra few pints
flowing through my veins.

840
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,000
It was no big deal.

841
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,800
Hmm.
You're not a big fan of needles.

842
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,700
Nor of fainting, it turns out.

843
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,400
But the bank was a little low

844
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,500
and us O-negative guys
got to stick together.

845
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,600
Hmm.

846
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,000
That's weird, 'cause all of a
sudden I have this strange urge

847
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to listen to Death Cab
and read comic books.

848
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,200
Really ?

849
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,700
No, I'm kidding.
Oh, that's too bad,

850
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,600
'cause if we could have

851
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,200
turned this into
a body-swap comedy,

852
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
we could have squeezed another

853
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,700
year or two out of this. Mm.

854
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,500
So listen, I don't know if I've
said this at all today, but...

855
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,500
You did.

856
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But after all the times you've
saved me, I was up, so...

857
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,800
All right.

858
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,000
Where's everyone else ?

859
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
How are, how are the girls ?
Kirsten, Sandy ?

860
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Uh, the girls are fine.

861
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,900
Veronica Townsend and Pancakes,
however, have matching casts.

862
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,000
And Frank is here

863
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,200
with Julie and Caitlin.

864
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,100
He gave me a ride,

865
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,400
brought you here.

866
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,000
Um, but my mom and dad are doing
some tests with the doctor,

867
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,900
'cause she fell.

868
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,500
Is it bad ?

869
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,100
Hey, boys.

870
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,300
Mom.

871
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,800
Hey. I'm so sorry.

872
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,900
Everything's fine.
`

873
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,100
The baby's okay.

874
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,700
She's okay.

875
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,300
She ?

876
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,300
It's a girl.

877
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,700
Sweet.

878
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,700
Cool.

879
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,400
Well, looks like the old
