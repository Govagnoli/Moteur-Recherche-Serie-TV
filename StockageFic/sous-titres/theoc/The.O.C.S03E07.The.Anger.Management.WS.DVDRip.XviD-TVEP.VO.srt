00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,034
<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,431
- You sure about this Julie Cooper?
- She's got nothing left to lose.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,200
- We wanna throw a charity event.
- Sounds like a wonderful cause.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,715
You were gonna scam me
into throwing a fake charity.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,154
Well, what if you help me?

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,436
So do you mind
if I join you for some pizza?

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,353
- Taylor, it's Summer! Open up!
- I can't hear you.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,272
Been dodging this business
for 20 years.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,237
Hang onto the company. I'll help you.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,992
This is Volchok.

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,639
Johnny?

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,199
Stay away from him.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,957
Look, I'm sorry, that movie sucked.

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,190
- <i>Master of the Flying Guillotine?</i>
- Yes.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,591
It's a classic of the genre. It's the
<i>Madame Bovary</i> of martial-art cinema.

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,433
The flying guillotine, was that
the spiky hat thing he threw?

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,034
- I'm sorry, but that was kind of weak.
<i>- Et tu,</i> Ryan?

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,670
It didn't make sense. Why was he going
after the one-armed boxer? Poor guy.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,239
Revenge. A tale as old as time.

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,437
- Maybe the girls should pick next time.
- Yes.

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,875
Do I have to remind you
about the <i>Bring It On</i> phase?

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,951
Now that is an awesome movie.

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,394
<i>I'm sexy, I'm cute</i>

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,834
<i>I'm popular to boot</i>

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,036
<i>I said I'm bitching, great hair</i>

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,679
<i>The boys all love to stare</i>

27
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,910
<i>- I'm wanted, I'm hot, l...</i>
- Summer.

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,279
Man, what'd I say?

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,592
Ten-to-one our boys are hanging out
at that candy-ass diner on the pier.

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,992
That's what I love about you rich kids.

31
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,310
- So predictable.
- What do you want?

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,154
I gotta spell it out for you?
I want a rematch.

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,914
Somewhere private.
Just me kicking your ass.

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,191
I'm not looking for trouble.

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,638
You should've thought of that
before jumping me the other night.

36
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,473
You didn't start it by hooking up
with someone's girlfriend?

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,471
Good point.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,349
Or that's unnecessary continuity.
Either, or.

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,839
Look, guys, this is so stupid.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,594
- I got nothing against you.
- That's too bad.

41
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,036
Because me and you,
we got unfinished business.

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,158
See you, guys.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,715
Hey, baby. I need your opinion.

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,678
Which of these screams
"real-estate mogul with a heart of gold"?

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,594
The blue.

46
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,153
And " sensitive, streetsmart man
of talent and mystery."

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,279
- The blue.
- All right, blue it is.

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,034
Sandy, you're gonna do great.

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,918
The Newport Group's lucky
to have you.

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,555
I just wanna make a good impression
on my first day.

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,472
Hey, how's that charity thing coming?

52
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,996
Oh, it's coming. I've just never thrown
together something so quickly.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,596
I hope Julie and Charlotte aren't out
getting Mystics while you do the work.

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,320
Don't worry, they're working.
Busy with the foundation.

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,311
Oh, good question.

56
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,153
- Booze or no booze?
- Oh, tough call.

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,357
A fundraiser for poor women
with substance-abuse problems.

58
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,238
I know, it'll be weird if people drink.

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,152
Then again,
people are more generous...

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,039
...when they've had
a couple of shots under their belt.

61
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,474
- Booze.
- Booze.

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,391
- Morning.
- Oh, hey, boys.

63
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,279
On Sunday, I would love
some help with the party.

64
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,112
Sunday. Sunday.

65
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,918
Yeah, it's gonna be tough.

66
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,510
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks, Ryan.

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,389
Well, I should get going. I have to meet
Charlotte and Julie at the club.

68
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,431
Hey, what is so incredibly
pressing on a Sunday?

69
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,030
It's the Sabbath, Dad.
It's the day of rest.

70
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,794
I don't make the rules.
Talk to the big guy.

71
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,757
I thought the Sabbath was Saturday.

72
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,276
Listen to me, this is the first public thing
your mother's done since rehab.

73
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,513
So we are gonna do everything in our
power to make it a success. Understood?

74
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,349
Mom, listen, Sunday,
I'm gonna be there, okay?

75
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,351
Provided I don't get struck
by lightning.

76
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,715
Thanks, Seth. That means a lot.

77
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,154
Such generosity.

78
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,958
Oh, there goes the back.

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,156
I'll be all right.
I can probably lift stuff.

80
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,392
I just feel responsible.
If I hadn't introduced Ryan to Johnny...

81
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,154
...then he never would've
gotten in a fight with that jerk.

82
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,356
If you're gonna blame someone,
why not Casey...

83
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,397
...for hooking up with the surf nazi?

84
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,314
- I know, I still can't believe she did that.
- Yeah, she had her reasons.

85
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,552
- Summer.
- I'm sorry. Have you asked him yet?

86
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,996
Right, I'll just say, " Hey, Johnny,
Casey thinks you're in love with me."

87
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,878
Then best-case scenario: he says no...

88
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,032
...and our relationship
is totally weird, if not ruined.

89
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,031
But what if he is?

90
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,951
Then our friendship
is totally weird, if not ruined.

91
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,669
He hasn't done anything
to make me think that.

92
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,832
So excuse me for not believing
his psycho girlfriend.

93
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,710
Ex-girlfriend. Yeah,
he's single now, remember?

94
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,871
I'll see you later.

95
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,599
Dude, all I'm saying is you just
got back into Harbor, okay.

96
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,032
You do not wanna go back
to the wasteland of homeschooling.

97
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,111
I told you, I'm not gonna fight him.

98
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,352
Yeah, I hear you, and I wanna believe
you, but I also know Kid Chino.

99
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,592
Sometimes, when his back's up
against the wall, his fists of fury...

100
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,034
Kid Chino is retired.

101
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,430
He hung up the hoodie.
So just relax, all right?

102
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,874
Seth.

103
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,154
- Hey, Taylor. How's it going?
- Oh, it's going great.

104
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,993
I cannot tell you how many people
have come up and told me...

105
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,957
...how awesome
they thought Lock-In was.

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,594
You know, every single one
mentions Capture the Flag.

107
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,830
Did you know
he was all-Camp Takahoe?

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,230
- He might have mentioned it.
- Told you it'd be fun.

109
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,153
It was, it was. And it was
all because of you too.

110
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,198
He took the lead in everything.
I mean with the trust falls...

111
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,555
...and the s'more making
and share time.

112
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,278
Your story about Captain Oats.

113
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,876
Oh, yeah, we had to tell a story
about our best friend growing up.

114
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,395
It was so insensitive
of those guys to laugh too.

115
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,712
Because your story wasn't nearly as lame
as Derek Simonds befriending the deaf kid.

116
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,236
But, Seth, I wanted to ask you...

117
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,437
...what do you think about planning
the Christmas dance together?

118
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,956
- The Christmas dance, you and me?
- We made such a good team.

119
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,351
Oh, wow, yeah. Well, that...
You should talk to Summer.

120
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,831
Your girlfriend?

121
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,554
- Summer?
- She did a fantastic job with the last one.

122
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,110
And I just think that you guys would...
There she is right over there.

123
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,910
- So you can talk to her about it yourself.
- Okay, forget it. I gotta go.

124
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,993
Oh, boy. You're in trouble.

125
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,832
- What?
- You're in trouble.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,673
That? I mean, I was nice to her.
So that's what that's about.

127
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,354
- Keep telling yourself that. Yeah, sure.
- Right. Hey.

128
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,033
What were you doing talking to her?

129
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,031
Forget she didn't
let me into the Lock-In?

130
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,918
I bruised my hand
pounding on that door.

131
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,516
- She probably didn't know it was you.
- She knew. She didn't wanna let me in.

132
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,239
Wonder why.

133
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,631
- I don't know.
- What's that supposed to mean?

134
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
We should take out half these
tables to have more flow.

135
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,078
We should also talk to them about music.
Last event they had us on a Kenny G loop.

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,232
Can I just tell you how excited I am?
This is gonna be so wonderful.

137
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,834
I'm so glad you suggested it.

138
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,633
Oh, there's the manager.

139
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,236
I'm gonna find out what time
we can be here on Sunday and set up.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,514
- So where are we?
- Hundred and thirty RSVPs...

141
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,229
...at five thousand a head.
That's over $600,000.

142
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,355
Three hundred thousand apiece.

143
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,357
Tell me again I have to do this.

144
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,557
Julie, you have two daughters,
no husband and no money.

145
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,757
You're about to get $300,000.

146
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,710
Oh, yeah. I'm totally doing this.

147
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,438
He says we can be here at 8.

148
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,996
- Ryan, hi.
- Hi.

149
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,628
- Going this way?
- Yeah.

150
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,509
- So you're, like, Seth's best friend, right?
- Don't tell Captain Oats.

151
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,148
That's funny.
I didn't know that you were funny.

152
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,072
So Seth and Summer seem happy.

153
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,949
I mean, I know they had that trouble
last year, but they seem stable.

154
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,954
Wouldn't you say that they're stable?
Of course, though, look at Brad and Jen.

155
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,272
Everybody thought that they were stable,
but nobody knew how unhappy Brad was.

156
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,237
Just waiting for Angelina
to rescue him...

157
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,709
- They're stable.
- How stable? One to ten.

158
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,470
- Excuse me?
- On a scale of one to ten.

159
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,359
- Right.
- How stable are they? Six?

160
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,873
Six-point-five?

161
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,429
- Ten.
- Ten.

162
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,474
Sucks for Angelina.

163
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,308
Then again, things happen, don't they?

164
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,754
I bet Brad and Jen used to be a ten.

165
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,992
Oh, bye.

166
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,511
I wanted to welcome you all
on our first day.

167
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,796
- Matt, have you met everyone?
- Not yet.

168
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,234
Matt Ramsey.

169
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,311
I wanted to go over what's changed.

170
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,359
The Newport Group will still develop
residential and commercial properties.

171
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,794
With this alteration...

172
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,748
...one quarter of all our new
housing projects will be low-income.

173
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,673
We are not just catering
to the mansion crowd anymore.

174
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,469
- Though we do need their money.
- The other thing that's changed is us.

175
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,279
Matt will be a vice president
and director of development.

176
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,556
Which will leave me
as president and CEO.

177
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,075
Despite the fact that I've watched
my lovely wife do this job...

178
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,472
...for the past 15 years, I'm new at this,
and I'm gonna need your help.

179
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,435
Stop milling around,
and get back to work.

180
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,160
- Thank you, everybody.
- Thank you.

181
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,272
- Nice speech.
- That's nothing.

182
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,796
Catch me with a microphone in my hand.
You should try to meet everyone.

183
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,632
- They'd appreciate it.
- Oh, yeah.

184
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,156
Hi, Matt Ramsey.
Good to meet you. You're fired.

185
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,199
Your meeting with
the accountant didn't go so well.

186
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,158
The word "unsustainable"
was used a lot.

187
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,790
- We have to lose nine people.
- Nine?

188
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,474
- That's a little extreme.
- You have to look at numbers.

189
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,915
For now, we sit tight.
We're here one day.

190
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,311
The first order of business
is not going to be firing half the staff.

191
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,750
All right. You're the boss.

192
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,070
I have a meeting about
the zoning on Crestmont.

193
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,912
Let me know what you come up with.

194
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,916
I'm only telling you so you can be
on the lookout, okay. This guy's crazy.

195
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,752
Gotcha. I'll be on AMBER Alert.

196
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,388
Oh, and don't tell Johnny.
He might do something stupid.

197
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,357
Say no more. It'll be our little secret.

198
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,114
And if sharing that secret
brings us closer together...

199
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,191
...creates a bond,
we'll roll with that too.

200
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,476
- Just don't tell Johnny, okay?
- Tell me what?

201
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,950
- Johnny.
- Hey. How are you?

202
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,793
- Good. Tell me what?
- No offense, man.

203
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,918
This is kind of just
between me and Marissa.

204
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,679
It's Volchok, isn't it?

205
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,273
- What'd he do?
- Nothing.

206
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,112
Chili.

207
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,113
Man, you guys are tearing me
apart here.

208
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,669
Look, he tried to get Ryan
to fight him.

209
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,271
But nothing happened, so...
Hold these. Johnny, wait.

210
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,430
- Johnny.
- Look, this isn't Ryan's fight.

211
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,672
What are you gonna do? Knock
on his door and say, "Fight me instead"?

212
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,308
I'm not gonna let your boyfriend
take the heat for me.

213
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,311
I'm not letting either of you guys fight.

214
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,471
- Marissa, that's...
- What is it with you two?

215
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,359
- I'm so sick of this.
- Ryan has nothing to do with this.

216
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,238
You know what? It's fine.
Just do whatever you want.

217
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,719
Hey.

218
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,195
Okay. I won't fight him.

219
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,036
Seriously?

220
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,397
Fighting a guy is one thing.

221
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,348
When it comes to upsetting a lady,
I'm a total coward.

222
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,551
You win.

223
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,678
Look, we better get to class.

224
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,877
I'm serious. Do you have any idea what
Summer will do if she finds out?

225
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,350
- I can imagine.
- I have to tell Taylor it's not gonna happen.

226
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,750
Even if I didn't love Summer...

227
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,469
...her and I, we're totally incompatible.
Seeing as how she's crazy and I'm not.

228
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,471
Well, I thought you said
she wasn't that bad.

229
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,914
- Taylor Townsend?
- Yeah.

230
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,516
In fourth grade, she campaigned against
making the school handicap-accessible.

231
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,910
She said it was reverse Darwinism.
Besides...

232
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,232
Who? Who wants
Dean Hess's seconds?

233
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,590
Oh, look, there's a picnic on our car.

234
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,191
It's you guys. Finally.

235
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,198
- Seth, get security.
- Well, maybe we'll go get them together.

236
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,599
Security? We're just talking.
I mean, nothing's gonna ha...

237
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,157
- It's all right, that's just a little soap...
- I'm not gonna fight you.

238
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,198
Did you hear that? Rich boy doesn't
wanna get his hands dirty.

239
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,152
Is your butler around?
Maybe he'll fight me.

240
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,231
I got it. We're all strangers, okay?

241
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,675
So let's take a step back for a second.

242
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,479
I'm Seth. I like comic books.

243
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,313
You obviously like flaming heart
tattoos.

244
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,311
I think you do got it in you.

245
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,789
In fact, I think you're
just itching to throw down.

246
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,953
I just gotta find the key.

247
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,155
Oh, look what I found.

248
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,917
You know what I just realized though?
She doesn't have a name.

249
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,798
I'm gonna call her:

250
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,439
"Little Bitch."

251
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,198
Just keep walking.

252
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,431
This ain't over.

253
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,832
- Hi.
- Hey.

254
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,116
Were we having breakfast
this morning?

255
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,238
So, Summer told me what
happened yesterday with Volchok.

256
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,472
Yes. Seth kept a secret a whole
12 hours. Must be a record.

257
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,234
Yeah, you know, I just,
I didn't wanna worry you.

258
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,592
Well, I'm proud of you for not fighting.
I know it must've been hard.

259
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,433
You have no idea.
That guy's a total jackass.

260
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,518
What are you doing?

261
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,079
What are all these tools for?

262
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,394
You wanna see? Come on.
Just don't overreact.

263
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,114
- A punching bag?
- Sandy had one, said I could use it.

264
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,748
- So you could train to fight him?
- No.

265
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,592
I'm not gonna fight him.
I didn't yesterday.

266
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,637
Then what's it for?

267
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,838
Therapy.

268
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,389
Okay. I just don't want
anyone fighting.

269
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,109
Johnny wanted to go after Volchok
again. But I talked him out of it.

270
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,113
- How's he doing?
- You mean about Casey?

271
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,554
Well, she really hurt him.

272
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,992
Seth's going to the Bait Shop tonight.
Why don't you invite Johnny.

273
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,435
- It'll take his mind off things.
- Sure.

274
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,430
- Now, what about breakfast?
- Definitely.

275
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,353
- I'll meet you inside. I gotta clean up.
- Okay.

276
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,193
<i>You can 't deliver at four.</i>

277
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,273
By the time the guests arrive, there'll
be pudding, and I can't have pudding.

278
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,633
Six will be fine.

279
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,109
- Thank you.
- Ah, sweet charity.

280
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,714
I am hereby calling the next
three hours "Kirsten time."

281
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,189
I am going to the gym,
I am getting my nails done...

282
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,396
...and everything else can wait.

283
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,075
- Good for you.
- You left early this morning.

284
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,989
Yeah. You know, nothing like a little
dawn patrol to clear your head.

285
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,390
Is everything okay?
I was so busy yesterday...

286
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,959
...I forgot to ask
how your first day went.

287
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,999
Oh, it's good, it's good.
It's, you know, just a lot.

288
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,639
You can always come to me
with questions.

289
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,236
Thanks.
You go have your "Kirsten time."

290
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,358
Come in.

291
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,433
Hi, Seth.

292
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,431
Taylor, hey.
What are you doing here?

293
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,275
Oh, your mom let me in.
She seems really, really nice.

294
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,792
Wow, your room is really cute.

295
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,076
- Look, can we talk?
- Before you say anything...

296
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,037
- I like you.
- Oh, boy.

297
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,636
I know. It totally surprised me too.

298
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,075
Because I don't usually
go for the R. Crumb type.

299
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,708
But the heart has its own logic.

300
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,910
Yeah, well,
I'm with Summer though, so...

301
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,389
- I heard you were breaking up.
- What? Who said that?

302
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,472
I made it up. But what did
you feel when you heard it?

303
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,358
- Relief?
- No.

304
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,476
Listen, Taylor, even if I was single...

305
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,518
...I'm not sure that you and I
would make a great match, I mean...

306
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,989
Is that a <i>Yakuza Prep</i> poster?

307
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,309
Yeah. It's just this Japanese film
about these prep...

308
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,552
Yeah, yeah. It's like
my favorite movie of all time.

309
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,154
I think Kenji Yamamoto was a genius.

310
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,390
Really?
Seen his <i>Samurai Assassination</i> series?

311
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,790
<i>Battles at the Edge of Hell?</i>
I own the collection.

312
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,396
- Oh, my God. Do you like comic books?
- Comics are geek-whacking material.

313
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,348
But, look, Seth. I mean,
it is obvious that we are soul mates.

314
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,556
All you have to do
is break up with Summer.

315
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,789
Right. Well, I'm not gonna
be able to do that, so...

316
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,038
I see.

317
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,073
Excuse me.

318
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,913
- Hello?
- Hey.

319
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,513
What time do we have
to be there tonight?

320
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,150
We should be
at the Bait Shop by like 8.

321
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,753
I'll see you later, Seth.

322
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,356
Who was that?
That sounded like a girl.

323
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,433
Did it? Yeah. Well, sure,
because I'm listening to the radio...

324
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,036
...and <i>This American Life</i> is on,
and so it was a girl talking.

325
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,634
Oh, is that that show
by those hipster know-it-alls...

326
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,633
...who talk about how
fascinating ordinary people are? God.

327
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,878
Yeah, yeah.

328
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,516
<i>- Hello?</i>
- So did you get the tickets?

329
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,992
Yep. San Juan, Puerto Rico,
where your ill-gotten dollar goes farther.

330
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,229
How's your roomie?

331
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,949
Oh, she still thinks she's getting
half the money and a free condo.

332
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,759
- You almost feel bad for her.
- <i>Yeah, almost.</i>

333
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,399
I'll see you tomorrow night.

334
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,199
- I just don't think we should sign.
- What's the problem?

335
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,590
Oh, they want us to sign
a liability agreement.

336
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,273
But then you'd be responsible.

337
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,238
- I'm happy to do it.
- What could happen?

338
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,753
Exactly.

339
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,513
There, it's done.

340
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,910
I'm gonna give this to the manager.

341
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,798
It's if somebody stubs a toe.
It doesn't mean anything.

342
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,679
I know. I'm just nervous.

343
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,071
As soon as I skip town, everybody's
gonna blame me. You're gonna be fine.

344
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,878
What about Kirsten?

345
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,076
Well, she is gonna be very hurt.

346
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,959
And she's gonna need her best friend.

347
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,993
Right.

348
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,038
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

349
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,829
I spent the morning with our accountant
going over the numbers, and you're right.

350
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,629
For this company to be as strong
as possible, we have to lose nine people.

351
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,268
- For once, I wish I was wrong.
- I'm still not doing it.

352
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,318
I came up with a plan.

353
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,474
We restructure our loans, eliminate
the perks, cut my salary by 30 percent.

354
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,077
- We let four people go. It'll get us by.
- But this... This leaves us no margin.

355
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,435
- lf one deal goes down...
- Then we go down.

356
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,914
But as long as I'm running this company,
that's how we're gonna do it.

357
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,353
Hey, it was not a pity invite, okay?

358
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,593
Tell him.

359
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,997
Yeah, no, we thought
you might like to see the band.

360
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,070
So you weren't worried I'd be home
alone all weekend thinking about Casey?

361
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,958
- No, no.
- That's crazy.

362
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,192
Seriously, what are you doing tomorrow?
My mom's having a fundraiser.

363
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,079
Yeah, if you want... Seth and I
could use your help setting up.

364
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,437
Yeah, well, if they're counting on Seth,
they definitely need your help.

365
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,115
You guys are so not subtle.

366
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,077
But I appreciate it.

367
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,953
Thanks.

368
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,631
Hey, okay, buddy...

369
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,030
Come on. I used to work here.

370
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,474
Hello, Seth.

371
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,871
Taylor. Hey.

372
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,876
- Is Summer here?
- Okay, look.

373
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,156
I love Summer. I always have.

374
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,151
Now, while you and I may share
an appreciation...

375
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,390
...for ultra-violent Asian cinema...

376
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,915
...there's no way...
- What's going on?

377
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,153
Tell me you just heard
what I was saying.

378
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,231
Hi, Summer. You look really cute.

379
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,439
I know. But more importantly, why are
you always talking to my boyfriend?

380
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,393
She likes <i>Yakuza...</i>
Never mind.

381
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,949
Well, maybe I should just get going.

382
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,634
I almost forgot.

383
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,474
Here.

384
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,399
Thanks for letting me borrow him.

385
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,038
It really means a lot to me
that you trust me.

386
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,512
Bye.

387
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,272
- You let her borrow Captain Oats?
- I didn't let her borrow anything.

388
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,989
- She must've taken it from my room.
- When was she in your room?

389
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,233
Wait, that was her?
When I was on the phone...

390
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,675
Something happened at the Lock-In.

391
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,156
- You're such a jerk.
- Summer...

392
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,272
Summer?

393
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,630
You leaving already, bro?

394
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,798
Yo, Harper, what's up?

395
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,675
- How's your girlfriend doing?
- No. Whoa, hey, he's not worth it.

396
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,990
Just get out of the way, man.

397
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,116
Or what? You're not gonna
fight me, I know that.

398
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,078
But she might shoot you.
She has before.

399
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,151
- Yeah.
- Is that true, bro?

400
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,198
You let your girlfriend
do your fighting for you?

401
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,354
No, hold up, girl.

402
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,679
- Don't you touch her.
- So that's what gets you going.

403
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,071
You. Out.

404
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,035
- Hey.
- Hey.

405
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,671
Kirsten's already over
at the yacht club.

406
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,512
Once you and Mr. Sabbath
have breakfast...

407
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,193
...we should head over
and start setting up.

408
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,555
Great. Can I talk to you
about something?

409
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,272
Anytime.

410
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,830
There's this guy, and he's gotten it
in his head that he's gonna fight me.

411
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,714
Does this have anything to do
with the fact my car is now...

412
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,154
...the "Little Bitch"?

413
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,754
- Maybe. I was gonna fix that.
- Forget about it.

414
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,480
- That there's enough to go to the cops.
- Yeah.

415
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,790
- Do you want me to talk to him?
- No. No offense...

416
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,349
...but I don't see this guy
getting scared.

417
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,072
You know you can't get into
another fight.

418
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,071
I know. I've been trying to walk away.

419
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,038
You're using your brain
instead of your fists. Good.

420
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,037
- How's that helping me with this guy?
- Well, you gotta keep walking away.

421
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,078
Because whatever's making
him angry, it isn't you.

422
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,112
Hang on just a minute.

423
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,595
Hey, Matt. It's a little early
on a Sunday morning.

424
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,038
Today?

425
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,398
No, you don't do anything
till I get there.

426
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,032
All right.

427
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,430
You and Seth are gonna have to go to
the club without me. I'll catch up later.

428
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,797
I'll have my phone if you need me.

429
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,509
I can't believe you dragged me out of
bed for this. This is the worst idea ever.

430
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,954
There's no other way.

431
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,317
But seriously, you don't know Volchok.
Last year, some guy snaked his wave...

432
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,597
...so he went up on the pier
and dropped a kitchen sink on him.

433
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,716
Where do you even get a kitchen sink?

434
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,555
Yeah, well, if you're so concerned,
why don't you stay in the car.

435
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,234
I'm just saying maybe
we could bring some muscle.

436
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,868
Besides the muscle
that I already provide.

437
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,514
Hey, look who's here.
Now, don't shoot.

438
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,592
- Hey, dork.
- Hey.

439
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,230
Look, I want you to leave Ryan alone.

440
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,952
Oh, so it's bribes now?
Well, I got a watch. Kmart, 15.99.

441
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,271
Well, this is Cartier,
and I got it for my 16th birthday.

442
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,158
It's worth, like, four grand.

443
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,598
Damn.

444
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,917
You must really think
I'm gonna hurt him.

445
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,636
Do we have a deal?

446
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,551
- Sure. I'll leave your little boy alone.
- All right.

447
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,916
If I see you around again,
I'm gonna tell the cops you stole that.

448
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,752
You do that.

449
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,559
Don't put them in direct sunlight.

450
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,110
The water heats up
and then the flowers, they wilt.

451
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,999
Do you think there's too much red?

452
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,673
- Hey, Kirsten.
- Oh, hey.

453
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,070
- What's up?
- Just giving final instructions.

454
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,559
I know I'm going a little crazy,
but I just want everything to be perfect.

455
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,110
- It will be, won't it?
- Yeah, of course. It'll be fantastic.

456
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,158
Thanks, Julie. I am so glad
we're doing this together.

457
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,073
Me too.

458
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,511
- What are you doing?
- Let me explain.

459
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,954
Forget going behind my back.

460
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,395
You called people in
on a Sunday to fire them.

461
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,118
That's what business school
teaches you?

462
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,793
Don't lose time during the week?

463
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,871
I thought it'd be better now
than Monday...

464
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,508
...when they have to pack up
in front of their coworkers.

465
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,432
- I didn't go behind your back.
- Really?

466
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,830
As much as I appreciate
the phone call...

467
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,797
...that you're about to fire
four employees...

468
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,919
...I don't recall ever agreeing to this.
- We agreed we had to let them go.

469
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,233
I just thought that if I did it myself,
I would spare you the pain. That's all.

470
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,676
For the record, I don't let people
do my dirty work for me.

471
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,149
- Where are they?
- They're in your office.

472
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,392
- Sandy.
- Oh, it's all right, Matt.

473
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,472
Now go home. It's Sunday.

474
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,189
Listen to me.
Nothing happened at the Lock-In.

475
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,158
Yet you still felt the need to lie
about her being in your room?

476
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,834
Because I knew how you'd react.
Not that it's your fault.

477
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,230
I'm saying it's my fault.
It's definitely my fault.

478
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,391
- You know what is my fault?
- What?

479
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,391
That.

480
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,999
Listen, man, I'm really sorry
about the whole Volchok thing.

481
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,232
It's not your fault. Guys like Volchok
are looking for any excuse.

482
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,550
Sounds like you've been
in this situation before.

483
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,950
Feels like every week.

484
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,593
Look...

485
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,831
If anything goes down, I'm there.

486
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,994
Thanks, but I'm hoping
it doesn't come to that.

487
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,674
Sometimes you don't have a choice.

488
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,998
Julie, you're not dressed.
We need to leave in a few minutes.

489
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,313
I don't think I can do this.

490
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,354
You're worried about
Kirsten getting hurt.

491
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,193
Kirsten, Marissa.

492
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,590
Even if they blame you.

493
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,678
I see. Well, what if they blame you?

494
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,950
- What?
- What if I call the police and tell them...

495
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,510
...how we created a fake charity
to defraud your friends?

496
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,672
- Charlotte, they'd arrest you.
- Yeah, they'd have to find me first.

497
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,673
I somehow think you'd be
a little easier to track down.

498
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,673
Could you do jail, Julie?
And if you did...

499
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,071
...which one of your former friends
would help you when you get out?

500
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,950
Now get dressed...

501
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,110
...or we'll be late for the party.

502
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,237
- Do you think Taylor's pretty?
- Summer.

503
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,470
Well, I mean, I know
she's not prettier than me.

504
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,916
- But objectively speaking.
- Objectively speaking, Seth loves you.

505
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,277
You've got nothing to worry about.
Go put these on a table.

506
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,237
He told me to give you this.
He changed his mind. He wants cash.

507
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,559
- But he can sell that.
- Tell him yourself. He's in the parking lot.

508
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,996
- We had a deal.
- Pawn shop ain't open. I need cash now.

509
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,072
- I owe a guy some money.
- Well, I don't have $4000.

510
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,879
Lucky for you,
all I need is a couple hundred.

511
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,508
Come on, you got
an ATM card, don't you?

512
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,035
Screw it. Is your boyfriend inside?

513
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,237
Okay. Fine, I'll go.

514
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,154
Let's do it.

515
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,157
- The party's really wonderful, Julie.
- Yes...

516
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,436
I'm so glad that you both could come.

517
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,477
You should watch those Ahi rolls,
Chuck...

518
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,790
...or we'll be treating you
for substance abuse.

519
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,993
Oh, excuse me. Nice to see you.

520
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,792
Well, you don't miss a beat.

521
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,394
Oh, well, you know,
just like riding a bike.

522
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,431
Julie, I really wanna thank you.

523
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,354
For what?

524
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,999
Making me do this.

525
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,871
I wasn't sure that I was ready.

526
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,755
But having your support...

527
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,591
I just wish my dad could see us.

528
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,430
He'd be so proud.

529
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,592
I thought you said
you'd have friends here tonight.

530
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,797
- They're just not here yet.
- I don't want another evening...

531
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,633
...of you sitting alone in the corner
reading <i>The Economist.</i>

532
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,189
- It's embarrassing.
- They're gonna be here.

533
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,954
Well, excuse me
if I don't hold my breath.

534
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,196
Taylor, sorry I'm late. I was...
Hi, Seth Cohen.

535
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,590
Veronica Townsend. Nice to meet you.

536
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,479
Taylor, is this the young man
you bought the present for?

537
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,911
- Mom.
- Well, give it to him.

538
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,878
She must have re-wrapped it
four times before we left the house.

539
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,598
Oh, my God.

540
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,189
Okay. Fine.

541
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,238
Oh, wow. You know, I mean...
That's, you know...

542
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,551
<i>Yakuza Demon?</i>

543
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,357
How did you get this? I thought
they only released it in Japan.

544
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,640
My cousin works for Christie's in Tokyo,
and he sends me DVDs. I don't know.

545
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,360
- I just thought you would like it.
- It's amazing.

546
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,156
Well, I'll just let you two be alone.

547
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,713
Taylor, this is, like, so...

548
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,630
- Taylor!
- Go away, Seth.

549
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,360
- I don't need you feeling sorry for me.
- I don't.

550
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,876
Oh, God. Well, why not?
You heard her. She's horrible.

551
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,237
She's always saying the same things:
"Why don't people like you, Taylor?

552
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,709
Why aren't you popular?
Why don't you have friends?"

553
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,711
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

554
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,871
Yeah, but that's just it. She does.

555
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,350
I live in this dream world where
I think that Summer is my friend...

556
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,149
...and I think that you like me. And
the truth is that I don't have anybody.

557
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,039
Oh, my God. Even the Grinch
had that stupid little dog.

558
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,633
- You think Summer's your friend?
- Yes, I know. I'm crazy.

559
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,756
You know what, I like you.

560
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,273
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

561
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,274
- You pity me. It's different.
- No, I really do. I think you're funny.

562
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,996
- Stop teasing me.
- I'm not. Listen to me. I'm serious.

563
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,753
You got great taste in movies.
I think you're smart, you're interesting.

564
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,239
- Really?
- Yeah.

565
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,472
If you just relaxed a little bit,
I think other people would see that.

566
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,234
You know, they'd see
that you're one of a kind.

567
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,631
Yeah. But I've actually
gotta head back in right now. So...

568
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,392
- Seth, l...
- No, no. Just because...

569
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,676
...I think Summer may be looking
for me.

570
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,513
You know, if she was to come out here
and see us talking:

571
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,910
- So we're gonna talk at school.
- Okay.

572
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,514
- Okay. Okay, good.
- Okay.

573
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,236
But I feel really good about this.

574
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,470
It's happening.

575
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,556
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

576
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,871
This party's unbelievable.
It feels like I'm in a movie.

577
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,110
I know the feeling.
Have you seen Marissa?

578
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,669
No. No, but I just got here.

579
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,239
- Why, what's up?
- Nothing.

580
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,709
I just saw her a little while ago, but...

581
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,749
Guess who? Hey, where are you?

582
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,992
Well, right now,
I'm with your girlfriend.

583
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,634
<i>Are you there, Little Bitch?</i>

584
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,519
- Yeah, I'm here.
- She's fine.

585
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,958
But she does miss you.
So why don't you come get her.

586
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,917
We're underneath the pier.

587
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,518
What's up?

588
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,515
- Volchok's got her.
- We should call the cops.

589
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,309
Yeah. You call them.
I'm gonna finish this.

590
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,878
Hey.

591
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,632
Kirsten.

592
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,916
I've raised over $300,000 in pledges.

593
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,469
Oh, that's great.
I think Julie's doing even better.

594
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,631
I wouldn't be surprised
if we hit a million.

595
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,677
Where is she?
I haven't seen her in a while.

596
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,638
- I don't know.
- Excuse me.

597
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,314
Excuse me, may I have
your attention over here, please.

598
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,711
I'm Julie Cooper-Nichol.
It's so great to see all your faces.

599
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,713
And I just want to thank you
so much for coming here.

600
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,836
With your assistance,
we are going to be able...

601
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,197
...to help a great many women
in need.

602
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,640
Thank you. However,
as you write your checks...

603
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,950
...I would ask
that you make them out...

604
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,475
...to the National Foundation
for Substance Abuse.

605
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,559
As it so happens...

606
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,554
...your generosity has somewhat
overwhelmed our small organization.

607
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,998
With the National Foundation's network,
your money will go a lot further.

608
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,434
And still be tax-deductible.

609
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,792
So thank you very much.

610
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,435
- Did you know about this?
- No, I...

611
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,951
- I'll go talk to her.
- Okay.

612
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,433
Julie.

613
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,956
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Oh, could you not hear me?

614
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,076
I always hold the mic too far away.

615
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,751
I wasn't kidding about the police.

616
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,639
Get back over there.
Tell everyone it was a mistake.

617
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,711
- Call them.
- What?

618
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,958
Call the police.

619
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,912
I thought so.

620
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,310
Oh, what? You think
you're back in society now...

621
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,517
...so you don't need the money?
Wake up, Julie.

622
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,750
These people are never gonna
accept you.

623
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,036
- You don't have any friends here.
- Wrong.

624
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,634
I have Kirsten,
and I won't do this to her.

625
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,475
Now, I think it's time you left,
don't you?

626
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,155
This town's only really big enough
for one manipulative bitch.

627
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,435
Take care, sweetie.

628
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,917
Where have you been?

629
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,359
I'm not talking to you
but you're not allowed out of my sight.

630
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,272
- I was in the parking lot.
- The parking lot?

631
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,795
Why were you in the par...?

632
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,276
<i>- Yakuza?</i> Were you with Taylor?
- She's having an emotional crisis.

633
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,950
- She's about to have a physical one.
- Summer, she thinks you're her friend.

634
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,350
What? She is crazy. I hate her.

635
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,512
I know, you along with everyone else.
This whole thing started...

636
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,116
...because that day I was at the Lock-In,
I saw how awful her mother is.

637
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,838
So you know, I was nice to her.

638
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,798
Okay. So that's the problem?
You were too nice?

639
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,714
She's not used to it,
and I think she's overreacting a little bit.

640
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,552
She's just really Ionely.

641
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,070
- She doesn't make it easy to be nice to.
- I know.

642
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,359
- Just don't ever lie to me again, okay?
- I won't, I swear.

643
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,352
How bad do you want
to watch that movie?

644
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,033
So bad it may actually kill me.

645
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,032
Come on.

646
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,876
Dude, this is a bad idea.
Last year, Volchok almost killed this guy.

647
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,953
- I know what I'm doing.
- Would you mind telling me what that is?

648
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,714
- I'm gonna try and use my head for once.
- With Volchok?

649
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,952
Just trust me.
And whatever happens, go with it.

650
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,078
All right. If that doesn't work?

651
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,671
Grab Marissa and run.

652
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,314
Here comes your boy.

653
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,675
- Whoa, slow down, bro.
- You all right?

654
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,070
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- We said she could go...

655
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,958
...but she wanted to stay.

656
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,791
Check it out, you brought Harper.
Want some when I'm through with him?

657
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,951
- Let's do it now.
- No. This is mine.

658
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,950
- Ryan!
- Whoa, bro, come on now.

659
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,519
Let's not get crazy, man.

660
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,677
You don't wanna do this...
- Oh, you giving me advice now?

661
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,149
Come on.

662
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,117
Don't look at them, look at me.
Come on!

663
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,599
- Ryan.
- Stay out of it!

664
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,949
Come on, you scared, huh? Dude,
you don't know what you're doing.

665
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,438
I been fighting guys like you for years.

666
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,195
Wanna bash my face in
because your life sucks? Fine!

667
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,634
Yeah?

668
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,158
But if you wanna fight,
you're gonna have to kill me.

669
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,191
So, what's it gonna be?

670
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,799
- Come on!
- All right!

671
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,271
All right.

672
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,673
Let's go, man. The guy's crazy.

673
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,231
- Hey.
- Hey.

674
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,231
Have a seat.

675
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,197
So the event was a success.

676
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,715
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

677
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,796
So you wanna tell me
what's going on?

678
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,793
- What do you mean?
- Don't shut me out, Sandy.

679
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,233
I fired four people today.

680
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,155
I'm not sure I'm the guy
for this job at all.

681
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,673
I'm glad you're upset.

682
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,109
- Good pep talk.
- It means you care.

683
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,511
Do you think my father gave
a second thought to someone he fired?

684
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,238
Exactly. He was successful.

685
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,356
And his ego almost
destroyed the company.

686
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,152
If I had to choose between you
and my father to run things...

687
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,117
...I would choose you every time.

688
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,118
Thank you, baby.

689
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,998
I'm not fragile.

690
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,752
You don't have to protect me.

691
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,957
- I forget, you are your father's daughter.
- No.

692
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,434
I'm your wife.

693
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,077
Good answer.

694
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,511
That was intense.

695
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,397
- You really wanted to hit him, huh?
- Oh, no.

696
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,431
No, I'm fine.

697
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,718
Well, I didn't hit him.
I think that's the most important thing.

698
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,791
Yeah, it is.

699
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,431
I'm sorry I doubted you.

700
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,990
You had plenty of
evidence to back you up.

701
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,434
Yeah, but you've changed.

702
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,875
You're like a totally
different Ryan Atwood.

703
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,349
- Was the old one so bad?
- No. No.

704
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,794
Just...

705
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,359
...darker.

706
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,438
It scared me sometimes.

707
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,719
Yeah. Me too.

708
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,390
I should head home.
I've got school in the morning.

709
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,273
You're gonna have to pull Summer
away from that <i>Yakuza</i> movie.

710
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,510
Somehow, I think I'll manage.

711
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,717
Hey, I'm proud of you.

712
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,199
Yeah.

713
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,516
