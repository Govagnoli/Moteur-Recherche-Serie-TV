1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,317
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- This is school?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,631
If you graduate from here, you can
get into any college in the UC system.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,439
What happens in Mexico, you know,
stays in Mexico.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,113
You don't deserve her.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,032
- I didn't want to kill myself.
- I know.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,555
- I'm so sorry about everything.
- Go away.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,030
- Our chemistry is undeniable.
- I don't have a date to the cotillion.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,519
Would you be my escort?

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,353
- Good news! I'm available.
- No.

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,750
- Who's Rachel?
- She works at the law firm I met with.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,309
- So if I did take this job...
- You already have.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,277
- This is Rachel.
- I'm Rachel.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,271
You and Marissa want different things.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,716
- You don't know what she wants!
- She doesn't want to live with you.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,872
I wanna live with Dad.
At least for now.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,632
Ryan's had a lot to overcome.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,360
- Not exactly Harbor School material.
- Give me a shot.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,035
First day of school. Excited?

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,838
You know, I ask you questions in
the hopes of eliciting an actual response.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,878
- I feel I convey more with a look.
- You look adorable.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,393
- No.
- Cute?

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,028
- Dope? Rad?
- Please, this is so painful!

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,474
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,108
- How was surfing?
- Cut it short.

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,874
I wanted to see the boys off.

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,679
Doesn't Seth look rad?

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,718
Oh, you do look rad! Mad props, son.

28
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,354
Thank God. Are you ready to go?

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,476
First day. You excited?

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,392
Enough said.

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,916
How do you do that? How do you
convey everything with just a look?

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,513
And again.

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,990
- How are you doing? Nervous?
- Why would I be nervous?

34
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,594
Because we're going to school
with, like, 300 Lukes...

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,751
...minus the redeeming social qualities.

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,031
I got it. Sorry.
You meant you were nervous.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,878
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous. I'm just not going.

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,429
You have to go. You own the school.

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,716
What about Kickoff Carnival?
You're the social chair.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,594
Let's see. Be humiliated
in front of the entire school...

41
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,035
...or hire someone
to do balloon animals?

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,475
Hire the guy who makes
the balloon octopus.

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,156
So your boyfriend cheated on you,
and, yes, you almost died in Mexico.

44
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,992
And the scandal with your dad...

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,390
If you're trying
to make me feel better...

46
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,553
Okay. The point is, there's
no such thing as bad publicity.

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,518
- Is that something burning?
- Okay, so...

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,549
...new oven. Haven't quite figured out
how to make French toast.

49
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,234
Not in the oven
would be a good place to start.

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,392
Since no one will hire me,
I've got plenty of time...

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,869
...I'm gonna go out and buy a cookbook.

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,793
Come on! It's good, they're crunchy.

53
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,394
- See?
- No, thanks.

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,154
I don't know who I'm more
worried about here.

55
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,519
I think it's safe to say that
this year is going to be different.

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,514
- Maybe this year will be different.
- That's the mantra every year.

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,912
And every year some big water-polo
player pees in one of my shoes.

58
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,312
Just kidding. They pee in both.
Ryan has Mr. Schmidt for pre-calc.

59
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,434
- What's wrong with Mr. Schmidt?
- Nothing. Say hi to his mole for me.

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,670
At least you have each other.

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,196
- Very wise, Dad.
- Thank you, son.

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,908
We're doomed.

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,677
The master race has been perfected
and they all go to our school.

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,033
Hey, fellas.

65
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,949
All right, don't get
your Speedos in a bunch.

66
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,680
- This is a nightmare.
- This is a nightmare.

67
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,230
- I bet, like, no one even knows.
- Are you kidding?

68
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,631
- I heard she died down there.
- She looks pretty good for a dead girl.

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,270
Hey, whores!
Why don't you go work another corner.

70
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,228
Summ, maybe I should go home.
Help my dad unpack.

71
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,710
Coop, that is as bad as it's gonna get.
I spoke too soon.

72
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,316
Hello, Summer. What does
your schedule look like today?

73
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,471
- Full.
- Really?

74
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,631
- A friendly face.
- How's it going?

75
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,597
- Not good. You?
- Worse.

76
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,550
So why don't we just get out of here?
Right now. Go down to the pier.

77
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,871
I can't. Dean Kim would call my dad.
Or worse, my mom.

78
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,318
- Okay. How about after school?
- I'm chairing the carnival committee.

79
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,678
- I know. I've been looking for an excuse.
- I think you found one.

80
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,479
- I'll meet you out front.
- Something to look forward to.

81
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,200
Coop! Can we go, please?

82
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,868
Hey. Could we maybe talk or...?

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,638
Stay away from her.

84
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,836
How?
We all go to the same school.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,592
You should've thought about that...

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,036
...before hooking up with one
of her best friends! Ass!

87
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,949
- You okay?
- Yeah. I just have to get used to it.

88
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,153
This, I guess.

89
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,114
- But we're still on, right?
- Yeah. Something to look forward to.

90
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,678
Coop!

91
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,831
See you, Summer.

92
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,233
Slowly I thaw her icy heart.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,310
- Look at you.
- Lf I must.

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,679
- New suit. New scent. New look.
- I feel like this is heading somewhere.

95
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,751
- New girlfriend.
- And there it is.

96
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,319
You're still all bent out of...

97
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,232
Oh, God! I should've found
an attractive co-worker years ago.

98
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,789
- It was a figure of speech.
- Rachel's attractive?

99
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,951
Is that her name? It's context.

100
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,159
Only, you know, in relation to which
she invokes amorous feelings...

101
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,108
...in my far more, extremely more,
attractive wife.

102
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,436
Good answer.

103
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,912
- Mornings used to be our time.
- I remember them well.

104
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,877
What happened?

105
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,353
Work happened.
Just hang on one sec.

106
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,990
Wait a minute. I can't get it.
Hang on one sec.

107
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,079
Just hold on. I got it.

108
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,468
Wait.

109
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,396
How did she know?
You're not gonna answer it, are you?

110
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,235
It's my dad.

111
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,030
Hey, Rachel.

112
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,713
Hi, Dad.

113
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,555
So if you'd care to join me
for lunch today...

114
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,551
...I can arrange for an empty chair.

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,109
There's nothing but empty chairs
at your table.

116
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,554
Seth Cohen?

117
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,273
Anna! Hey, how are you doing?

118
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,271
Excuse me, we were talking here.

119
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,512
So insulting him
counts as conversation?

120
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,798
If it doesn't, then we've never spoken.
Remember Anna from Pittsburgh?

121
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,476
- How could I forget?
- We're still on for lunch today, right?

122
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,030
- She probably didn't even hear me.
- Seth, what are you doing?

123
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,839
I thought you got past
this whole Summer thing at cotillion.

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,276
Right. And I know it seems like
not a lot of progress has been made...

125
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,830
...but I have to tell you... Yeah, not that
much progress has been made.

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,869
Despite all my best judgments,
I cannot not like her.

127
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,634
- You're such a boy.
- Well, whatever.

128
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,874
- I'm nothing but available for that girl.
- All right. Right there.

129
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,352
That's your problem. Girls like to be
chased by guys that aren't into them.

130
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,556
That sounds a little bit
like a game to me...

131
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,950
...and I don't really like to play games.

132
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,554
Unless we're talking about
Saturday-night Jenga...

133
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,712
...a little Magic: The Gathering.
I love Magic: The Gathering.

134
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,838
Maybe you just don't know how to play.

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,037
- Well, you're a girl, right?
- Yeah.

136
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,589
- And we're friends, right?
- Sure.

137
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,955
Then train me in the ways of women.

138
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,917
I don't understand chicks like Summer.

139
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,798
I'll teach you how to play Jenga.

140
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,957
- You really like her?
- Since I was 10.

141
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,519
Fine.

142
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,117
- But I make no promises.
- Trust me, I cannot do any worse.

143
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,192
That I trust.

144
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,833
You're my girl.

145
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,917
- Hey.
- Hey.

146
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,958
What were you doing this morning
when I called? You sounded...

147
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,348
Did I wake you?

148
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,478
- I was spending some time with my wife.
- Yeah? How'd that go?

149
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,632
- Well, I got to work on time.
- Too bad.

150
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,951
It might be a while before your wife
is in the mood for love.

151
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,395
Yeah? Something you know I don't?

152
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,996
I know lots that you don't,
but in this case...

153
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,196
...are you familiar
with the Balboa Wetlands?

154
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,476
Yeah, the largest coastal wetlands
in California.

155
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,918
Home to the blue heron,
the brown pelican and the swamp rose.

156
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,308
Right.

157
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,358
The wetlands are key
to water quality in the county.

158
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,308
- Not to mention, they're kind of pretty.
- Naturally, they must be destroyed.

159
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,109
The Balboa Heights are 250 acres
of land that sit above said wetlands.

160
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,556
- Every developer's after the Heights.
- Somebody got it.

161
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,030
And they're looking to tear it up,
put in condos, a golf course.

162
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,954
Thank God. The lack of golf courses
around here, it's tragic.

163
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,510
This is a policy-changing,
career-making piece of litigation.

164
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,674
A tree-hugging crusader, like yourself,
would kill for a case like this.

165
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,400
- And you want to share this with me.
- Yes.

166
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,959
Why?

167
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,157
Oh, my wife's company is the plaintiff.

168
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,550
It's her father's company.

169
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,992
Why even tempt me with this?

170
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,152
It's a conflict of interest.
I'm not even sure it'd be ethical.

171
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,074
The client, the Balboa Land Trust,
not only waived the conflict of interest...

172
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,800
...they insisted you take the case.

173
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,999
Your politics, your passion,
your dislike for your father-in-law.

174
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,948
- You're the ideal advocate.
- My wife will have a different spin on it.

175
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,473
You came to this firm...

176
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,552
...because we have the resources
to help you make a difference.

177
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,679
They're gonna teach this in law school.
So, what's it gonna be?

178
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,593
Your sex life? Or the swamp rose?

179
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,955
Did you know that
she overdosed on Vicodin?

180
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,120
You are not quitting your post
as social chair, Marissa.

181
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,636
You were elected by the students,
you've held the position for two years.

182
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,713
I know, Dr. Kim. But that was before
everything that happened this summer.

183
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,077
I understand you are going
through a lot of change right now...

184
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,312
...but you're a leader here at Harbor,
that doesn't have to change.

185
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,756
You're a wonderful example.
Students look up to you.

186
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,433
Not anymore.

187
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,878
Putting aside the issue of how walking
away from your responsibilities...

188
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,271
...will affect your college transcript...

189
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,149
...people are always going to talk.

190
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,199
You may as well give them
something good to talk about.

191
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,148
Don't disappear, Marissa.
This is your school, your life.

192
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,197
Your future.

193
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,599
Hey, what are you doing?

194
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,512
You never told me
about summer reading.

195
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,908
Who does summer reading?

196
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,198
- Apparently, everyone in my class.
- Oh. Yeah. Sorry about that one.

197
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,477
Anna here has convinced me
to join <i>The Plank</i>, the literary magazine.

198
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,552
I needed an extracurricular activity,
and apparently...

199
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,711
...you don't have to wear a
sports bra.

200
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,269
It's appealing on many levels.
Plus I feel...

201
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,000
...I have a few limericks
to share with the world.

202
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,628
Have fun.
I'm gonna hang with Marissa.

203
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,030
School might not suck this year.

204
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,159
Hey. I have to plan
this carnival thing after all.

205
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,072
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

206
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,151
I talked to the dean, and...

207
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,915
...I think getting involved in school again
might not be a bad idea.

208
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,197
- I know, that sounds lame.
- Yeah. No, it's cool.

209
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,318
- So...
- Can we reschedule?

210
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,436
- Absolutely.
- What about the carnival?

211
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,239
I'll save you a ride on the Ferris wheel.

212
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,710
No Ferris wheels. I don't do heights.

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,152
- But we'll figure something out.
- Are you sure you're gonna be...?

214
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,359
I'm fine. I just got a lot of reading to do.
Like 500 years of it.

215
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,511
Okay. So I'll see you.

216
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,075
- Morning.
- I didn't hear you come in last night.

217
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,071
I didn't want to wake you.
You look nice.

218
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,879
Dad's demanding a company breakfast.
Some kind of crisis.

219
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,952
If this is how it's gonna be,
after a couple of weeks of work...

220
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,032
...we're gonna be like...
- Two ships passing in the morning.

221
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,952
What have they got you working on?

222
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,918
A big high-profile case.

223
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,310
How about lunch today? I'll pay.

224
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,152
No, actually, you can pay.

225
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,392
You're the one that's working
on a high-profile case.

226
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,198
How about Friday?

227
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,557
I'll have my people call your people.
I love you.

228
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,631
I love you too.

229
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,718
Hey, kid.

230
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,518
- How did school go for you?
- Fine. Just behind.

231
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,910
After one day? Nice work.

232
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,913
It's brutal. You're brave to face
those preppy little savages.

233
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,308
I mean the teachers.

234
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,756
I don't think it was a good idea,
me in private school.

235
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,959
- You're one of their smartest kids.
- It's not the work. It's just...

236
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,476
...everybody's got something,
except me.

237
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,154
- Well, you got Seth.
- Seth's got his women.

238
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,432
Seth Cohen?

239
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,276
Okay. So...

240
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,556
Really?

241
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,750
So you need something.
An activity. A sport.

242
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,470
- Ladies.
- Don Juan, we're trying to find...

243
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,835
...an extracurricular activity for Ryan.

244
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,719
- Okay.
- Harbor's got a great archery program...

245
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,279
Archery, no.
Absolutely not.

246
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,668
Fencing?

247
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,355
What century are you in? Open your
mind. This isn't me we're talking about.

248
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,751
With Ryan, we have an opportunity
to have a real athlete in the family.

249
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,148
Somebody to achieve...

250
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,232
...all that your Jewishness has
prevented me from accomplishing.

251
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,630
- I always wanted to play soccer.
- I used to play.

252
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,031
- Done.
- Glad I could help.

253
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,759
I didn't get around
to getting those cookbooks.

254
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,957
I guess it's better
to play it safe, then.

255
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,759
So how's sleeping on the sofa?

256
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,353
It's fine.

257
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,909
- It's just temporary.
- I can handle it.

258
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,071
Did you talk to your mom?

259
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,594
I'm sorry about all this, sweetheart.

260
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,718
- I just wish you would've told me.
- I know, I know.

261
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,189
But things will be different now.

262
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,874
Hey, don't get too excited.

263
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,158
The phone company is installing
an actual phone line.

264
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,117
A very big day.

265
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,199
- Hey, Mr. Cooper.
- Luke.

266
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,193
So is this your new place?
Looks great.

267
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,639
- Not buying it, Luke.
- Right. Can I talk to Marissa?

268
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,756
- No. You can't.
- Come on, it's me.

269
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,558
If I could talk to her...

270
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,191
Yeah, she told me what happened,
and she doesn't want to talk right now.

271
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,874
Come on. If anybody knows
about being in the doghouse...

272
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,031
Don't say it.

273
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,391
What can I do?

274
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,630
You can leave.

275
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,396
Well, tell her sorry.

276
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,668
Okay.

277
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,473
Thanks.

278
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,990
- Hey.
- Hi.

279
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,878
- How did it go with the carnival?
- Oh, very exciting.

280
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,632
If I get out of my meeting early...

281
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,030
We're voting on cotton candy
versus funnel cakes.

282
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,670
- Cotton candy, no question.
- My thoughts exactly.

283
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,515
But I can't today. I got soccer practice.

284
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,399
- You do?
- Yeah, I'm gonna try out.

285
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,314
I figure getting involved in school
might not be such a bad idea.

286
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,712
Yeah. Plus, now we both get out
at 5, right? Meet you in the quad.

287
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,996
See you then.

288
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,278
- Hello. Is this seat taken?
- It is now.

289
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,668
Cool.

290
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,792
You can sit here
if you want, Summer.

291
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,308
Thanks.

292
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,390
Seth, come sit here by me.

293
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,438
Are you sure? You don't mind
one cheek on, one cheek off?

294
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,318
Sit!

295
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,789
Sitting.

296
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,710
Oh, my God!
Okay, so tell me about Tahiti.

297
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,031
- Oh, it was incredible.
- Anna just sailed to Tahiti.

298
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,317
Sailing is, like,
so not the fastest way to get anywhere.

299
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,473
If you'd flown,
you would've gotten there a lot sooner.

300
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,915
You should be on the debate team.

301
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,999
- Hi.
- Hi.

302
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,995
- Nice office.
- It came furnished.

303
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,110
- I brought you lunch.
- Well, it's not a lump of coal.

304
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,430
- When were you going to tell me?
- Soon.

305
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,160
Not soon enough.
I signed a deposition this morning.

306
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,878
Oh, honey.

307
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,838
I'm not even sure
if I'm gonna take this case.

308
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,752
There is no case!

309
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,595
You're talking about destroying one of
the world's most productive ecosystems.

310
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,877
It's like selling off the rainforest
to profit a few individuals...

311
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,508
...and asking generations
of others to pay for it.

312
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,118
We have proposed to protect 350 acres
of wildlife refuge and a natural park.

313
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,670
You'll still add 30% more traffic
and 10 tons of air pollution daily.

314
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,071
Not to mention
what you'll do to the water supply.

315
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,276
- You're gonna take this.
- No...

316
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,158
Sandy, it isn't even ethical.

317
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,276
I feel comfortable comparing ethics
with your father.

318
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,398
Well, as long as you're comfortable.
I gotta go.

319
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,633
I gotta keep this off my father's radar.
He's going to lose his mind.

320
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,039
All right, move! Don't wait for it!

321
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,192
Hey. You Atwood?

322
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,590
- What position you coming out for?
- Striker.

323
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,833
You see that kid out front?
That's Luke, the captain and striker.

324
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,031
Let's go! Show me something!

325
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,356
Hey, Ward!
You got a little competition!

326
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,593
Thanks.
Tomorrow we'll figure out the parking.

327
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,389
Make sure the band's booked.
No last-second surprises.

328
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,678
We need to talk.

329
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,956
You do not want to hear
what I have to say.

330
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,678
- Yes, I do.
- No.

331
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,310
All you want is for me to tell you
that everything's okay now. It's not.

332
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,152
I know, and I'm so sorry.

333
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,154
I don't care how you feel
or what you're going through.

334
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,357
- Because you didn't care about me.
- That's not true.

335
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,752
I slept with you. Then you slept
with one of my best friends.

336
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,550
I waited for you and you lied to me.
You humiliated me.

337
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,959
Marissa...

338
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,791
It's just...

339
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,553
I'm so sorry.

340
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,719
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to not be able to talk to you?

341
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,999
- You think it's easy for me?
- Let's just start over.

342
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,119
Please?

343
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,114
I don't know what I'd do without you.

344
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,591
Just because I ruined everything,
it doesn't mean I didn't love you...

345
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,035
...because I did.

346
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,513
I do.

347
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,513
You know what the worst part is?

348
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,478
If I hadn't caught you...

349
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,517
...I'd still love you too.

350
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,911
I gotta go.

351
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,192
I know that look.

352
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,275
I was trying to keep this from my dad,
and now it's on the front page.

353
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,671
I thought we could settle this privately.

354
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,434
- This was not to go to the press.
- It's your firm!

355
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,478
And now the entire
community knows we're fighting.

356
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,317
Well, I guess
they got the story straight.

357
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,759
- What are you doing?
- Morning ritual, Ryan.

358
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,639
- Coffee, bagel, Arts & Leisure.
- You have a morning ritual?

359
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,870
Something I've been crafting
for a while.

360
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,948
So, what's up, dude?

361
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,759
How's life? We never talk anymore.
Who are you?

362
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,472
- We had dinner 12 hours ago.
- Fine. Keep it all bottled up.

363
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,713
- What was that?
- Nothing.

364
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,475
That wasn't nothing. I saw
thoughts forming and words percolating.

365
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,358
It's just...

366
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,749
- Never mind.
- Come on! What was that, dude?

367
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,071
Last night, I saw Marissa with Luke.

368
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,150
- Making out?
- Making up.

369
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,231
Luke was crying.

370
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,156
Luke was crying?

371
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,396
- That doesn't sound like anything.
- It didn't sound like nothing.

372
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,551
Looked like they were
getting back together.

373
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,030
So ask her about it.
If nothing's going on, she'll tell you.

374
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,273
- Do not tell him!
- Shouldn't I just be honest?

375
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,558
Never. You guys haven't even gone
on a date yet. You'll freak him out.

376
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,790
Trust me, what he doesn't know
won't hurt you.

377
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,708
- Hi.
- Hi.

378
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,553
What happened to you last night?
I tried calling.

379
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,632
Sorry. I got slammed last night.
I'm behind.

380
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,518
After two days?

381
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,510
What did you do?

382
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,870
Nothing. My meeting went long.

383
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,269
- How'd it go?
- Good. I think it'll be good.

384
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,677
What did you do after?

385
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,593
- After I couldn't find you, I went home.
- Sorry.

386
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,639
Yeah, but you've got soccer
practice later. Maybe I'll stop by.

387
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,236
I gotta get to class. I'll see you.

388
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,111
- I mean, ew!
- That's my girl.

389
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,272
- Cohen, you're a good dissector.
- Hands of a surgeon.

390
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,749
It's decided, then.
You'll be my lab partner.

391
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,797
You can write up the lab reports.

392
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,190
Actually, Seth already has a partner.

393
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,235
He's promised himself to me, right?

394
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,470
Yes. I am betrothed.

395
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,074
Good.

396
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,992
She wanted to be my lab partner.
You're supposed to help me get her.

397
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,720
Watch and learn, Cohen.

398
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,472
Follow my lead.

399
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,073
Scalpel!

400
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,433
Where shall we begin?

401
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,393
The heart.

402
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,436
Well, Sanford, you're all anybody's
talking about around here.

403
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,433
Did you bring me into this firm
because of this case?

404
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,592
We didn't have this case
when we hired you. Don't worry.

405
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,036
You've already convinced everyone
that you're really torn.

406
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,395
This could go
to the state supreme court.

407
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,838
Yeah. And I know I could win.
It's a question of what I'm gonna lose.

408
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,270
Well, if your marriage
can't survive this...

409
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,314
...what kind of marriage is it?

410
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,669
Hey, Atwood, good!
Good! Take a shot!

411
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,070
- All right.
- Good hold, guys.

412
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,395
All right, let's keep it moving.
Let's go! Line up!

413
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,788
Hi.

414
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,394
Sorry about yesterday.
That was kind of intense.

415
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,475
The last time I cried was when
Macaulay Culkin died in <i>My Girl</i>.

416
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,712
Yeah, the bee stings.
You were a mess.

417
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,159
Kick! All right, good, good.

418
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,709
All right, guys, let's go.

419
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,589
- Hey, Ward! Get over here!
- I will...

420
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,549
Sorry, coach.
I had to tape up my ankle.

421
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,633
Excuse me.

422
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,429
All right, we're finally all together?
I wanna see some hustle now.

423
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,314
Hey! Illegal!

424
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,955
Get in my office. Right now!

425
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,031
Don't put any weight on it.

426
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,908
Nice job.

427
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,719
What's your problem, dude?

428
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,759
How was soccer?

429
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,434
So, Pops, how's the new job?

430
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,235
Hey, Mom, I...

431
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,070
I'm just going to be quietly eating now.

432
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,393
Hey.

433
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,116
What was that about?

434
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,350
- What?
- You attacked him.

435
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,557
He beat me to the ball.
It was a clean tackle.

436
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,314
- Why are you lying to me?
- Why are you lying to me?

437
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,509
- What are you talking about?
- You and Luke.

438
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,036
- I saw you yesterday. I heard everything.
- I didn't know what to say.

439
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,474
Why not tell me the truth?

440
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,110
Why didn't you just tell me,
instead of hurting him?

441
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,317
- You're as bad as he is.
- I don't need any more lies.

442
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,155
I didn't lie to you. What happened
was between me and Luke.

443
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,871
- It has nothing to do with you.
- Right, it has nothing to do with me.

444
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,149
It just isn't gonna happen.

445
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,595
No, it's not.

446
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,999
Your coach called.

447
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,798
He wants to suspend you
for two games.

448
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,791
- Great.
- He thinks you got talent.

449
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,712
He also thinks your attitude sucks.

450
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,111
- It does.
- Sit down and listen to me.

451
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,034
You can stand if you want,
but you know how lawyers love to talk.

452
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,039
You don't need this blowout
on the soccer field...

453
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,634
...to turn into a suspension from school.

454
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,473
- This school can do great things.
- For Seth, not me.

455
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,234
You're angry. I know that.
I don't blame you.

456
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,995
Every day at that school,
you're gonna run into spoiled rich kids...

457
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,116
...whose ass you are gonna
want to kick.

458
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,033
You've gotta find a way
to work it out right now.

459
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,589
Let's forget about suspension.

460
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,318
We're always one mistake
away from...

461
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,475
...from someone taking you from us.

462
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,995
You know, Seth was never
really big on organized sports.

463
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,349
I'd love to see you play.

464
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,554
Go to some of your games.

465
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,990
And women usually find
stark brutality so romantic.

466
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,594
- I messed up.
- Yeah, well.

467
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,513
In my experience,
you should always apologize.

468
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,355
Even if you've done nothing wrong,
your shoes get peed in so much less.

469
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,479
- That was a metaphor.
- Apologize. Right. And to Luke?

470
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,677
That crybaby? No, man.
He can drown in his own tears.

471
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,717
They're all the same.

472
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,872
It's too bad, because I could tell
you really liked him.

473
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,428
Hi.

474
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,078
- Do you mind? Can we...?
- We have to get to class. Come on.

475
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,955
I do love Mr. Solomon Burke.

476
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,588
Hey.

477
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,799
I was...

478
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,510
I was gonna bring you
a bouquet of swamp roses...

479
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,240
...but apparently they're endangered.

480
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,872
I'm gonna take it. I gotta. I'm sorry.

481
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,156
It's who you married.

482
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,231
I know.

483
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,073
You know, I've been
pissing you off for years.

484
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,196
Why stop now?

485
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,358
My father, my husband...
It's gonna be a long year.

486
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,037
Could be a couple of years.

487
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,157
Yeah. Well, I couldn't be married
to a man who wasn't a man.

488
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,271
I'm all man.

489
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,352
We'll get through this.

490
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,752
There's a reason why we're together.

491
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,432
I have that suspicion.

492
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,278
Okay.

493
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,670
Okay?

494
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,068
Okay.

495
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,028
Okay.

496
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,356
- The kids are at that carnival.
- I heard that rumor.

497
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,472
- Are you getting out?
- Are you getting in?

498
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,991
Maybe.

499
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,230
Maybe. Okay.

500
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,914
- Oh, my God.
- Why do you keep this thing on?

501
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,036
Emergencies.

502
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,399
It's my dad. And it's an emergency.

503
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,472
Hey, Dad.

504
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,470
Rachel, hi.

505
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,392
- Lf only Skee-Ball were a school sport.
- A boy can dream.

506
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,312
- Let's see you take a shot.
- I'll pass.

507
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,631
Take one shot!
Take a shot. It's very easy.

508
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,394
Okay? Concentrate.
Lean to the left a little bit.

509
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,711
- Any luck finding Marissa?
- No sign of her. You guys?

510
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,030
Nothing. We have to let
Anna concentrate...

511
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,350
...as she dares to step up to the master.

512
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,438
Okay. Clearly, you're a lesbian.

513
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,355
I'm gonna go trade in my tickets
for some cash prizes.

514
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,069
Hey, do you think I should get Summer
something? What would she like?

515
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,796
I can figure it out.

516
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,918
Seth doesn't understand
the whole hard-to-get strategy.

517
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,355
- That's because he's not.
- Oh.

518
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,029
Why are you helping him
with Summer?

519
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,633
Why not?

520
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,439
Seth doesn't see me that way.

521
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,639
When he looks at Summer,
he sees lips, hair and boobs.

522
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,511
When he looks at me, he sees...

523
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,871
...a lab partner.

524
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,474
- We're friends.
- And you're gonna let that slide?

525
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,672
Anna...

526
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,071
...guys wanna be chased by girls
who aren't interested in them.

527
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,831
Come on!

528
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,275
Summer, it's right here.

529
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,873
So do girls.

530
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,156
She's heading for the Ferris wheel.
Gotta go.

531
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,912
Good luck.

532
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,075
I'm sorry about yesterday.

533
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,153
Actually, I'm glad we came.
It's not half as bad as last time.

534
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,517
- You're going with me.
- Yeah, okay. Let's go.

535
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,712
Do you mind?

536
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,394
Not getting involved.

537
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,959
- What are you doing?
- I wanna talk.

538
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,519
I thought you were afraid of heights.

539
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,989
But this is important.

540
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,108
Oh, boy.

541
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,195
Look. I said some things last night,
and I just want you...

542
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,793
Whoa.

543
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,558
- What's going on?
- We're stopped.

544
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,756
Why are we stopped?

545
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,276
Keep them up there a few minutes.
Let them work it out.

546
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,915
You are the master.

547
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,310
Cohen, there's something
I wanna tell you.

548
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,358
All right. More advice.
I'm ready, bring it.

549
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,877
Was this all part of the plan?

550
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,955
Because it looks like it's working.

551
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,951
Yeah.

552
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,759
It was all part of the plan.

553
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,557
So are you gonna go?

554
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,398
Yeah. Thank you.

555
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,273
I got this for you.

556
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,719
It's all I could get with my tickets.

557
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,108
Thanks.

558
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,833
Hi, Summer.

559
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,159
What's going on?

560
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,878
Coop's stuck on the Ferris wheel...

561
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,157
...and I was looking for someone
to go on the Tilt-A-Whirl with me.

562
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,515
I'll go on it with you.

563
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,268
Okay. I may vomit.

564
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,271
I like those odds.

565
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,674
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

566
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,950
You had to get
the cheap Ferris wheel!

567
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,759
What kind of carnival is this, Cooper?

568
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,359
Okay.

569
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,759
Look...

570
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,273
I don't talk a lot about stuff...

571
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,159
...and I really don't trust people.

572
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,239
But I trust you.

573
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,951
And I want to make it, this, work.

574
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,830
No matter what. If we ever get down,
maybe we could talk about it.

575
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,878
- Who knows when that'll be?
- Please don't say that.

576
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,833
Maybe you just need something
to take your mind off of it.

577
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,230
Fifty feet in the air,
how do you expect me to...?

578
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,353
One more time.
