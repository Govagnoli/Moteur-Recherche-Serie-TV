1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,116
-Previously on The O. C.:
-When you were in Miami...

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,670
-... Marissa and I got drunk.
-You came on to her.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,398
-She threw herself at me.
-What should I think?

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,028
-I didn't hook up with him.
-I am a good mother.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,679
You're also an alcoholic.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,912
I may like my chardonnay,
but I am not gonna die alone.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,152
-And that's more than I can say for you!
-Cal!

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,709
It's about your father. He's dead.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,752
I can meet you right away.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,119
I want to. Now, I have a funeral
to go to in a couple of hours...

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,316
...so I gotta keep it brief.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,836
But the sooner the better.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,113
Thank you.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,872
-Hey.
-Hey.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,429
-Everything okay?
-Been better.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,998
-I'm sorry about everything.
-That's okay, sweetie.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,196
-He loved you very much.
-Y eah.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,749
-I'm gonna miss him.
-Need anything?

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,639
No, I'm looking for my cell-phone
charger. My battery's dead.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,597
There might be one in your dad's office.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,751
-I'm gonna get ready.
-All right.

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,154
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,390
-How you doing?
-Well, I was depressed.

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,471
Now I'm depressed and confused.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,673
-A rehab center. Where'd you get this?
-My dad's office.

26
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,115
I don't think he's trying to kick bagels.

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,716
I don't think it's for your dad.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,592
Why don't you tell me more
about your wife, about her history.

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,228
Well, Kirsten's always enjoyed
a glass of wine or two...

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,951
...but in the last few months,
it's changed. She's changed.

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,749
-Changed how?
-She switched to vodka for starters.

32
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,036
Last week she had a car accident.

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,590
And now I'm afraid, with the loss of
her father, things are gonna get worse.

34
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,274
I assume you'd want her
to have a residential treatment.

35
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,998
And as you can see, we provide...

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,152
...a confidential and peaceful
environment for recovery.

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,633
You know, doctor, l--
I might be overreacting.

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,279
I know how hard it is to accept.

39
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,076
We all wanna think we can get someone
we love through something like this.

40
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,156
She's not gonna come voluntarily.

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,232
Very few of our patients
check themselves in.

42
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,394
I'm getting ready.

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,913
My black dresses look like they should
be accessorized with a broomstick.

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,399
-Do you have anything I could borrow?
-It's a funeral, Mom, not a fashion show.

45
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,399
Sorry. Look, let me see
what I've got, okay.

46
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,118
-Wait. I can do it.
-No.

47
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,748
You've been through more than enough.

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,433
I didn't mean to be a bitch.

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,160
Apples and trees. You are my daughter.

50
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,232
Which means I must have something
that'll look great on you.

51
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,318
-Dad.
-Hey, kiddo.

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,597
Hey.

53
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,119
-Hey, Jules.
-Jimmy.

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,673
-What are you doing here?
-Think I'd leave you alone during this?

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,191
Well, I can see how you might,
but I'm....

56
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,432
I'm so sorry. I really am.

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,918
-It's really good to see you.
-Yeah. Really good.

58
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,797
Well, I'm sure it's been
a hard week, but...

59
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,757
...we'll get through it.

60
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,874
-Hey, sis.
-Hey.

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,588
Oh, it's so good to see you.

62
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,550
He said his heart thing was no big deal,
not worth flying home for.

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,992
He didn't wanna worry you.

64
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,913
-You were his little girl.
-I know.

65
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,550
And after all these years, I caused him
nothing but stress and anxiety.

66
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,076
Nothing made him more proud than
seeing you get your life together.

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,075
Me? The last time I saw him,
I told him he was gonna die alone.

68
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,516
-Hi.
-Hey, Cohen.

69
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,229
Captain Oats around?
I brought him some company.

70
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,152
Princess Sparkle, you're in my room.

71
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,550
Yeah. I figured Oats
would be pretty down...

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,235
...could use the companionship of
someone sweet and with shinier hair...

73
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,358
...that would just, you know,
be there for him.

74
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,829
Yeah. Well, the captain's pretty lucky.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,912
Well, if he gets fresh with her,
it's straight to the glue factory.

76
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,311
-Hi.
-Hi.

77
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,675
I know you and your grandpa were close.

78
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,673
-It's actually my mom I'm worried about.
-Your mom?

79
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,273
Yeah.

80
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,589
This morning I was in my dad's office,
and I found, like, a brochure for rehab.

81
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,713
Oh, my God.
Has she been drinking a lot?

82
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,158
Well, I mean, she's a Wasp living in
Orange County, so it's all relative, right?

83
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,589
I don't know. She has a glass
of wine at dinner, maybe two.

84
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,478
-Any more than that?
-That's the thing.

85
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,111
I've been so self-involved this past year,
I don't even know. I have no idea.

86
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,511
And I'm sure it's, you know,
at least partially my fault.

87
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,638
I know running away was really
hard on her last summer, and--

88
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,475
Cohen, no offense,
but you're being self-involved again.

89
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,829
I think this is bigger than you.

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,676
I should go put on my tie.
It always takes me a few tries.

91
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,073
Yeah.

92
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,029
I didn't think you got up this early.

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,111
Maybe I haven't been to sleep yet.

94
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,032
Something's come up.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,989
What's going on?

96
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,630
It's graduation time,
which always means big business.

97
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,429
I got a call from a couple of kids
who basically supply Garden Grove.

98
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,712
I'm real happy for you.

99
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,829
For us. It's gonna be huge,
like 1 5 grand.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,718
I'll give you half.

101
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,308
-And why would you do that?
-Because I need your help.

102
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,959
-Where the hell did you get that?
-Do you know how to use it?

103
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,918
I'm not, like, a sniper or anything.

104
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,071
Can you point it at somebody
like you mean it?

105
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,398
Then you get half.

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,274
Now...

107
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,390
...I definitely...

108
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,631
...need to get some sleep.

109
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,472
Thanks for coming.

110
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,398
Julie.

111
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,599
We are gathered here today to pay
our last respects to Caleb Nichol.

112
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,228
His loss is felt across
the county, across the--

113
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,436
Caleb Nichol was not
a man of many words.

114
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,715
He was, however, a brilliant man.
He leaves a legacy of possibility.

115
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,318
But his true achievement
were his children.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,470
He was a caring father,
a wonderful grandfather...

117
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,312
...a truly terrible father-in-law.

118
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,074
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

119
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,357
-...I will fear no evil.... "
-So...

120
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,672
...he may be gone,
but he won't soon be forgotten.

121
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,038
Rest in peace, Cal.

122
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,997
And if you can't do that...

123
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,311
...I'm sure heaven could use
a few more McMansions.

124
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,028
What are you doing here?

125
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,912
-I do work for a living.
-Yeah?

126
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,832
Hang out with me
and you won't have to.

127
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,712
Let me ask you a question.

128
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,792
Why don't you ever worry about,
like, calculus or Mayan history...

129
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,520
-...Iike a normal teenager?
-Bad parenting.

130
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,479
So it looks like everything's
gonna go down tonight...

131
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,870
-...and it's gonna go down here.
-What do you mean?

132
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,600
I needed a public place.
The last kid who sold to them...

133
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,320
...ended up with a tire iron
upside the head.

134
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,429
-Look, if you don't wanna do it--
-Look, I said I'm gonna do it, and I will.

135
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,795
But after this, I am done.

136
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,312
I figured if I didn't initiate,
you wouldn't talk to me.

137
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,311
Hailey, hey. No.

138
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,711
I'm sorry, I had my hands full
with Julie and Marissa.

139
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,316
-You don't hate me for bailing on you?
-People in glass houses, Hail.

140
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,278
-So you moved to Hawaii. How is it?
-It's fantastic.

141
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,876
-You would not believe the North Shore.
-So I've heard.

142
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,876
She's-- She's taking it pretty hard, huh?

143
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,318
I've never seen her like this.

144
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,956
We have bartenders
we're paying to do that.

145
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,670
-I don't like waiting in line.
-You know, honey, it's still early.

146
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,594
This thing's gonna going on for a while.
Maybe you wanna pace yourself.

147
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,079
Maybe I don't.

148
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,833
My father just died. Maybe you wanna
lay off the Kirsten drink count.

149
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,639
-Look, I know you're upset.
-You're right.

150
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,279
I am.

151
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,397
If it would help, I could take over
Kirsten watch for a while.

152
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,357
I don't know if anything's gonna help.

153
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,080
So then let her glower at me.
I'm used to it.

154
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,959
Unfortunately, so am I these days.

155
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,872
Thank you, Julie.

156
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,988
I have officially talked to every pillar
of the community. I'm sick of pillars.

157
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,958
You don't have everyone asking
if you burned down Caleb's home...

158
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,519
...and caused his heart attack.

159
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,433
Everyone's looking at me
like I'm the grieving stepdaughter.

160
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,114
-I don't think the guy could stand me.
-Where is Summer?

161
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,158
Is she smoking the salmon herself?

162
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,039
-You guys wanna hide in the pool house?
-Oh, so bad.

163
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,237
Mrs. Cohen, I thought
you might be hungry.

164
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,594
Oh, no thank you, Summer.

165
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,072
If my stepmother taught me anything,
it's to never drink on an empty stomach.

166
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,912
Thanks for the tip.

167
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,078
-Hey, Summer.
-Hey, Mr. C.

168
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,231
Boy, you really cleaned out
the buffet, huh?

169
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,109
-Well, I have extra if you want any.
-I am powerless before a whitefish.

170
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,159
Could you do me a little favor? This thing
is gonna be going on for a little while...

171
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,232
...and, you know, Seth's been through
a lot the last couple days.

172
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,393
It might be a great idea if you could get
him out of the house for a little while.

173
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,237
-Yeah. Sure thing.
-Thanks.

174
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,956
-Hey.
-Hey.

175
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,715
Funeral food is so depressing. I thought
maybe we could go get some chili fries...

176
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,950
...and maybe stop by the Bait Shop
or something.

177
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,872
Good idea.

178
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,999
Hey, Ryan, you don't think
Trey will be there, do you?

179
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,513
No, he's on day shifts.

180
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,511
Be fine, promise.

181
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,952
Do I still even work here?

182
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,839
I should find out for tax purposes.

183
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,516
You've gotta be kidding me.

184
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,553
Great.

185
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,996
Hey. Man, I'm so sorry
about your grandfather.

186
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,593
-Thanks.
-What are you doing here?

187
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,150
-I came by to pick up a paycheck.
-Paychecks are handed out on Mondays.

188
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,153
-Even I know that, and I've been fired.
-Oh, yeah?

189
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,673
When was that?

190
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,714
You guys are dressed up.

191
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,030
We just came from
my grandfather's funeral.

192
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,033
Yeah. Well, he was probably pretty old.

193
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,399
Ready, Trey?

194
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,278
Bye, party people.

195
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,318
You wanna go grab us some seats?

196
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,436
-Yeah, we'll get drinks.
-Okay.

197
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,919
Come on.

198
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,714
It's bad enough this has to go down in
the place I work at, but with Ryan here?

199
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,556
Afraid you're gonna look
bad in front of Marissa?

200
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,792
No, I just think we should go
someplace else. The pier, whatever.

201
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,635
It's too late. Our friends are already
on their way. Is it loaded?

202
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,357
Okay, Coop, you wanna tell me what
that was about between you and Trey?

203
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,476
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know...

204
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,279
...gamma rays of hate
shooting out of your eyeballs.

205
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,955
I mean, problems with Ryan,
a weird tension with Trey.

206
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,669
One girl, two brothers.
It's all a little Legends of the Fall.

207
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,592
-I never saw that one.
-Hey, Marissa.

208
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,079
Hi.

209
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,112
I guess if I still worked here
I could make the drinks myself.

210
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,437
-So how are you, man?
-Not good. My head's all over the place.

211
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,160
I still haven't had a chance
to talk to my dad.

212
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,151
Two Y oo-hoos and a couple of
smoothie chasers, please.

213
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,752
And what about you? I mean, how's--?
How's work? How's the family?

214
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,829
Well, actually, not so good.

215
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,837
You know, you left, boy,
just before things got really crazy.

216
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,756
-Yeah, well, that was the idea, I guess.
-Sandy.

217
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,678
I need your help.

218
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,953
Excuse me.

219
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,350
For God's sake, Kirsten,
at least use a glass.

220
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,556
For God's sake, Sandy,
just leave me alone.

221
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,792
It's been a long day, and I bet
you could probably use a little sleep.

222
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,713
-I feel okay.
-Come on. Let's just go to bed.

223
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,075
Get your hands off me!

224
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,393
Are you happy?

225
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,594
-Kirsten.
-I'm okay.

226
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,388
Jimmy, I'm okay.

227
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,038
I got you.

228
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,951
You got the money?

229
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,597
Have your taste, then we're all good.

230
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,750
The speed and E are in the bag.
Same quality.

231
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,390
Actually, we don't have enough
to cover the coke.

232
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,472
How about we set up a payment plan.
We pay when we feel like it.

233
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,837
-Yo, what's up? We had a deal.
-We're renegotiating.

234
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,470
What are you gonna do about it,
you little Newport beyotch?

235
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,758
-Who's the bitch now?
-What the hell do you think you're doing?

236
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,798
Give me my money, get in your
rice rocket, and drive away.

237
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,678
You're gonna have to shoot me.

238
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,599
Get down!

239
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,633
-Everybody okay?
-Marissa.

240
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,756
Oh, my gosh.

241
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,717
It's just broken glass.

242
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,719
Wait.

243
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,554
Hold on.

244
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,870
I can answer all of your questions now.

245
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,518
You already have.

246
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,875
There was only one answer
to that question.

247
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,359
Where is she?

248
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,353
- Yes, I know why you came back.
-Sleeping it off.

249
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,591
How long has this been going on?

250
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,273
T oo long.

251
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,916
You know, last night sealed the deal.

252
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,799
She's getting help,
whether she wants it or not.

253
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,438
Speaking of help, how can l?

254
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,394
Well, I'm gonna need
to talk to the boys privately.

255
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,358
-I don't know what they know.
-I can get her out of the house.

256
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,397
Maybe a day at the spa.

257
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,393
-Thanks, Hail.
-Yeah.

258
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,757
-Hey. I had a feeling I'd see you--
-Can l....

259
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,751
-Can I come in?
-Yeah. Yeah.

260
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,480
-You want something to drink--?
-What happened last night?

261
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,952
I was helping Jess out.
It got a little out of control, man.

262
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,314
Story of your life, right?

263
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,758
Yeah, but that was it, man.

264
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,196
-I told her I'm done.
-Done. I heard that before too.

265
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,511
I know, but Jess turned out
to be a little crazier than I expected.

266
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,796
Really? You met her face down in a pool.

267
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,349
I screwed up. I know that.
What do you want me to say?

268
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,715
I don't want you to say anything...

269
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,994
...anymore. We gave it a shot.
We tried to make it work.

270
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,993
-I swear to God, Ryan--
-I want you out of Newport.

271
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,835
Come on, man.

272
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,910
We're brothers. We're blood.

273
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,869
-Granted, I got more of Dad's bad luck--
-You gotta go, Trey.

274
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,159
Okay.

275
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,716
I'll be gone first thing
in the morning.

276
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,638
I figured you hadn't learned
how to brew coffee yet.

277
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,952
Okay, marrying Caleb didn't exactly
turn me into a domestic goddess.

278
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,272
I brought your favorite powdered-sugar
doughnuts from 7-Eleven.

279
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,634
Thank you.

280
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,433
So listen...

281
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,593
...I was hoping you, me, Marissa take
the boat out and sail to Catalina today.

282
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,909
Oh, well, except Marissa won't be up
till close to sundown, so....

283
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,198
Well, then how about you and I go?

284
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,159
You and me. Grab some lobsters...

285
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,437
...dead ones, of course,
hang out, have lunch.

286
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,119
We haven't done that in like a million
years, since before we were married.

287
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,273
Okay. I'll write Marissa a note.

288
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,428
-Hey.
-Hey.

289
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,239
-I was making some cereal. Want some?
-No, I'm good, thanks.

290
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,392
We got a lot of leftovers,
and food is arriving by the truckload.

291
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,518
Yeah, it's the silver lining of any funeral.

292
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,033
-How's Mom? Is she up yet?
-Yeah.

293
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,839
She's spending the day at a spa,
getting a little R and R.

294
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,958
Well, that's good.
She could use a day to relax.

295
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,069
She hasn't really been too
mom-esque lately.

296
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,957
Well, that's true.

297
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,832
She's suffering right now.

298
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,719
Well, she was really close
to grandpa, so....

299
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,632
Oh, it's bigger than that, Seth.

300
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,710
Your mother has a drinking problem.

301
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,757
She needs help.

302
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,915
You mean like that rehab brochure
I found you just forgot to mention?

303
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,435
I've been waiting for the right time...

304
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,197
-...and hoping I can do this myself.
-Maybe we can.

305
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,035
So she's drinking. We ask her to stop.
We don't have to send her away.

306
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,158
She can't stop. She's tried.

307
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,438
There's a doctor coming here
this afternoon.

308
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,351
-To help us stage an intervention.
-What?

309
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,749
Is this like an Afterschool Special?

310
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,912
Her dad died. She's sad.
She's having a few drinks.

311
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,230
This has been going on for a long time.

312
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,470
-The car accident she had.
-Yeah?

313
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,119
Did you know she'd been drinking?

314
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,033
No, I didn't, because you never told me.

315
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,237
You never told me anything,
and you expect me to help ship her off.

316
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,549
We're trying to help her.

317
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,870
How do I know you didn't
cause her to drink?

318
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,878
Something weird has been going on.

319
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,758
I get that you're upset.
I'm upset too.

320
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,071
Well, if your way of showing that
you're upset is shipping her off...

321
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,037
...I'm not gonna be a part of it.

322
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,997
You are a part of it.

323
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,072
You wanna run away again,
get in your boat and sail away?

324
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,037
Your mother needs you.

325
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,515
-Come in, Ryan. You should hear this.
-Yeah.

326
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,399
Apparently, mom's a drunk
and today's the intervention...

327
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,994
...so plan your afternoon accordingly.

328
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,869
I can talk to him, tell him you're doing
the right thing, because you are.

329
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,189
Thanks...

330
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,831
...but that's my job.

331
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,109
Come in.

332
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,432
Hey. How's your head?

333
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,716
Okay. It's just a scratch.

334
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,997
Well, I was thinking, after the past
few days you've had...

335
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,390
...some pancakes
and some serious sunbathing...

336
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,950
...could be just what the doctor ordered.
That is, if I had a Ph.D.

337
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,712
You don't have to take care of me.

338
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,872
You kidding? After that scene
from Scarface we just lived through...

339
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,712
...I could use a short stack, stat.

340
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,678
All right. Well, I appreciate it.

341
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,400
Good. So we'll go...

342
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,990
...just as soon as you tell me
what's going on.

343
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,953
The weird bruise on your neck,
and a bad excuse from you.

344
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,949
Weird tension with Trey, and then you
don't even bother to make up an excuse.

345
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,758
Marissa, please don't lie to me.

346
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,390
I'm your best friend,
and I know something happened.

347
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,437
Please just tell me what's going on.

348
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,392
Coop?

349
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,558
Coop?

350
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,389
Oh, sweetie.

351
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,240
Maybe I should've told you earlier.

352
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,038
I don't know.

353
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,711
They left that chapter out of the manual.

354
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,829
How long would she go away for?

355
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,355
Well, as long as it takes.

356
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,909
Months, maybe.

357
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,238
This isn't....

358
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,394
This isn't supposed to happen to us.
We're not that family.

359
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,400
Every family's got their issues.

360
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,352
This is ours.

361
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,229
I just don't think I can do it.
Not to Mom.

362
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,438
I get it.

363
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,788
That's the doctor from the clinic.

364
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,551
We'll be downstairs.

365
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,348
I'm sorry.

366
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,191
-How you feeling?
-Better, thanks.

367
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,830
It's just what I needed. That deep-tissue
massage worked miracles.

368
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,399
That's good.

369
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,790
We should see if they
want us to pick up food.

370
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,949
We should probably just go home.
You know, there's a lot of leftovers.

371
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,191
Hello. Anyone home?

372
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,078
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

373
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,754
Why don't you come to the kitchen.
I need to talk to you.

374
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,355
You're acting awfully mysterious.

375
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,751
Oh, I didn't know we had company.

376
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,638
Hi, I'm Dr. Kenneth Woodruff.

377
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,517
I'm a counselor at the Suriak Drug
and Alcohol Abuse Rehabilitation Center.

378
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,800
Okay, does someone wanna
tell me what's going on?

379
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,997
Your family requested I be here
to help them lead an intervention.

380
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,358
-What for? Why?
-We are all here...

381
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,751
...because we are worried that
you have an addiction to alcohol.

382
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,795
Each person here wants to share
their concern for you.

383
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,274
Well, that's very nice of everybody,
but not necessary.

384
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,676
Sandy, you go first.

385
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,156
I' m so sorry, honey.

386
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,276
How hard this must be for you to hear.

387
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,473
-I don't want you to hurt yourself.
-Don't you think you're overreacting?

388
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,596
I mean, everybody's overreacting.

389
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,513
Hailey, please. Now you.

390
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,273
Kiks...

391
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,394
...you know our history.

392
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,632
Mom battled it, and you know if it
was me, you'd do the same thing.

393
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,153
I don't know that.

394
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,595
All the time you were partying
and doing drugs...

395
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,351
...I just encouraged you to make
better choices. I didn't lock you up.

396
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,919
Ryan.

397
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,793
Oh, don't you say a word.
I let you into this house.

398
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,599
Yeah, you did, because my own mom
couldn't take care of me.

399
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,357
Because she wouldn't get help
even though I asked her to.

400
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,798
I don't wanna see that happen again
to someone I love.

401
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,629
I don't know who you are
or what you're doing here...

402
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,157
...but I am not going.

403
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,438
Mom, please. You gotta do this.

404
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,275
Whether you have a dark complexion,
a light complexion. If you--

405
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,749
--earnings per share
by 12 cents to 15 cents....

406
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,954
Aren't you glad you got to come back
for all this fun?

407
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,637
Actually, I am.

408
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,835
I'll put the bag in your car.

409
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,636
I'll see you soon, sis.

410
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,836
I' m so sorry that I put you both
through this.

411
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,390
-Just get better.
-I will.

412
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,437
You gonna be okay?

413
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,553
Yeah, I'll be fine.

414
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,554
Don't worry about Dad.
We'll set up a stage in the living room.

415
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,350
Give him a mike and the music
to Starlight Express.

416
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,999
I got the takeout menus covered.

417
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,038
-I'll order. I' m good with the phone.
-We'll be fine, really.

418
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,360
I love you both so much.

419
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,991
All right, come on.
You owe me a rematch.

420
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,472
Well, James, other than those
disgusting mussels you made me eat...

421
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,119
...this was actually pretty fun.

422
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,271
Well, you're entitled to a little fun.

423
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,351
Oh, it's just...

424
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,272
-...I feel so guilty.
-About what?

425
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,318
Smiling the day after
your husband's funeral?

426
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,152
Well, let's-- Let's face it.
That marriage wasn't exactly--

427
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,992
What we had?

428
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,071
Nothing ever will be.

429
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,711
What if I decided to stay? What if,
you know, we gave it another shot?

430
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,435
We're both older and wiser now.

431
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,159
Well, I'm certainly wiser.

432
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,719
Going somewhere?

433
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,835
I don't know where I'm going,
but I'm going.

434
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,470
-We could take off together.
-Yeah, Jess, and where would we go?

435
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,028
Vegas.

436
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,749
You a gambler, Trey?

437
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,398
I hooked up with you.

438
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,516
I'm gonna go home and pack...

439
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,989
...steal my stepdad's Beamer...

440
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,071
...and I'll be back at 8.

441
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,750
This floating in the pool thing
is not helping.

442
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,069
No, I hear you.

443
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,710
But neither was video games
or the wisdom of Chuck Klosterman.

444
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,075
You know, we should
get out of the house.

445
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,640
Hit up a old-age home,
some shuffleboard action.

446
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,360
I'm not really in the mood
for old people.

447
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,155
IMAX movie?
Something with sharks, huh?

448
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,311
I don't really like sharks.

449
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,113
The way things have been going,
I bet that's Oliver.

450
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,156
-Hey.
-Hey. Can I talk to you alone?

451
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,953
-What's going on? Everything okay?
-No.

452
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,239
Look, I'm really sorry to pile on
in terms of, like, the worst news ever.

453
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,470
Hey, it's okay. What's the matter?

454
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,632
When you and Ryan were in Miami,
Trey and Marissa....

455
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,913
Yeah?

456
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,915
He attacked her, Seth.

457
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,076
-What do you mean?
-He forced himself on her. He tried to--

458
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,758
But she didn't tell Ryan...

459
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,957
...because, you know, he's Ryan,
and who knows what he would do.

460
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,357
-Well, he has to know.
-You think?

461
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,432
Yeah, look, if last night wasn't
proof enough, Trey's crazy.

462
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,353
What if he attacks you next?
I can't not tell him.

463
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,310
But how are you gonna tell him?

464
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,189
Welcome.

465
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,349
I'll show you to your room, but first
I need to check your bag, Kirsten.

466
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,910
It's standard procedure.

467
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,270
Oh, it's a good-sized bed.

468
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,189
Oh, nice sheets. High thread count.

469
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,356
Nice TV. A lot of channels. I'll bet
you get a lot of reading done here.

470
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,393
Yeah.

471
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,433
Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen,
we're having a meeting for new guests.

472
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,478
What time is it over? I wanna
make sure I'm home when you call.

473
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,996
Actually, she won't be able
to make any phone calls for 72 hours.

474
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,831
It's detox.

475
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,958
-Could you give us just a minute?
-Yeah.

476
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,599
I'm so sorry, Sandy.

477
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,874
What I said to you, put you through.

478
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,759
Now, we can bend this thing.

479
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,110
It doesn't mean it's gonna break.

480
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,359
-Hey.
-Hey.

481
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,512
We should probably go.
IMAX movies have previews?

482
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,558
Maybe we should skip the movie,
actually.

483
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,957
Do you wanna sit down, maybe,
or stand up or whatever?

484
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,678
What's going on?

485
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,955
My dad just called. He said
my mom just landed at the place.

486
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,111
-It's really beautiful, and--
-That's good.

487
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,113
Yeah, but also, something more.

488
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,511
But before I tell you, you gotta promise
you're gonna stay calm.

489
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,116
You're not gonna get all
old-school Ryan Atwood.

490
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,750
-What is it?
-Well, it's upsetting.

491
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,638
Yeah, we covered that.

492
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,798
So I know what happened
with Trey and Marissa.

493
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,275
Like, what really happened.

494
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,273
What do you mean?

495
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,754
I guess when we were away, he sort of,
like, attacked her or something...

496
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,672
...and kind of forced himself on her.

497
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,559
I mean, nothing happened.
She fought him off. But that's--

498
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,950
That's why he's got the cut on his head.

499
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,678
All year...

500
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,479
...I have tried to be a different person.

501
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,313
I can't do that anymore.

502
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,392
Wait, Ryan. What are you gonna do?

503
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,550
I'm gonna settle this with Trey.

504
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,113
Once and for all.

505
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,358
What are you guys doing?

506
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,512
Oh, well, we thought
we'd have dinner as a family.

507
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,834
Okay.

508
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,150
And breakfast.

509
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,557
What's going on here?

510
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,869
Well, your father's going to stay with us
while we get settled...

511
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,235
...and then maybe after that.

512
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,912
If that's okay with you.

513
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,150
And with Kaitlin
coming home from school...

514
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,834
...we were talking about taking
a family trip maybe.

515
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,434
Again, if that's okay with you.

516
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,636
Anything to have you back, Dad.

517
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,192
Thanks, kiddo.

518
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,550
I'd really love for us to be a family again.

519
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,159
The Coopers making a comeback.
Who'd have thunk it?

520
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,231
Oh, sorry. One sec.

521
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,598
-Hey, can I call you back?
-Actually, no. There's a problem.

522
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,429
-What's going on?
-We're going to Trey's. You're closer.

523
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,795
-Maybe you can stop him.
-What are you talking about?

524
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,871
Ryan knows.

525
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,352
-Hey, Ry.
-I know what happened.

526
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,509
I know what happened
with you and Marissa.

527
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,716
How could you, man?

528
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,350
-I would've done anything for you.
-Look, man...

529
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,511
-...I was stoned.
-lt wasn't my idea, Trey.

530
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,797
-I didn't wanna steal that car.
-Yeah, well, I went away for it...

531
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,111
-...and you got the good life.
-So you had to hurt her, huh?

532
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,872
No, no. Hey.

533
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,076
Okay. Listen, man.
You're gonna calm down.

534
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,390
You're gonna calm down
right now, okay?

535
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,516
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

536
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,511
Is that how this ends?

537
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,391
How this ends is up to you...

538
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,028
...and whether or not
you walk away right now.

539
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,156
Walk away.

540
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,674
Oh, my God. Stop it. You're killing him.

541
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,239
Trey, get off of him, please!

542
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,754
Please, stop it. You're killing him.

543
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,154
Stop it!

544
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,319
You're gonna kill him.
