00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,516
Your mother has a drinking problem.
She needs help.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,954
Mom, please. You gotta do this.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,997
Who knew my new PlayStation idol
would be your new girlf...

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,115
- Your new...
- Friend.

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,589
- I would love to go to Cabo with you.
- Cabo?

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,795
I know about you and my dad.

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,359
My dad just got out
of a marriage...

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,511
...and I don't want him
rushing back into another.

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,477
The board is watching you,
waiting for you to screw up...

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,232
...and you're screwing up.

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,073
What's it gonna be?
Hospital or Matt?

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,629
- You and Marissa are gonna be okay?
- Yeah, of course.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,069
He's leaning forward,
indicating all focus is on her.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,391
See how her palms face up?
She's open to what he's communicating.

<i>Star</i> magazine. " What Stars'
Body Language Is Really Saying."

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,353
Well, I've talked to the guy...

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,592
...and what Ryan is saying
is he and Sadie are just taking it slow.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,079
Oh, no. Bodies don't lie.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,754
I'm sounding out
a hot-new-couple alert.

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,118
- Act like you know nothing.
- I don't.

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,471
Hey, so I think we're gonna head out.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,029
- All right, we'll go with you.
- No, just stay here.

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,191
I'll get him home safe.

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,629
All right, so they're into each other.

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,711
You know what?
I'm actually happy for them.

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,472
You don't feel weird about Marissa?

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,870
Even I feel a little weird
about Marissa for you.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,635
Nope. I'd feel weird about Marissa
if I saw Marissa.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,519
Thought she was staying
at your house while your parents...

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,036
...are hooking up on the high seas.
- She's been sleeping at the trailer.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,599
This breakup has hit her hard.

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,992
She said she needs time to process
her feelings and heal in solitude.

34
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,516
- Or party with 200 sweaty teens.
- What?

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,355
Oh, my God.

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,229
- So if the body doesn't lie...
- Then it's saying "ew."

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,151
"Ew" or "touch my pooper"?

38
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,554
Coop. It's me. Your best friend.

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,790
You know,
the one that you tell everything to.

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,952
- Dude, my head.
- Well, what time is it?

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,429
I know it's not big in there.
My voice travels.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,515
- Okay, you gotta hide.
- What?

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,240
- You live in a trailer.
- Coop.

44
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,472
I'm coming, Sum.
Here, take these and... And this.

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,278
- Go.
- Coop.

46
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,716
My hand doesn't remotely hurt.

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,394
- Coop.
- Hey.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,835
Hey. Looking good, Coop.

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,510
Very Kate Moss, pre <i>Vanity Fair</i> cover.

50
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,958
What you doing?

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,072
You know, nothing.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,710
- Did you have a good time last night?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,911
Synapses are really firing, huh?

54
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,958
I think I have a bit of a head cold.

55
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,873
As long as you don't have
any other infectious diseases.

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,594
What?

57
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,109
Hang on.

58
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,395
Hey.

59
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,638
Hi, Mom.

60
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,869
- Hello.
- <i>Hey.</i>

61
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,917
- How's my girl?
- Hey, Daddy.

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,799
- We're back from our trip.
- Did you guys have a good time?

63
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,713
It was wonderful.
Can you have dinner with us tonight?

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,313
Fine. What time?

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,913
Don't sound so excited.

66
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,830
- Eight-ish.
- Yeah, perfect. Bye.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,036
Okay. Bye.

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,633
- My dad.
- My mom.

69
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,552
- Dinner?
- Eight.

70
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,075
You go get dressed,
I'll drive you to school...

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,151
...we can talk about that
and other stuff.

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,639
Okay, give me a minute.

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,268
I think you're gonna need
a little bit more than that.

74
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,155
- Come here. It's cherry.
- Look, you gotta go.

75
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,273
It's wake and bake, baby.
Always cures a hangover.

76
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,071
Hey, what's up, man?

77
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,117
Someone's in a chipper mood
this morning.

78
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,590
Yeah, you know, I had a really good time
last night. I like that place.

79
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,830
The Bait Shop?
We should hang out there more.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,479
- Really?
- Yeah.

81
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,473
Maybe...
Maybe tonight. Sadie likes the DJ.

82
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,154
She... She kind of wants to get me
on the dance floor.

83
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,673
- No.
- What?

84
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,638
You're the one who's always telling me
to loosen up. Go out.

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,110
Tense, tightly wound, shut in.
That's all I want out of you. Okay?

86
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,919
It's kind of a Boo Radley shape.
Far from The Bait Shop...

87
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,311
...and all its unsavory characters.
- Hey. Sandy, what's going on?

88
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,115
- Good mood, huh?
- Yeah, well...

89
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,713
Things must be working out.

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,156
- Dad, Ryan just smiled.
- Well, she seems great.

91
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,631
- Everything okay with you?
- Yep, just work. Not to worry.

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,315
All right. Well, listen, fellows,
love to chat, gotta get over to Sadie's.

93
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,631
Got a few minutes before school,
but cheer up, okay?

94
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,353
Hey, handsome men.

95
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,589
- Where?
- Where?

96
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,069
I just made the same joke as my Dad.
A bad sign.

97
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,073
Your father happens to be hilarious.
It's just harder to tell.

98
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,118
Well, then it's a good thing
that we have a date tonight.

99
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,315
- What?
- Romantic dinner by the water...

100
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,313
...followed by an even more
romantic walk on the beach...

101
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,833
...followed by...
- Nothing.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,150
Followed by nothing.
You will walk and eat.

103
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,676
Oh, jeez, I'm afraid l...
I can't even do that.

104
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,274
- You're canceling?
- Postponing.

105
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,718
I wanna be in the right frame of mind
to eat and walk with you. I'm sorry.

106
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,349
Something's wrong?

107
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,154
It'll all be fine.

108
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,356
So Dad's been working a lot
lately, huh?

109
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,955
Look, I'll be your date.

110
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,634
We haven't gotten a chance
to hang out in a while.

111
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,996
- I thought you forgot you had a mother.
- Hey.

112
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,232
Lay off the guilt. I said I'm in.
I just get to pick the movie.

113
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,834
So we're a couple thousand feet short
of a McMansion...

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,752
...but hopefully someone will take it.

115
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,471
- With that sales pitch, who could resist?
- Are you saying you find me irresistible?

116
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,799
Paint smell, realtor on the way over.
It's romantic and all, but...

117
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,748
Yeah. Plus I should probably
get to school too.

118
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,273
- Okay.
- No, no, wait.

119
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,113
- No.
- We can pick this up tonight.

120
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,511
I could give you a tour
of the pool house.

121
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,830
Yeah, we'll see
if you can close the deal.

122
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,278
Gotta go.

123
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,557
You didn't mention a word to Ryan?

124
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,029
Spoil his good mood?
He skipped out of the kitchen.

125
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,998
Atwood skipping?
Now there's a disturbing and odd visual.

126
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,516
Picture this one: Ryan dancing.
That's what this woman does to him.

127
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,753
If we wanna keep this skip in his step,
we gotta keep Volchok off his radar.

128
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,189
You play.

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,114
Volchok is Atwood's kryptonite.
He'll totally Hulk out.

130
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,590
You're mixing comic-book metaphors.
You think we can keep Marissa quiet?

131
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,830
She can barely put words together
these days.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,560
- She's such a wordsmith.
- What does she see in that guy?

133
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,316
- He's so dirty and greasy.
- He's got good abs. Women like abs.

134
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,869
I got a six-pack myself, I know.

135
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,315
Oh, Cohen, those are your ribs.

136
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,431
Well, listen,
let's just not tell anybody anything.

137
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,672
All right. Heads down,
lips sealed, smooth sailing.

138
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,798
He's also got really defined triceps.
I like that.

139
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,676
I'm gonna get right to it.

140
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,076
I talked to Griffin.

141
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,834
You're firing me?

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,355
Yes. I'm firing you.

143
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,476
I have no choice.

144
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,471
It's for the good of the hospital.

145
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,152
What kind of garbage excuse is that?

146
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,278
- The truthful kind.
- Yeah. When it's convenient for you.

147
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,872
Every time you need to do
something that makes you feel bad...

148
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,749
...you're doing it for the hospital.
- It's either you or the hospital.

149
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,388
Griffin will not move forward
unless you're gone.

150
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,552
You don't even see what's happening.
He's making me the fall guy.

151
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,154
There's no need to pedal
in conspiracy theories, Matt.

152
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,788
- You are no angel.
- Neither is Griffin.

153
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,157
He's been taking kickbacks
from vendors for years.

154
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,517
- I like to know who I'm in business with.
- Those are bold accusations.

155
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,673
I can back them up. And I'll be happy
to share everything I know about him...

156
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,912
...and you to whoever will listen.

157
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,751
Thanks for the heads up.

158
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,432
- I know I'm doing the right thing.
- You think things are complicated?

159
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,996
You haven't seen anything yet, boss.

160
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,797
A little champagne
won't hurt you girls.

161
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,436
- It is a toast.
- How often do we get engaged?

162
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,919
Don't answer that.

163
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,589
- Engaged?
- You guys are engaged?

164
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,352
I'm so happy for you.

165
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,954
- Thank you, baby.
- Really, you are?

166
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,634
I mean, you may be
Mrs. Cooper-Nichol-Cooper-Roberts...

167
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,791
...but if you make Dad happy...
- She does.

168
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,837
- I do.
- Then I'm happy.

169
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,192
Marissa, how about some champagne?

170
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,874
Sure.

171
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,436
Marissa, do you have anything to add?

172
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,397
One sec.

173
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,234
Hey. Yeah.

174
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,153
You are? Okay, bye.

175
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,719
Congrats.

176
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,430
Will you excuse me for a moment?

177
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,674
- l... Me too.
- Marissa.

178
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,871
Where do you think you're going,
young lady?

179
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,235
I gotta go, Mom.
My friend called, he needs me.

180
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,674
I need you.

181
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,308
I don't have to tell you
how important this is for us.

182
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,790
Yeah, well, don't worry, Mom. I'm not
gonna screw up your golden ticket.

183
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,194
I don't know if I'm a fan
of yakuza films.

184
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,719
It was an interesting movie.
But a fun night.

185
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,189
Yeah. I would say anytime
you get to watch a guy...

186
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,193
...rip off his arm and continue
fighting, that's a good night.

187
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,272
- I didn't understand the other fellow.
- The guy that produced...

188
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,954
...the ball of energy
and then destroyed the world?

189
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,031
I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

190
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,795
You remember
when I took you to <i>Fantasia?</i>

191
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,318
Because I do.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,479
Sorry you didn't like the movie.

193
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,835
Oh, it was worth it
to spend some time with you.

194
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,793
I've missed you.

195
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,155
You wanna do it again?
You want a second date?

196
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,470
Yeah. But I get to pick the activity.

197
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,358
- Sure.
- Tomorrow night?

198
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,556
I have an idea already.

199
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,318
- Hey.
- We have a major problem.

200
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,994
Marissa just bailed
on our parents' engagement party...

201
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,755
...to skank out with the surf Nazi.
- Your dad and Julie got engaged?

202
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,115
You kind of buried
the lead there, Summer.

203
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,510
- Julie and Dr. Roberts?
- <i>We got bigger fish here.</i>

204
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,875
Marissa's on a slut spiral.
We need to stop her.

205
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,634
- It's a little out of my league.
- <i>I know. We need Ryan.</i>

206
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,110
- The code of silence has been lifted.
- I'll talk to him.

207
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,157
But he's been in such a good mood.

208
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,475
So this is the pool house?

209
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,715
You interested in making an offer?

210
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,628
It's a little small.
But it's got great views.

211
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,319
What? Locked?

212
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,074
When did this door get a lock on it?

213
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,630
- Little busy, Seth.
- You're not the only one.

214
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,314
I don't wanna have to tell you this
through the door...

215
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,550
...but Marissa's been hooking up
with Volchok.

216
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,111
Oh, hey.

217
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,151
Oh, hey.

218
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,191
- Sadie, I didn't realize...
- Yeah. Good night, Seth.

219
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,679
- Good night.
- Call me, okay?

220
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,478
Yeah.

221
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,952
- Guess I ruined the mood, huh?
- Just a lot.

222
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,200
When I put the locks on,
I thought I solved the problem.

223
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,716
You know me. When I have information
to disseminate, nothing can stop me.

224
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,713
- Not walls, not locks.
- Not women?

225
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,154
So, what are you gonna do?

226
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,959
Well, reschedule with Sadie
and go back to her place.

227
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,439
No, I meant about Marissa.

228
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,397
What do you mean,
what am I gonna do?

229
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,994
Well, Summer seems to think
this Volchok guy...

230
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,037
...is not exactly a beacon
of morality.

231
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,792
Not my problem. Not my girlfriend.

232
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,076
Well, I know. Two coffees.

233
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,435
Look, man, she makes her own choices,
so do I.

234
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,158
I choose Sadie's tonight.

235
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,594
You're so Zen these days.

236
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,955
It's simultaneously inspiring
and disconcerting.

237
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,310
Just feeling good, man.
Just feeling good.

238
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,869
Cheers.

239
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,034
I can't believe
you're getting married. Again.

240
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,077
You make it seem
like an everyday occurrence.

241
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,595
- It almost is.
- This time it's gonna stick.

242
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,193
It just feels real.

243
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,557
Not everyone can have that
Kirsten-and-Sandy relationship.

244
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,915
That bionic, Kevlar-wrapped,
robo-marriage...

245
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,753
...that can withstand
anything you throw at it.

246
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,031
Well, you've seemed happier
than I've seen you in a long time.

247
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,557
Neil has mellowed me.

248
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,039
No more manipulative bitch...

249
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,031
...no more scheming,
no double-crossing.

250
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,952
Which will be disappointing to some.

251
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,917
Not for Dr. Roberts.

252
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,073
You know, we both just
kind of found each other...

253
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,629
...right at the moment
when we really needed someone.

254
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,076
- There's no agenda.
- He does have a palatial estate.

255
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,755
Kirsten, if he wanted to live together
in this trailer, I'd do it.

256
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,719
Not that I'm offering.

257
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,592
Real classy, Gus.

258
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,274
It's them Big Gulps.
They go right through me.

259
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,714
Sneak up on me too.

260
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,189
- That's a nice final image.
- What's going on?

261
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,914
Oh, my God.

262
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,749
You the new tenant?

263
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,273
Nice to meet you.

264
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,069
We really need to get you out of here.

265
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,434
Hi.

266
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,919
Hi. What's up?

267
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,308
Missed you in class.

268
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,153
- Yeah, there was traffic.
- We had that test today.

269
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,149
That was today?

270
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,674
Thanks. Gotta go.

271
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,792
Totally and completely untrue.
And if Matt tried to print that...

272
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,872
...I'll sue him for libel.
- He seemed pretty sure of himself.

273
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,838
If it wasn't for me, your firm
would be belly-up right now...

274
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,389
...which is why I don't appreciate
your accusing me.

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,718
I'm not accusing anybody of anything.

276
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,873
And forgive me for saying, Henry,
but you seem a touch defensive.

277
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,551
The only business that I am in
is the business of helping people.

278
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,188
I would like to believe
that we are partners in that.

279
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,436
You give me your word,
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

280
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,070
Sandy, I didn't become a doctor
to get rich.

281
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,276
You have my word.

282
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,709
Thank you. You did a wonderful job.
Thank you.

283
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,918
Bye.

284
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,438
I'm from the Philippines.

285
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,035
Oh, well, then...

286
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,079
Wow, Coop.
You make a really good hood ornament.

287
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,958
- Funny.
- I know.

288
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,190
- Are you getting drunk?
- More like staying drunk.

289
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,789
- Oh, good plan.
- I can't deal with this right now.

290
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,350
Well, you're gonna have to.
Because now, Coop, we're sisters.

291
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,238
Right. Which means you're not my mom.

292
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,114
I know about Volchok.

293
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,068
Saw you at The Bait Shop, I know you're
shacking up with him at the trailer park.

294
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,115
Well, aren't you
a regular Veronica Mars?

295
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,078
- Way to solve this weeks' mystery.
- What has gotten into you?

296
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,151
- Since l-know-who has.
- What do you care?

297
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,313
You have Seth, Ryan's got
his new girlfriend, Johnny's gone.

298
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,037
What difference does it make
what I do?

299
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,193
- I'm not hurting anyone.
- You're just the saddest girl in the world.

300
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,557
Grow up. Get over yourself.
Take a shower.

301
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,631
Fine. Take your little emo boyfriend...

302
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,030
...drive off in your Beemer,
go home to daddy's mansion.

303
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,397
Oh, yeah? Go with Volchok to one of his
heavy metal vomit parties...

304
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,357
...and listen to heavy metal and vomit.

305
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,273
- Wow, you're being so lame.
- Not as lame as you.

306
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,237
- Fine. Bye.
- Later.

307
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,237
- What are you doing?
- Taking what's mine.

308
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,913
You were to turn over your key.

309
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,469
- You're trespassing.
- These are my personal files.

310
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,552
Which your office conveniently
forgot to send. I'm taking them.

311
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,870
- You're not.
- What are you gonna do, arrest me?

312
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,474
Fight me? You act
like you got something to hide.

313
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,032
- You're acting like a child.
- lf you're sure I don't have a case...

314
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,111
...you shouldn't care
if I leave with this.

315
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,840
- You threatening me?
- Doesn't seem like I have a choice.

316
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,991
Game on, Sandy.

317
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,033
This is so romantic. And original.

318
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,033
Yeah. Well, what can I say?
I'm a creature of habit.

319
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,910
Yes, yes. The lure of the chili fry.
Natural aphrodisiac.

320
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,913
Well, I think we'll be fine
as long as Seth is nowhere nearby.

321
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,356
Seth, right.

322
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,637
Well, good. I have something
to tell you. I have some good news.

323
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,268
- Yeah?
- I can't believe Volchok missed today...

324
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,431
...he's gonna be pissed.
- He won't care.

325
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,511
He's hanging with that chick, Marissa.

326
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,270
- She seems kind of lame.
- Yeah, lame and hot.

327
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,398
She ain't innocent. Volchok show you
the scratches on his back?

328
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,950
- Why don't we take this to go.
- No, it's fine.

329
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,157
- Let's just go. Come on.
- It's... Sadie, it's fine. Sadie?

330
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,599
Sadie.

331
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,432
Sadie.

332
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,198
I'm not mad. I just feel like once again,
you know, the mood was kind of ruined.

333
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,238
- Okay, we can turn that around.
- I think we're trying too hard.

334
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,757
Maybe we need to let
the perfect night just happen. Okay?

335
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,559
Give it some time.

336
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,234
All right, all right. Fine.

337
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,152
Let me at least drive you home.

338
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,232
- Okay.
- Just give me a second.

339
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,593
Ryan, come on. Don't go back.

340
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,199
- Hey, look, it's little bitch.
- Volchok around?

341
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,510
- You looking for your girlfriend?
- No, for him.

342
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,990
And if you see him, tell him that.
And to meet under the pier tomorrow.

343
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,916
You think you can remember all that?

344
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,551
You need me to write it down for you?

345
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,911
Yeah, bro. We'll tell him.

346
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,392
You know, I just knew.

347
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,279
It was only a matter of time
until you got in my face again.

348
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,919
- I just wanna talk.
- About what?

349
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,799
Your girlfriend or mine?
I got stories about both of them.

350
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,473
I bet you do.

351
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,835
This where you tell me
I better leave her alone?

352
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,151
- That she's too good for me?
- Whoever Marissa wants to be with...

353
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,356
...it's not my place to judge.

354
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,513
- I saw her at school, didn't look so good.
- That girl couldn't look bad if she tried.

355
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,716
She was drinking.
You know she has a problem?

356
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,838
She drinks. She gets drunk.
I don't see the problem.

357
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,717
Just so you know,
I'm not looking after her anymore.

358
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,033
It's on you now.

359
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,314
Treat her right. She deserves it.

360
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,478
- Good morning, ladies.
- I'd say a great morning.

361
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,756
Our new family,
first breakfast together.

362
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,238
And tonight we're going to have
our first family dinner.

363
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,960
Something that hopefully
will become a weekly tradition.

364
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,475
Nothing like all sitting down
together to a meal.

365
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,596
Discussing current events,
catching up.

366
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,512
- Doesn't that sound fun?
- Tons of.

367
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,956
Marissa has several events
she would love to share with the family.

368
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,635
Summer, you can make that dessert
I like, the one with the graham cracker.

369
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,678
Oh, I'm sure daddy's little girl
would love to.

370
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,592
Excuse me.

371
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,712
Sisters.

372
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,876
Sadie?

373
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,957
- Hey, man, I was looking for Sadie.
- Hey. Yeah, she's in the shower.

374
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,633
Or was.

375
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,233
Ryan. Did you meet Bob?

376
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,753
Hey, Bob.

377
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,592
What's up?

378
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,031
- Garage door sticks a little.
- Cool.

379
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,077
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

380
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,958
See you.

381
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,075
One bad date
and I'm already replaced, huh?

382
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,118
- All right, all right. Two bad dates.
- Bob?

383
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,068
He bought the house. He lives next door
and he made a really great offer.

384
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,635
- My news last night, if you'd listened.
- I know. I'm sorry, I was distracted.

385
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,758
- You wanna tell me what's up?
- Sure.

386
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,313
It's Volchok and Marissa.

387
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,074
But it's all good now.

388
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,834
There was a conversation
I needed to have, I had it...

389
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,274
...I'm done.
- That's good.

390
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,238
It's just, I think I'm done too.

391
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,960
- What do you mean?
- Well, my aunt's business is handled.

392
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,792
The house is sold.

393
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,077
- There's no reason for me to be here.
- No reason?

394
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,470
Ryan, I never intended
to stay this long.

395
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,870
I think it might be easier
for me to leave if...

396
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,473
If we didn't happen?

397
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,112
- Have you thought about this?
- Yeah, I have.

398
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,875
- Have you?
- Yeah.

399
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,315
If I stayed,
I'd have to find an apartment.

400
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,677
Then what? Wait for you to finish
high school? Follow you to college?

401
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,638
We're getting a little
ahead of ourselves, I mean...

402
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,308
I don't know, I honestly didn't think
that much about the future.

403
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,756
I was just hoping
to take you to dinner.

404
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,236
You eat, right?

405
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,033
You haven't thought about it
because you're not ready to.

406
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,156
Which I totally get.

407
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,835
But I can't change my whole life
to be with someone who's distracted.

408
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,836
So that's it then. No more smiling...

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,833
...no skipping, no dancing.
- You were never a fan of dancing.

410
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,116
I might have come around.
Now we'll never know.

411
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,317
Yeah, I can't just ask her to move here,
change her whole life.

412
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,074
Well, relocating to Newport
might not be that big a deal.

413
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,277
Yeah. Puts a lot of pressure on us,
you know? On the relationship.

414
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,953
Ryan Atwood loves pressure.

415
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,590
He's not comfortable unless his entire
body's being squeezed in a vice grip.

416
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,432
- That is not true.
- Yeah?

417
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,797
You moved to Chino to help a girl
with a baby that might not be yours.

418
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,155
- Theresa needed someone.
- Stayed with Marissa...

419
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,436
...for several years of tortured torture.

420
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,797
- She was there for me too.
- When it comes to pursuing happiness...

421
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,794
...with a great girl who seems
to be relatively issue-free...

422
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,515
- I gotta ask her to stay.
- Yes, you do.

423
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,556
- All right.
- I saw that smile. Smiler.

424
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,631
I told you, the kid's just posturing.

425
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,518
He's trying to get a rise out of you.

426
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,511
Well, Matt said he has documents.

427
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,915
He said he could prove
what he's saying.

428
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,229
Look, Sandy, I apologize.

429
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,557
- Now what are you saying?
- I'm saying...

430
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,235
...I've let you shoulder too much
of the responsibility on this situation.

431
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,756
- I'll handle it from here.
- Well, that sounds a little ominous.

432
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,229
- What are you gonna do?
- You focus on the hospital.

433
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,517
There's people counting on you
and there's a lot of work to be done.

434
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,398
Now you've done too much already.

435
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,109
What was that you were saying
about 18 holes at Big Canyon?

436
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,350
- You're wearing that to a family dinner?
- Who says I'm going to dinner?

437
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,954
Okay, Marissa, be mad at me
if you want, but it is our family.

438
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,233
Whatever. Save me some dessert.

439
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,797
- Hey, what's up?
- The slut is spiraling.

440
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,110
- I thought I told you to talk to Ryan.
- I did.

441
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,716
I tried to activate his savior complex,
but it seems he's been cured.

442
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,552
I gotta go.
I'm hanging with my mom.

443
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,711
- With your mom?
- <i>I know, it seems weird.</i>

444
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,474
<i>We're trying something different.</i>
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

445
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,108
- Fine.
- Okay, bye.

446
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,953
- All set?
- Yeah.

447
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,554
Where we going?
Cardio Barre? Yogalates?

448
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,597
Something new.

449
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,478
Let's give Marissa
a couple of more minutes, shall we?

450
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,471
Actually, we should just get started.

451
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,914
Personally, I'm starving.

452
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,672
Why don't we just dig in and bond.

453
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,752
What were we gonna do at this dinner?
Discuss current events?

454
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,071
- I think we live in a very fascinating time.
- Riveting.

455
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,356
Julie, why don't you
ring her on her cell.

456
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,238
I did call. Several times.

457
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,279
Well, I'm concerned, she never missed
dinner when she was here last semester.

458
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,759
That's because I wasn't here.

459
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,797
Marissa and I haven't
had the greatest...

460
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,473
Luck.

461
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,599
But you've always stood
by each other through hard times.

462
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,910
- Isn't that great, Dad?
- Yes. It is.

463
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,832
You Cooper girls are really something.

464
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,471
Thank you, Neil.

465
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,596
And thank you, Summer.

466
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,436
Will you pass the potatoes, please?

467
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,113
I thought you and your mom
fought all the time.

468
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,877
It's not my mom...

469
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,314
...it's Summer.

470
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,716
You know, the only other time
we really fought was in the fifth grade?

471
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,270
When I sat on the bus with Luke
on the way to the Museum of Tolerance.

472
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,193
Who's Luke?

473
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,752
Summer and Luke were engaged.

474
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,115
In the second grade.
She doesn't like to talk about it.

475
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,836
- Why all the questions? All of a sudden?
- What do you mean?

476
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,996
You just seem very interested in my life.

477
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,597
I just...

478
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,637
We're hanging out, seems like...

479
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,478
What?

480
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,632
You deserve to be treated right.

481
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,512
If I wanted to be treated right,
I wouldn't be with you.

482
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,631
Works for me.

483
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,917
You want a bump?

484
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,269
I don't... I mean, I've never.

485
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,830
There's a first time for everything.

486
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,274
Guess I'm partying solo.

487
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,037
Okay, what is this place?

488
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,197
You'll see.

489
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,319
Crappy rec center basement, bad coffee.
Don't think you're in Weight Watchers...

490
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,835
...so either you're
in a community theater group...

491
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,230
...or have converted
to an under-funded religion.

492
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,870
Hi. I'm Ellen,
and I'm an alcoholic.

493
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,632
- Hi, Ellen.
- Hi, Ellen.

494
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,109
We will begin
with our reading of chapter five.

495
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,158
- Seth.
- Thank you, Ellen...

496
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,550
I thought if you knew
you wouldn't have come.

497
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,869
Well, good instinct.

498
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,235
Going through this the first time
wasn't enough?

499
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,359
This place has saved my family,
my marriage, quite possibly my life.

500
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,670
These people know more about me
than my family.

501
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,274
Who's fault's that?
Like you talk about what happened.

502
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,839
It's not like you ever ask.

503
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,029
- lf this is how you act when I share...
- There's sharing and then there's lying.

504
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,597
Well, we're here,
and I'm not leaving.

505
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,194
So you can wait in the car
or you can do this for me.

506
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,916
Just give me an hour.

507
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,514
It's important that you be here tonight.

508
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,190
Is anyone gonna rip off their arm,
keep fighting?

509
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,038
Metaphorically speaking, yeah.

510
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,515
<i>Matt, this is Mitchell Kiven</i>
<i>from</i> The Register.

511
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,797
<i>I've got your message, and I'm</i>
<i>very interested in the Griffin story.</i>

512
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,712
<i>You got the number.</i>

513
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,760
<i>Hey, Matt, it's Sandy. We need to talk.</i>

514
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,434
<i>Will you call me back</i>
<i>as soon as you can?</i>

515
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,195
- It's cool. Take whatever you want...
- This isn't a robbery.

516
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,396
- Hey.
- Hey.

517
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,834
Is Sadie around?

518
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,560
- No, actually, she...
- Do you mind if I come in and wait?

519
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,234
Well, I mean, might be a while.
You just missed her.

520
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,517
She left for Oregon a couple hours ago.

521
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,112
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,319
Hey.

523
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,959
Hi.

524
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,515
What are you doing here?

525
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,990
Sorry, I figured you were spending
your time under the pier these days.

526
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,079
- I can go.
- No, it's fine. I'm... I'm not gonna stay.

527
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,474
Where's Sadie?

528
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,198
Gone. Back to Oregon.

529
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,672
Went to see her, she'd already left.

530
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,229
Without saying goodbye?

531
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,550
Guess she thought
it was easier this way.

532
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,432
And is it?

533
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,910
You don't have to answer that.
I'm gonna go.

534
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,358
But...

535
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,911
Enjoy, then.

536
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,358
I'll leave it as I found it.

537
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,394
I'd pissed in the streets...

538
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,156
...eaten out of garbage
and accidentally shot my wife.

539
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,710
Not once, but twice.

540
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,393
Thank you very much.

541
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,915
That's a heartwarming tale.

542
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,997
He's been sober 30 years.

543
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,233
Thank you for that, George.

544
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,914
Before we leave,
we have a couple of chips to hand out.

545
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,548
Kirsten, if you'd like to join me.

546
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,356
Congratulations.

547
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,156
- You're nine months sober.
- Oh, thank you.

548
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,632
All of you.

549
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,078
And especially my son, Seth,
who's here with me tonight.

550
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,800
- Hi, Seth.
- Hey.

551
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,030
He doesn't know this...

552
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,031
...but he's the reason that I got sober.

553
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,957
The look on his face
at my intervention...

554
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,758
...he was so disappointed in me.

555
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,433
But he believed that I could do this.

556
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,874
And he was right.

557
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,756
Congratulations, Mom.

558
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,031
Only 29 years
and three months more to go...

559
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,272
...until you're as normal
as William S. Burroughs over there.

560
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,552
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>
<i>for bus number 338...</i>

561
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,792
<i>... with continuing service to San Diego.</i>

562
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,638
Never expected to see you here.

563
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,836
Yeah, well, I'm just glad I found you.

564
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,911
There's a lot of ways
to leave Newport.

565
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,231
- Bus, plane, boat.
- Greyhound.

566
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,233
- Way to hedge your bets.
- I'm just glad you're still here.

567
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,520
- Why?
- Because I don't think you should leave.

568
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,519
Ryan really cares about you.

569
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,354
He told you that?

570
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,999
Well, I mean, he didn't have to.

571
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,720
After everything we've been through,
I know him well.

572
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,311
<i>Bus number 465 to Portland,</i>
<i>with stops in Bakersfield...</i>

573
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,517
- Yeah, well, this is my bus.
- He wants you to stay.

574
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,591
- He didn't try to stop me.
- Yeah, he did.

575
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,035
He was just a couple of minutes too late.

576
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,829
Why are you doing this?

577
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,389
Well, I guess because
you make Ryan happy.

578
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,309
<i>Bus number 465</i>
<i>to Portland, Oregon is now boarding.</i>

579
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,470
- Neil, dinner was amazing.
- Yeah.

580
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,393
Marissa's gonna be sorry she missed it.

581
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,071
Well, we have years
of family dinners ahead of us.

582
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,995
Julie, you know this engagement
is a trial, right?

583
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,954
What?

584
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,758
A trial.

585
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,275
For you, me.

586
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,271
Us together. For the girls.

587
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,149
I mean, if our families aren't a good fit,
then we really shouldn't get married.

588
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,878
Of course.
I mean, love doesn't really conquer all.

589
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,713
Well, we both have
the broken marriages to prove that.

590
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,199
But, Neil, surely this time...

591
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,433
I don't mean that in a punitive way,
I'm just trying to be practical.

592
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,240
I've got some reading to do.
I'll see you in a minute.

593
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,429
Hi, baby.

594
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,750
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

595
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,069
I couldn't help overhearing
what my dad just said.

596
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,154
But don't worry, he always gets this way
when he starts to get close to someone.

597
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,679
Actually, Summer, the only thing
I'm worried about is my daughter.

598
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,397
Yeah, me too.

599
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,836
- Hey, vodka on the rocks, please.
- You got ID?

600
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,151
- I drink here all the time.
- Yeah, when Volchok's guys are buying.

601
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,636
Can't you make an exception
this one time?

602
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,916
- I used to date the manager.
- Sorry.

603
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,111
Look, I'm having a bad night,
and I really need a drink.

604
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,351
You and me both.

605
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,912
Matt?

606
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,316
Oh, my God.

607
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,357
What happened?

608
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,119
Like you don't know.

609
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,912
- What are you doing here?
- You tell me.

610
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,634
There's another bus in an hour.

611
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,359
What do I have to do
to get you to stay?

612
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,635
I think you're doing it.

613
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,635
Glad to see you back.
Wasn't sure if I should...

614
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,631
No more talking.

615
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,390
Here, let me help you with that.

616
