00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,149
<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,992
Promise me you're gonna
quit this thing.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,513
It's about more than the hospital.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,477
- I can't just quit.
- I'm an alcoholic.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,315
Soon Marissa's gonna wake up and
realize she is so much better than you.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,879
You think she's gonna come
back to you?

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,031
Our kids got into college.
It's a big day.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,633
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,518
Oh, God, how did I not get in?

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,875
I'm not sure that Brown
is the right choice for me.

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,156
We applied to Brown
so that we could be together.

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,436
I need to get Summer back
and get into Brown.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,319
- We need a plan?
- It's gonna be a long night, Ryan.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,709
You taking all that? You only own,
like, a wife-beater and two hoodies.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,077
Sorry. I don't know what people
wear to Prospective Students Weekend.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,992
- I brought everything.
- I packed light.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,276
I wanna be free and easy
for pre-frosh weekend.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,512
- Even though you're not a pre-freshman.
- It's called pre-frosh, Ryan.

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,240
And if I'm gonna go there,
I need you to get the lingo.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,070
Don't give me that look. You were way
into this when we came up with it.

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,151
That's because
we only had the beginning.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,234
So you're gonna fly to Brown...

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,277
Then I will somehow get them
to admit me.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,672
Yeah. I don't have the details yet,
but Brown's a spiritual place.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,719
I'll just... I'll go, I'll get a vibe. Maybe I'll
bump into the ghost of old man Brown.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,792
- Or whoever they named the school after.
- Summer's gonna be there.

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,393
I don't know that for sure.

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,393
Every student is going to be
at a college. She's gonna be there.

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,189
It's not like we'll run into each other.
We're going to a land of Jewish kids.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,793
- I'll blend right in.
- Yeah?

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,514
- And your flight?
- Booked a ticket through Chattanooga.

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,636
Totally inconvenient.
No way she'll be on it.

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,075
I don't wanna see you
get deeper into this, okay?

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,992
You're going to Berkeley with your ex.

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,515
- You ready to go? College calls.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,238
- I think we're set.
- Just think...

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,913
...the next time we send you off...

38
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,071
...it'll be real.
- Only be a few hours away.

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,549
What about you,
going all the way to the East Coast.

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,950
If I wasn't so proud of you,
I'd be angry at you...

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,998
- All right, we got planes to catch.
- Okay, let's go.

42
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,479
Where's Sandy?

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,915
He had an early meeting.
He said to say goodbye.

44
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,514
That's weird. Man lives
for the airport sendoff.

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,240
Well, I guess it was
an important meeting.

46
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,311
<i>Flight 825 to Phoenix is now boarding.</i>

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,675
All right, well my gate's this way.

48
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,193
Call when you get there.

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,436
Yeah? All right, bring it in.

50
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,794
- Save the hug.
- Yeah, okay.

51
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,439
- See you Sunday.
- Okay.

52
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,999
<i>Phoenix is now boarding.</i>

53
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,798
And what about you? Are you okay?

54
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,474
I'm a little nervous, actually.

55
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,471
Ryan, Berkeley's gonna be a breeze.

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,632
You conquered Newport.
This town isn't known for its hospitality.

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,756
But I had you,
and I had Seth, and Sandy...

58
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,114
Hey. You did this.

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,793
- You earned your future.
- Yeah.

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,234
- Enjoy it.
- All right.

61
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,799
Thanks.

62
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,633
Have a wonderful time.
And call when you get there.

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,199
Okay. I will.

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,512
<i>Passenger Scott Menville, please come to</i>
<i>the club lounge on the mezzanine level.</i>

65
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,519
Hey.

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,798
- Hey, Theresa.
- Hi.

67
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,757
Here you go.

68
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,637
I'll take that.

69
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,155
<i>Scott Menville, meet your party</i>
<i>at the club lounge.</i>

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,992
He's cute.

71
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,030
- Can I borrow that sparkly scarf?
- Sure.

72
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,438
What am I thinking? Kids
at Brown don't wear sparkly scarves.

73
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,189
On my way to the airport I'll stop and
get some kind of angry-Iooking piercing.

74
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,271
Sum, you should just dress like yourself.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,956
This is all wrong.

76
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,350
- What, the scarf?
- No.

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,714
This. All of this.

78
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,553
Me going without Cohen.
You going to Berkeley without Ryan.

79
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,235
I'm going to Berkeley with Ryan.
I'm just not going "with" him.

80
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,879
Yeah, which is even weirder.

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,632
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.

82
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,677
This way,
we're forced to focus on the future.

83
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,713
And we can start
doing that this weekend.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,197
Big talk coming from the girl who
chucked her acceptance in the garbage.

85
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,673
Yeah, well, I was going
through something.

86
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,877
Is that code for having an affair
with an almost-homeless surfer?

87
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,679
And does your past tense
imply it's over?

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,559
- Whatever I was doing with Volchok...
- I don't need details...

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,153
Well, I'm not doing it anymore.

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,356
After today, I probably
will never see him again.

91
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,995
- What do you mean today?
- He texted me to say...

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,948
...I left some stuff at his place. I told him
I'd stop and pick it up before I left.

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,473
No. You won't.

94
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,949
Saying your goodbye
with his dirty mattress in sight?

95
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,669
- That is breakup sex waiting to happen.
- Have you no faith in me at all?

96
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,912
Forty-eight hours ago, Coop,
you were Newport's Courtney Love.

97
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,798
Baby steps.

98
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,109
Fine.

99
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,350
I'll just tell him to meet me at the diner.

100
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,834
You know what,
you should take this with you to Brown.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,913
They're gonna love you,
just so long as long as you be yourself.

102
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,352
Talk about clichéd advice.

103
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,597
I can say things like that
now that I'm smart.

104
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,952
Here you go, my love.

105
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,473
- Thank you.
- Hey.

106
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,916
You don't want a ride
to the airport now?

107
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,275
Oh, no, we got it.
But we could use your muscle...

108
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,556
...to help get our bags in the trunk.
- Muscle.

109
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,472
Guess I still got it.

110
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,678
Marissa, you know it's not
too late for me to go with you.

111
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,559
I won't embarrass you.
I could pretend to be your entourage.

112
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,553
- Or your Scientology guide.
- Mom, you don't have to worry, okay?

113
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,995
Kids go crazy at college.
You saw <i>Girls Gone Wild.</i>

114
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,038
Yeah. I lived it.
Not the topless part.

115
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,351
But don't worry, I've got all
that partying out of my system.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,877
I do want something
different from this.

117
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,156
Well, the Cooper women
do have nine lives.

118
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,312
- I'm just glad you're on to your next one.
- Summer's waiting.

119
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,517
- Bye, Marissa.
- Bye. I'll see you guys in a few days.

120
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,989
- Bye, Mom.
- Have fun.

121
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,268
Did a priest just break in here
and perform an exorcism?

122
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,989
I don't know, but she's definitely
out of the woods.

123
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,668
Well...

124
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,355
It's just you and me this weekend. What
should we do? I could call the Montage.

125
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,431
Can't. I've got that dinner
tomorrow night.

126
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,068
- Retirement party for the head of surgery.
- Oh, right.

127
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,992
Well, then. Thank God for Netflix.

128
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,197
Are you ever gonna come
to one of these?

129
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,669
Why? So the women can gossip
about me after I leave?

130
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,115
Now, why would anyone
wanna gossip about you?

131
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,999
I don't get it. You throw
parties for the dating service.

132
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,230
I have Kirsten, then.
She's my wingwoman.

133
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,038
So invite Kirsten and Sandy.

134
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,034
He can network with the doctors,
and she can "wingwoman."

135
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,799
It would mean a lot to me.

136
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,833
Then I'm there.

137
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,718
- Ryan Atwood. Sorry I'm late.
- Don't worry.

138
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,871
- Wes Seifert. Your buddy.
- Nice to meet you.

139
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,519
- You need a hand?
- No, I'm good.

140
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,955
We've seen better days.
I'll show you the dorm.

141
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,270
- Okay.
- You don't mind an inflatable mattress...

142
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,273
- No, sounds good.
- I saw your profile. You're from Newport.

143
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,395
- Did you go to Harbor?
- Yeah, you know it?

144
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,835
Yeah, a few guys
in my Poli-Sci Club went there.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,228
Play water polo?

146
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,358
No, no. You know what, actually
I'm not really from Newport.

147
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,479
I mean, I am, but up until the last two
years I was... I was living in Chino.

148
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,234
I guess I figured I needed
to get that out of the way.

149
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,109
- I think you'll be okay.
- What do you mean?

150
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,238
I got one roommate from Bangladesh.

151
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,516
The other one's from Partridge, Kansas.

152
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,398
Population 300.

153
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,517
So there's no mold here.
It's pretty easy to fit in.

154
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,871
Guess I'm not really used to that.

155
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,192
Hey.

156
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,915
Summer's waiting,
and I've got a plane to catch.

157
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,638
So do you have my stuff?

158
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,269
- No.
- What? Why?

159
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,836
Tell me why you all of a sudden
up and bailed.

160
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,920
I really never thought
of you as the possessive type.

161
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,877
I just wanna know what happened.

162
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,273
It's what you already know.

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,036
You and me,
we have nothing in common.

164
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,553
Right.

165
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,278
You got money and I don't.

166
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,829
- Same old story.
- No, it's not like that.

167
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,672
You really wanna know?

168
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,870
When I was little, my sister and I used
to always watch <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

169
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,598
Yes, I must have missed that one.

170
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,111
Okay, well, there's this girl in it, Liesl.

171
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,953
I always used to think
I was gonna grow up to be just like her.

172
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,312
I'd have the really cute boyfriend...

173
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,789
...that looked like her boyfriend.

174
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,073
And our lives would be
just like the scene where they're...

175
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,676
They're standing in the gazebo
and singing to each other.

176
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,431
Then I grew up, and...

177
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,634
...I found myself doing coke
and sleeping with a guy...

178
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,360
...who I'd never had
one real conversation with.

179
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,713
I know it sounds cheesy.

180
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,872
But I'm just not ready to give up
on <i>The Sound of Music</i> thing.

181
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,199
Not yet.

182
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,833
Well, good luck with that.

183
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,192
I'll be sure to drop off your stuff.

184
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,157
It's not gonna be a problem.
I promise you.

185
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,511
Look. Hey, hey, hey, let me
get back to you, all right?

186
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,955
I was just about to get some lunch.
Wanna go out?

187
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,554
- I only have a minute.
- I'm sorry about the other night.

188
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,551
- I tried to call.
- It's something else.

189
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,349
When I was at the airport this morning,
I saw Ryan's ex-girlfriend Theresa.

190
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,470
- How's she doing?
- She had a baby with her.

191
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,471
A boy. Looked about 2.

192
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,271
- Think it might be Ryan's.
- It's possible.

193
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,429
- You spoke to her.
- No.

194
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,955
For all you know, he could be
her cousin or nephew.

195
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,271
I saw how she was with him, the way
she picked him up. She's a mother.

196
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,431
Yeah, well, she told Ryan
she lost the baby.

197
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,719
What are you saying, she lied?

198
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,950
I just think we should
tell him what I saw.

199
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,270
We've always been honest with him.
He trusts us.

200
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,590
Oh, honey, let's keep it to ourselves.

201
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,479
You know, at least until he gets back.

202
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,553
- <i>Hey, Seth.</i>
- Hey, man, how's Berkeley?

203
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,472
It's... It's cold, and wet,
and pretty cool.

204
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,835
I can't believe I'm actually
on a college campus.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,719
Ryan, I'm touching ivy right now.

206
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,156
- What?
- Real ivy. It grows on the buildings here.

207
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,949
These pictures in the brochure?
They are not photoshopped.

208
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,112
- <i>You're in the middle of the quad now?</i>
- Yeah, dead center.

209
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,396
Pretty stealth.
Can't imagine anyone seeing you.

210
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,318
I know, I know.
It's a Summer hot zone.

211
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,835
I just had to come visit campus
for a few minutes.

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,629
- Yeah, and it's perfect?
- Man, it's better than perfect.

213
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,838
- Seth Cohen has come home to roost.
- Cohen?

214
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,752
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

215
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,319
I'm too afraid to turn around.

216
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,915
Anna?

217
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,229
- So...
- Yeah.

218
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,868
Newport versus Pittsburgh.
Who would win in a smackdown?

219
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,473
For me, Pittsburgh.

220
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,471
Come on, you miss Newport.

221
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,677
The sun and the surf, the surgery.

222
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,035
They've not perfected
chin implants in Pittsburgh.

223
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,078
- But I am optimistic.
- Mocking Newport with Anna Stern.

224
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,913
- That is one of my favorite pastimes.
- Mine too.

225
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,753
But I did get a small taste
when <i>Atomic County</i> came out.

226
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,559
- Hey, you saw my comic.
- I was so proud of you.

227
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,757
- Thanks.
- I do have a few notes on Punky Spitfire.

228
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,230
- Okay.
- And that Mobisode was hilarious.

229
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,549
What the hell is a Mobisode?

230
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,073
You don't know?
I thought it was yours.

231
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,630
Yeah, it was, but I traded it
to a guy named Zach Stevens...

232
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,631
...in exchange for Summer.

233
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,074
How romantic.

234
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,800
- How are you guys?
- Great.

235
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,998
- Great. Great.
- Great.

236
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,879
- Tell her I say hi.
- I will.

237
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,429
But I wouldn't want her
to get the wrong idea...

238
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,113
...about us bumping
into each other.

239
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,068
- I know, it does kind of seem like fate.
- Yeah, not exactly.

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,275
- Ouch.
- Well, what I mean is...

241
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,595
...and the only other person
who knows this is Ryan.

242
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,279
- I am not officially admitted here.
- You didn't get in?

243
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,634
Shut up.

244
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,791
No, I didn't. That's why I'm out here.

245
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,269
- I'm trying to get in.
- How do you plan on that?

246
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,878
I haven't quite nailed that down yet.

247
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,315
But now that I've run into you...

248
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,597
...who, if I remember correctly,
is not only sage, but wise...

249
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,830
And you want me to come up
with some scheme...

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,560
...to, what, smuggle you into college?
- Yes. Please?

251
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,632
Listen, it's fate. You said it yourself.

252
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,355
All right.

253
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,590
There's a "Meet the Faculty"
reception tonight.

254
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,352
I assume Dr. Overbee will be there.

255
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,670
- That's the admissions dude.
- Try talking to him.

256
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,149
- I will say what?
- You flew all the way out here...

257
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,711
...because you wanna go here so badly.
You should come up with that speech.

258
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,632
What are you doing tomorrow night?

259
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,394
No plans? Good. You're going
to Neil's dinner with doctors.

260
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,357
Sandy can recruit for the hospital.

261
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,478
You and I can sit in a corner and gossip.
A fun time will be had.

262
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,073
Actually, I'm busy.

263
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,953
Kiki...

264
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,313
All you ever do is sit
in this house and drink tea.

265
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,357
I mean, what's the real reason?

266
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,476
Sandy and I have hit
a bit of a rough patch.

267
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,633
What happened?

268
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,353
It's complicated.

269
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,354
Suffice it to say, I'm not
a huge fan of this hospital project.

270
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,193
Well, are you a huge fan of me?

271
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,999
Because, you know, I'm saying,
if you need a reason to go...

272
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,993
...you're looking at one.
- You don't need me to do this.

273
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,276
Yeah, Kirsten, I do.

274
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,751
You know, ever since Caleb died...

275
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,593
...the way I've been able to navigate
these Newpsie waters...

276
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,752
...is with you by my side.
Please, Kirsten...

277
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,957
...I want Dr. Roberts'
doctor friends to like me.

278
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,028
- Fine. But I'm only doing this for you.
- Thank you.

279
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,998
I owe you one.

280
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,556
Or, you know, maybe it's more than one.
But who's counting.

281
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,631
Okay. See you tomorrow.

282
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,150
- So your dad's in jail?
- Yeah, yeah.

283
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,788
I got a dad, one brother,
and two uncles locked up.

284
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,469
You win.

285
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,471
Miguel's the first to go to college too.

286
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,193
Really?

287
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,918
You ever feel out of place here?

288
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,355
All the time. Look,
as long as I keep my grades up...

289
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,397
...I figured I belong
as much as anyone.

290
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,434
And one day Wes here is gonna
get my brother out of jail.

291
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,750
- Supreme Court Justice.
- It's just a pipe dream.

292
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,832
- I mean, I'll be happy if I pass the bar.
- That's amazing.

293
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,958
Oh, speaking of amazing...

294
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,677
And she's headed this way.

295
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,319
- Hi.
- Hey.

296
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,312
- You two know each other?
- We were in the same class.

297
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,274
Yeah, at Harbor. This is Miguel.

298
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,034
- Hi.
- And Wes, my freshman buddy.

299
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,792
Speaking of buddies, where's yours?

300
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,629
Oh, mine's vegan,
and she's boycotting this.

301
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,552
Because of the turkey on your plate.

302
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,439
What can you do, right?
So you're... You're all alone, huh?

303
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,791
Yeah, but, I'm fine. No worries.

304
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,235
- See you guys around.
- All right.

305
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,595
- Okay, there's definitely a story there.
- Oh, yeah.

306
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,318
And it's not, "we went to Harbor."

307
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,074
Yeah, we dated. On
and off for two and a half years.

308
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,559
- That'll do it.
- Yeah.

309
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,073
She seems nice.

310
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,593
And Ionely.

311
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,197
If you wanna go over and talk to her...

312
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,716
Hey, hey. She's your ex, I'm your buddy.
Not a good mix.

313
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,316
Honestly, I'm gonna be in college
with her. So I gotta get used to it.

314
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,277
Really. Go for it.

315
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,192
- You sure you don't mind?
- No.

316
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,918
Well...

317
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,556
So let me tell you about rush week.

318
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,552
Okay. Look, there he is.

319
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,960
Dr. Overbee, head of admissions.

320
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,957
- What?
- No, no, I'm just looking around.

321
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,588
- Why are you acting like a fugitive?
- No, no.

322
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,115
Staying under radar.
Never know who's at these things.

323
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,192
Well, focus. Have you thought
about what you're gonna say to him?

324
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,071
I'm probably just gonna riff.

325
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,832
You know, we're both dudes...

326
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,673
...even though he's got a bow tie
and probably nine Ph. D's...

327
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,478
...underneath, I'm sure...

328
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,835
...we're the same.
- Could you maybe think...

329
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,433
...of some talking points?

330
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,316
Okay, he's by himself.
This is my moment.

331
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,276
- Dr. Overbee. Hi.
- Hi.

332
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,035
The fact is, the U.S. has been
performing its own jihads for decades.

333
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,839
Instead of Allah,
the killing is done in the name of oil.

334
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,353
Totally.

335
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,520
You guys? What is a jihad?

336
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,152
Exactly.

337
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,675
Way to reframe the question, Summer.

338
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,955
- Now, what was your name again?
- Seth Cohen.

339
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,112
You may remember me
from my application essay on Superman?

340
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,717
- Lonely guy, Superman.
- I don't recall it at the moment...

341
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,269
...but if you're here,
I trust it was exceptional.

342
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,115
About that, do you have a minute? Do you
wanna take a walk, stretch your legs?

343
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,353
I'm sorry. This is a faculty reception.
I have to be here.

344
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,829
- I should make the rounds.
- Dr. Overbee, please...

345
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,958
...we really need to talk. If you can't
do it now, name the time.

346
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,678
All I need is five minutes.

347
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,198
I suppose I could see you here,
tomorrow around 5?

348
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,079
Great. Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

349
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,753
Cohen?

350
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,270
Oh, hey. What's going on?

351
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,638
What the hell are you doing here?

352
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,036
Providence in spring. Can't beat it.

353
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,315
So you are going to Brown.
You just didn't want to come with me.

354
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,708
How'd it go?

355
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,074
Anna.

356
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,879
Summer.

357
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,755
You're probably
really confused right about now.

358
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,717
No. Not at all.

359
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,271
All of this, everything you've done up
until now finally makes sense.

360
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,270
So you and Ryan dated for how long?

361
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,714
Couple of years.

362
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,075
But we've both been
with other people since then.

363
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,835
It's not exactly normal yet,
but we're working on it.

364
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,919
So where is Ryan, anyway?

365
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,752
Tour of the Architecture Building.

366
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,115
Never set foot in there,
so I couldn't show him.

367
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,113
- Oh, yeah, where do you hang out?
- Poli-Sci Building.

368
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,077
Sexy, right? It's my major.

369
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,952
I'm hoping it gets me into law school.

370
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,394
My dad was a Poli-Sci major.

371
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,669
You know, you kind
of remind me of him, a little bit.

372
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,719
The good parts, at least.

373
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,712
If that's a compliment, I'll take it.

374
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,793
It is.

375
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,360
- One second.
- Hey, Ryan.

376
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,192
- Hi.
- Hi.

377
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,716
- I didn't know you were gonna be here.
- I hope it's not weird that I am.

378
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,996
I don't really know
the rules between us.

379
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,559
Well, me either.

380
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,993
So I know the whole friendship thing
didn't really work out in Newport but...

381
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,391
That was Newport. Everything feels
different here. I'm willing to try.

382
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,594
Well, I don't know.

383
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,753
If I was in your circle of friends, I might
let it slip that you used to do musicals.

384
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,396
I have enough dirt on you to last
the next four years. So bring it on.

385
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,120
That might be true. Do you
wanna come sit with me and Wes?

386
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,679
I wanna hear about
your architecture tour.

387
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,429
- Really?
- Yeah.

388
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,031
Seth, it's okay.

389
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,948
Sorry. I should've told you
I was on a Summer mission.

390
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,156
Yeah, well, I should've known it.

391
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,153
But I can't be mad at you
when you're this pathetic.

392
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,556
- Thank you.
- Now stop wallowing...

393
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,280
...and let's figure out
how we're getting you out of this.

394
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,438
- I thought you didn't wanna help me.
- It's the pathetic thing. It works on me.

395
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,637
Okay, look, here's a list
of tomorrow's pre-frosh activities.

396
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,916
Try and figure out which one
Summer might go to.

397
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,071
I don't know.
She's never been a joiner.

398
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,271
Maybe the walking tour.
She likes cardio.

399
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,396
Good. You can go. You can talk to her.

400
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,199
We gotta figure out what
you're gonna say to Dr. Overbee.

401
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,828
I don't know. If he didn't
like my essay, I'm out.

402
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,594
Seth, you flew all this way
to win her back.

403
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,991
Now you have five minutes
with Dr. Overbee to make it happen.

404
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,673
We're gonna write the speech.

405
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,910
What have I done
the last two years without you?

406
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,716
Honestly?

407
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,112
I don't know.

408
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,838
Hey. I got your message
about the hospital dinner.

409
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,797
- Tomorrow. Can you make it?
- Absolutely.

410
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,350
Maybe I can get some of these doctors
excited about the new hospital.

411
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,119
Hey.

412
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,078
Ryan, how are
my old stomping grounds?

413
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,670
I'm happy to hear that.

414
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,034
Hey, listen, you know what?

415
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,270
I got a call that I gotta
take here. It's work.

416
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,351
I'm gonna hand you
to Kirsten, all right?

417
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,873
Have fun. Here you go.

418
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,314
Hello.

419
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,073
- How are those permits coming?
- Hey, how's it going?

420
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,038
Hey, Kirsten, it's...
It's actually kind of amazing.

421
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,111
- Fine. I'm good. Fine.
- You don't sound fine.

422
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,870
Don't be silly.
Tell me more about college.

423
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,068
Kirsten, what's going on?

424
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,799
It can wait till you get home.

425
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,399
Okay. So there is something.

426
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,913
It's really... It's not...
It's not important.

427
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,957
Then you won't mind telling me.
What is it?

428
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,152
I don't want you to overreact,
because that's probably what I'm doing.

429
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,512
I saw Theresa at the airport.

430
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,239
<i>She had a baby with her.</i>

431
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,356
<i>It looked like her son.</i>

432
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,875
- And you think...?
- I don't know what I think.

433
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,632
There she is.

434
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,553
Now, remember,
you're just gonna tell her the truth.

435
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,915
- Right.
- Yes.

436
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,196
Okay. All of it.

437
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,079
Summer, can I talk to you?

438
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,912
- Just leave me alone, Cohen.
- Everyone.

439
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,629
Hello. My name is Jack.

440
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,678
I'm a sophomore here at Brown.
I'll be leading this walking tour.

441
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,355
So long as everyone's got their
nametags, we can get started.

442
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,159
I wanna explain to you
about everything.

443
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,039
You in the striped shirt.

444
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,633
Do you have a nametag?

445
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,114
Yeah. Yeah I do. I'm all set.

446
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,950
Kumar? Your name is Kumar?

447
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,474
Yes. Kumar Zimmerman.

448
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,949
I'm half Indian, I am half Jewish.

449
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,519
I am a Hin-Jew.

450
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,393
Well, good. Good then. Right.

451
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,074
Come, everyone. Right this way.

452
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,188
Now, to our left,
we've got the Main Dining Hall.

453
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,634
The Sharpe Refectory...

454
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,756
...known as the Ratty.
- I've been acting like a freak.

455
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,148
I know that.

456
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,435
Does this tour offer an audio option, like
when you get headsets at the museum?

457
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,674
No.

458
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,793
- We've got the Main Building.
- You can't just ignore me forever.

459
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,030
Oh, yes, I can.
Don't you remember middle school?

460
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,475
I was good at ignoring you.
Getting back into shape.

461
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,108
Look, I promise you, I did not know
Anna was gonna be...

462
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,033
Kumar?
Kumar, you wanna keep it down?

463
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,189
Yeah. Sorry.

464
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,353
You're wondering about the Kumar thing.
Again, if you let me explain...

465
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,034
...I promise you, it will all make sense.
- Oh, no.

466
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,714
It already makes sense.
I don't need any explanation.

467
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,193
You broke up with me so you can
be free to date smart women.

468
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,318
- You got quite the head start.
- Summer, that is so not it.

469
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,756
Look, you already
ruined senior year for me.

470
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,151
There's nothing I can do about that.
I'm not gonna let you ruin college.

471
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,193
Now, will you please
just leave me alone? Please.

472
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,398
- Hi. I couldn't stay.
- Ryan. I'm sorry.

473
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,358
- I shouldn't have told you.
- No, no, I'm glad you did.

474
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,794
It's funny, in a way
I was kind of expecting it.

475
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,110
I mean, for once
things were uncomplicated.

476
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,952
How long could that last, right?

477
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,470
- Well, maybe it's not...
- Yeah, yeah.

478
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,876
Whatever's going on with Theresa,
we'll get to the bottom of it.

479
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,273
I did some research on the Internet,
and I found her address.

480
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,792
Oh, great. Thanks.
I'm gonna put this in the pool house.

481
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,310
Ryan, no matter what happens,
we're behind you.

482
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,477
Dr. Overbee, you made it.

483
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,438
Yes, well, as I said,
I've only got five minutes.

484
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,716
Sure, sure. Okay. You're a busy guy.

485
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,552
And I have a tendency to ramble...

486
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,029
...which is why I've prepared
this statement.

487
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,434
Dr. Overbee, the following
is a list of reasons...

488
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,352
...why I should have gotten into Brown.

489
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,108
Wait a minute. You didn't get in?

490
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,071
No, I didn't.
But only because I'm sure...

491
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,912
...there was some clerical error...

492
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,991
...or human error,
maybe the computer froze.

493
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,118
Mr. Cohen, I was under the impression
you were an admitted student.

494
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,953
- That's why I came to meet you.
- I know. Please listen...

495
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,192
...and if you still don't wanna
let me in, at least I'll know I tried.

496
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,112
Okay.

497
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,679
You have one minute.

498
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,910
Then I'm gonna have to
sort of condense this...

499
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,117
...maybe make it more
of a bullet-point thing.

500
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,270
Grades, 3.8.

501
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,119
SATs, 2250.

502
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,635
That's not perfect,
but I would say it's respectable.

503
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,553
I was president of the Comic Club,
a member of the Chess Team.

504
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,109
- I was extremely low profile.
- Thirty seconds.

505
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,511
Oh, okay. Here's a part about
how I belong on the East Coast.

506
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,357
And it's a little joke about the weather
to keep it light. It's funny.

507
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,993
And I guess that's about it.

508
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,271
That was compelling.

509
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,310
But you misled me,
and you wasted my time.

510
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,675
So now I trust
you will show yourself off campus.

511
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,954
Dr. Overbee, I have to get in here.

512
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,432
Okay? And it's not just because I love it.
Although I do, I truly... I do.

513
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,230
It's because of a girl. Her name's
Summer Roberts, and she's going here.

514
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,995
If I don't get in, I'm gonna lose her
and the rest of my life is gonna be ruined.

515
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,154
- So this is a about a girl?
- Yes.

516
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,594
It's about the girl.

517
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,948
- Do you get it?
- I do.

518
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,759
But we make commitments
when we send out those letters.

519
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,480
And for better, for worse,
we stick to them.

520
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,752
- Please?
- I wish I could help...

521
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,197
...but you're gonna have
to do this yourself. Good luck.

522
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,113
Ryan, I thought you weren't
getting home till tomorrow.

523
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,633
Kirsten didn't tell you?

524
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,756
- No, no. She didn't.
- I kind of figured...

525
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,514
...I needed to get home and deal.
- Right, of course.

526
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,989
- In case it turns out...
- We'll cross that bridge...

527
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,355
...if and when we come to it.
- Yeah.

528
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,715
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

529
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,430
- You told him.
- I didn't think he'd come home.

530
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,233
Oh, you know Ryan better than that.

531
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,471
It just happened. You weren't there.

532
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,153
You had to take a business call.

533
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,390
Oh, so you told Ryan
about Theresa to punish me.

534
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,596
I told him. He asked.
He has a right to know.

535
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,320
Theresa hasn't demanded
anything of him. Why should we?

536
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,677
Being a father is important.
Being a family is important.

537
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,035
There was a time
you'd be making this argument.

538
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,794
- What's that mean?
- You know what I'm talking about.

539
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,111
I know that we have to talk about this
more, and I can't right now.

540
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,477
- I gotta go to the office before dinner.
- It'll have to wait. Fine.

541
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,513
- Oh, hey. Here, let me help you.
- Hey. Thank you.

542
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,633
Thanks.

543
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,034
Staying dry?

544
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,394
Yeah.

545
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,315
- Yeah.
- Thanks. So we're having some people...

546
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,040
...back to our place later,
if you wanna come by.

547
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,668
Oh, well, I was supposed
to go to a freshman barbecue.

548
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,276
But considering the rain,
I could be persuaded otherwise.

549
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,714
Good. You'll come over then.

550
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,757
- Hey, where's Ryan?
- Left this morning.

551
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,352
- He went home?
- Yeah, some family emergency.

552
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,317
Didn't seem like
he wanted to talk.

553
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,198
So I didn't push it.

554
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,879
Well, I should call him.

555
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,997
Or shouldn't I?

556
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,957
I don't know,
should I give him space?

557
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,350
It's not easy being
friends with your ex, is it?

558
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,713
Look, you know Ryan
better than I do, but...

559
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,031
...seems like whatever
was happening, it was private.

560
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,679
He'll tell you if he wants.

561
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,432
I guess so.

562
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,231
- Well, this thing's getting heavy.
- Is that a hint?

563
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,992
Yeah, thanks.

564
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,109
- Here, I'll switch you.
- Okay.

565
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,957
Hi, I'm looking for Theresa.
Is she home?

566
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,232
I'm sorry. Miss Diaz won't be
home until later. Can I help you?

567
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,592
I'm Ryan Atwood. I'm an old friend.

568
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,799
Say hi, Daniel.

569
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,354
Hi, Daniel.

570
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,033
This is Theresa's kid, huh?

571
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,997
Yeah, she's a terrific mom.

572
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,151
I'll be sure to tell her
that you stopped by.

573
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,072
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

574
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,199
Having a good time?

575
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,998
Yeah, it seems like everyone is.

576
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,639
Yeah, wait till tomorrow.

577
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,358
Come Sunday, all these people...

578
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,875
...will be fighting
for study carrels in the library.

579
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,518
- That's gotta be tough.
- Not everyone can handle it.

580
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,238
I couldn't, anyway.

581
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,995
You? Please.
You're like the model freshman.

582
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,035
You should have seen me last year.

583
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,432
The truth is, this is
my second stab at freshman year.

584
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,670
Last go-around didn't go so well.

585
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,592
Why? What happened?

586
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,593
Let's see, 1.5 GPA...

587
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,319
...too much partying...

588
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,392
...went home after a few months.

589
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,077
Realized I had to figure out
what I wanted from college.

590
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,392
I never would have guessed.

591
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,029
Well, not all pre-freshman
are as gung ho as you.

592
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,553
You bought that?

593
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,631
What? That was an act?

594
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,320
Well, it wouldn't
have been two years ago.

595
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,839
I was the girl on Yearbook,
Charity League, Social Chair.

596
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,718
Whatever my mom told me to do.

597
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,791
I got straight A's.

598
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,396
Sometimes a B in math,
but my dad was a whiz, so he'd help me.

599
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,873
And then on the weekends,
I rode my little sister's pony for fun.

600
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,549
I even won some blue ribbons.

601
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,077
And then what happened?

602
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,551
Well, my dad lost all his money...

603
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,759
...the pony lost all its hair,
and my mom kind of lost her mind.

604
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,836
Also, I got kicked out of school...

605
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,911
...and my friend died.

606
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,071
I guess everything happened.

607
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,232
And then, at some point...

608
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,116
...I just stopped being
the girl who belonged at college.

609
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,635
Or anywhere, for that matter.

610
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,913
Everyone belongs somewhere.

611
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,751
Maybe not everyone.

612
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,398
Maybe some people just get lost.

613
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,755
I won't know anything
till I talk to Theresa.

614
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,115
- I'm just gonna wait.
- Yeah, well, not to worry.

615
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,350
I'm on the next flight.
I'm waiting on my cab.

616
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,795
Seth, you don't have
to come home on my account.

617
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,916
There are a lot of reasons, trust me.

618
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,752
See you when I get home.

619
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,959
- Get in.
- Hey.

620
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,679
Hey.

621
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,429
- You're giving me a ride to the airport?
- Eventually.

622
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,113
My plane leaves in an hour, so...

623
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,953
Well, that is just enough time
to make a quick stop at RISD.

624
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,431
You mean the Rhode Island
School of Design?

625
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,830
You're gonna apply,
and this is your application.

626
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,992
- Where did you get this?
- l... I had my mom FedEx it.

627
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,077
Just in case the Ironist failed...

628
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,995
...and Dr. Overbee didn't go for the quick
quips and pop-culture-laden bromides.

629
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,798
And I have an in there.

630
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,315
- My cousin.
- Anna.

631
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,879
If you get in...

632
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,553
...you'll be in the same state.

633
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,836
And the good news is,
it is a very small state.

634
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,798
I know, but it's one
of the best art schools in the country.

635
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,111
And as much as I love
the face-to-face college rejection...

636
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,840
...I should just cut my losses on this.
- Cohen?

637
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,639
- Yeah?
- Confidence. Remember?

638
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,919
- Right.
- Good.

639
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,479
All right, we're going to RISD.

640
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,474
- Kiki, you made it.
- Hey, here's the man of the hour.

641
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,471
- Good to see you, Neil.
- You too, Sandy.

642
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,200
- Hey, Julie.
- Kirsten, you look lovely.

643
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,828
Would you excuse us?
Some doctors wanna meet this fella.

644
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,911
That'd be great. Excuse me.

645
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,669
What's wrong?

646
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,239
Long story.

647
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,114
And now you have to watch
him work the crowd all night.

648
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,271
- And it's because of me.
- Julie, it's okay.

649
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,273
- I wouldn't have bailed on you.
- Then let me return the favor.

650
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,396
Come on, let's go hide out
by the crab dip.

651
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,835
Maybe we could flirt
with one of the bartenders.

652
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,198
- Hi.
- Hey.

653
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,272
I just wanted to see if you were okay.

654
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,151
Yeah. You bailed early too, huh?

655
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,388
Yeah.

656
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,512
Yeah, come in.

657
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,879
- So Berkeley didn't live up to the hype?
- Well, it's not really Berkeley's fault.

658
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,679
- I was asking a lot.
- To take you from every problem...

659
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,068
...you've ever had here?

660
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,913
Something like that.

661
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,998
So you don't have to tell me.

662
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,519
It's Theresa.

663
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,272
She did have a baby.

664
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,477
- Oh, my God.
- I haven't talked to her yet.

665
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,513
So I'm not sure...

666
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,240
...if I'm the father or not.
- What makes you think...

667
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,231
...you're the father and not Eddie?

668
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,629
Because when I was at Berkeley, l...

669
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,314
I just felt like I was
living somebody else's life.

670
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,518
And then I heard the news.

671
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,349
And I was, like... back to being me.

672
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,439
But when you were at Berkeley,
it felt right, didn't it?

673
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,955
I could see it on your face.

674
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,997
Yeah. Yeah, it did.

675
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,512
Well, then you'll get back there.

676
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,395
No matter what happens with Theresa.

677
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,114
Hello, everyone.

678
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,192
As the new guy in these circles,
I thank Neil and Julie...

679
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,079
...for inviting us here tonight.
I welcome you all...

680
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,800
...to lend your talent
and expertise to the new hospital.

681
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,633
Because I am gonna need
all the help I can get.

682
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,829
As you know, behind every successful
man is a very surprised woman.

683
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,639
I'd like you to meet the former head
of the Newport Group...

684
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,509
...and the brains behind the organization,
my lovely wife, Kirsten Cohen.

685
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,716
Kirsten, how do you think your husband
is doing running the Newport Group?

686
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,439
I guess she's still surprised.

687
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,909
I'd like to propose a toast.

688
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,119
To Sandy Cohen...

689
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,030
...who has told me countless times
over the last year...

690
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,078
...how important this hospital is to him.

691
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,429
Ouch.

692
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,633
You know, they say that when
you grow up, you marry your father.

693
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,880
I thought I'd escaped that.

694
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,754
Chardonnay?

695
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,670
Seth is going to Brown,
and he's dating Anna?

696
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,637
I know. Is your brain exploding?

697
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,632
A little.

698
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,678
- How did he explain himself?
- He didn't.

699
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,070
Well, he tried to.
But you know how I get, Coop.

700
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,276
The rage makes it hard to talk,
or listen.

701
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,159
Don't assume anything
until you hear what he has to say.

702
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,590
<i>You don 't know for sure they're dating.</i>

703
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,077
So how was Berkeley, was it amazing?

704
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,635
Yeah, I mean, it could be...

705
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,718
...if I was ready for it.

706
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,313
I just don't know that I am.

707
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,876
Well, I believe in you, Coop.

708
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,156
I'll see you in eight short hours, okay?

709
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,632
Okay. Bye.

710
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,671
I am beyond happy
for you right now.

711
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,435
I'm like Christmas-morning-
won-the-Iottery-level happy for you.

712
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,034
The RISD guy only said
he was impressed.

713
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,751
He said "very impressed." And in
these scenarios, "verys" are important.

714
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,593
- Well, if I get in, it's all because of you.
- No.

715
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,068
It's your comic book.

716
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,590
And your plane's about to leave.

717
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,354
Well, thank you. Really.

718
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,910
- All right.
- Okay.

719
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,032
See you soon. Call me.

720
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,428
Will do.

721
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,713
Ryan.

722
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,154
Hi.

723
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,638
I don't know how you found me.

724
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,150
- Look, I just need to know.
- He's not yours, Ryan.

725
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,073
Eddie's the father.

726
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,988
We got a paternity test and everything.

727
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,996
I'm sorry that I wasn't
honest with you...

728
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,596
...but I saw how your life opened up
when you met the Cohens, and l...

729
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,229
- Is Eddie helping you out?
- Are you kidding?

730
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,913
That bum.

731
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,670
I would have, you know,
for what it's worth.

732
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,512
- I know.
- Even if it hadn't been mine.

733
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,352
I know, that's why I didn't tell you.

734
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,110
But believe it or not,
I'm doing okay on my own.

735
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,669
- Yeah, seems like it. Saw the apartment.
- Yeah.

736
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,872
Yeah, I got a job at this hotel,
and then I got promoted.

737
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,598
And I got promoted again and again.

738
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,990
And suddenly I have myself a career.

739
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,792
And a kid. Daniel.

740
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,917
- Yeah.
- How is he?

741
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,957
How much time do you have?

742
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,792
I don't know. You wanna grab a bite?

743
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,359
You can tell me about him.

744
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,878
Yeah, I'd like that.

745
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,718
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

746
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,793
- It's good to see you again, Ryan.
- Yeah, it's good to see you.

747
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,951
