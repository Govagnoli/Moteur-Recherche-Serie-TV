1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,192
- <i>Previously on</i> The O. C:
- She came back...

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,634
...so I guess you're going home.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,030
- You're his mother.
- I'm a mess, not a mother.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,749
- You can't walk away.
- This way he ends up with a real mom.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,716
It's sweet that
you're concerned about this boy...

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,189
...but you need to focus on the future,
which means Luke.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,998
She chose you.
You're the one she wants.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,071
- I wanna sail to Tahiti.
- You're taking this to Tahiti?

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,753
- How much do you need?
- It's $100,000.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,798
The check that you guys gave Jimmy.
We needed that 100 grand.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,916
- Ryan's gonna stay with us now.
- Awesome.

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,355
We just got in way over our heads.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,073
- Oh, really? You think so?
- I do.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,798
We'll see about that, monkey pox.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,710
So the pupil has become the teacher.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,872
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,389
Who died?

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,915
Seth, we need to talk to Ryan.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,999
Okay.

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,153
If this has to do with the rug, I want to
say that Ryan had nothing to do with it.

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,719
What about the rug?

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,678
I'm gonna go now.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,073
So...

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,948
Kirsten and I went
to Child Services this morning...

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,749
...and we told them
that we want you to stay with us.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,794
But there's a catch.
Because you're a minor...

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,349
...the only way they're gonna
allow that to happen...

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,637
...is if we assume
all legal responsibility for you.

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,557
- I can't ask you guys to do that.
- You don't have to. We're asking you.

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,315
We've all talked about it,
and we want to be your legal guardians.

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,031
We want you to be part of the family.

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,629
If you wanna be.

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,914
What if it doesn't work?

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,513
Well, how do you mean?

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,671
What if something happens
and you guys change your mind?

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,319
Like what?

37
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,391
You steal a car?
You burn down a house?

38
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,120
You beat up the captain
of the water polo team?

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,191
Those ships have sailed, my friend.

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,592
You have to promise us you'll stay out
of trouble. From now on, no more fights.

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,153
You're still on probation, and Child
Services will be up our ass all the time.

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,273
No more trouble. I promise.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,228
Well...

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,315
- Welcome to the family.
- Thanks, guys.

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,995
Okay, Seth. You can come out now.

46
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,711
You knew about this
and didn't say anything.

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,154
I didn't wanna jinx it.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,875
Dude, you're a Cohen now.

49
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,191
Welcome to a life of insecurity
and paralyzing self-doubt.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,478
Yeah. Now all I have to do
is stay out of trouble.

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,512
Yeah, that could be...

52
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,033
...difficult.

53
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,309
You're gonna need
bedding and towels.

54
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,074
How's the bed, Ryan?
Is it comfortable?

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,034
Yeah, it's...

56
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,311
It's fine. It's great.

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,636
We want you to have your privacy,
but it's a pool house. It needs warmth.

58
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,633
You'll need chairs and a desk,
a bookshelf...

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,553
Plasma flat screen,
a couple of turntables, minibar.

60
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,594
And we should clean all this out so that
you have room for some of your...

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,233
Right, you don't have stuff, so we have
to buy clothes, shoes and underpants.

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,391
Mom, don't say "underpants."

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,118
I've got everything I need. Really.

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,397
I bet you don't have a tux.
Because you're gonna need one.

65
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,758
- For what?
- For cotillion.

66
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,117
It's the annual debutante ball.
It's Newport's biggest event.

67
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,554
Until whatever's next week.

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,439
It's the day when Newport's
most accomplished young women...

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,113
...make their debut into society.

70
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,874
Or another excuse for them
to get wasted and throw up.

71
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,794
I was a deb. I made my debut at this
very country club not so many years ago.

72
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,713
- The year was...
- Hey, watch it.

73
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,039
You know what?

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,914
- Maybe I should skip it.
- You have to go.

75
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,594
It's a family tradition.
And you're part of the family.

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,910
- Hello, dear.
- Hi, Peggy.

77
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,832
- How are you?
- I'm good.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,434
- How's it going?
- It will be fine.

79
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,990
- The fitting area's back there.
- Thank you.

80
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,196
Come on, boys. It'll be fun.

81
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,113
Sandy.

82
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,713
Hey, Jimmy.

83
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,592
Got some surfing in, huh?

84
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,558
Late court date. Gotta take advantage.

85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,711
I used to have hobbies.

86
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,838
Look, I know you're not thrilled
with me.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,073
When I borrowed the money from
Kirsten, I should have asked you.

88
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,471
- I wasn't going behind your back.
- Look, it's done. Let's move on.

89
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,029
I was afraid of what you'd think of me.

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,032
Losing as much money as I have...

91
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,876
...is not an impressive accomplishment.

92
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,191
- How much money did you lose?
- Look...

93
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,595
It's not important.

94
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,830
- How'd you lose it?
- The important thing is...

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,630
...I don't know what Julie and I would
do without friends like you and Kirsten.

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,914
So everything's okay?

97
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,594
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

98
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,910
- I'll see you around.
- See you.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,676
Okay, pick whatever you want.
We have Gucci, Armani. Versace's there.

100
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,433
Hi, I'm picking up for Marissa Cooper.

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,989
- Hey.
- Hey.

102
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,358
What are you doing here?

103
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,999
I...

104
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,276
...had an appointment
with my personal shopper.

105
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,313
But I thought you said
you were leaving with your mom.

106
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,113
It didn't really work out,
so I'm kind of living with the Cohens.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,309
- For good?
- Is that...

108
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,835
...gonna be a problem?
- No, no. It's great.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,036
I mean, I guess now
we can be friends, right?

110
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,354
Hey, Coop.

111
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,478
These gloves are giving me
serious sausage arms.

112
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,712
What are you still doing here?
I thought you were going back to Chino.

113
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,348
- I had a change of plans.
- Ryan's living here now.

114
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,595
- He's what?
- Look, I'm not here to cause problems.

115
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,159
Is everything all right?

116
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,038
- I'll be in the truck.
- Great.

117
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,071
Marissa, I was gonna call you.
Since you're lead deb...

118
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,798
Seth?

119
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,474
I wanted to introduce you
to a couple of white knights.

120
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,074
In case any of your girls
needed a last-minute escort.

121
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,674
- Okay.
- Every girl needs a white knight.

122
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,235
Seth Cohen, white knight.

123
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,519
So you'll be at the rehearsal?

124
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,432
Yes, absolutely.

125
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,038
See you then.

126
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,439
Bye.

127
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,670
Cotillion rocks.

128
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,233
You want me to fix you up with Ryan?
I thought you said he was a "psycho."

129
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,278
- That was before I got to know him.
- When did you get to know him?

130
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,589
Just now.

131
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,876
Plus there's that
whole brooding bad-boy thing.

132
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,110
He's wounded. I can save him.

133
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,511
Have you ever really talked to him?
He's not really a bad boy.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,194
Well, he will be by the time
I get through with him.

135
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,395
What? You're not, like,
into him, are you?

136
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,915
- I mean, you're with Luke, right?
- Right.

137
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,399
Good.

138
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,272
Sandy Cohen?

139
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,274
I'm with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Enforcement Division.

140
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,793
Okay.

141
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,315
I was hoping you could help me out
with a case.

142
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,035
Sure. What can I do for you?

143
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,392
Were you aware, Mr. Cohen,
that a check your wife made out...

144
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,712
...to a James Cooper for $100,000
was not treated as an investment...

145
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,110
...but as a deposit
into his personal account?

146
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,239
It wasn't an investment. It was a loan.
My wife and Jimmy are old...

147
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,675
- What's this about?
- Did you know Mr. Cooper is...

148
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,308
...the subject of an
SEC fraud investigation?

149
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,873
No.

150
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,599
No, I didn't.

151
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,277
Hey. White gloves,
ready for a comeback.

152
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,635
Hey. What are you doing home?

153
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,511
Fellas, do you mind?

154
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,513
- Lf this is about the vase...
- Which vase?

155
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,789
Nothing. Let's go, Ryan.
Come on, buddy.

156
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,074
What's going on?

157
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,470
Okay. So...

158
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,791
I think I'm not going to cotillion.

159
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,678
Yeah, okay. Except that you are.

160
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,877
I made a promise to your parents
that I'd stay out of trouble.

161
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,429
It's a debutante ball.
What trouble can you get into?

162
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,953
Why don't you ask Luke.

163
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,670
Ryan, we're white knights, okay?

164
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,877
That means Marissa probably
already has some sad, Ionely girl...

165
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,237
...lined up for you to escort,
so you can't cancel at the last minute.

166
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,038
That's a faux pas, buddy.

167
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,474
- Would you call her?
- No.

168
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,918
If you're gonna bail on Marissa and some
poor, pathetic, dateless girl...

169
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,310
...you'll just have to
do that one yourself.

170
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,273
Are you sure?

171
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,876
These guys say Jimmy's been siphoning
money out of his clients' accounts...

172
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,837
...to cover his own debts.

173
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,274
- How could we not know this?
- Because we trusted him. Everybody did.

174
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,796
This entire community wrote him blank
checks. You gave him 100 grand.

175
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,188
It was just a loan.

176
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,591
Which, according to the SEC,
makes us worth investigating too.

177
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,671
I'm gonna be sick.

178
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,155
I'm gonna have to call our friends
and let them know.

179
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,551
Sandy, wait.
You're just gonna panic people.

180
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,029
Don't do anything
until I talk to him, okay?

181
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,873
Put your feelings for him aside.
Forget about your history.

182
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,190
He's one of my oldest friends.

183
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,400
If it's true, I just need
to hear it from him.

184
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,074
<i>I'm coming.</i>

185
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,355
Hey. You're...

186
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,112
...at my house.
- I...

187
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,794
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about cotillion.

188
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,678
Oh. Okay, well...

189
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,992
I was just trying this on,
and I can't seem to reach the...

190
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,479
Did you want me to...?

191
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,312
I could... Do you want me to...?

192
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,070
Yeah. You know, actually,
if you wouldn't mind.

193
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,753
Thanks.

194
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,317
So, what's up with cotillion?

195
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,876
What time did you want me there?

196
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,596
I'm... I'm so sorry.

197
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,513
I never meant for you
to be dragged in like this.

198
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,390
How did this happen? I understand
a couple of bad investments, but theft?

199
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,028
- Theft? No, no.
- Okay, honey, so we're gonna...

200
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,918
- Oh, Kirsten.
- Julie.

201
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,672
- Jimmy didn't say you were coming by.
- She just had a quick business question.

202
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,115
- A quickie, huh?
- Julie.

203
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,590
I'm kidding. So we're off.
Kaitlin needs new shoes for cotillion.

204
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,275
Then we're test-driving the CLK, then I
have to re-up Marissa's tennis lessons.

205
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,795
- So which credit card should I use?
- The MasterCard.

206
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,316
- What about the Amex?
- No, don't use the Amex. The...

207
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,833
Get the miles.

208
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,519
Okay.

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,513
You two have fun.

210
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,679
Well, now that the how and why
have been accounted for...

211
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,868
Look, I was not stealing.
I was borrowing to pay back my debts.

212
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,349
And then the market took a turn,
and there we are.

213
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,999
You were stealing.

214
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,518
I... I can't say no to my family.
I'll pay everything back.

215
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,956
- I just need that one stock. That one.
- Jimmy, you need help.

216
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,595
Yeah, well, who's gonna help me?

217
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,312
So, what exactly happens
at this rehearsal?

218
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,630
Just stupid cotillion stuff.

219
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,314
Bowing and curtsying.

220
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,870
One, two, three. One, two, three.

221
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,237
Try to enjoy this, please.

222
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,755
Dancing? You didn't tell me
there was dancing.

223
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,832
Well, if I'd told you there was dancing,
I'd be here by myself.

224
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,479
Because I really...

225
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,039
...don't dance.

226
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,191
Neither do I. I just move well.

227
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,110
Want me to teach you that one?

228
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,038
- Maybe later. You ready?
- Take your places.

229
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,437
Hey, guys.
So can I introduce you to your debs?

230
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,238
We've already met.

231
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,030
Oh, well, actually, Summer, Ryan's
already been promised to someone else.

232
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,077
You gave him to someone else?

233
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,074
Who? Who's pathetic enough not
to have a date the day before cotillion?

234
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,198
Actually, at this point,
that would be you.

235
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,319
So, Anna Stern, this is Ryan Atwood.
Anna just moved here from Pittsburgh.

236
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,072
Pittsburgh?

237
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,389
Can we just get this over with?

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,752
<i>Caliente.</i>

239
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,837
- Hey, it's not that bad.
- You haven't seen me dance.

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,752
Well, I can help you.

241
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,480
So, like, what am I supposed to do?

242
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,392
Over here.

243
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,679
Fine. Let's go.

244
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,910
Are you sure? Because if you're not...

245
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,594
Just don't talk to me.

246
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,116
All right, I get it. Our...
Our connection's deeper than words.

247
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,951
That's it. I'm done. I'm sorry.
Chock-full of quiet now.

248
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,511
Okay. So you guys will be over here.

249
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,148
If you want to,
go ahead and get into waltz position.

250
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,636
Which means, Anna, you put
your left hand on Ryan's shoulder.

251
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,069
No, not like that. Here, watch.

252
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,715
Okay? Now, Ryan, you put
your right hand on my back.

253
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,952
Lower.

254
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,231
Okay. Good.

255
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,914
Good.

256
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,718
I'd be pretty jealous right now...

257
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,479
...if Chino wasn't gay.

258
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,072
- Luke.
- What? No, it doesn't bother me.

259
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,514
He was born that way, right?

260
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,716
Thanks. I think
we can take it from here.

261
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,552
Okay.

262
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,835
You're into her, huh?

263
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,117
Man, are you in trouble.

264
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,398
- I know.
- Yeah.

265
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,959
- Yeah.
- Come on.

266
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,431
All right, darlings, listen up.

267
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,036
Let's review the classic waltz step.
Phillip?

268
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,273
And...

269
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,793
One, two, three.

270
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,313
One, two, three.

271
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,038
One, two, three.

272
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,270
One, two, three. Smile, please.

273
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,319
- That kid is stalking you.
- He is not. He's my neighbor.

274
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,675
And he's not going anywhere,
so get used to him.

275
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,356
What I'll never get used to is that kid
macking on you when I turn my back.

276
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,670
So you don't trust me?

277
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,118
No, I...

278
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,359
I don't trust anybody else.
Not around you.

279
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,557
- Wait.
- Slow down.

280
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,188
Are you the kid from Chino
who steals cars...

281
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,669
...and sets people's houses on fire?

282
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,679
You're saying I'm making my debut into
society with Newport's most wanted?

283
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,149
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- I can't wait.

284
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,837
Absolutely not.

285
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,278
As happy as I am that you came all
the way out to my office to visit me...

286
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,395
...the answer is no.

287
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,394
Corey! I need that file
on <i>Nerodner v. Caplin.</i>

288
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,154
- And I need the INS report on my 4:30.
- Yes, sir.

289
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,073
I got a two-time drug offender
they want to deport. 15 years old.

290
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,832
Sandy, he needs help.

291
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,197
Jimmy Cooper? He stole from his clients,
he stole from his friends...

292
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,433
...and then he had the nerve to borrow
$100,000 from us to cover it up.

293
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,909
He was trying to provide for his family.

294
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,479
Yeah. Boats, ponies...

295
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,108
- You'll defend a drug offender, but...?
- Yes.

296
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,792
My clients are kids who have
no hope, no guidance, nothing.

297
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,396
Jimmy Cooper is just another
spoiled Newport brat...

298
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,198
...who had everything handed to him.

299
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,635
- Like me.
- No. Not like you.

300
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,792
You would never lie.
You would never steal.

301
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,030
I'd like to think that, but the truth is...

302
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,078
...there isn't anything
that I wouldn't do for my family.

303
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,158
See you at home.

304
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,431
- Three hours of dancing.
- I feel like I could go for three more.

305
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,477
Ryan. So Anna seemed nice.

306
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,154
I mean, I just figured she's new
and you're new, so...

307
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,074
- Yeah.
- Great. Good.

308
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,434
Holl, I was about to tell them
about the cookout tonight.

309
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,955
It's at my house.
I do it every year for cotillion.

310
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,714
- You didn't do it last year.
- Yeah, we did.

311
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,709
Ouch.

312
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,108
- See you tonight.
- Bye.

313
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,599
See you there.

314
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,955
You really think
that's such a great idea?

315
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,679
Yeah, I do.

316
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,913
You're living here now, and there's no
reason why we all can't hang out, right?

317
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,073
- I can think of a reason.
- Yeah. I'm not going.

318
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,470
- I don't want to go alone.
- Summer will be there.

319
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,030
Yeah, I'm still going. I would just prefer
not to go alone. Listen to me.

320
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,034
We're like brothers now, okay?
That means we do stuff for each other.

321
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,749
If you do this for me, later on
I'll be able to do something for you.

322
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,276
I don't know what it's going to be yet,
but it's gonna be awesome.

323
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,629
Please?

324
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,758
Okay, here we are.
Thank you very much. Okay.

325
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,276
Here we go, sweetheart.
Make sure we got everything.

326
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,750
Hey, Jimmy Cooper.
Just the man I wanted to see.

327
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,150
- Hey, Greg. Hey, Holly.
- Hey, Mr. Cooper.

328
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,514
Somebody's having a party.

329
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,319
Holly's hosting this thing for the debs
out at the beach house.

330
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,278
That's right. Marissa's going.
Have a good time.

331
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,238
Honey, take these down to the car.
I'll be right there. Okay?

332
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,994
Hi, I'm picking up for Cooper.

333
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,357
Listen, Jimmy. I haven't heard back
from you. Did you get my messages?

334
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,589
Yeah, I'm sorry.

335
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,991
You know, work has been so crazy.
But what's going on?

336
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,038
I've been asked to invest
in a commercial real-estate property.

337
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,077
It could be a nice second income for us.

338
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,596
It might be our only income, the way
the pharmaceutical industry's going.

339
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,149
- That sounds promising.
- Yeah.

340
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,393
So we're gonna have to pull $250,000
out of the investment account.

341
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,235
Are you sure you wanna do that,
with the market about to turn around?

342
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,632
Sir? I'm sorry,
but your credit card's been declined.

343
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,469
Oh, it's a new card,
and I forgot to activate it.

344
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,471
Did you want to use another card?

345
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,231
Dad, I'm gonna be late
to my own party.

346
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,594
Okay, honey.

347
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,639
I'll call you tomorrow about the details.
Just bring the check to the cotillion.

348
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,279
Enjoy your meal.

349
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,835
I'll just pay with cash.

350
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,030
Give me 10 minutes to find Summer,
lock it down for tomorrow.

351
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,315
See where the night takes me.

352
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,074
- Better take you back here in 10 minutes.
- Don't wait up.

353
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,437
Come on. Two Jack Johnson tickets,
a massage at Burke Williams...

354
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,832
...and all the money I have on me,
which is $11.

355
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,355
Sorry, Summer,
I don't want to trade escorts.

356
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,472
- Hey, Summer.
- What did I say about talking to me?

357
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,555
Okay. I just wanted to make sure
we're still on for tomorrow night.

358
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,199
I guess.

359
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,670
Could you even pretend
to be a little bit stoked?

360
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,118
Fair enough.

361
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,556
You're a really good barbecue-tionist.

362
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,599
There it is.

363
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,672
Oh, jeez!

364
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,073
You lost a bet. You lost a bet.
You've got to pay up.

365
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,518
You sure you want to be seen with me?

366
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,196
Hey, I'm glad you came. I mean,
how could you possibly miss all this?

367
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,037
- I'm gonna go.
- Hey, we're not doing anything wrong.

368
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,909
Well, now that you've moved in, I see
you're making yourself right at home.

369
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,116
Luke, come on.
You said you were gonna try.

370
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,432
I'm trying. I'm trying to understand
why there's all these people here...

371
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,115
...and you only want to talk to her.
- Hey, I wanted to talk to him.

372
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,716
Look, babe, why don't you go talk
to Summer, all right? She looks Ionely.

373
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,348
Or you can,
and I'll finish talking to Ryan.

374
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,150
No, it's okay. I'm just gonna go.

375
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,788
- No. Stay.
- What are you doing? Don't tell him that.

376
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,270
- Don't tell her what to do.
- I thought you were leaving.

377
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,351
Why don't I just help you out.

378
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,279
I'm not gonna fight.

379
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,150
- Even if I do this?
- Luke!

380
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,031
Oh, God. Are you okay?

381
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,830
God, Luke, you're such an idiot.

382
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,596
You just got your butt kicked and didn't
fight back. Dude, you really are a Cohen.

383
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,352
Yeah. Let's get you home.

384
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,830
What are you doing?
Why aren't you dressed yet?

385
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,231
I'm not going. Would you let Anna know?
She'll probably be relieved.

386
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,595
Are you not going
because you're afraid of Luke?

387
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,955
That's not what I'm afraid of.

388
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,872
Look, your parents taking me in is the
greatest thing that's happened to me.

389
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,793
I'm not gonna lose it
just to kick some guy's ass.

390
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,474
- You could totally kick his ass, right?
- Oh, yeah.

391
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,039
Cool.

392
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,915
All right. Well...

393
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,753
...have fun.

394
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,433
Sweetie, I need to borrow
your lip gloss.

395
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,239
Oh, I love this dress.

396
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,789
Really? Maybe you should wear it.

397
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,317
You're sweet, but I think we both know
I'm no longer a size 0.

398
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,789
Give me a few more months
on the Zone.

399
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,076
I don't think I want to go.

400
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,789
I'm sorry, I thought I heard you say you
don't want to go to your own cotillion.

401
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,428
Look, Luke and I
got in a fight last night, okay?

402
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,909
So you got into a fight.
You've had fights before.

403
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,798
You guys have been together forever.

404
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,315
Maybe that's the problem.

405
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,751
I mean, what if
there's someone else out there?

406
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,036
Like who? That boy from Chino?

407
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,354
Do you want to end up like Aunt Cindy,
with four kids in a trailer park?

408
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,317
She broke my mom's heart.
You won't break mine.

409
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,597
- So now this is about you?
- No, sweetie, it's about you.

410
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,797
- What future is there with that boy?
- Mom, I'm 16.

411
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,475
The choices you make when you're 16
can affect your entire future.

412
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,997
Luke is from a good family. If you stay
with him, you'll always be comfortable.

413
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,789
- I'm comfortable now.
- Nothing in life is certain.

414
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,919
- What does that mean?
- It means you'll put on this dress...

415
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,198
...do your hair like I showed you and
make your debut into society with Luke.

416
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,679
I can't.

417
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,639
I'm sorry.

418
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,789
No, you're not.

419
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,310
But you will be.

420
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,350
What are you doing?
Why aren't you dressed?

421
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,909
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean, you're not going?

422
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,911
I don't feel like getting dressed up...

423
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,594
...and pretending Jimmy Cooper
is the O.C. Golden boy.

424
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,194
And any community that makes that guy
a hero is not one I feel like being part of.

425
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,189
You're not going either?

426
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,079
- I wanted to leave 20 minutes ago.
- Let's go.

427
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,038
- Dad, why aren't you...?
- Seth. Now.

428
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,313
I don't know.
Maybe I shouldn't go either.

429
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,677
What? What is wrong with this family?

430
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,037
This is cotillion, the most
important event of the year.

431
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,952
Am I the only one who gets it?

432
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,872
I get it, Mommy.

433
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,873
Daddy, it's Mr. Fisher again.
He's called, like, three times.

434
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,157
No. We do not have time
for you two to talk business.

435
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,074
Tell Greg Daddy will see him
at the cotillion. Right, Jimmy?

436
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,990
All right.

437
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,549
Come on. We don't wanna be late.

438
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,711
You guys know Anna Stern?

439
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,313
Seth.

440
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,235
Wow.

441
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,553
- You think?
- Yes...

442
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,679
...I do. Which makes this
even harder to say.

443
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,356
Anna, just know that, in life,
there are peaks and...

444
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,033
Ryan's not coming, is he?

445
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,998
Kind of took the wind
out of my sails there, but yes.

446
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,279
- Are you okay?
- I'll survive.

447
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,874
- Hey.
- Hey.

448
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,710
- Thought you were going to cotillion.
- I thought you were.

449
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,633
Yeah. No.

450
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,831
Yeah, me neither.

451
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,433
- Which one's sword?
- Not the one you're hitting.

452
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,319
- Got it.
- Okay, now you're stabbing me.

453
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,790
Just don't touch any of the buttons.
Follow me through the forest...

454
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,713
...and maybe we'll both make it
out of here alive.

455
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,715
So you didn't feel like going, huh?

456
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,678
Yeah. No, not really for me.

457
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,116
What? Waltzing and orchids?
What could be more you?

458
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,191
Guess I don't really fit in, huh?

459
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,590
Oh, I got news for you. Nobody does.

460
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,508
I guarantee you every single person
at that cotillion feels like a fraud.

461
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,389
They've all got secrets, and they're all
terrified the neighbors will find out.

462
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,958
What's your secret?

463
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,239
Sometimes, when the sun's
coming up and the surf is good...

464
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,393
...and I haven't pissed my wife off
quite as much as I have today...

465
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,237
...I kind of like this place.

466
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,592
You just stabbed me again.

467
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,788
Sorry.

468
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,473
I can't believe you're not coming.

469
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,236
It's just after the whole Luke and Ryan
thing last night, I don't feel...

470
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,753
Coop...

471
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,194
...Ryan isn't even here.

472
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,873
He's not?

473
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,070
Yeah, well, even so.

474
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,039
I'm just not up for it.

475
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,558
She's not coming.

476
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,990
So, what did I get all dressed up for?

477
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,117
I mean, whatever you think about
the whole superhero movie genre...

478
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,794
...at least people are now reading
the source material.

479
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,476
I cannot believe that you read
comic books. I mean, you're a girl.

480
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,518
What's that supposed to mean?
And I call them "graphic novels."

481
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,116
In fact, if more people did, maybe
the form wouldn't be so marginalized.

482
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,191
I couldn't agree more.

483
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,672
Summer, are you ready?
You look just great.

484
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,319
So listen...

485
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,432
You...

486
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,832
...found another date.
- Yeah.

487
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,912
It's kind of an emergency,
but you're off the hook.

488
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,714
- Sorry.
- No, that's...

489
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,352
That's fine.

490
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,029
- Hey.
- Hey.

491
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,188
You're not at cotillion.

492
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,188
Neither are you.

493
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,990
Look, I hope you didn't not go
because of last night or...

494
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,913
...because of me.

495
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,633
How come you're not going?

496
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,477
So you think hiding out, staying home
is gonna make everything better?

497
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,435
Seems to be working for you.

498
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,675
I'll go if you go.

499
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,234
Ryan, come on. Check this out. I have
totally annihilated all the other ninjas.

500
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,152
I'm already on to the...

501
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,278
Marissa. Hello.

502
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,199
Hey.

503
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,598
So we're gonna go.

504
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,794
To cotillion.

505
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,789
I'll get the car.

506
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,075
Hey, Jimmy, there you are.

507
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,312
- Greg, how you doing?
- I'll be better once I get that check...

508
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,313
...get this property deal closed,
get my wife off my back.

509
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,597
- I don't have it.
- What do you mean? Did you forget it?

510
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,594
This isn't the time or place. Stop by the
office tomorrow, and we'll talk about it.

511
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,830
Talk about it? Talk about what?

512
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,153
- Excuse me.
- Jimmy...

513
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,870
I don't believe it.

514
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,791
You told Summer you weren't coming.
Now you're here with him?

515
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,349
- Ryan and I aren't here together.
- I'm not an idiot.

516
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,511
Then listen to her
and stop acting like one.

517
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,272
What did you say?

518
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,712
- Forget it.
- No, what did you say? Come on, man.

519
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,393
Luke, stop it.

520
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,400
I'm over this. We're done.

521
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,678
Hey, look who decided to show up.

522
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,196
Don't worry, your hit man already
took care of it. I didn't feel a thing.

523
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,239
I'm here now, if you want to...

524
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,434
No, too late. You missed your shot.

525
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,195
I guess you'll have to go
with Princess Mononoke over there.

526
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,035
- And what are you gonna do?
- Oh, so now you care? Go.

527
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,315
Marissa, if you'd just stuck
to the original plan...

528
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,119
- Sorry. Do you want Daddy to go find...?
- No, Mom.

529
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,034
- You can't debut without an escort.
- I hear there's a white knight available.

530
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,513
Well, that's very nice of you to offer,
but I don't think it's appropriate.

531
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,272
I'll go get dressed.

532
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,436
Could you be any more pathetic?

533
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,990
A Ione figure sitting on the floor...

534
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,072
...wondering if he'll be Ionely
for the rest of his life.

535
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,200
Hey, your sensitivity, it's really...

536
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,750
...nonexistent.
- You know what your problem is?

537
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,956
You're not a man.

538
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,031
Again, not appreciating
the brutal honesty.

539
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,952
Do you know what girls find sexy?

540
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,554
Nope. Wait, let me guess.

541
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,998
- Dudes who play water polo.
- Confidence. Watch this.

542
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,909
- Seth?
- Yes?

543
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,594
I don't have a date to the cotillion.

544
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,917
Would you be my escort?

545
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,278
I mean...

546
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,954
Confidence, Cohen.

547
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,870
Let's do this.

548
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,795
Hair's good, makeup's good. Very nice.
Stand up straight. Gum, please.

549
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,949
How did this happen?

550
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,317
How did I go from having three dates
to cotillion to having none?

551
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,835
I'm sorry, girl. That blows.

552
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,157
Good news. I'm available again.

553
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,113
You are?

554
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,077
No. No. We're gonna go this way. No.

555
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,072
Five hundred channels and nothing on.

556
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,275
You couldn't put on a tux?

557
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,829
Pick your battles, honey.

558
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,357
Good evening, everyone.

559
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:14,470
And welcome to the 47th annual
Newport Beach Debutante Cotillion.

560
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,754
Hey.

561
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,991
Are you ready to make your debut?

562
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,878
Holly Fisher,
daughter of Greg and Marianne Fisher.

563
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,951
Anna Stern,
daughter of Cameron and Patricia Stern.

564
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,272
Marissa Cooper,
daughter of James and Julie Cooper.

565
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,272
- I love you, kiddo.
- I love you too, Daddy.

566
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,839
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

567
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,357
...please join me in congratulating
this year's debutantes.

568
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,996
We never finished our conversation.

569
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,390
I gotta tell you,
you got me a little concerned.

570
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,757
Believe me, it's nothing
that can't wait until tomorrow.

571
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,472
Don't the girls look beautiful?

572
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,997
I hate dancing.

573
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,309
Thanks.

574
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,153
No, with you, it's...

575
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,356
It's not horrible.

576
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,632
You're sweet.

577
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,315
- Are you leading?
- I'm trying.

578
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,153
Attitude. I like that.

579
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,915
I've put in an offer. I got a mortgage,
the kids are in private school.

580
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,877
If there's a problem, I need to know.

581
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,110
Now is not the time.

582
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,349
Jimmy, where's my money?

583
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,311
I asked you a question.
Where's my money?

584
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,199
I didn't want you to find out
this way, but I don't have it.

585
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,430
- What?
- I will, but I don't have it right now.

586
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,273
- Lf you don't have my money, who does?
- Hey, look.

587
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,750
I promise I'm working on it, all right?
There's been some bad investments.

588
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,751
Are you telling me you lost everything?

589
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,593
Would you just keep it down?

590
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,275
I won't keep it down. That is my money.
My retirement, my kids' tuition!

591
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,829
- I'm sorry.
- Son of a bitch!

592
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,555
- Oh, my God.
- You're a thief! You took my money!

593
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,994
Greg!

594
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,678
I want my money back, you hear me?

595
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,598
Get off me!

596
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,871
You're a thief! You're a thief!

597
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,195
- Get off me.
- Go outside.

598
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,430
- He's a thief! You're a thief!
- Leave. Please.

599
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,749
- Come on.
- He's a thief!

600
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,433
Dad!

601
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,272
Take it outside. Come on.

602
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,397
I haven't seen you
in a fight since...

603
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,676
...ever.
- Now you know why.

604
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,593
What are you talking about?
He sucker-punched you.

605
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,671
You didn't have to jump in like that,
defend Jimmy.

606
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,070
Well, I've always had this thing
for the underdog.

607
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,274
After I fill out the police report, maybe
we should go and see how he's doing.

608
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,198
Hi.

609
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,630
So, sorry. I know I promised
I wouldn't get into any fights.

610
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,473
We can make an exception
in this case.

611
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,315
The police, however, will have questions.
As your attorney, I advise you...

612
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,594
...get out of here.
- Thanks.

613
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,199
Hey.

614
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,158
You don't mind if I walk
your date home, do you?

615
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,952
- No.
- Cool.

616
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,999
That's quite a debut you had tonight.
You know how to present yourself.

617
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,913
Finally, a Cohen who can throw down.

618
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,638
You wanna come with us?

619
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,512
- I'll just see you at home.
- See you at home.

620
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,950
So do you think
that I'll get to see you again?

621
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,910
- No.
- Okay.

622
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,399
No, it's just...

623
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,596
I know this might sound kind of...

624
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,478
...whatever...

625
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,438
...but I'm spending the rest
of the summer on a sailing trip.

626
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,716
To Tahiti.

627
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,077
- You like sailing?
- Yeah.

628
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,478
You okay?

629
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,351
What happened in there?

630
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,352
I don't know.

631
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,150
What's gonna happen now?

632
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,319
I don't know.

633
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,311
Come on, let's go.

634
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,199
Come on.

635
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,953
Came as soon as I heard.

636
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,112
Are you...?

637
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,353
I'm sorry.

638
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,510
Can I take you home?

639
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,754
- We could talk, maybe.
- I...

640
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,317
I just need to be alone right now.

641
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,313
Thanks.
