1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,113
Previously on The O. C.:

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,396
Promise me you will not say
anything to him.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,397
-Get out.
-I've gotten a hotel room.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,437
You have a week to find
somewhere to live.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,319
If I have to sacrifice our friendship
to be with Summer, I'll do it.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,595
So it's war.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,432
I'm worried about how much
you're drinking.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,795
-I love you.
-Pull over, and I'll come get you.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,678
Ryan.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,518
Ryan.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,198
Hey, Ryan.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,317
-What time is it?
-It's 5:30-ish.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,198
You're showing up earlier and earlier.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,318
Yeah, well, we have a lot of ground
to cover, so I figured...

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,153
...since we're both up,
we may as well get a jump on it.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,788
Yeah, no. We've been over this.
Summer doesn't want you.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,394
She doesn't want Zach.
All there is to it.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,598
Good night.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,109
-Something occurred to me. A wrinkle.
-The prom?

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,874
Yeah, and I have convince Summer
to go with me.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,989
We must partake in the magical rite
of passage known as the prom.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,754
Oh, yeah, you mean people
getting drunk, making out...

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,309
-...throwing up on the gym floor?
-No, I mean romance.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,472
I mean tuxedos, corsages, limousines.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,279
I don't know. I don't see Summer
buying into the prom thing.

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,194
You're wrong. Summer's fantasized
about prom since fifth grade.

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,033
-How do you know that?
-Sat behind her in computer class.

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,875
I really honed my eavesdropping skills
that year. The point is, Summer's...

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,238
...forever dreamt of going to the prom,
and I would dream of going with her.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,552
You need to get that out of your mind.
If it helps, I don't think I'm gonna go.

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,429
Just because you saw Trey leaving
doesn't mean they're hooking up.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,114
-What does it mean?
-Maybe he went to borrow something.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,840
Like a book.
Or one of her newsboy caps.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,230
-Y eah, maybe they hooked up.
-Okay, you're just...

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,709
...married to the worst possible
scenario, huh?

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,872
I'm gonna talk to her about it today,
but whatever happened...

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,156
...she seems dead set
on keeping it from me.

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,671
-Kind of early for a phone call.
-Kind of early for a lot of things.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,114
Hello?

40
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,633
Dad, what are--?

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,438
Where are you?

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,957
Oh, my God.

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,316
Okay. Yeah.

44
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,833
We'll be right there.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,911
-What is it?
-My mom got in a car accident.

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,957
She's at the hospital.

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,952
Oh, honey. I am so glad you're okay.

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,034
I'm so sorry.

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,159
We'll get through this.

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,717
I promise.

51
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,436
They had to cut it off.

52
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,750
Well, you were due
for an upgrade anyway.

53
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,712
Mom, are you okay?

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,752
Oh, I'm fine.

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,356
The doctor says she has a concussion,
but, fortunately, no internal injuries.

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,431
-What happened?
-Talking on the cell phone.

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,989
Stupid. Thank God for airbags.

58
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,595
-Well, is there anything we can do?
-Oh, not a thing.

59
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,071
I'll just probably spend the day
on the couch.

60
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,153
Well, under the circumstances, I'll lift
my parental ban on my DVD collection.

61
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,912
-What an honor.
-lt is.

62
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,640
You can watch anything you want.
House of Flying Daggers...

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,233
...Evil Dead II.

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,598
If you must, X-Men 1 and 2,
but you gotta do 1 first.

65
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,558
-I kind of like 1--
-That's sort of the catch. No, 2's better.

66
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,830
I don't know what to tell you, Sandy.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,116
She blew a.08.

68
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,638
Look, maybe....

69
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,512
Maybe I read it wrong.
Maybe it was a.07.

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,679
-I'm not asking you to do that.
-Just promise you'll get her some help.

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,674
It's an underwater theme?

72
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,718
Yeah, but it turns out that's a lot
more work than I thought.

73
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,235
Do you have any idea how to make
a papier-mâché octopus?

74
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,076
No, but maybe Ryan could bring
you one instead of a corsage.

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,715
I don't think Ryan's gonna be
bringing me anything.

76
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,156
But you guys are going
to prom together, right?

77
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,312
-I wouldn't count on it.
-Coop, did I miss something?

78
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,040
Because for, like, a blip,
you guys actually seemed happy.

79
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,794
-It's complicated.
-It's you and Ryan. It's supposed to be.

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,350
-Can we not talk about this anymore?
-Yeah.

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,511
-Coop, are you okay?
-Fine. I'm fine.

82
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,035
So everyone's saying you're
gonna be voted prom queen.

83
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,270
Isn't that your fifth-grade dream
coming true?

84
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,749
No. My dream involved an actual date.

85
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,673
A hot guy in a tux with a carnation
pinned to his lapel.

86
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,513
Instead I'm drawing straws between
Nerdboy and Assclown.

87
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,750
-So, what are you gonna do, not go?
-Exactly.

88
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,480
If I go, I have to decide
between Seth and Zach.

89
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,074
Fast-forward to prom.
There's me standing alone while...

90
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,196
...they wrestle like two girls
in a mud pit.

91
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,352
I'm building the lost city of Atlantis
out of streamers and tape.

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,272
-You gotta at least show up.
-Fine.

93
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,796
If you work out your mysterious issues
with Ryan, then maybe I'll go.

94
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,913
I wouldn't hold my breath.

95
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,358
So how is she?

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,195
Well, the doctor says she'll be fine.
She's resting now.

97
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,033
I should've seen this coming.

98
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,510
So she's been hitting the bottle hard.
It's been a rough couple of weeks...

99
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,716
...for everyone, even me.

100
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,795
Okay, I'll bite.

101
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,750
-So, what's the problem?
-Sandy...

102
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,673
...I did not come here
to talk about myself.

103
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,517
But as long as we're on the subject,
I could kind of use your advice.

104
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,277
Hey, if this involves you being naked,
please, you gotta warn me.

105
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,192
It's my prenup.

106
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,668
It says if you and Caleb have been
married for a year...

107
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,876
...you get $3 million at least.

108
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,953
If you have been married for less
than a year, you get nothing.

109
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,909
Eleven months, 27 days. Why do you
think he's in such a rush to divorce me?

110
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,435
I'm not surprised. He's a wily old guy.

111
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,592
He's a cheap son of a bitch who
wants to throw me out on the street.

112
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,036
-You've gotta find a loophole.
-I don't know, Julie. This looks ironclad.

113
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,836
All Caleb has to do is file the papers
by Monday with the county clerk.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,719
Unless you can figure out a way
to stop him...

115
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,677
...you're out of luck.

116
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,753
Hey.

117
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,429
-Cohen.
-Dude.

118
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,149
I'm so sorry about the launch.
I had a Bruce Banner moment.

119
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,880
Yeah. Yeah, we're both to blame.
Let's put it behind us.

120
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,632
-Okay, like it never happened.
-Yeah.

121
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,313
I'm going this way.

122
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,710
-You think Summer's willing to forget it?
-Sure.

123
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,110
If she sees how mature
we're being, right?

124
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,430
Look how much we've grown.
We're shaking hands...

125
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,910
-...we're using brains instead of brawn.
-We're not ruled by Y chromosomes.

126
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,354
No, we're civilized gentlemen.

127
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,796
We can handle any situation
with grace and dignity.

128
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,034
Here comes our first test.

129
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,794
Summer, hey.
We were both just talking and--

130
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,599
Save it, Cohen.
I'm done listening to your excuses.

131
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,320
Summer, we're really sorry.
Are you willing to forgive us?

132
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,790
Nope. Don't want to forgive you,
but prom is tomorrow night.

133
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,076
And I have wanted to go my whole life.

134
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,596
So I'm not gonna let our demented
little threesome ruin that for me.

135
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,830
So I'm going with one of you.

136
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,515
-Which one of us are you gonna take?
-Don't care.

137
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,558
I am too pissed off and tired to choose,
so you're gonna decide.

138
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,837
Don't care how, but tomorrow
I will be at my house in a dress...

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,719
...and one of you will pick me up.
Got it? Good.

140
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,398
My dress is a magenta color, so my
corsage should be in that general family.

141
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,076
-Dude, she's hanging by a thread.
-Yeah, I'll take one for the team.

142
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,754
-I'll take her to prom.
-No way. Why do you get to go?

143
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,356
Because, dude, I saw her first.

144
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,910
That doesn't make sense.

145
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,638
Sure it does.

146
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,156
I got a text message from Reed. She
wants to meet us at the diner for lunch.

147
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,118
Dude, the ladies are all over us,
but not in a good way.

148
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,999
Okay, listen. I say we go to the diner,
we meet with Reed.

149
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,550
-We deal with this Summer thing later.
-All right. One battle at a time.

150
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,750
-What is that?
-It's the best facility on the West Coast.

151
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,434
-You're sending me to rehab?
-I'm asking you...

152
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,318
...to get help.

153
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,040
Nobody needs to know.
We can say you're taking a trip.

154
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,237
-ln this town, a trip is always rehab.
-All I care about is you.

155
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,516
You don't have to worry.
I'm done with drinking.

156
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,113
Just like that, huh?

157
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,039
Last night scared me.

158
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,232
You don't snap your fingers and
make something like this disappear.

159
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,030
Well, you do when you could lose
everything, and last night I almost did.

160
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,039
Look.

161
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,234
I'm going to the kitchen now, and I'm
gonna pour out every drop in this house.

162
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,912
-Are you coming?
-Right behind you.

163
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,271
-Marissa.
-Hey.

164
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,920
Look, I know there's something
going on, so just tell me.

165
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,753
-Tell you what?
-I saw Trey leaving your house last night.

166
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,120
-It's not what you think.
-I asked you what happened...

167
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,874
...when I was in Miami,
and you're not talking...

168
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,474
-...so I'm taking my best guess.
-Which is?

169
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,799
You and Trey.

170
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,916
What, you think we hooked up?

171
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,356
-Thanks for the vote of confidence.
-You've been strange since I got back.

172
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,159
Trey's avoiding me.
What am I supposed to think?

173
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,676
-You should give me a little more credit.
-Okay, fine.

174
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,953
Tell me.

175
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,754
I didn't hook up with him.

176
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,356
And if you don't believe me, why don't
you ask your brother what happened?

177
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,514
I understand you're probably
a little bit upset about the launch.

178
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,756
Well, I think one day pretty soon we're
all gonna have a good laugh about this.

179
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,879
I know that day feels far off.
But comedy is just tragedy...

180
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,554
-...plus time.
-Reed, we're really sorry.

181
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,109
We had a huge opportunity,
and we blew it.

182
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,510
-I hope we can make it up to you.
-Thank you, Zach.

183
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,717
-I was gonna say that.
-I hate to give you guys good news...

184
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,792
...but unfortunately I have some.

185
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,390
George Lucas is interested
in Atomic County.

186
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,551
He might want to make it
into his next movie.

187
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,950
-Oh, my God.
-This is incredible!

188
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,317
Oh, my God. It's happened.
We're this decade's Matt and Ben.

189
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,629
Look, he's coming to town.

190
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,314
He wants to sit down with you guys,
but here's the deal:

191
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,596
-Only one of you can take the meeting.
-What?

192
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,034
-Reed.
-Face it.

193
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,158
You two can't do anything together
except whine about Summer.

194
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,074
I can't face another debacle.
I can't handle another debacle. I--

195
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,390
No. One.

196
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,909
-Well, which one of us do you want?
-I am pissed off enough that I don't care.

197
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,116
But George is coming to town
tomorrow night.

198
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,078
So he and I will be at Al Forno,
and one of you will be there.

199
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,072
And if either of you utter the name
Summer, so help me God....

200
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,239
Dude, this is amazing.
I have to go to that meeting.

201
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,231
Do you realize
what this could do for me?

202
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,233
I've dreamed about meeting
George Lucas since I was a fetus.

203
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,439
-You wanted to go to prom.
-I think you said that too. I think you--

204
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,591
-Yeah, you did.
-All right.

205
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,794
So one of us takes the meeting.
The other one goes to prom.

206
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,359
All right.

207
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,195
Do you have any ideas
how to settle this?

208
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,159
No.

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,319
Not even one.

210
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,155
-How is she?
-Well, she's doing all right.

211
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,788
-A little rattled.
-I hope she'd be rattled.

212
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,474
Drunk driving at her age?
It's a disgrace.

213
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,790
What Kirsten needs right now
is a little support.

214
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,110
If you can't give her that,
show yourself out.

215
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,875
I see you're employing your softball
approach. That might be appropriate...

216
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,873
...when your son runs off to Portland,
but this is more serious.

217
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,031
I know how to help my wife.

218
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,031
Sandy, l....

219
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,795
-I can handle this.
-Okay. I'll be outside.

220
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,837
Behave yourself.

221
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,036
I'm glad to see
you're still in one piece.

222
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,078
Dad, I know you're worried,
but I'm fine.

223
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,835
See? A couple of sprained fingers.
Not the end of the world.

224
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,035
So how are things at the office?

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,389
-You could've been killed.
-I learned my lesson.

226
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,279
-Always eat dinner.
-ls that the lesson to be learned here?

227
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,871
I made an error in judgment.
You should be familiar with that.

228
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,153
This is not about me, Kiki.
You have a problem.

229
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,196
My God, did you give
any thought to your kids?

230
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,276
-I am a good mother.
-You're also an alcoholic.

231
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,116
Your mother was one too. She did
her best to hide it, but I always knew.

232
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,919
Why do you think Mom drank
the way she did?

233
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,835
Why do you think Hailey
left the house at 1 7?

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,594
If this family is screwed up,
it's because of you.

235
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,591
I gave you everything you ever wanted.

236
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,718
I may like my chardonnay,
but I am not gonna die alone.

237
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,792
And that's more than I can say for you!

238
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,593
Trey.

239
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,997
Trey, you in there?

240
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,432
Trey, look, it's me.

241
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,993
I know you're avoiding me,
but I need to talk to you...

242
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,628
...so do me a favor, call me back. Bye.

243
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,073
Summer.

244
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,109
-What do you want?
-We both want to take you to prom.

245
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,795
Now, I know it feels like deep down
you hate us both equally.

246
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,157
But somewhere,
if you look inside yourself...

247
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,992
...you've gotta hate one of us less.

248
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,913
I've tried choosing. When Seth
went to Portland, I chose Zach.

249
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,516
When Zach went to ltaly, I chose Seth.
Somehow it just doesn't seem to stick.

250
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,035
So I'm done deciding.
I am leaving it up to you guys.

251
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,398
-What if we can't decide?
-Flip a coin. I don't care how you do it.

252
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,999
Bye.

253
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,039
-Heads, I go to the prom. Tails, you go?
-Okay, fine.

254
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,192
-No, wait. Hold on.
-No. No changies.

255
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,954
No, I think we should wait.
If we flip the coin now...

256
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,953
...we'll both try and get out
of whatever we're supposed to do.

257
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,874
-lf we wait till right before the prom....
-Neither will have a chance to back out.

258
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,508
-I'll meet you at your house before prom?
-Fine.

259
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,718
-You talked to Marissa.
-Yeah.

260
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,514
-She said she didn't hook up with Trey.
-Good news, right?

261
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,678
-Something happened. I know it.
-Have you tried talking to Trey?

262
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,638
-See what he says?
-I went to his place. He wasn't there.

263
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,917
-He's not taking my calls.
-Your options are, A, sit here...

264
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,435
...spin conspiracy theories
about Trey and Marissa...

265
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,910
...or, B, you can believe her.
Now, my personal recommendation--

266
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,071
-Let me guess, B.
-Yes, B. Believe her.

267
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,550
And might I add, first of all,
that you have no reason not to.

268
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,713
But if you believe her, you can put
this weird non-fight behind you guys...

269
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,916
...and you can go to prom together.

270
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,833
-I'm not in the mood to go to prom.
-You have to go. Look.

271
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,276
I've seen too many Saved by the Bell's,
but if it's taught me anything...

272
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,671
...it sure has taught me that prom
is a seminal moment, okay?

273
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,432
It's meant to be shared.

274
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,872
-ls this about you and Summer?
-No.

275
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,237
Maybe. Yes, but only because Summer
and I aren't gonna go to our prom...

276
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,075
...because of some fight. You should
really learn from the error of my ways.

277
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,514
Please.

278
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,591
Somebody really should.

279
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,158
Well...

280
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,159
...is this a booty call?

281
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,832
Not in the least.
I've come for my sleeping pills.

282
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,558
Well, they're upstairs.

283
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,679
Yeah, I haven't been sleeping very well
either. This divorce, it's so ugly.

284
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,353
Oh, it's not that.

285
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,512
I had an argument with Kirsten,
our worst yet.

286
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,114
-I just can't stop thinking about it.
-Oh, well...

287
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,159
...I'm just thinking outside the box here,
but you could apologize.

288
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,788
-No, I couldn't face her.
-So write her a letter.

289
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,872
Say all the things you're too stubborn
to say to her face.

290
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,710
Come on. We both know
you can't stand to fight with her.

291
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,955
Sometimes you surprise me, Juju.

292
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,275
Hang on. I'll get your pills.

293
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,596
Orange bottle, blue-and-white label,
little black-and-white things.

294
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,637
I know. Just a second.

295
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,238
I could've found them in half the time
without my glasses.

296
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,278
Okay, okay. Here.
Now make sure you only take one.

297
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,112
-Yeah, I know.
-Wait, Cal, wait.

298
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,829
Would you like to do something
tomorrow night? Maybe get together?

299
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,588
-You asking me out on a date?
-ls that so odd?

300
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,470
All right, I guess it is.
But just think of it as one last hurrah.

301
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,279
It'll probably be the last night
we ever spend together.

302
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,557
Julie, you're not gonna seduce me
out of this divorce.

303
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,439
I'm meeting my lawyer tomorrow
to finalize the paperwork.

304
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,036
-I'm filing bright and early Monday.
-So send me the papers.

305
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,919
I'll make the marks.
We'll make a party out of it.

306
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,914
Oh, why not?

307
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,277
-A fitting end to a marriage like ours.
-I'll see you tomorrow?

308
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,032
See you tomorrow.

309
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,479
Hi.

310
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,875
-Hi.
-So...

311
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,397
...I'm sorry I went off on you yesterday.
I was confused.

312
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,714
I get it. I know I've been
kind of all over the map lately.

313
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,599
No, no. You say nothing happened,
and I believe you.

314
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,590
-You feel like going to prom?
-You mean it?

315
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,435
-I thought you weren't into PDA.
-I'm coming around.

316
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,559
Good morning.

317
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,392
Good morning.

318
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,592
-Did you sleep at all last night?
-Not a wink.

319
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,958
Listen, I'm an expert at fighting
with your father.

320
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,192
And believe me, every time
you think you've driven him away...

321
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,478
...he comes back asking for more.
You couldn't beat him off with a stick.

322
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,359
Oh, but the things I said.

323
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,112
He'll forgive you.

324
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,271
Give it some time.

325
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,477
I guess so.

326
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,275
How about we lay low tonight?

327
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,073
We'll order some takeout...

328
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,151
...maybe watch one of Seth's DVDs.

329
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,035
I should try and talk to my dad.

330
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,511
If we're gonna get through this
all by ourselves...

331
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,560
...we need to get back on solid ground.

332
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,912
Well, I've never seen
House of Flying Daggers.

333
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,677
-Scared you.
-Jess.

334
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,479
Walk me to class. I feel like
we haven't chatted in a while.

335
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,108
-What do you want?
-A date for the prom.

336
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,918
-You taken?
-Yeah.

337
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,877
Let me guess, Marissa Cooper.

338
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,034
It doesn't bother you?

339
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,319
Getting your brother's sloppy seconds?

340
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,032
Look, nothing happened between
Marissa and Trey, okay?

341
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,595
You're getting your chain yanked,
Atwood. Bad.

342
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,309
-You got the story? I'd love to hear it.
-Ask your brother.

343
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,712
Although I don't think he's too anxious
to share, since he took off for Chino.

344
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,555
-You better not be screwing with me.
-Apparently I'm the only one who's not.

345
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,317
Okay. I'm prepared for whatever
fate throws my way tonight.

346
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,675
I have a tuxedo pressed
in case I'm going to prom.

347
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,273
-Mine's in the trunk.
-All right.

348
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,432
And if I am, in fact,
meeting with George Lucas...

349
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,315
...I have my Boba Fett T -shirt.

350
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,991
-It's a little small.
-I got it when I was 8.

351
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,912
Hopefully it will stretch. Shall we?

352
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,752
-You do the honors.
-Okay.

353
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,593
-Heads, I go to the prom. Tails, you.
-Great.

354
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,070
-Works for me.
-Just as I hoped.

355
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,277
-Good luck tonight, man. Have fun.
-Yeah, same to you.

356
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,199
Julie.

357
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,552
Just a second. I'm coming.

358
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,992
You're early.

359
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,720
I see you've pulled out all the stops.

360
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,190
One last-ditch effort to stop
this divorce from going forward?

361
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,430
God, paranoid much?

362
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,114
I just wanted one last night with you.

363
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,272
And if you don't believe me, here.

364
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,712
-You signed.
-Told you.

365
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,950
So now maybe you can relax.

366
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,633
Have a drink. Take a dip.

367
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,919
Here, I made it just the way you like it.

368
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,428
On the rocks, plenty of salt.

369
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,152
I think I'll start with a Scotch.

370
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,478
Okay. No hurry on the margs.
Scotch it is.

371
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,271
Ry. Good to see you, man.

372
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,159
Cut the crap, Trey. You got
something you wanna tell me?

373
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,108
-What do you mean, man?
-About Marissa.

374
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,919
All right.

375
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,709
Fine, let's take a seat, get a drink.

376
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,358
Two 7&7s.

377
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,233
One 7&7, and one just 7.

378
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,752
When you were in Miami, Marissa and l,
we got drunk together.

379
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,558
And you came on to her.

380
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,553
Why do you always assume
that it's my fault?

381
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,517
Because it always is.

382
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,552
Well, anyway, we were both wasted,
really wasted...

383
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,679
...on the beach, and your girl, she can
drink, but she can't hold her liquor.

384
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,279
Look, I'm sorry, Ryan.

385
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,230
She threw herself at me.

386
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,229
I don't believe you.

387
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,278
We agreed not to tell. We thought
it'd be better if you didn't know.

388
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,873
There's no way.

389
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,392
You swear?

390
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,959
On Mom.

391
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,590
I wouldn't lie to you, Ryan.

392
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,751
Not about this.

393
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,634
-Ryan, look--
-I gotta go.

394
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,791
Man, I'm so sorry.

395
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,631
Marissa, hey, it's me.

396
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,150
I'm not feeling well...

397
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,711
...so I'm not gonna make prom.

398
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,153
Sorry.

399
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,433
Ryan?

400
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,309
Theresa.

401
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,396
So, what are you doing back, huh?

402
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,790
I'm visiting my mom for the weekend.

403
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,753
Believe it or not, I miss it here.

404
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,189
I mean, it might not be paradise,
but it's home.

405
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,717
-And Atlanta?
-It's fine for now.

406
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,675
You know, I wrote you all those letters.

407
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,359
I know.

408
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,956
I needed a clean break.

409
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,071
-Or you were mad because I left.
-I wanted you to leave.

410
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,430
You belong in Newport. I mean....

411
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,634
Which doesn't explain,
why are you back here?

412
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,476
-Trey.
-He's out of jail?

413
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,870
He was crashing with the Cohens
for a little while.

414
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,110
-Everything was going good, but--
-Let me guess.

415
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,952
Trey got into trouble.

416
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,519
He hooked up with Marissa.

417
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,833
Trey says she came on to him.
She says nothing happened.

418
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,673
-I don't know who to believe.
-I do.

419
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,515
Ryan, Trey has been jerking you around
your entire life. I mean....

420
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,750
-And Marissa--
-Has made mistakes.

421
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,437
She would never hurt you like that.

422
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,992
How do you know?

423
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,948
Because last year, when I needed you,
you know, she....

424
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,758
She let you go.

425
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,915
Even though it broke her heart.

426
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,671
I mean, they both love you,
but of the two of them...

427
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,831
...Marissa is the one
that you can trust.

428
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,880
Well, this is me.

429
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,549
-Oh, is your mom in? I'll say hey.
-Yeah, but-- It's getting kind of late.

430
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,553
-All right. Let me help you in.
-No, it's okay. I got it.

431
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,230
-Yeah? You sure?
-Yeah.

432
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,313
Okay.

433
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,272
Talk to Marissa, you know.

434
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,998
Make this right.

435
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,673
Yeah, I will.

436
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,439
Okay.

437
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,512
-Take care.
-Yeah.

438
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,838
Bye.

439
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,109
-Hi.
-Somebody missed you.

440
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,668
Oh, he looks more and more
like his daddy every day.

441
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,871
I'm glad it's you.

442
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,350
I didn't know what magenta was,
so I got you white.

443
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,714
Perfect.

444
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,315
We gotta get our picture taken with
the mermaid. It's for the yearbook.

445
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,038
Okay.

446
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,753
-Yeah, just give me a second, okay?
-Okay.

447
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,910
-Coop. Hey.
-Hey.

448
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,833
-Under the O. Sea is awesome.
-Thanks.

449
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,355
-Where's Ryan?
-He couldn't make it.

450
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,432
-He's sick.
-Sick? Too sick to take you to prom?

451
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,477
He better be really sick, like dead.

452
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,552
If he's not, I'm gonna strangle him
with his own wife beater.

453
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,757
It's okay. You know, I mean,
I've got plenty to do anyway.

454
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,353
I'll be okay.

455
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,312
I'll have a seltzer on the rocks
with a twist of lemon.

456
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,711
I'll have the same. Seltzer. On the--
George Lucas drinks seltzer.

457
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,113
Everything you do, every little detail,
to me, it's just--

458
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,157
-It's fascinating.
-You're too kind.

459
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,117
Let me ask you just one question,
then I promise we'll get into the book.

460
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,640
How did you first come up
with the lightsaber?

461
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,157
I'm sure Mr. Lucas doesn't have time
for such large-scale questions.

462
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,038
Okay, fine. I'll go smaller.

463
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,472
Did you go to your prom?

464
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,153
Prom?

465
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,754
-Oh, my God.
-As in "prom"?

466
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,913
It's a personal thing, and I wondered if
you went to yours. It would help me out.

467
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,516
Well, actually, I didn't.
I spent my time being creative.

468
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,319
-Drawing Ewoks, Jar Jar Binks.
-Good to know.

469
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,835
If George Lucas can skip his prom,
I can skip mine.

470
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,151
No. No, wait a minute.
I do regret not going to my prom.

471
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,551
-Really? Because it's a seminal moment?
-Exactly.

472
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,235
Mr. Lucas, I'm sorry.
We can get back to the point.

473
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,789
No, wait. It would be good
for me to talk about this.

474
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,555
The prom is a great American tradition.
It's important to experience the things...

475
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,029
...of being a teenager
when you're a teenager.

476
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,397
When I made American Graffiti,
I'd never had the experience of a prom...

477
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,757
...and I had to make a movie about it.
I felt hopelessly inadequate...

478
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,195
...without having really done it myself.

479
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,273
Not having been part of that
pivotal moment in teenage life...

480
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,671
...I felt very sad and alone.

481
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,878
You're buzzing.

482
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,350
Yeah, Reed's sending me text messages.
I don't have to check them.

483
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,078
Go ahead.

484
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,879
Okay.

485
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,156
Oh, God, she's saying George Lucas
is checked out.

486
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,949
God, Seth is totally ignoring
the talking points.

487
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,917
He always--

488
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,112
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

489
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,999
No, it's not. This is ridiculous.

490
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,359
I'm here with you at prom,
just like I wanted.

491
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,993
If you have to talk yourself
into this...

492
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,152
...it probably means
you shouldn't be here.

493
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,518
I'm your date. Even though
you didn't want me to be.

494
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,516
-I did want you to be.
-No. You didn't.

495
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,591
I saw your face
when I got out of the limo.

496
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,716
And I saw yours.

497
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,273
You want to be there talking
about your comic book with Reed.

498
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,518
Look, my prom fantasy,
it didn't quite happen...

499
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,110
...but you've been dreaming about
this comic book your whole life.

500
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,840
This is your shot. You should go.

501
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,718
I can't abandon you.

502
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,871
I did it to you.

503
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,436
-Good point.
-Go.

504
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,275
Save Cohen from himself.

505
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,316
So we ended up--
Well, we flipped a coin.

506
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,358
-You flipped a coin?
-Yeah, and I know it sounds crazy...

507
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,556
...but at the time--

508
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,354
Will you excuse me for one second?
I'll be right back.

509
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,073
Hey. You didn't have to come here.

510
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,834
Look, we need to settle this thing
once and for all.

511
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,356
And I think for the first time you and l
both know where we need to be.

512
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,274
-You want the comic book.
-And you want Summer.

513
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,959
All right. Hey, you don't have
much time.

514
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,633
So take this.

515
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,075
All right. Thanks, man.

516
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,793
So movie time.

517
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,190
Now, Seth recommends
Shaun of the Dead.

518
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,796
He says it's a very funny,
romantic zombie comedy.

519
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,918
Actually, I'm pretty wiped out.
I'm gonna go soak in a hot bath.

520
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,078
The food's here.

521
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,276
I'll wait then. I can take a bath later.

522
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,198
You know what? Go ahead. We can
heat the food up when you're done.

523
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,349
Thanks.

524
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,714
Hey.

525
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,078
You know what? I don't have my wallet.
Hang on. Let me grab some cash.

526
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,511
So...

527
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,272
...you about ready for this marg?

528
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,552
Why not?

529
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,197
You know, I've never been
in this pool before.

530
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,033
No, you're more of a land shark.

531
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,358
We should have done
this sort of thing more.

532
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,149
-Enjoyed each other more.
-Well, we had our moments.

533
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,190
I suppose this calls for a toast.

534
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,150
You know, I really did love you, Juju.

535
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,351
Past tense. That stings.

536
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,431
Sorry. Grammatical error.

537
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,158
To us.

538
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,709
Wait, stop.

539
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,991
-What?
-I didn't put lime in your drink.

540
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,958
-Let me make you a new one.
-There's no need.

541
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,918
Well, it looks like we're both
flying solo on prom night.

542
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,312
-Why? What happened to Zach?
-Oh, he went to go save his comic book.

543
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,595
-Are you okay?
-Y eah.

544
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,034
So prom was a letdown.

545
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,351
You know, I bet it is for everybody.
It's like New Y ear's.

546
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,396
Well, we could always go back
to your house.

547
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,869
Yeah. Curl up with Princess Sparkle...

548
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,349
...watch the season one
of The Valley on DVD.

549
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,715
-That sounds perfect.
-Yeah.

550
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,074
-Come on.
-All right.

551
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,879
All right, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

552
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:15,194
It's time to announce Harbor School's
prom king and queen.

553
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,716
And your prom queen tonight:

554
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,989
Summer Roberts.

555
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,674
-Summer, come on up here.
-Oh, no.

556
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,876
-Get me out of here.
-And your prom king:

557
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,634
Zach Stephens.

558
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,113
-I'm making a run for it.
-lf the king and queen could join me...

559
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,840
...on-stage, they'll kick off
your spotlight dance.

560
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,638
There's the queen. We found her.

561
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,555
We're halfway there.
Summer Roberts, come on up here.

562
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,439
-All right, Summer!
-Yeah, Summer!

563
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,154
Way to go, Summer!

564
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,952
Looking good!

565
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,557
Zach Stephens, we're waiting.

566
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,392
All right, Zach!

567
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,630
Zach, where did you go?

568
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,358
What's up, man?

569
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,554
-Zach Stephens, we're waiting.
-They're calling you, dude!

570
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,392
No one's coming.

571
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,316
-Cohen.
-I'm sorry I'm late.

572
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,436
-I was caught in traffic.
-Get off the stage!

573
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,558
-I'm on-stage.
-That's not Zach Stephens.

574
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,518
-No, I'm not.
-I think you should step down.

575
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,114
-You're not the prom king.
-Seth Cohen's a tool.

576
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,751
Okay. I know I'm not who
you all imagined as prom king...

577
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,718
...seeing as how I'm not
who any of you actually voted for.

578
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,475
But she's the queen, and I love her.

579
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,434
So I guess that that makes me king.

580
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,951
No, I'm just a guy standing next to you.
You're the queen, all right?

581
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,953
I'm the jester, perhaps, if that works.

582
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,190
So let me ask you this, Your Highness:

583
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,474
What can I do to make it up to you?

584
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,791
Well, you--

585
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,348
Well, you can start
by dancing with me.

586
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,156
But he's a tool.

587
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,273
Marissa.

588
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,118
Ryan.

589
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,155
Sorry I missed prom.

590
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,038
You're just in time.

591
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,194
Julie.

592
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,433
Julie!

593
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,029
Cal?

594
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,714
Cal!

595
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,436
That moo shu smells great.

596
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,635
What are we gonna do about you?

597
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,270
I found your stash.

598
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,355
-It's just in case.
-And I trusted you.

599
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,757
I believed you when you said
you were done.

600
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,229
Sandy, I'm doing this my own way.

601
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,358
How? By sneaking around?

602
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,989
By lying to me?

603
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,675
I just don't want you to babysit me
like I'm some wayward child.

604
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,075
Well, maybe that's exactly
what you need.

605
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,949
Right now I feel more like your dad
than I feel like your husband.

606
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,518
Hello. What? Julie?

607
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,750
Wait, wait, wait, calm down.

608
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,516
Well, say that again.

609
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,992
Oh, my God.

610
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,638
I understand.

611
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,033
Of course.

612
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,751
It's about your father.

613
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,919
What is it?

614
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,196
He's all right, isn't he?

615
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,518
He's dead.

616
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,555
I am so sorry.
