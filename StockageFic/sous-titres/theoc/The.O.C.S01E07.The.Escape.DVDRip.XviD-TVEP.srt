1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,668
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- Daddy!

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,070
Her dad beat up
my dad at my debutante ball.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,669
You can't blame Holly for that.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,955
- I know Jimmy.
- I've heard.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,951
He still has your prom photo on our wall.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,678
- What do you want from me?
- I want a divorce.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,751
I never should have broken up
with you in the first place.

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,309
- I don't know what I should do.
- Let me know when you decide.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,358
You chose Luke, huh?
Chino didn't stand a chance.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,278
Let's go.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,469
You're too late.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,269
- The plan is undeniable.
- I'm denying it.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,112
We have my mom's Range Rover.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,556
We have a perfect alibi, as I go to
this comic-book convention every year.

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,915
We have my entire life
of never doing anything wrong...

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,275
...which lulls my parents
into a false sense of trust.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,752
And you wanna throw all that away for
Summer in a wet T-shirt doing body shots?

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,634
I'm sorry. I thought that was
a rhetorical question. Yes...

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,270
...Ryan, yes. On the last weekend
before school, one goes to Tijuana.

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,749
It is tradition,
and it is a rite of passage.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,115
What happens in Mexico
stays in Mexico.

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,913
What happens in Mexico?

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,594
I don't know. It stays there.
That's why we must go.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,191
I don't know about lying
to your parents.

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,271
I can respect that. I will lie to them.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,471
Why can't we just go to Comicon?

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,471
Comicon is a bunch
of pathetic virgins...

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,710
...ogling some porn star dressed
as Catwoman.

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,836
I thought you went every year.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,277
Listen. Tijuana's a big town.
I'm sure you won't even see Marissa.

31
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,398
I don't care about seeing Marissa
or not seeing Marissa.

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,472
Therefore, you should have
no problem coming to Mexico, right?

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,631
Well, won't she be hanging out
with Summer?

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,711
No, she'll probably be
shacked up with Luke.

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,395
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That was probably a bit painful.

36
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,028
Hey, fellas.
You all excited about Comicon?

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,829
Seth's been going since he was 10.
It's the highlight of his year.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,594
Thanks. "Highlight" is a bit overstating it.

39
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,992
- Check you out. Big pimping.
- I got a meeting with a private law firm.

40
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,594
- You suing one of their clients?
- It's a job interview.

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,389
Which he'll never take. They like to
flatter him every once in a while.

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,917
- Yeah, I go for the free meal.
- But you'll still be a public defender, right?

43
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,072
After 15 years?
There's no way he's selling out.

44
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,356
Well, it'd have to be
one hell of a free meal.

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,988
And that's what's they call
a "callback" in comedy.

46
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,549
So how soon until you two
are leaving on your trip?

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,392
I don't know. How soon?

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,039
Tomorrow.

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,676
Don't you mean "<i>ma Íana</i>"?

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,714
- Looks good.
- I don't wear hats.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,718
Ryan, you mean "sombrero."

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,236
Brush up on your Spanish.
There's over 500 useful phrases.

53
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,238
"May I please see a ladies' worsted
nylon bathing suit?"

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,630
Yeah. Well, did you know that one?

55
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,678
- What's this?
- An itinerary for our trip.

56
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,070
Seth, it's 12 pages long.
We're going for two days.

57
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,674
If you're gonna get over Marissa,
you need activities.

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,513
I don't need to get over Marissa.
I'm over Marissa.

59
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,239
Ryan. Ryan.

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,995
Look at me.
Look, this is me here, okay? Amigo.

61
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,835
Now, I know you're hurting, and I think
you need to unburden your soul.

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,278
- Any time. I'm here to help.
- My soul is fine. Marissa and me...

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,750
It just... I don't know.
It never would have worked.

64
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,354
No kidding.
It is so much better this way.

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,512
He's all, like, brooding, wounded,
"Somebody save me."

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,036
- I thought you liked that.
- It is too hot to save anyone.

67
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,273
Speaking of hot, I can't believe
you and Luke. You guys did it.

68
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,954
Tell me everything.
I've been waiting for this forever.

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,599
- You have?
- You've seen it before.

70
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,795
- Come on!
- Touched it?

71
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,713
Summer! It's a sacred act
between two people.

72
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,431
It was a letdown, right?
Kind of hurt? Totally awkward?

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,750
I don't have anything to compare it to.

74
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,037
So do it again.
It is way better the second time.

75
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,430
I'm supposed to go to his place
this afternoon.

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,353
Trust me, Coop.
Get back on that horse.

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,877
- You gotta giddyup!
- My dad's home!

78
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,396
I don't understand. You promised me
the apartment would be ready tomorrow.

79
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,076
Yeah, I'm moving out this weekend.
Where am I supposed to stay?

80
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,909
Yeah, well, you don't have to apologize.
I just...

81
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,595
You know what? Thank you.
Forget it. Yeah. Bye.

82
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,110
- Dad?
- Hey. Hi, girls.

83
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,236
Hey. So Summer and I are gonna go...

84
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,198
Oh, right. You're going to
Palm Springs, yeah.

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,272
We're not leaving until tomorrow.
For Tijuana?

86
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,035
Oh, right, yeah.
Yeah, I meant... Yeah.

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,428
Are you okay?

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,273
Because, I mean,
I was gonna go over to Luke's.

89
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,638
- But if you want, I could stay here.
- No, I'm fine, sweetie. Go to Luke's.

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,830
Luke's great. Isn't he, Summer?
He's... He's a good kid.

91
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,354
Sure.

92
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,990
Anyway, l... I gotta... You know...

93
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,957
Right. I know. Yeah.

94
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,392
Okay.

95
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,512
All right. Bye.

96
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,477
- See you.
- See you.

97
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,839
- Hey.
- Hey.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,309
Is now a bad time?

99
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,152
I don't know why you didn't come
to me in the first place.

100
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,313
I'll call my realtor, Gloria. I'm sure
she'll be able to help you find something.

101
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,596
Thanks. Yeah, really, thank you.

102
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,638
So how'd the girls take the news?

103
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,078
Well, Julie and I decided to table
that conversation until Monday.

104
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,753
You haven't told them yet?

105
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,754
Well, Julie's at her mom's with Kaitlin and
Marissa's going to Mexico this weekend.

106
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,356
We just thought it'd be easier
and cleaner if we did it that way.

107
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,513
They come back,
I'm gone, and then we tell them.

108
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,716
I'm not so sure about this.

109
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,395
Well, neither am I...

110
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,839
...but the thought of having them
watch me move out...

111
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,750
It's hard enough as it is.

112
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,032
I never thought I'd be that guy that...

113
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,311
The divorced guy.

114
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,228
I can't wait to go to Tijuana.
It's gonna be so romantic.

115
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,550
It's kind of gross there.

116
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,473
So what?
We won't leave the hotel room.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,877
I don't know.

118
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,390
It'll be way better the second time.

119
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,791
No, I mean, I don't know about Mexico.

120
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,359
TJ.

121
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,631
I don't think I'm gonna go.

122
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,268
I feel like my dad's having a meltdown.

123
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,199
You're thinking about your dad
right now? Come on, babe.

124
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,753
I don't know if I can leave him alone.

125
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,355
Marissa, he's, like, 40.

126
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,637
Look, we can go to Mexico whenever.

127
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,712
I feel like I should be with him
right now.

128
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,718
Okay, fine.

129
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,950
I gotta go meet the guys anyway.

130
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,719
Is she looking at me?

131
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,952
- Still not.
- You know what she's doing?

132
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,473
And it's textbook.

133
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,473
She's playing me hot and cold,
pretending our kiss didn't happen.

134
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,029
There were no witnesses.
I didn't see anything.

135
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,317
Then maybe I'll just have to make
magic happen again, won't I?

136
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,593
Hey.

137
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,271
How you been?
I haven't seen you in a while.

138
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,796
Yeah, well, the last time I saw you,
you kind of had your hands full.

139
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,874
Coop! Come on.

140
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,832
- Well, don't let me keep you.
- I won't.

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,592
- Okay. Later.
- Fine.

142
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,112
- Hey, Coop.
- Hey, Holl.

143
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,909
You don't make those freshmen
watch a real donkey show, do you?

144
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,271
Sandy Cohen.
How'd you get past security?

145
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,158
- How are you, Rachel?
- Hi.

146
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,830
You look great. Being a slave
to the Man agrees with you.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,356
Six seconds until the first insult.
You're getting soft. Still surfing?

148
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,399
Every morning. Keeps my mind clear.
That and not working in a joint like this.

149
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,393
Yeah. Decent hours,
appropriate compensation.

150
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,835
I don't know how I ever left
the DA's office.

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,629
It's because you kept losing
to this roguish, brilliant...

152
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,110
- Conceited.
- That's right, it was me.

153
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,670
What do the good folks at Partridge,
Savage and Kahn want with a lowly PD?

154
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,752
I gotta tell you, you made some noise
with that Jimmy Cooper case.

155
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,356
- I didn't do anything.
- You have your work cut out for you.

156
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,910
But heading the feds off at the pass,
negotiating a restitution deal...

157
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,356
...calling in a high-powered securities
attorney in the span of a weekend.

158
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,034
- God, I am impressive.
- And conceited.

159
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,519
So you keep saying.

160
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,148
Truth be told,
no one was gonna touch that guy.

161
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,676
The fact that you did made
the partners think, made me think.

162
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,196
"Is Sandy Cohen really ready
to come down off his high horse?

163
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,191
Is he finally tired of being a martyr?"

164
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,351
Jeez, I was just hoping for a free meal.

165
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,115
Sorry to disappoint you. All you're
getting is a really good sales pitch.

166
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,157
Sounds delicious.

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,194
What are you...?

168
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,315
Eavesdropping, Ryan.
I hear like a wolf.

169
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,268
- What do you mean, you're not going?
- I just... I don't know, Summ. I can't.

170
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,392
But how am I supposed to get there?

171
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,358
The guys are going tonight
for that stupid freshman hazing.

172
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,829
- Holly's car is full.
- I'm sorry.

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,719
I'm totally stranded.

174
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,440
What happens in Mexico
stays in Mexico.

175
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,752
Holly, I can't. Me and Marissa,
we're back together.

176
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,396
I give it a week. You'll miss me.

177
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,479
Come on, babe. Let's get you
out of here before the road trip starts.

178
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,036
I don't know. Whatever.

179
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,591
Hello, Summer. Seth Cohen.
I believe you remember.

180
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,158
Nothing?
I heard you needed a ride tomorrow.

181
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,954
- You have all our numbers.
- Dad, I know our phone number.

182
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,237
Did you bring enough water?
Extra batteries?

183
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,391
Air in the tires? Gas in the tank?

184
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,835
It's amazing I turned out so normal.

185
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,513
Hey. Let me get that.

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,833
Hey, Summer. Sandy Cohen.
I'm Seth's dad.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,956
I had no idea you were
into comic books.

188
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,712
Comic books?

189
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,269
- She goes for the anime.
- Anime.

190
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,318
I'm gonna go say bye to Coop.
Don't touch my stuff.

191
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,438
This is gonna be awesome.

192
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,953
She is hot stuff, son.

193
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,156
And now it's ruined.

194
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,029
- I told you, I can't go.
- I got us a ride. Just grab some stuff.

195
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,033
Hey. What are you guys
still doing here?

196
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,838
I thought I'd stay home this weekend.

197
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
What? Why? I thought you were
looking forward to this trip.

198
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,872
I was. But I thought maybe
we could spend some time together.

199
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,600
Well, we can't, I'm sorry.

200
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,389
I thought you were going,
so I made other plans.

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,673
I was. I just...

202
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,432
I mean, are you sure?

203
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,158
- Because I thought maybe we could...
- Look, Marissa, please.

204
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,959
Come on.
I can't take care of both of us.

205
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,473
Okay. I'll go pack my stuff.

206
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,839
Coop?

207
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,709
- So who's going with us?
- You'll see.

208
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,515
Great news. I got Coop to come along.

209
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,952
We're going to TJ!

210
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,879
I can't believe you convinced me
to do this.

211
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,191
- You could've brought somebody in.
- Where's the fun in that?

212
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,272
It only took us a couple of hours
to paint my dorm room, remember?

213
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,795
Your dorm room was the size
of a prison cell.

214
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,952
Well, we may be painting
one of those as well.

215
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,348
Sorry.

216
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,397
Listen, thank you so much.

217
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,235
The thought of being home
when Julie and the kids come back...

218
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,960
- You haven't told them yet.
- Well, not exactly.

219
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,716
I mean, I was gonna tell Marissa,
but then it just seemed impossibly hard.

220
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,792
Because it is.
Jimmy, Marissa's not a little girl anymore.

221
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,192
And if she comes home and finds
you gone, she'll never forgive you.

222
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,356
Call her.

223
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,592
She'll still love you. I promise.

224
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,032
We should be there in three hours.

225
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,156
The GPS says the ETA's
three and a half.

226
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,153
Well, that's because someone drives
like an old woman.

227
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,072
I'm going 70 in a 65 zone.

228
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,639
Eighty is the new 70.

229
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,836
What? Who talks like that?

230
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,798
Who gets passed by a van full of nuns?

231
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,393
Oh, wait, Cohen does.

232
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,279
They have God on their side.
I'm not gonna beat Jesus.

233
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,590
I'm gonna call Holly
and see how far ahead she is.

234
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,593
- And she's a girl.
- That's insulting to your own gender.

235
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,275
- Not as insulting as it is to you.
- Point taken.

236
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,559
No, thanks.

237
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,633
I'll take it.

238
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,358
I'm so dehydrated.

239
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,479
What is up with the a.c.? My hair
is frizzing out. I look like Howard Stern.

240
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,236
- My Jewfro benefits from this climate.
- You're Jewish?

241
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,593
Yes. That's why I feel so comfortable
in this desert heat.

242
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,958
This is a nightmare. I'm sweating
to death, driving 10 miles an hour...

243
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,429
...in, like, a rickshaw,
listening to this music.

244
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,671
Hey, do not insult Death Cab.

245
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,229
It's, like, one guitar
and a whole lot of complaining.

246
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,392
Reminds me of someone else
who's doing a lot of complaining. You.

247
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,076
I'm driving this vehicle, and I'll drive
at the speed that I feel comfortable, okay?

248
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,832
It's my music, it is my snacks...

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,911
Kudos and Goldfish? What are you, 8?

250
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,316
- Say goodbye to Summer.
- What are you doing?

251
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,199
Leaving you at the side of the road.
Don't touch the wheel!

252
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,920
Stop! Stop it!

253
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,469
- Guys, stop it!
- Seth!

254
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,111
It's not exactly the honeymoon suite.

255
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,919
Well, it's only for one night,
until the axle's fixed.

256
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,152
- I've stayed in worse.
- That's nothing to brag about.

257
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,677
Sweet!
Do we have to pay extra for the pubes?

258
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,072
- This is so gross. I cannot stay here.
- Unless you feel like hitchhiking again...

259
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,516
No, thank you. I've spent
enough time in a truck full of chickens.

260
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,318
Hey, we're lucky that guy stopped.

261
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,677
We'd be even luckier if Cole Trickle here
hadn't driven us off the road.

262
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,991
- Who the hell is Cole Trickle?
- Tom Cruise. <i>Days of Thunder</i>.

263
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,752
Guys, can we try to be positive?

264
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,876
Okay. I am positive this is Summer's fault.

265
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,110
I'm positive that I'm leaving
here with a rash.

266
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,272
Oh, so you plan on making
some extra money tonight.

267
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,435
This bathroom is so...

268
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,474
- Hello.
- Hey.

269
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,598
Hey, what happened to you?
You're finger-painting in the back yard?

270
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,194
I was helping Jimmy
paint his new living room.

271
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,433
- Julie kicked him out?
- Is that okay that I'm helping him?

272
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,194
Yeah, I guess, with everything
he's been going through.

273
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,749
Honey! You shouldn't have!

274
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,549
I didn't. It washed up
about an hour ago. Who's Rachel?

275
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,517
She works at the law firm I met with.

276
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,114
Well, the meeting must have gone well.
You never said.

277
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,236
You must have let them down easy.

278
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,949
In a private practice, I could do more
pro bono work than I do now.

279
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,477
Sandy, you're not seriously considering
taking this job, are you?

280
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,029
The salary they offered me
is outrageous.

281
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,751
You've never been swayed by a paycheck.
This family has all the money it needs.

282
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,114
Except it's your money.

283
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,872
- It's our money.
- Not really.

284
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,634
Unless you wanna buy the Lakers
or a Caribbean island.

285
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,473
It's not about buying stuff,
although Aruba would be nice.

286
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,473
It's about contributing.
And I have an opportunity here.

287
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,196
Yeah, to work for people
that you hate.

288
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,759
You refer to those places as...

289
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,151
...evil empires controlled by
corporate interests, owned by the Man.

290
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,551
Well, I tend to be hyperbolic.
It goes with the territory.

291
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,676
The PD office is your life.

292
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,037
I don't want you to give that up
so you can buy groceries the next week.

293
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,317
Don't belittle this.
I think balance is important.

294
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,596
- We don't have balance?
- No, you have all the money.

295
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,228
And you have all the ideals.

296
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,755
- You like that I don't make a lot of money.
- What?

297
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,072
It makes us different from all these
other families. All these other women...

298
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,277
...married to their investment bankers
and their CEOs.

299
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,954
As long as I haven't sold out,
you haven't sold out.

300
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,917
- That's not true.
- Come on, face it.

301
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,153
The only thing that keeps you
from feeling like Julie Cooper is me.

302
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,393
But, hey, it's just an offer.

303
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,037
I have to pick wisely.
Ding Dongs or Cheese Sticks?

304
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,031
I don't care. Pick whatever.

305
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,510
- I don't care either.
- So I guess we'll just starve.

306
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,073
- You ever gonna stop being mad at me?
- I'm not mad at you.

307
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,798
Right.

308
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,031
- Why would I be mad at you?
- You walked in on me with another girl.

309
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,510
Actually, I think she was a woman.
But why would I care about that?

310
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,150
- I don't know. Shouldn't be a problem.
- There's no problem.

311
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,754
Except Ding Dongs or Cheese Sticks.

312
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,509
I don't care, Ryan.

313
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,717
I don't care about Cheese Sticks
and I don't care about Ding Dongs.

314
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,714
And I really don't care that I walked
in on you with some girl. Or woman.

315
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,632
Whatever.

316
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,110
I was only with her because
you were clearly back with Luke.

317
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,872
I was not back with Luke.

318
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,988
You are now, right?

319
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,990
- Right.
- Okay.

320
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,755
Great. So we'll just get to Mexico,
split up and never talk again.

321
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,831
Sounds like a plan.

322
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,831
By the way,
you could have knocked first.

323
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,872
Did you ever wonder why
I came to the pool house to find you?

324
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,799
Every day.

325
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,192
Here's your chance.
Clear the air. Tell me.

326
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,393
Cheese Sticks. I hate Ding Dongs.

327
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,232
Hey. Static.

328
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,958
That's awesome.

329
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,311
What are you doing?

330
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,996
Almost watching TV. This is either
<i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> or <i>JAG</i>.

331
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,071
Get off the bed.
The sooner I go to sleep...

332
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,755
...the sooner it'll be morning
and this nightmare will be over.

333
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,359
I'm not sleeping on that couch. It's
stained and smells foul. You sleep there.

334
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,909
After you've made it sound
so appealing? Good night.

335
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,752
- Come on, get off the bed!
- Nope.

336
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,878
- Be, like, a gentleman.
- Chivalry's dead, sugar.

337
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,110
You make a move,
I rip out your jugular.

338
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,999
Oh, hey, pillow talk.

339
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,754
Hello?

340
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,831
Oh, hey, Dad.

341
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,197
Hey, you got a minute, kiddo?

342
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,511
Yeah. Is everything okay?

343
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,750
<i>Well, no.</i>

344
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,229
<i>Not exactly.</i>

345
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,038
What is it?

346
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,996
<i>This isn 't a very easy thing to say.</i>

347
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,075
When you get home,
I'm not gonna be there.

348
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,632
<i>Your mom and I are...</i>

349
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,392
You're getting a divorce.

350
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,396
I just can't believe you're telling me this
over the phone.

351
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,393
I was gonna tell you before you left,
but then I knew you'd stay.

352
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,670
<i>And I just couldn 't let you</i>
<i>watch me pack up my life.</i>

353
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,156
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, kiddo.

354
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,196
<i>I don 't wanna ruin your whole trip.</i>
<i>It's good that you went.</i>

355
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,913
I can sleep on the floor.

356
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,473
No, it's okay.

357
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,914
I'm sorry.

358
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,033
Thanks.

359
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,431
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

360
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,079
I know.

361
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,512
You wanna go home?

362
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,672
I just...

363
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,670
I think I wanna stay here.

364
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,230
I'm gonna go take a shower.

365
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,478
So...

366
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,710
...Tijuana.
- Yeah.

367
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,792
Should we have woke Ryan
and Marissa?

368
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,111
No. They looked so cute together.
Vomit.

369
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,033
Hey. That's a real sentimental streak
you got there, Summer.

370
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,555
It's too early for your so-called comedy.

371
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,199
You enjoy my comedy.

372
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,233
You know what else I think you enjoy?
Me.

373
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,277
That's because you're mentally unstable.

374
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,715
Be that as it may,
the facts speak for themselves.

375
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,269
Might I remind you of something
that I call...

376
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,477
..."the time that you kissed me
at my grandfather's party."

377
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,232
- What are you talking about?
- Okay.

378
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,119
I know that denial is a very powerful
coping mechanism...

379
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,272
...but it's time we paid lip service
to our lip service.

380
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,432
Two words: No tongue.

381
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,593
- You agreed to take this trip with me.
- I needed a ride.

382
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,113
We shared the same bed.

383
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,475
I wasn't sleeping on that couch.
It smelled like eggs.

384
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,677
- You ate my toast, Summer.
- I like crusts, Seth.

385
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,354
Face it. Our chemistry is undeniable.

386
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,069
- You know what else is undeniable?
- What?

387
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,119
The pain this fork is gonna cause
when I jam it into your eye.

388
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,436
I suffer from rage blackouts.

389
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,110
I'm gonna get the check.

390
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,629
Where's Coop?

391
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,234
- The shower.
- Hope she's wearing shower shoes.

392
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,631
Here's breakfast, and the chariot's
repaired and out front. Ready to go?

393
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,030
- I'm not sure we're going.
- What?

394
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,152
Marissa's dad called
with some bad news.

395
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,991
What's going on?

396
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,192
They're getting divorced.

397
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,954
Baby, I'm so sorry.

398
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,433
Whatever you wanna do, Coop.

399
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,160
But if I may,
speaking as a child of divorce...

400
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,311
...you do not wanna be home
right now.

401
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,711
And this is our last chance for freedom.

402
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,394
We get back to Newport,
and it's school and reality.

403
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,917
Let's go to TJ, have fun.
Life will suck soon enough.

404
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,600
She might actually be right.

405
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,035
Well, there's a first time for everything.

406
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,516
Rage blackouts, got it. I'll be in the car.

407
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,318
Let's go to TJ.

408
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,157
I still don't understand
why we needed to get two rooms.

409
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,550
I'll leave you my key
just in case you get Ionely.

410
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,678
Or in case I wanna smother you
with your pillow.

411
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,559
- Whatever turns you on.
- Everyone's at Boom-Boom.

412
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,996
I have to go to the pharmacy. You can
get anything without a prescription.

413
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,957
I need to make a pit stop
for my stepmom.

414
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,953
She's taken all the painkillers
available in Orange County.

415
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,829
I should probably pop in and pick up
an antihistamine. Allergies.

416
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,913
You don't have to come with us
if you don't want.

417
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,911
I'm going to find Luke.

418
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,908
It's okay. Really. That's fine.

419
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,912
Hey, where are the partners? Oh, right,
I forgot. Vampires hate the sunlight.

420
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,117
- They didn't want to appear desperate.
- So they sent you.

421
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,114
- Desperation's your strong suit.
- And yours is...

422
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,840
I'm drawing a blank here.

423
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,675
They're pulling the offer first thing in
the morning unless they hear from you.

424
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,549
Thank them for the surfboard,
although it did freak my wife out.

425
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,075
You had her believing
I was considering this job.

426
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,117
- Which you are.
- No.

427
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,989
As much as I'd like to think you're here
for the sparkling banter and crab cakes...

428
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,388
...I know you're interested.

429
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,190
It's not gonna happen. I've been in the
PD's office my whole life. It's what I do.

430
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,430
And I'm giving you
a platform to do it better.

431
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,192
The sand dabs are great here.

432
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,033
Don't you wanna see what
would happen if you tested yourself?

433
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,873
Not just against one more overworked,
underpaid ADA.

434
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,792
I always loved beating you.

435
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,996
- You know why?
- Why?

436
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,673
Because I was excellent.

437
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,317
Which is why I left.
I wanted to do more.

438
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,799
And so do you.

439
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,632
The clock's ticking.

440
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,799
Sand dabs, huh?

441
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,279
Yep.

442
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,278
Of course she would be.
But telling her...

443
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,032
You were totally right.

444
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,679
It'll take a while.

445
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,594
It's gonna take us all
a while to get used to this.

446
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,320
My swinging new bachelor pad.

447
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,352
You know, this is the first time
I've ever really been a bachelor.

448
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,435
I mean, I went from you to Julie,
and the rest is...

449
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,591
Let me ask you something.

450
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,039
You ever have any doubts
about you and Sandy?

451
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,111
We have our issues.

452
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,114
You ever think what it would be like
if you and I had ended up...?

453
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,873
Sometimes.

454
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,753
Finished.

455
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,557
I should go.

456
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,190
Yeah, I'm sorry, that was totally...
That was wrong of me.

457
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,114
My marriage is falling apart,
but I shouldn't try to bring yours down.

458
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,238
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay. I'm sorry. L...

459
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,916
- Come on, Luke. Back that ass up.
- No, that's cool.

460
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,954
Marissa's not even coming.

461
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,271
Come on. I love this song.

462
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,149
I love authentic Mexican culture.

463
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,914
- What are you doing?
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.

464
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,638
What, that you got caught?

465
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,349
- Don't ever talk to me again.
- You are such a bitch.

466
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,080
- Please. He hooks up with everyone.
- Shut up.

467
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,755
Freshman girls,
girls from Mater Dei, girls from UCI.

468
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,433
Is that true?

469
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,358
Marissa, everyone knows. Everyone!
Now you do too.

470
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,554
- You are so mean.
- Summer, I am honest.

471
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,072
Her parents are getting divorced,
you stupid slut!

472
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,312
Walk away, Holly.
She suffers from rage blackouts.

473
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,073
- Let her go.
- This isn't about you.

474
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,912
- It is now.
- Get out of my way.

475
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,752
You don't deserve her.

476
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,919
- I'll go check the hotel.
- I'll check the streets.

477
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,798
Call me if you find her.

478
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,990
Thank God, Coop.

479
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,038
I slept with him.

480
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,952
I know, sweetie.

481
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,158
- I gotta call Ryan and Seth.
- No. I don't wanna see them.

482
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,912
Just...

483
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,911
I'm so embarrassed.

484
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,119
It's okay. It's just...
We'll go home.

485
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,630
I can't go home. My dad will be gone.

486
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,997
My mom's gonna be back. I have...

487
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,832
I have no one.

488
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,909
Come on, Coop. Let's get out of here.

489
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,990
I'll grab our stuff.

490
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,074
Hey, it's me.

491
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,673
Hey.

492
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,876
- I found her.
- You did?

493
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,519
She's at the hotel.

494
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,557
- <i>You guys need to get here fast.</i>
- Okay.

495
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,278
Okay.

496
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,192
Hey, Coop.
You wanna get some dinner?

497
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,237
What are you in the mood for?

498
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,118
Coop?

499
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,594
Coop.

500
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,519
Okay.

501
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,477
- Bad news. She's gone.
- What?

502
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,598
And so are my stepmom's painkillers.

503
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,676
- Should we split up?
- No, let's stick together. Come on.

504
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,313
- Hey.
- Hey.

505
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,359
How'd it go with the suits?

506
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,317
You know, okay.

507
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,552
I can't believe summer's over.

508
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,312
I know.

509
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,836
Feels like it goes faster and faster
every year.

510
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,033
So if I did take this job...

511
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,794
You've already taken it.

512
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,673
Haven't you?

513
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,638
I can still get out of it if you want me to.

514
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,671
To a new season.

515
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,039
Coop!

516
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,032
Coop!

517
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,152
Hey, honey, come on.

518
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,632
Wake up.

519
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,552
Wake up.
