00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,350
<i>Previously on</i> The O. C:

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,078
Know what I like about rich kids?

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,914
- Nothing.
- Let me meet you upstairs.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,069
- Summer?
- Anna?

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,832
- Seth?
- The gruesome twosome.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,753
You spent the weekend painting
Jimmy's house, and I didn't say a word...

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,229
...because I knew nothing was going on.
- Of course.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,194
Do I have a fever?

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,715
I think I might have a fever
and/or the chills.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,872
- Since when?
- Since recently.

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,474
So you're not feeling well?

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,756
No, I feel fine.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,432
Just my head's a little achy
and my stomach's kind of weird. I'm okay.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,874
Come here.

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,279
- You don't feel warm.
- What about cold or clammy?

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,592
- Maybe you've got the summer flu.
- Yeah. It's November, but it's possible.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,796
Maybe you need some Anna-biotics.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,231
- Do you not want to go to school?
- No, Dad. I want to go to school. Okay?

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,594
- I'm just worried about infecting others.
- You're right.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,479
We should just take you
straight to the emergency room.

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,629
Just to be sure.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,590
Okay. Or I could stay home
and try and sleep it off.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,070
Or you could go to school,
face Summer and Anna and apologize.

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,357
First of all, no.
Second of all, no.

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,158
Why would I?

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,118
Oh, the Summer flu.

27
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,272
I just got it. That was good.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,352
It's not my fault that they both
tried to kiss me on Thanksgiving.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,272
What was I supposed to do?
Not kiss back?

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,351
Say "No, stop"?
Risk hurting their feelings?

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,034
Well, it seems you already did
hurt their feelings.

32
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,078
Yeah, perhaps I did,
but what about my feelings, okay?

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,310
I was the one who was assaulted.
I'm the victim.

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,948
Hey, how come you're not dressed?
You're gonna be late.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,669
And so are you. Or is that what ladies
are wearing these days to Yogalates?

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,435
Taryn called to remind you that today is
the first day of your Yogalates workshop.

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,357
- Okay. Mom, Yogalates?
- I don't know if I'm gonna go.

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,590
- I'm not feeling well.
- See? It's contagious.

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,274
You know, honey, you might
still be a little hung-over.

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,429
From what?

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,034
I don't know. Getting drunk
and passing out on Thanksgiving?

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,237
Hey, I had two glasses of wine.

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,719
Three.

44
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,189
I'm sure Julie Cooper
has spread word around town...

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,032
...that I now have a drinking problem.

46
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,077
Which is why you
have to go to Yogalates.

47
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,119
Because you know those chatty Newpsies
will assume you're sleeping off a bender.

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,748
And Summer and Anna
will assume you're afraid of them.

49
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,992
Hey, I'm not afraid of Summer
and Anna, all right?

50
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,720
- Well, I'm not afraid of Anna.
- So you're going to school.

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,950
- And you're going to Yogalates.
- You like saying that.

52
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,350
Yogalates? I kind of do.

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,078
- Yogalates.
- Yogalates.

54
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,755
You know what I want to know,
is why these two are so smug.

55
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,309
Because for once,
they didn't do anything wrong?

56
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,159
That's true.

57
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,592
- Here's to you.
- Back at you.

58
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,952
Enjoy it, boys,
because knowing the two of you...

59
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,951
...it won't last long.
- Yogalates.

60
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,197
Your class presentations will account
for one-third of your final grade...

61
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,399
...along with your term papers
and, of course, the final exam.

62
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,472
I'll be dividing the class
into two-person teams.

63
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,553
Each team will be responsible
for presenting a detailed account...

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,077
...of a pivotal event or period
in European history.

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,595
I've already had quite a few
partnership requests...

66
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,155
...however,
in fairness to the other students...

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,039
...I will select the teams myself
at random.

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,760
Lauren and Kenny,
the French Revolution.

69
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,077
Ryan and Luke,
the Spanish Inquisition.

70
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,312
Stephanie and Bobby,
the Protestant Reformation.

71
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,277
Stephanie? Are you listening?

72
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,237
Stephanie? Miss Savage, please.

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,630
- You and Luke?
- I know.

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,438
Holy unholy alliances.

75
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,512
This is why I asked Mr. Bendis
a week ago if we could be partners.

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,433
- To avoid a situation like this.
- Why? Who did you get?

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,398
Marcy Ross and I
are doing Cort Ás and the Aztecs.

78
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,235
I like Marcy Ross. She's got a good smile
on her. It's innocent but it's knowing.

79
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,437
- You're going after Marcy now too?
- Hey. I'm the victim here, okay?

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,478
Don't tell me, tell Summer and Anna.

81
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,279
And, hey, eventually you might
want to tell Marcy too.

82
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,878
What are you and Luke doing?
That was me ignoring you, by the way.

83
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,395
Spanish Inquisition.
Meeting at his house after school.

84
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,028
You're going into the belly of the beast?

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,749
Hey, it's not gonna be that bad. Who
knows, you might end up being friends.

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,996
- You think?
- No, it's too weird.

87
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,515
I mean, my ex-boyfriend
hanging out with my boyfriend?

88
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,036
- What are you guys gonna talk about?
- I can only think of one thing.

89
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,473
So I talked to my guy at the SEC
and your clients...

90
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,918
...and they all agree that if you make
full restitution by January 1 st...

91
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,436
- But that means selling the house.
- And avoiding criminal prosecution.

92
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,716
- And jail time.
- I can't sell the house now...

93
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,190
...it's almost the holidays.
I can't do that to Julie and Kaitlin.

94
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,193
They wouldn't have to move out
right away. Just show the house...

95
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,157
...when Julie and Kaitlin are out.

96
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,357
What if she says no? She's on
the title too. What if she won't sell?

97
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,718
What choice does she have? She can't
afford to live there if you're in jail.

98
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,917
Now that she's got
Caleb Nichol in her pocket...

99
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,072
- You had lunch with him?
- No.

100
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,755
I had lunch with Ryan.
Seth was just, you know, there.

101
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,595
I cannot believe you.
Coop, where is your loyalty?

102
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,352
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

103
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,239
- I'm not getting involved.
- That means he said something.

104
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,995
- What did he say?
- Nothing. I told you.

105
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,388
Hey.

106
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,233
Hello. What did he say?

107
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,631
- What did who say?
- Seth.

108
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,473
Oh, it's you.

109
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,472
You're, like, flossing.
At school.

110
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,279
Do you have any idea how much bacteria
accumulates between lunch and dinner?

111
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,671
No. But the fact that you do
tells me everything.

112
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,397
Look, if you want him,
you can have him. I'm done.

113
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,433
Thanks. But that's okay.

114
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,068
Right. Because you couldn't
be interested in someone...

115
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,435
...that's interested in me.

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,717
No. Because I couldn't possibly
be interested in someone...

117
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,348
...who treats women that way.

118
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,633
So how much bacteria? Like, a lot?

119
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,512
A lot.

120
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,469
Thanks.

121
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,474
Hey, I was hoping I'd bump into you.
I wanted to...

122
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,834
Hi, Summer.

123
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,795
And Anna hanging out together.

124
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,590
That's... That's awkward.

125
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,194
- Not really.
- Well, I meant for me.

126
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,830
How are you guys?
You guys good? You guys getting along?

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,879
Yes. In fact, we were just about
to go to the library...

128
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,712
...to do some research.

129
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,279
We were?

130
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,271
Yeah. The library.

131
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,756
- For books.
- Books.

132
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,310
Yeah. And then we thought we'd go
shopping, right? South Coast Plaza?

133
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,391
- Sounds good. Okay.
- All right.

134
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,152
Okay.

135
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,470
That doesn't sound good at all.

136
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,919
- Hey, guys.
- Kirsten. You made it.

137
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,036
How are you feeling, sweetie?

138
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,510
Julie told us you were
"under the weather" at Thanksgiving.

139
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,878
- She did?
- Oh, well, the holidays can be so stressful.

140
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,589
I could go for a little hair of the dog
myself right about now.

141
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,671
We'll see you out there.

142
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,308
- Hey, wait up, guys.
- Julie.

143
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,835
Kirsten, you showed up.
How are you feeling?

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,753
So did you tell everyone
I was drunk at Thanksgiving?

145
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,115
Everyone was wondering
where you were, so...

146
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,271
I was at the office working.

147
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,431
Well, hey, it's okay.
We're all friends here.

148
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,592
If we're all friends,
why don't you start acting like one?

149
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,996
- Hi. Ryan, isn't it?
- Hi.

150
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,037
Luke will be right down. Come in.

151
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,668
- No! Mine!
- Give me! Give it!

152
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,159
- Stop! The head!
- Just give...

153
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,153
- Stop it.
- Guys, guys. This is Luke's friend Ryan.

154
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,151
Ryan, this is Eric and Brad.

155
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,799
- Give it now.
- Stop.

156
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,473
- Who wants a snack?
- Me.

157
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,358
Ryan?

158
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,829
- Hello.
- Daddy, you're home.

159
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,512
- There they are. How are you doing?
- Can we play some ball later?

160
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,831
You know what, kids,
I'm just home to drop off Mom's car.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,198
One of the belts was misaligned. I had
them change the oil too. Sorry, fellas.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,151
You remember Luke's friend Ryan.
They're doing a project together.

163
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,914
- Yeah? What about?
- Spanish Inquisition.

164
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,389
Not one of Western civilization's
proudest moments.

165
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,235
I was a history major at USC.
Now I sell cars for a living.

166
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,789
Don't listen to him, Ryan.
He owns three dealerships.

167
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,316
- God, Mom. Brag much?
- She's just being proud of me.

168
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,436
Let's just do this.
We got a lot of work.

169
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,034
Yeah, me too. Gus is outside.
I'll see you tonight.

170
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,350
Ryan, keep him on his toes, please.

171
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,351
Luke, SC-Notre Dame this Saturday.

172
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,795
Thought we'd drive up about noon.
Tailgate.

173
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,154
Yeah, cool.

174
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,198
Ryan, it's gonna be a good game.
You're more than welcome.

175
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,955
- Come on, give it back. It's not yours!
- Guys!

176
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,749
So how you wanna do this?

177
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,239
I don't know. I was thinking...

178
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,551
Because I got books from the library,
I pulled some stuff off the Web.

179
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,792
I was thinking we could do, like,
a screen show on my PowerBook.

180
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,793
My dad's got a scanner at the office,
color LaserJet, PowerPoint.

181
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,872
We could just pull some stuff here
and then head over there.

182
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,279
You know, or not.

183
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,430
No, no. That sounds good.

184
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,509
Yeah.

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,072
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey. It's me. Can you talk?

186
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,357
Yeah. I'm just packing
some of Marissa's winter things.

187
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,636
I'll drop them by in the morning,
if that's okay.

188
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,836
Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

189
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,430
- What's going on, Jimmy?
- <i>Look, l</i>... <i>I had a meeting with Sandy.</i>

190
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,991
And it looks like I have to pay
everything back by January 1 st.

191
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,436
- Jimmy, it's the holidays.
- I don't have any other choice.

192
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,194
What are Kaitlin and I supposed to do?
Where will we live?

193
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,635
Live with your mother or... Caleb's.

194
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,198
No, we can't. And we shouldn't have to.
This is my house too. And Kaitlin's.

195
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,352
- <i>And we're not selling.</i>
- Julie, I could go to jail.

196
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,196
Maybe you should, Jimmy.
Have you ever thought about that?

197
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,392
<i>Maybe you deserve to go to jail.</i>

198
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,751
Dad?

199
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,998
Hello?

200
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,991
Dad, you here?

201
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,600
I don't know. He must've gone home.

202
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,233
Nice, huh? They're giving these away.

203
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,874
Oh, nice. It's in.

204
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,873
Check it out:
450 horsepower, 8-cylinder.

205
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,114
Dude, you have to get in.

206
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,713
Wow, man.

207
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,269
The stereo's insane.

208
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,552
Is that your dad?

209
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,876
Yeah, and that's
his business partner, Gus.

210
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,871
We should go say hey.

211
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,231
- Lf you tell anyone...
- I won't.

212
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,914
- Go! Let's go!
- Luke?

213
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,992
Luke!

214
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,870
Sorry I'm late.
I slept through my alarm.

215
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,712
No, it's okay.

216
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,918
How'd it go last night?
You didn't call me, so...

217
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,834
- We were working pretty late.
- Did you meet his mom? She's really great.

218
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,912
- Seemed nice, yeah.
- And I'm sure his dad was out of town?

219
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,789
- No, he was there.
- Really? Because he's never around.

220
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,669
He's got these dealerships in other cities,
and he's always traveling.

221
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,234
What?

222
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,789
Nothing. Just...

223
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,271
- I need some coffee.
- Okay.

224
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,034
I knew you guys would talk.
So, what did he say about me?

225
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,079
Nothing.

226
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,957
Fine. I'll go grab Seth.

227
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,473
Wait.

228
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,189
Something happened last night.

229
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,314
But I told Luke I wouldn't say anything.

230
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,914
Is it...? Is he okay?

231
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,639
What is it?

232
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,836
Ryan, you can tell me.

233
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,389
You can't tell anyone,
not even Summer.

234
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,835
- Especially Summer.
- I won't. I swear.

235
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,276
- Because I'm not even telling Seth.
- You can trust me.

236
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,318
I won't say a word. I promise.

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,037
Well, apparently some of us
are on Central time.

238
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,918
Yeah, sorry.

239
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,917
So how was your date with Luke,
your new study buddy?

240
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,073
- It was fine. Something for the road?
- Yes, I'd like something. It's called gossip.

241
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,038
Was there any cross-burning?
Any goose-stepping?

242
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,031
Small Taiwanese family
locked in the basement?

243
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,760
- Not so much. Fruit? Bagel?
- Yeah, a bagel would be good.

244
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,831
Yes. So would some information.

245
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,754
You went behind enemy lines. Come on,
the parents. What's the deal? Cyborgs?

246
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,433
Supremacists? Vegans?

247
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,670
We went to his dad's dealership,
looked at cars.

248
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,955
You guys friends now?

249
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,836
First Summer and Anna.
Now you and Luke.

250
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,556
They came out
of the bathroom together.

251
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,871
Then they went off
to the library together. Together.

252
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,917
Stranger things have happened.

253
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,914
Two people who hate each other,
brought together by their hatred of me.

254
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,629
It's like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader
teaming up to destroy the Emperor.

255
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,956
- Hey, we should talk about...
- We got nothing to talk about.

256
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,475
- Our presentation?
- I'll finish it myself.

257
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,914
All right.

258
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,391
- What are you looking at, queer?
- Somebody writing you new material?

259
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,279
All right, go with what works.

260
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,435
I... I gotta get to Spanish.

261
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,111
So I guess this means you and Luke are
not friends, which I find oddly comforting.

262
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,152
I promise.

263
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,035
So, hey.

264
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,189
That's a big test.

265
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,517
You know what?

266
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,829
Don't.

267
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,239
Hey, wanna...? Over there?

268
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,549
- Hey.
- Hey.

269
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,756
- Is this seat taken?
- It is now.

270
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,353
Cool.

271
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,193
- So did you study for the bio thing?
- Kind of.

272
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,509
Well, I didn't.

273
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,511
Don't worry. All you have to remember is:

274
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,319
Kittens prefer cream or fish,
generally speaking.

275
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,799
Excuse me?

276
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,475
Kingdom. Phylum. Class. Order.
Family. Genus. Species.

277
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,359
- You're, like, really smart.
- Compared to what?

278
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,668
Well, me.

279
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,309
- Summer, you're smart.
- Well, smart enough to sit next to you.

280
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,198
What was that kitten thing again?

281
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,669
Kittens prefer cream or fish,
generally speaking.

282
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,637
Or, if you're not a cat person:

283
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,950
King Philip comes over for good sex.

284
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,634
- Definitely not a cat person.
- Right.

285
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,597
That's really good. Thanks.

286
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,669
I am so sore. Are you?

287
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,395
I'm fine. You must not
have stretched properly.

288
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,558
Are you okay?

289
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,469
Sandy told me about the house.

290
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,791
Nothing to tell. I'm not selling.

291
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,518
Julie...

292
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,633
Julie.

293
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,876
If you and Kaitlin
need somewhere to live...

294
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,758
...I can find you a house.

295
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,797
My dad can find you a house.

296
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,555
Not according to him. Not without
compromising our relationship.

297
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,914
He said that?

298
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,959
So I told him if that's true, we don't have
to have a relationship. So now we don't.

299
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,350
I had no idea. I'm so sorry.

300
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,671
Wow. You'd think you'd be celebrating.

301
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,400
Go ahead. Tell everybody
that Caleb Nichol dumped me...

302
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,393
...my husband's going to jail,
and I have no place to live.

303
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,155
What you waiting for? I told them about
Thanksgiving. Now you can get even.

304
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,878
If you need anything, let me know.

305
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,309
Oh, my God! You guys, I just ran
into Betsy on the elliptical trainer.

306
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,358
She was getting her car
serviced this morning.

307
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,839
Okay, come here.

308
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,315
Okay, you can't tell anyone...

309
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,792
...but you are not going
to believe this. Okay...

310
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,797
I've never seen you hit the ball
like that, Jimmy. You crushed it.

311
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,594
Creative visualization.

312
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,228
- Julie's head.
- Get a realtor, show the house.

313
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,796
- But she...
- Julie will change her tune.

314
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,352
Once word spreads that the SEC
is investigating her...

315
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,557
...as a possible co-conspirator,
forget about it.

316
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,153
They are?

317
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,038
I can make a call.

318
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,439
Thank you.

319
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,516
- I'll get this one.
- Thanks.

320
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,559
You know, I gotta say,
you've just been incredibly...

321
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,756
...cool with me. I...

322
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,717
You know, considering...

323
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,029
...everything.

324
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,916
You know, I really appreciate, you know,
you just not saying anything...

325
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,197
...and I know you only heard it
from Kirsten's point of view...

326
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,237
...but I want you to hear it from me.

327
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,638
That whole thing was just a huge mistake.
I'm really sorry.

328
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,268
Jimmy, what the hell
are you talking about?

329
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,637
- Kirsten didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?

330
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,312
You know, when Julie kicked me out...

331
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,678
...I was lost, and Kirsten...

332
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,593
...came over to help me
set up my place.

333
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,713
And...

334
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,475
...I...

335
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,313
...kissed her.

336
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,759
Now, she was totally mortified. I...
And I apologized immediately.

337
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,952
She left, like...

338
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,519
...faster than that. I mean...

339
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,229
And she didn't tell you, because she
didn't... She didn't want to hurt you.

340
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,278
It meant nothing. So she didn't
want to hurt you over...

341
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,078
Over nothing.

342
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,597
Which now...

343
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,712
...I've done.

344
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,678
Creative visualization, Jimmy.

345
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,513
I'm trying hard not to see your head
as something I should hit.

346
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,352
Look, I'm really sorry.

347
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,274
I, you know... I just didn't want there
to be any secrets between us.

348
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,917
Mission accomplished.

349
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,477
- Hey.
- I've some news, but I'm only telling you.

350
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,877
Oh, my God.
Coop, you are not going to believe this.

351
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,429
Did you hear about Luke's dad?

352
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,519
I haven't heard about Luke's dad.

353
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,074
- Hey, I have crazy news for you.
- It's about your woman problems.

354
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,798
No, it's definitely not.

355
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,349
I heard his dad's favorite show
is <i>Dawson 's Crack.</i>

356
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,954
I heard it was <i>Ever-woody.</i>

357
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,553
Wait, Ryan.

358
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,909
- Hey, man, look...
- Who'd you tell?

359
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,036
Listen, I'm sorry.

360
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,273
You're dead.

361
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,789
- Everyone knows.
- Yeah, well, who'd you tell?

362
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,678
What? I didn't tell any...

363
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,991
- Was it Summer? I asked you not to...
- Why do you just assume it was me?

364
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,357
Because I'm the only one who knew,
and you're the only one I told.

365
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,233
I didn't tell anyone.

366
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,789
I never should've told you
in the first place.

367
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,430
Probably not, since obviously
you don't trust me.

368
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,393
You know what,
find your own ride home.

369
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,752
Hey.

370
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,319
Hey.

371
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,270
It's amazing about the Wards.
How fast word travels.

372
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,237
Sometimes.

373
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,390
- I'd ask you if everything's okay...
- It's not.

374
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,677
Which leads me to my next question.

375
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,071
It's well-covered territory with us.

376
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,911
Jimmy Cooper.

377
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,510
I... I want to do my best
not to sound too...

378
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,912
...high-school, but...

379
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,352
He kissed you.

380
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,759
He told you?

381
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,992
He didn't want there to be any secrets
between us. Apparently...

382
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,469
...you don't feel the same way.
- Of course I do.

383
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,392
It's just that it meant nothing.

384
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,030
Putting my own skepticism about
that remark aside for just a moment...

385
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,838
...if it meant nothing...

386
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,075
...then why didn't you tell me?

387
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,508
- Because I knew it would upset you.
- Thank you.

388
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,195
Because I feel much so better
having heard it from someone else.

389
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,878
- I'm sorry.
- All this time...

390
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,352
...this suspicion and paranoia
about me and my co-worker...

391
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,159
...and you're sitting on this.
- Sandy...

392
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,878
Sandy...

393
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,674
It means nothing.

394
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,998
It means something to me.

395
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,316
Okay, it's just that, after all
the years of Luke calling me gay...

396
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,036
...it's great that the shoe's on the other...

397
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,839
Actually, it's on his dad's foot,
but you get the symmetry.

398
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,718
It's not funny.

399
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,792
It's the end of their marriage.
The life they knew is over.

400
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,793
- I heard Meredith's filing for divorce.
- I was over there.

401
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,269
- They seemed really happy.
- Yeah?

402
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,715
By "happy," do you mean gay?

403
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,677
Seth, cut it out.

404
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,389
I mean, how can you be married for
that long and keep that kind of a secret?

405
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,993
You'd be surprised.

406
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,752
But eventually the secrets come out.

407
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,636
And some marriages can handle
the truth, and some can't.

408
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,753
Yeah, well, I'm sure everyone
will be so accepting...

409
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,798
...seeing as we're
such a liberal, tolerant bunch.

410
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,599
That was at the expense
of Orange County, not Luke's dad.

411
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,830
His big gay dad.

412
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,639
Did you see his arms?
What straight guy has arms like that?

413
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,915
Not my husband.

414
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,153
Charles and I went to see <i>The Lion King</i>
with the Wards, and Carson cried.

415
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,753
Wept.

416
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,075
All these years I've known him,
he's never once made a pass at me.

417
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,629
I feel so much better.

418
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,073
- I can't be here right now.
- Have you eaten?

419
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,992
- What do you have in mind?
- Fried food and beer.

420
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,798
First round's on me.

421
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,516
All right, if everyone will take
his or her seat, we shall begin.

422
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,148
Anyone seen Luke?

423
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,828
Okay, let's open our books to page 59...

424
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,958
...the Chesapeake
and the West Indian colonies.

425
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,471
So you should come over, like, at 4.

426
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,757
Yeah. I've got lit mag after school,
but I can come by after that.

427
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,480
Okay, yeah, the flash cards
should be done by then.

428
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,348
Hi, you guys.
Can I speak to you for one minute, please?

429
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,478
Because I owe you both
an enormous apology.

430
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,516
I guess, technically,
I owe two apologies...

431
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,389
...each one tailored to the specific wrongs
visited upon the specific person.

432
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,676
But since you two seem to be
a package deal...

433
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,355
- Cohen!
- Right. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry.

434
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,479
And I'm also sorry that I apologized
to her first. It's just, chronologically, l...

435
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,039
- Cohen.
- Right. Stupid, I know.

436
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,873
Well, let me start by saying
nothing in my life...

437
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,431
...nothing, prepared me for the events
of that fateful Thanksgiving day.

438
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,478
But I'm not gonna make
any excuses for what I did.

439
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,674
I just wanna say one thing
in my defense, which is:

440
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,355
You can't really blame me for wanting
the company of either of you two.

441
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,352
And I know that I hurt your feelings
and I feel bad about that.

442
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,798
I do, but please believe me when I say
that it wasn't intentional, okay?

443
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,190
I would never do anything
to ruin our friendship...

444
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,874
...or "-ships."

445
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,312
I know I have no right to ask...

446
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,392
...I just hope that some day
you can both forgive me.

447
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,677
Okay. So, yeah, thanks for your time.

448
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,712
You know, I never liked flash cards.
They never worked for me.

449
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,110
Yeah, you know,
I think I study better alone.

450
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,953
That's good, because I think
lit mag is going to go late.

451
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,031
- Maybe next test?
- Maybe.

452
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,596
It's like they enjoy it.

453
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,796
Well, I can't exactly claim that I didn't
once see the fun in witnessing...

454
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,633
...the fall of the rich and fabulous.

455
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,031
Then I became homeless,
and suddenly not so funny.

456
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,873
I don't really think that my dad
would let you go homeless.

457
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,792
Yeah, well, when I even mentioned...

458
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,633
...that I might have to sell
the house, he went into a panic.

459
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,831
You'd have thought
I was asking for a ring.

460
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,036
- That's so him.
- And when I tried to explain...

461
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,758
- He didn't listen.
- Not a word.

462
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,230
Can I ask you a question?
Do you like that he calls you Kiki?

463
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,231
- Hate it.
- He kept calling me Juju...

464
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,278
...like that candy that gets in your teeth.
I begged him to stop.

465
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,000
- When he gets something in his head...
- It has to be his way.

466
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,593
Always.

467
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,992
It's just who he is.

468
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,156
He can't spend longer than three months
with the same woman before he freaks.

469
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,719
He freaked, all right.

470
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,348
And I wish I could tell him
that I know what he's doing.

471
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,080
He's trying to replace my mom.

472
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,071
But he can't.

473
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,472
And I just wish that he would
stop trying and be happy.

474
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,359
- But you can't talk to my dad.
- No, I know.

475
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,791
And the important thing is that he finds
someone to share his life with.

476
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,155
Enjoy these years.

477
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,032
I just don't know
if he's ever gonna figure that out.

478
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,676
- Hi.
- Hey.

479
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,430
So that apology...

480
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,876
...aside from being the first
I've ever received from a boy...

481
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,679
...was also the nicest.

482
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,956
Well. Well...

483
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,997
...I meant it, so, good.

484
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,712
So, what are you doing Saturday?

485
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,195
- Hey, Seth.
- Hey.

486
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,396
- You going to lit mag?
- Yeah.

487
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,516
Wanna walk together?

488
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,236
- Do you?
- Yes.

489
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,231
That was so sweet,
what you said earlier.

490
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,231
And I could tell you really meant it.

491
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,197
We know sincerity
isn't your strong point.

492
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,511
- I'm working on it.
- I'd like to help.

493
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,833
What are you doing Saturday night?

494
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,797
Well, in the new spirit of sincerity...

495
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,072
...I have a date with Summer.

496
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,832
Yeah, so...

497
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,632
What are you doing Friday night?

498
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,709
What am I doing Friday night?

499
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,672
- Hi. Why are you here?
- Same reason you are.

500
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,592
- Hey.
- You okay, man?

501
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,952
Look, man...

502
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,751
I owe you an apology.

503
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,319
It wasn't you who said anything.

504
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,191
My dad, after we saw him,
he came out to my mom.

505
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:02,117
She wigged and called a couple friends,
and then everybody in Newport knew.

506
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,157
Don't worry about it. I just...

507
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,709
...wanted to see how you were doing.

508
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,432
Hey, Mom.

509
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,913
Meredith, please.

510
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,270
Luke, could I...?

511
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,759
Luke, please.

512
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,509
My entire life has been one giant lie.

513
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,153
Everything I thought
I knew about my dad.

514
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,913
I mean, all those business trips he took.

515
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,748
Or how about when he missed one of my
games because he was working late.

516
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,912
I don't even know if this guy was
the first one or if there were others.

517
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,074
- I can't even think about it.
- Look, I know it's hard.

518
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,758
But after everything I've been through
with my dad, we've never been closer.

519
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,435
I mean, we're finally able to be honest
with each other and talk to each other.

520
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,591
Maybe you could have that
with your dad.

521
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,638
What he has to say, I don't wanna hear.

522
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,350
I'm gonna go grab a jacket. It's cold.

523
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,834
Well, even if he...

524
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,560
...wasn't honest with you...

525
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,789
...he still cared.

526
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,037
He did make it
to some of your games.

527
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,315
Whatever.

528
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,311
What does it even matter?

529
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,836
It matters.

530
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,037
Especially if you had a dad who didn't
make it to any of your games.

531
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,034
Who didn't even know
what sport you played or cared.

532
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,358
Everything is just so screwed up.

533
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,232
Isn't this romantic?
A couple of Harbor Butt Pirates.

534
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,478
Is there a problem?

535
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,995
Other than the fact
that we kick your ass every year?

536
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,628
No, dude. No problem at all.

537
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,392
Didn't mean to interrupt your date.

538
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,231
Fag.

539
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,630
What did you call me?

540
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,556
Yo, dude, save that for your boyfriend.

541
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,076
- Okay, let's just not do this.
- How about a black eye for the queer guy?

542
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,549
Why don't you just run to your daddy.

543
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,393
Julie, hi.

544
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,915
I just had to come over
and say thank you.

545
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,399
- For what?
- I got home today.

546
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,632
There was a message on my machine,
"It's Caleb, call me." Whatever.

547
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,950
- Well...
- I know. But I call him, right?

548
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,590
Just in case he's ready to apologize,
which, P.S., he's not.

549
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,672
So he starts again with the excuses,
and he's feeling pressured.

550
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,910
- Well, because it's all about him.
- Exactly.

551
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,311
But then I remembered what you said
at lunch, so I let him have it.

552
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,755
- You did?
- I told him he's scared. Life's too short.

553
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,798
- Spend it with someone you enjoy.
- You did?

554
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,428
Don't worry, he doesn't think
it came from you.

555
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,478
But the important thing is, it worked.

556
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,275
- How so?
- Kirsten...

557
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,432
...he's buying my house
as an investment.

558
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,319
Jimmy's not going to jail.
Kaitlin and I have a place to live.

559
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,914
And who knows...

560
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,277
...maybe some day your
next-door neighbor will be your dad.

561
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,957
I don't know what to say.

562
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,192
Well, you might want to water that.
Bye.

563
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,829
<i>Here, you look like a strong, healthy boy.</i>

564
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,274
<i>Give me a hand.</i>

565
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,751
Hey, Seth.

566
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,150
Ask your mother who was at the door.

567
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,269
Mom, who was at the door?

568
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,796
- Julie Cooper, bearing gifts.
- Julie Cooper, Dad.

569
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,836
Ask your mother what she wanted.

570
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,952
Dad wants to know who...
What she wanted.

571
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,476
Dad, better idea, ask her yourself.
Come on.

572
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,949
Julie Cooper sold her house.

573
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,951
To my father.

574
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,190
Now that I wish you hadn't told me.

575
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,555
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

576
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,479
Are you guys okay?

577
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,791
- I didn't do it this time.
- I'm gonna get the first-aid kit.

578
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,359
Come on, have a seat.

579
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,556
Hey, what happened?

580
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,392
I guess bad news travels fast.

581
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,198
- Have you called your folks?
- No.

582
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,272
- I'll call them.
- No. I'd rather not call them, if it's okay.

583
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,750
- All right. He can stay in the guest room.
- Sure.

584
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,319
- I'm gonna call his dad.
- Okay.

585
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,635
So do you guys need
a ride to school in the morning?

586
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,199
You don't mind?

587
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,920
Yeah, well, you were pretty great
with Luke today.

588
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,277
- I never should've told you.
- Because I'll tell everyone, right?

589
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,876
- No, because he asked me not to.
- But the unwritten rule of relationships...

590
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,235
...says you're allowed
to tell your girlfriend.

591
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,234
Because everything you say to me
stays with me, and vice versa.

592
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,109
So you didn't tell anybody I went off on
you yesterday when I thought you'd told?

593
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,272
No. Well, I mean, just Summer.

594
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,116
Will you tell Summer about this?

595
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,632
No, this will stay just between us.

596
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,953
Carson, are you sure
I can't get you anything to eat?

597
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,111
Some Scotch? Xanax?

598
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,316
No, thank you.

599
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,550
- He's not coming down.
- Well, he's half-asleep.

600
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,915
Maybe it'd be better
to talk in the morning.

601
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,959
He's not gonna want to talk to me.
I lied to him.

602
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,351
I lied to everyone. I...

603
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,552
The truth is, I love his mom.
I always have.

604
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,748
And I love our family.
And I just didn't want to hurt anybody.

605
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,074
- And now he's up there hurting.
- Hey, if there's anything we can do...

606
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,118
No. No, I've embarrassed
my family enough.

607
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,840
I think the best thing
I could do now is to disappear.

608
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,197
No, I think that'd be the worst
thing you could do. I mean...

609
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,316
...it's what you've been doing all along.

610
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,393
But coming out and being honest with
yourself and your family, in this town...

611
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,516
...it's the bravest thing
you could've done.

612
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,114
Look, it's just my opinion...

613
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,352
...but you're the kind of father
any kid would be proud of.

614
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,755
Well, I should go.

615
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,672
Dad.

616
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,397
Just let me grab my shoes.

617
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,149
I'll go with you.

618
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,078
So while we're being honest...

619
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,912
Oh, God.

620
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,832
There's more?

621
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,548
That was a pretty impressive speech
you made in there.

622
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,472
Well, I'm prone to impressive speeches.

623
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,676
Right up until that line, yeah.

624
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,471
- From now on, you'll tell all your secrets?
- You gonna tell me all yours?

625
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,596
- You know, I don't think I have any.
- Really?

626
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,954
- Yeah.
- You sure?

627
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,270
- I think.
- Nothing from your past?

628
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,431
No secret fantasies?

629
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,512
No hidden porn stash on the PC?

630
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,114
No, because obviously you
already know about that one.

631
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:18,359
There's no way you can know
everything about someone.

632
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,832
- That's what keeps it interesting.
- Well, it hasn't been uninteresting.

633
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,878
At a certain point,
you have to trust the other person.

634
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,793
- That's what love is.
- Okay.

635
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,715
So you'll have to trust that you can
tell me things that I may not wanna hear.

636
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,275
We can handle it.

637
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,633
Like...

638
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,231
...Jimmy Cooper kissed me?

639
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,117
Trust me.

640
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,913
- This is gonna be weird.
- Yep.

641
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,231
Everybody's gonna be
staring at me and talking.

642
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,674
Yep.

643
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,150
Maybe I can just blow
the whole thing off...

644
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,517
...go hit the beach, give everybody time
to get it out of their systems.

645
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,036
It doesn't work like that. It's been
months. I'm still the kid from Chino...

646
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,428
...that burned a house down.

647
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,512
And I'm still the girl
who tried to kill herself in Mexico.

648
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,750
And I'm still the...

649
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,319
I'm still Seth Cohen.

650
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,592
Man, this is gonna suck.

651
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,752
Yep. Well, welcome to my world.
