1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,151
-Previously on The O. C. :
-Her dad is dying.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,118
-He asked me to find her.
-Rebecca Bloom? Love of your life?

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,999
-Will you come?
-Lindsay asked me to be the buffer.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,072
-Grandpa hates you.
-What is it that the two of you want?

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,349
-Money?
-What?

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,676
-Cohen's gonna do his own comic.
-They're good.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,678
-Yeah?
-The boobs are a little big. Aren't they?

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,229
Summer and I may be
taking a step forward.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,238
Aren't you sick of me? We've hung
out every day this week.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,079
-You're still in love with her.
-She's dead.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,549
Rebecca.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,070
-You're up early.
-I'm studying for this test.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,748
That's great. I was actually
on my way out to talk.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,632
-Studying.
-Fine. We can talk here.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,155
The issue feels
a little more pool house-y.

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,952
-ls this about Alex?
-No, no.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,033
She's merely kitchen-table fodder at this
point, no longer up to pool-house snuff.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,834
-So it's Summer and Zach.
-Yes. Which I realize is...

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,516
...more of an evening subject best
served over a game of PlayStation.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,352
-I'll allow it.
-Great. Thanks a lot.

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,633
So the three of us are moving forward
with this comic book.

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,070
-Right. So?
-Summer and I are getting involved...

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,835
...professionally. You know how these
things go. Late nights at the office....

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,479
-You don't have an office.
-Sure.

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,236
But with the added stress of work
and deadlines, things can get sexy.

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,477
-You're writing a comic book. Not sexy.
-You think I'm reaching.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,750
I think you're moving on
with Alex and Summer.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,593
For the first time,
you're not facing any women issues.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,633
So I'm complaining that
I have nothing to complain about?

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,592
This is what I'm saying.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,319
Okay, great.

32
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,519
Then I will await the next great romance
to wreak havoc on my heart and mind.

33
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,039
I can hardly wait.

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,114
-Hi.
-Well, you're up early.

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,756
-Are you sneaking in after curfew?
-Busted.

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,708
-Am I grounded?
-Perhaps if I let you off...

37
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,316
...you'll remember this act of kindness
and afford me the same leniency...

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,038
...should I miss my own curfew.

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,435
-Keep dreaming.
-lt was worth a shot.

40
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,354
You're home.

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,638
-I was worried about you.
-I'm okay. I was just beat.

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,439
How did Professor Bloom take the news
about Rebecca?

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,719
-How do you think he took it?
-I can only imagine.

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,190
His only daughter, and now she's gone.
He didn't even get to see her.

45
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,629
-Hello.
-Hey, Sandy. Rebecca.

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,516
-Yeah.
-Listen, I'm at the pier.

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,989
-Want me to grab you some coffee?
-No, no.

48
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,718
Nine is fine. I'll see you then.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,513
Okay.

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,592
It's gonna be a little hectic
for a while.

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,551
Well, you should try and get some sleep.
You look exhausted.

52
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,956
-You're up and about early.
-Test. Not ready.

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,272
-Don't miss those days.
-Oh, thanks.

54
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,158
-How's school? Life?
-Yeah, pretty good. The usual.

55
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,517
-You and Lindsay?
-We're good.

56
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,716
You know, we're good.

57
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,792
There was definite hesitation.

58
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,190
No, no. I'm just studying.

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,432
Ryan, whatever you did,
it can be undone.

60
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,875
Candies, flowers, work miracles.

61
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,550
Actually, it's not something I did.
Thanks for your confidence. It's....

62
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,229
-It's your dad.
-The one man impervious to miracles.

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,834
-What happened?
-Well, Lindsay reached out to him.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,958
Or I did for her. There was a meal.

65
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,793
Or there was supposed to be a meal.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,433
-We went to a restaurant.
-Poor girl. What did he say?

67
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,517
He didn't actually take
out his checkbook.

68
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,676
He thought she wanted money?

69
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,229
He must've got her confused
with my other sister.

70
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,597
-Or his wife.
-I'm not the biggest fan of your dad.

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,473
But I mean, Luke Skywalker was happy
to have a dad...

72
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,591
...even if he was Darth Vader.

73
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,833
You're right. She needs a dad.
I'll handle this.

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,874
There's gonna be another meal.
Here. And actual food will be eaten.

75
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,832
And I'll make sure that he behaves.

76
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,750
Did we really drink
that much last night?

77
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,558
We drank that much here.

78
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,637
Who knew Harbor chicks
could throw down.

79
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,308
Yeah, well, I'm not like the other girls.

80
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,193
Then it's time I show you
the meth lab in the basement.

81
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,277
I thought you'd never ask.

82
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,953
So I guess you have to go to school.

83
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,317
Say hi to Seth for me.
I kind of miss his little chicken arms.

84
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,074
What's he been up to?
He hasn't bugged me for a while.

85
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,956
I don't know. But I was kind
of thinking of skipping school.

86
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,588
How much is there to learn
about the Aztecs anyway?

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,678
-Nothing, really.
-That's exactly what I was thinking.

88
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,070
So, what do you wanna do?

89
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,511
-Well, you ready for that surf lesson?
-Y es. Awesome.

90
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,879
Let me just jump in the shower,
if that's okay.

91
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,431
Wait. Do you have a shirt I can borrow?
This one kind of smells like cigarettes.

92
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,076
So who would've thought Sandy Cohen
would be living in Newport Beach...

93
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,198
-...surrounded by all these surfers.
-It's been 22 years.

94
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,749
You say that like it's a long time.

95
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,675
-So you have two kids, huh?
-Yeah.

96
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,308
Who'd you end up marrying?
Wait, let me guess.

97
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,109
Left-wing radical from Long lsland.
Reformed.

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,872
Yep. That's it.

99
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,837
Not even close.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,834
Rich. Conservative. Presbyterian.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,195
She grew up right, well, here basically.

102
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,194
Blond. Blue eyes. Cute little nose.
Like a button.

103
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,996
You're full of surprises.

104
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,469
How'd she take the news
about my return?

105
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,915
Well, I haven't told her yet.

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,030
I don't want her to be considered
an accomplice.

107
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,955
-What with my harboring a fugitive.
-Yeah, that I am.

108
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,031
So, what about you? Are you married?

109
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,351
You got those five kids
you always wanted to have?

110
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,717
Not even close.
I haven't met anybody since you.

111
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,032
It's hard to meet people when you can't
let anybody know who you really are...

112
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,236
...and you can't stay in one place
too long.

113
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,512
-I see how that might salt your game.
-"Salt my game"?

114
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,716
Is that how they talk
in Orange County?

115
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,713
Stick around,
you'll be saying "rad" in no time.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,036
Yeah, except I'm not staying.

117
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,918
I figured l'd...

118
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,315
...hang out in my lovely accommodations
at the fleabag inn...

119
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,029
...for another 48 hours.
Spend this time with my dad.

120
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,719
Then disappear.

121
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,511
-You're leaving?
-How can I stay?

122
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,439
As you said yourself, I'm a fugitive.

123
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,036
The feds are looking for me.
I don't wanna get you in any trouble.

124
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,668
Does your dad know you're leaving
so soon?

125
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,031
I was hoping
you'd help me out with that.

126
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,114
Hey there.

127
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,399
-So, what do you want for dinner?
-Why? Are you inviting me over?

128
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,911
-Kirsten is.
-Great.

129
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,117
-So who's it gonna be with?
-You know. Me, you, Kirsten, Caleb.

130
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,439
Caleb.

131
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,315
-Caleb.
-Why?

132
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,516
One horrible dining experience
wasn't enough?

133
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,190
Kirsten just feels bad
about what happened at our dinner.

134
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,078
-You told her.
-She wants to help.

135
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,993
Well, I don't want her help.
I don't want your help.

136
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,355
And I definitely don't wanna dine
with Caleb.

137
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,751
All right, look, Luke Skywalker
was happy to find his dad, right?

138
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,115
Even if he turned out
to be Darth Vader.

139
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,512
Ryan, Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader
fought each other with lightsabers...

140
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,318
...until one of them died.

141
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,869
Vader cut off Skywalker's hand.

142
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,312
-When you put it that way....
-Look, just don't worry about my family.

143
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,391
Or our family, whatever they are.

144
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,869
-Just let it be, okay?
-All right.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,879
Kirsten. What a pleasure
to see you in my office.

146
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,158
You know, that Y ogalates
or Cardio Barre...

147
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,517
...whatever it is you've been up to,
is working wonders on you.

148
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,148
And that top, it's so fetching.

149
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,311
Fetching? Are you done?

150
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,557
Done complimenting my beautiful
daughter on how beautiful she is?

151
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,069
Dad. I need you to do me a favor.

152
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,238
I need you to have dinner
with me, Lindsay and Ryan.

153
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,556
I need you to not be
the world's biggest ass.

154
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,672
-What are you talking about?
-You accused her of wanting money.

155
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,110
Not that you've viewed that
as a flaw before.

156
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,233
Well, she turned up
with that lnland street thug.

157
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,635
Dad, listen up.

158
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,032
Ryan, the assumed street thug, has been
living with us for a year and a half now.

159
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,710
He is a brother to Seth,
and a son to me and Sandy.

160
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,077
I still question his motives.
I'm just protective of my family.

161
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,313
This girl wants to know her father.
She wants to get to know you.

162
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,159
Now, tonight you are gonna show up
for dinner.

163
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,399
You're gonna be a real dad to this girl
or you're gonna lose two daughters.

164
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,352
Got it?

165
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,916
Dad, I can't stay. I'm already
endangering you and Sandy.

166
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,548
Oh, I see. So I'm gonna lose you
all over again.

167
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,069
-We really don't have a choice.
-Of course we do.

168
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,840
-The choice we always had.
-I'm not turning myself in.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,673
Know how long it would be before
I got to court? We'd have no time.

170
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,759
All I want is to see you clear
your name, to get your life back.

171
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,030
That'll be hard,
considering what happened.

172
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,390
Except it didn't happen, Sandy.

173
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,671
Tell him, Rebecca.

174
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,910
-Tell me what?
-Okay.

175
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,557
That night, I never showed.
I got scared.

176
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,712
Zukowski had to go it alone.

177
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,878
I knew it.

178
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,632
-Why'd you run?
-I panicked.

179
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,349
I knew if I got caught
I'd have to testify against my friends.

180
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,516
You could defend her.
You could clear her.

181
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,836
We can't ask him
to put himself at risk.

182
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,951
-He has a family now.
-No, wait, wait.

183
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,315
Before you left, we were his family.

184
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,314
Sandy, please, I am begging you.
Give my daughter her life back.

185
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,714
-Hey.
-Hey.

186
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,273
Is that Marissa?

187
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,318
Yeah, or as I like to call her,
Cosmo Girl.

188
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,398
With a passion for fashion
and a magic flask.

189
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,956
Alcoholism as a superpower.
Well, that is an interesting take.

190
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,954
You must think Marissa is hot. You won't
draw me short and stumpy, will you?

191
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,715
-To punish me for not liking you.
-This is kind of my concern.

192
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,314
-You and me and the artistic process.
-What about it?

193
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,074
Well, you and I have a history.
I'm a little concerned...

194
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,879
...that it's gonna compromise
my vision.

195
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,196
Are you writing me out?

196
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,153
I'll compromise your vision.
Don't forget my rage blackouts.

197
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,430
-I haven't. it's part of your powers.
-Really?

198
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,757
-It's very Hulk-like.
-I'm not gonna turn green, am l?

199
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,709
This is your way to make me
rip off all my clothes.

200
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,195
That there, that's our history
affecting the work.

201
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,675
Are you forgetting about
our third partner, Zach?

202
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,156
Superhero nickname, The Boyfriend.
Has the power to make me forget you.

203
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,915
I'm just saying:
High stress. Late nights. Close quarters.

204
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,992
I hope it doesn't,
but, I don't know, it could get weird.

205
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,397
-You think?
-Well....

206
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,716
-Hey, guys! I got great news.
-Hey.

207
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,158
My dad has an intern
whose uncle works at Wildstorm.

208
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,634
-Really?
-What's Wildstorm?

209
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,349
Unbelievable comic-book company.
I pitched them the shape of the idea.

210
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,876
-Zach, we don't really have--
-They love the world of Orange County.

211
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,559
They think it could be hot.

212
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,672
If they like the artwork,
they might wanna set up a meeting.

213
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,598
-All right.
-So get ready, man.

214
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,991
Late nights. High stress.
Close quarters.

215
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,839
-Oh, and, Cohen. You gotta nail Summer.
-What?

216
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,110
-Excuse me?
-I pitched Little Ms. Vixen...

217
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,039
...with her bag full of killer credit cards.
They loved her.

218
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,838
-They did? They love me.
-Yeah. Okay.

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,912
We gotta lock down her likeness.
Start drawing her right away.

220
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,832
-Okay.
-Like, tonight.

221
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,109
So I'll be posing for Cohen tonight?

222
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,629
-That's fine.
-This is gonna be great.

223
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,438
-Great.
-So great.

224
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,471
-Hey.
-Hey.

225
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,754
We're not having a party, are we?
One never knows.

226
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,753
No, it's just dinner. With my dad.

227
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,077
Don't worry. You're not invited.

228
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,716
Well, good. I should probably get back
to the office anyway.

229
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,194
Okay.

230
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,955
-Are you working with Max?
-Yeah.

231
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,556
-What's there left to do?
-Everything.

232
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,270
What if I told you he wants me to clear
Rebecca, prove she was innocent?

233
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,476
I would think that would be wonderful.

234
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,399
-You would?
-The man's daughter died.

235
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,996
If you can't bring his daughter back,
at least you can clear her name.

236
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,349
I knew you'd understand.

237
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,675
Why aren't you dressed?
Is Lindsay here?

238
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,114
-Lindsay isn't coming.
-Why?

239
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,914
-Because Caleb's coming.
-I know. That was the idea.

240
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,672
-Get her.
-I'm in the middle enough.

241
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,189
Didn't you use
Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader thing?

242
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,233
-She poked a hole in that analogy.
-My father is on his way.

243
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,109
If Lindsay doesn't show up, we'll be
having dinner with him alone.

244
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,511
That's a good point. I just don't think
there's anything I can say.

245
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,477
Maybe you're right.

246
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,432
Forks on the left.
Soup spoons on the right.

247
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,074
-What's this?
-Oh, it's something Seth drew.

248
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,630
It's a demon water-polo player,
I guess.

249
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,631
He left it here.

250
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,957
Maybe in 1 0 years I'll sell it
on eBay or something.

251
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,310
-So, what's the deal with you guys?
-We never really left the ground.

252
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,119
We taxied down the runway
but never achieved liftoff.

253
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,032
Y eah, I just got out of one of those.

254
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,589
Y eah, they're good
for getting over someone, I guess.

255
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,478
Or getting you ready for someone.

256
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,351
Hey, can I crash at your place again?

257
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,273
Anything to avoid hanging out
with my stepdad.

258
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,877
Works for me. But....

259
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,436
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

260
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,035
What are you doing with me?

261
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,917
Picking up a pint of Cherry Garcia
and renting some DVDs?

262
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,877
I mean, sleeping over, hanging out
all the time, borrowing my clothes.

263
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,990
Things that never happened with Seth,
and I was dating him.

264
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,754
Well, Seth's not really your size.

265
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,794
No. But he was, however briefly,
my boyfriend.

266
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,199
Maybe you're right. I should probably
sleep at home anyway.

267
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,830
-I'm out of fresh clothes as it is.
-Okay.

268
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,349
Oh, and I'll wash this shirt,
get it back to you.

269
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,835
No. Don't worry about it.

270
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,599
I'm almost done practicing, Mom.

271
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,679
Not your mom. Your sister.

272
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,588
-I didn't know you played the oboe.
-Oh, not well.

273
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,830
I just started practicing again.

274
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,636
-Well, it sounds great. What was that?
-lt was Brahms, an orchestral piece.

275
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,197
-You know who likes Brahms?
-Yeah, I am not going to dinner.

276
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,079
Even if Caleb is a huge fan of the oboe.

277
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,599
Look, no one has been more thoroughly
crushed by our dad than me.

278
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,076
-Hey, now there's a club I wanna join.
-He's got a lot of issues.

279
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,357
He's not the easiest guy in the world
to get along with.

280
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,034
But once you figure him out,
he's really a good guy.

281
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,794
-Really?
-I don't know.

282
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,996
I've never been able to figure him out.

283
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,189
But maybe we can try...

284
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,152
...together.

285
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,918
Well, it's not much.
But the couch is pretty comfy.

286
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,913
We got air conditioning.
Well, we don't, but we have windows.

287
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,196
-Carpeting. Very lush.
-It's private.

288
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,356
-The price, you can't beat it.
-It's great.

289
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,028
It's perfect. It'll be fine
for the next 48 hours.

290
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,156
It might take me a little longer than that
to figure out how to take on your case.

291
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,992
You are? You will?

292
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,717
Thank you.

293
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,197
I mean....

294
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,519
Thanks. I know I said
I didn't want your help...

295
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,070
-...but I kind of did.
-I kind of knew that.

296
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,472
So....

297
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,396
-Have you told your wife yet?
-No.

298
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,352
-Sandy?
-She can't know anything yet.

299
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,909
Not until we get this sorted out.

300
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,471
I don't like it...

301
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,949
...but it's the best thing for her.

302
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,759
Okay, that's your decision.

303
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,428
My dad's gonna be thrilled.

304
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,070
-We should celebrate.
-Yeah, I'll go rent out Chuck E. Cheese.

305
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,113
I know we can't go out,
but we could order in Mexican.

306
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,879
Grab a bottle of tequila.

307
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,429
-Still like Patron?
-Yeah.

308
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,278
Yeah? Smoke a little weed?

309
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,314
Cool.

310
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,519
Yeah, while I'm harboring a fugitive,
I'll go and score some pot off the street.

311
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,393
Never leave home without it.
Happen to have a bong handy?

312
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,915
Not these days, no.

313
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,958
My son, Seth, is....
He's quite the detective.

314
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,957
If my memory serves...

315
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,759
...Sandy Cohen could turn just about
anything into a pipe.

316
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,071
Soda can. Apple.

317
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,151
Do we get to listen
to the Allman Brothers?

318
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,920
Depends if you've got an apple.

319
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,358
Let's just stick to the tequila.

320
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,120
-Hello.
-Come in.

321
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,559
All right. Hey. Nice to see you
dress up for the occasion.

322
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,193
Oh, yes.

323
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,758
-Ready?
-Yeah, just a second.

324
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,833
All right.

325
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,033
Oh, my God.

326
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,349
What?

327
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,753
It's my costume.
I told you I had wardrobe approval.

328
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,872
If it was up to you, I'd wear
shredded purple jeans and pasties.

329
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,032
-No, this is better. This is much better.
-Okay, come on.

330
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,708
Let's be professional.
Less drooling, more drawing.

331
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,474
And don't give me any
junk in the trunk either.

332
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,278
It's just the gifts God gave you.

333
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,797
You think you could maybe
turn, like, 40 degrees?

334
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,758
But keep your face tilted
towards the light.

335
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,388
-And then hold your arms akimbo.
-A-what-bo?

336
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,911
Here. Just like this.

337
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,836
Okay, look. Chest out a little bit.

338
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,992
This way.

339
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,115
And kind of turn your face out
this way a little bit.

340
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,719
-Wait. There's just one....
-What...?

341
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,677
Hold on.

342
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,556
Okay. Are your greasy paws
done manhandling me?

343
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,110
Yeah. You look good.

344
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,431
-Did you just draw that? Like, now?
-You just stepped out of the light.

345
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,516
You know, I wish I could draw.
But every time I try to draw a person...

346
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,229
...it's just one big head
with legs coming out of its chin.

347
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,352
Yeah. Look how you're holding
that pencil. You're choking it.

348
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,232
I am not. This pencil can breathe.

349
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,992
The guy with no neck can't.

350
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,794
-Loosen up a little bit. All right.
-Okay.

351
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,636
-Just take it nice and easy.
-Yeah.

352
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,758
Picasso said:

353
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,798
"First, you have to be able
to draw a straight line. "

354
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,032
Right.

355
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,153
I think I've got all the angles I need.
I can do the rest from memory.

356
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,035
Yeah, good. Because my costume's
starting to ride me.

357
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,799
Excellent.

358
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,835
I'll come back for
Princess Sparkle later.

359
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,797
Okay.

360
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,632
Okay.

361
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,239
This is the best meal
you ever cooked, Kiki.

362
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,712
It's fondue, Dad. Cheese pot.
Not so difficult.

363
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,879
Did you know that
Lindsay plays the oboe?

364
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,832
Not well.

365
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,268
Do you now?

366
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,677
-Do you play any Brahms?
-I try.

367
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,073
Did you know that Dad has box seats
at the Hollywood Bowl?

368
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,510
-Have you ever been?
-No. I heard it's amazing.

369
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,316
-The tickets are yours.
-Great.

370
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,236
Ryan, what do you think?

371
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,318
A little Esa-Pekka, a little Y o-Y o Ma?

372
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,636
I don't think Ryan would be interested.

373
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,239
Dad.

374
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,995
I'm just saying. A boy like Ryan
would get bored with a show like that.

375
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,272
-Because they don't have music in Chino.
-It's fine. Just let him insult me.

376
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,958
I didn't mean to insult you. I just had
no idea you were a classical-music fan.

377
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,670
What's your favorite Brahms concerto?

378
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,758
-Ryan, I'm so sorry.
-No, it's fine. I'm just gonna go.

379
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,550
This was supposed to be about Lindsay
and Caleb making up for lost time.

380
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,838
-What are you insinuating?
-You guys have a lot to catch up on.

381
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,912
I'd hate to see you waste
all your time insulting me.

382
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,432
-Ryan, stay.
-Y es, Ryan. Stay.

383
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,592
As long as you like.
Living in this house, eating our food.

384
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,876
Dating our children.
Butting in to our affairs.

385
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,116
-You are so out of line.
-What?

386
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,955
I've forgiven him for burning down
my model home...

387
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,912
...teaching my grandson
to steal cars...

388
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,873
...and for starting a brawl
at my Man of the Y ear party.

389
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,719
Everyone seems to have forgotten
he impregnated a girl.

390
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,799
Something you might know about.
Except I didn't pay her off to stay quiet.

391
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,319
-What did you say to me?
-I'm just telling you the truth.

392
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,596
You can hide from Lindsay,
make this about me--

393
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,638
-I've had enough.
-I'm just getting started.

394
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,439
Let me tell you,
if you've come here for a fight--

395
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,868
Ryan, don't.

396
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,273
Dad!

397
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,199
Dad! Dad! Oh, my God!

398
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,590
Call 91 1! Dad!

399
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,789
-That's the last time I try cooking.
-I'm starving.

400
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,793
There's gotta be a vending machine
to raid around here.

401
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,877
-I'd love some coffee.
-Let me get that.

402
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,514
Hey, Lindsay, you wanna come?

403
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,637
I'll stay here.

404
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,590
I'm here. I'm sorry.

405
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,433
Not that I haven't wished it on him,
but how's he doing?

406
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,556
Haven't heard yet.
I was worried about you.

407
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,638
-Oh, l-- I was working late.
-Have you been drinking?

408
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,910
-Kirsten Cohen?
-Yes.

409
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,588
I'm Dr. Lasser.
I was with your father all night.

410
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,598
-Let me say he's gonna be okay.
-Oh, thank God.

411
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,194
He did, however,
suffer a mild heart attack.

412
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,597
We'll run some tests, keep him
a day or two. Nothing to worry about.

413
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,758
-Can we see him?
-Well, visits are restricted to family.

414
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,718
-I'm his daughter.
-Then right this way.

415
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,999
-Are you coming?
-ln a second.

416
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,237
I was thinking,
you around my dad right now--

417
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,118
Not the best for his blood pressure.

418
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,753
-Probably not.
-I understand.

419
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,157
I got plenty of work to do,
but I'll stay if you want me to.

420
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,635
-I have Lindsay, Ryan and Seth.
-Right.

421
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,318
Oh, my God.
You almost kissed him?

422
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,677
-Shouldn't you be at the hospital?
-Whatever. It's just Caleb.

423
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,231
Ryan said he'll be fine. Besides,
he's like a cockroach, you know?

424
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,231
He'll outlive us all.

425
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,273
-Again. You almost kissed Cohen?
-lt was not an almost kiss.

426
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,194
-lt was a nose graze. Totally different.
-Not totally.

427
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,870
Sometimes you can just have, like,
a moment with someone.

428
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,396
You know, when you're doing
something totally random...

429
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,519
...and it's just, like,
charged or something.

430
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,311
-Who have you been nose-grazing with?
-What? No one.

431
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,351
I just mean....

432
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,952
-Do you know what I mean?
-Even if you're dating a hot guy...

433
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,510
...that likes you, you can still get
flustered by a bobble-headed geek...

434
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,592
-...in size 27 jeans.
-Yeah. What is that?

435
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,791
-I don't know.
-What are you supposed to do?

436
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,916
I think it depends on who the person is.

437
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,509
If it's Cohen, well,
I think you need to use...

438
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,672
...all your weapons in your designer
handbag to defend yourself.

439
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,115
If it's a normal person, you go for it.

440
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,874
What if it's someone whose nose
you never thought you'd graze?

441
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,315
Do you mean like Princess Sparkle?

442
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,997
You are young, you are single
and you have a cute nose.

443
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,469
So why not put it out there?

444
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,034
Are you comfortable?
Do you need anything from home?

445
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,760
-Slippers? Robe?
-No, no. I'm fine.

446
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,518
Thanks.

447
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,749
Actually, I've never been better.

448
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,638
Are you on morphine?

449
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,438
I owe you both a huge apology.

450
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,837
It's a shame it took a coronary
to realize how terrible I've been.

451
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,519
-I've been terrible.
-It's okay.

452
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,593
It's not okay. But now that I've got
a second chance, well....

453
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,671
I'd like a second chance.

454
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,318
Can we start over?

455
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,433
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I didn't even think I liked you...

456
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,798
...until I thought I lost you.

457
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,752
Does that mean you forgive me?

458
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,712
Okay. Y eah.

459
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,191
-Am I going to jail?
-Not necessarily.

460
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,468
But clearing your name
is probably impossible.

461
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,195
It's not gonna be easy. I'd like
to explore some kind of amnesty...

462
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,557
...a plea bargain to keep you out of jail
so you can be with your dad.

463
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,631
Yeah. That's what's important here.

464
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,356
-What can we do?
-I need a statement of fact. Your story.

465
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,916
Then we can track down any witnesses
who can corroborate the truth.

466
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,957
But first...

467
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,997
...I gotta call my wife. Excuse me.

468
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,638
Hey, baby, it's me.
Oh, I was hoping you'd be there.

469
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,189
I guess we'll catch up
back at the ranch for dinner.

470
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,476
Call me if you need anything.

471
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,631
I love you.

472
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,349
Maybe you should be with your family,
your wife, given everything....

473
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,830
Oh, it's okay. I don't think
she really wants me there.

474
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,471
Her father and I don't exactly
get along so well.

475
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,632
-You sure?
-Yeah. The sooner we get started....

476
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,439
The sooner I'm out of your life,
and you have yours back.

477
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,278
Oh, it's not like that.

478
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,351
Yeah, it is.

479
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,199
Go home to your wife.
We'll work on this in the morning.

480
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,913
Hey.

481
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,152
-These are probably pretty cold by now.
-Thanks.

482
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,199
I was gonna go and give them to you
guys, but I didn't wanna interrupt.

483
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,669
-Where's Seth?
-He went home.

484
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,070
-To shower, do some work.
-Why didn't you go?

485
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,033
Well, I just figured I'd stay here.
Least I could do.

486
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,549
Ryan, nobody blames you for this.
Really.

487
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,438
-Hey. What's going on?
-Hey.

488
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,198
I just came by to give you this.

489
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,999
It might be worth
a lot of money someday.

490
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,590
-Nice house.
-Thanks.

491
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,595
It's good for weekends
and, you know, vacations.

492
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,877
So you seeing anyone?
Multiple people, perhaps?

493
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,752
Female? Life partner?

494
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,155
-Seth.
-That's a legitimate question.

495
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,157
Don't make me hurt you
in your nice house.

496
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,158
Well, you know what,
you hurt me enough already, so....

497
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,716
Come on. I didn't hurt you.

498
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,790
It was never that kind of thing.

499
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,157
Well, I remember you scratching
my cornea really bad.

500
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,113
And bending my arm in ways
it's not supposed to bend.

501
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,838
You know what I mean.

502
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,395
We were each other's
in-between people, you know.

503
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,519
You helped me get over Jody,
and I helped you get over...

504
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,957
...Summer.

505
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,078
It's kind of cool, actually.

506
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,754
We helped get each other ready
for what's next.

507
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,634
Well, good luck with that.

508
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,871
Good luck with Summer.

509
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,238
Look at this.

510
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,834
Well, I figured you could use
a home-cooked meal.

511
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,389
It's grilled salmon
in a raspberry coulis reduction.

512
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,118
-My favorite.
-I know.

513
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,077
My hero.

514
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,954
-You shaved.
-Well, I clean up nice.

515
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,751
So you've been working hard.
It's good you got the new office.

516
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,190
-How do you like it?
-Well....

517
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,794
It's rough around the edges.
It's just my style.

518
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,633
If you'll be spending
a lot of time there, spruce it up.

519
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,956
I like it un-spruced.

520
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,028
Well, while you are whipping up
a culinary miracle...

521
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,674
...I'm gonna go and pick up
some things for my dad.

522
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,276
-I love you.
-I love you.

523
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,274
-Hey.
-Hey.

524
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,913
-Cohen.
-Summer.

525
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,633
You....

526
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,830
-So I've been--
-Yeah, I've been thinking.

527
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,712
-Sorry. Go.
-No, no.

528
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,638
-You go first.
-Yes, okay.

529
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,998
I'll go.

530
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,959
I'm not happy...

531
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,878
...with the shadings
on my sketches.

532
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,356
I'm glad to hear that. Because I've
made modifications to my costume.

533
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,915
-And Princess Sparkle now has a cape.
-Nice touch.

534
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,113
Fantastic. I always say, every
four-legged sidekick, they need a cape.

535
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,673
-Y es.
-I always say that.

536
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,155
Yeah. Good.

537
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,914
-Do you need to draw me again?
-No. That's not necessary.

538
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,355
That is not necessary.
I've got your image.

539
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,592
-It's just seared in my memory.
-Good.

540
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,354
I think. I look forward to seeing
what you come up with.

541
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,271
Here's the thing.

542
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,109
I just think that the best way for us
to maintain a professional relationship--

543
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,073
-ls to spend very little time together?
-Yes, exactly.

544
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,508
-Good.
-It's perfect.

545
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,312
-Who's ready for a road trip?
-What?

546
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,153
I talked to the guy at Wildstorm.
He loved your drawings.

547
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,955
I set up a meeting. We're going
to San Diego. Just the three of us.

548
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,511
-Great.
-That's great.

549
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,590
-This is my fault.
-No. It's no one's fault.

550
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,790
I think Caleb has changed.

551
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,428
He really wants...

552
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,160
...a relationship with me.

553
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,631
That's great.

554
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,394
-Yeah, it is.
-Yeah.

555
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,391
It's just....

556
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,917
-I think that's gonna be pretty hard....
-lf I'm around. Yeah, I know.

557
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,789
Look, I know that he's gonna like you.

558
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,512
I mean, how could he not?

559
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,316
I just think that it's gonna take
some time.

560
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,434
-And he needs me now.
-Yeah, we'll take some time off.

561
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,876
-It's not like we haven't done it before.
-First Kirsten, now my dad.

562
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,634
You don't want a relationship
with Julie Cooper, do you?

563
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,236
-I don't think we'd see each other.
-Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

564
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,919
Look....

565
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,109
I know what it's like...

566
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,396
...not having a dad.

567
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,632
-I get it.
-Thanks.

568
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,273
Bye.

569
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,237
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me.

570
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,039
-I'm just making sure you're okay.
-Yeah.

571
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,152
I was just getting ready to sack out
on the couch.

572
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,399
All right. I'll see you in the morning,
and we'll figure this out.

573
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,592
With you leading the charge,
I have no doubt.

574
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,395
-Good night.
-Good night. Thank you.

575
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,157
-Hello?
-Oh, hey, sweetie. It's Mom.

576
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,397
-Hey. How's Grandpa?
-He's okay. I just saw him.

577
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,113
Is your dad around?

578
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,150
Hang on. Let me check.

579
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,071
Dad?

580
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,033
-I have no idea where he is right now.
-Okay.

581
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,677
Well, I'm gonna drop a few things off
at his office. It needs some sprucing up.

582
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,152
-Did you say "sprucing"?
-Yes, I did indeed.

583
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,911
All right. If he and I cross paths, is there
anything you want me to tell him?

584
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,838
No, I want it to be a surprise.

585
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,560
Just let him know that
I'll be home in a few minutes.

586
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,274
All right, I can do that. Bye-bye.

587
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,552
Yeah?

588
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,435
-Hey.
-Hey.

589
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,473
-We could use help setting the table.
-All right.

590
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,956
-Who called?
-Oh, it was Mom.

591
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,759
-Oh, yeah? What'd she say?
-She's gonna be home in a few.

592
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,750
Sandy? Is that you?

593
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,754
Rebecca?
