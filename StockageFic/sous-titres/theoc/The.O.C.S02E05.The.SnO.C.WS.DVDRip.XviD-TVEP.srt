1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,559
Previously on The O. C. :

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,915
I don't wanna talk, okay?
I'm fine with this.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,354
Zach, will you wait, please!

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,511
Beat it. Duckie!

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,871
I'd really like to try and be something.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,153
I didn't marry you for money.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,198
-Because you were pregnant.
-I married you because I loved you.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,119
If my dad is acting all weird,
he's hiding something.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,430
-You having an affair?
-We're in deeper water.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,672
-You think I'm cute.
-When I asked you out for Seth...

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,831
-...I wanted it to be me.
-You are an idiot.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,639
-An idiot you'd go out with sometime?
-It's possible.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,317
So Alex and I kissed, and you spent
the whole night at the bus stop...

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,754
...talking to Lindsay.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,434
-Somehow the double date worked out.
-I'm proud of you.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,990
What's next for you two lovebirds?
Maybe chatting at the train station?

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,151
Whispering sweet nothings
at the airport?

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,675
Ryan, I'm working out
the bus stop motif, bro.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,559
Yeah, I got it.
I don't know what's next.

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,029
I'm just gonna take things slow.
No pressure.

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,236
What about asking her
to the big dance?

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,430
-Oh, no. The winter dance.
-Yeah, do it.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,229
I'll take Alex, so take Lindsay. We'll have
the double date we should have had.

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,199
It seems a little soon.
What if she's thought about it...

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,158
...and thinks we should just be
lab partners? We just talked.

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,313
-Ryan Atwood, are you scared of a girl?
-No, I just-- I might like her and--

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,438
-Every time there's a big party--
-Something goes terribly awry?

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,874
Y eah, but usually to you.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,838
-It's my turn for that burden.
-You're no fistfighting type.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,594
You're not the type to be scared
of a girl. Just ask her.

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,115
It's the only way to know
how she feels.

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,758
Maybe I'll just go alone.

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,638
Coop, you cannot go alone.

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,911
Why not? It's just a school dance.

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,479
It is not just a school dance.

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,392
It is the SnO.C...

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,949
...the one night where winter comes
to Newport Beach.

38
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,350
And your first dance of the year
as social chair.

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,794
What happened to DJ?

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,632
I didn't ask him.

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,598
My mom's chairing the host committee.
She'd freak.

42
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,194
-Your mom dislikes him?
-She doesn't know about him.

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,237
It's not his type of thing anyway.

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,636
-Hi.
-Guys, you still haven't bought...

45
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,870
...your SnO.C. tickets,
so do you want four?

46
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,996
-I don't know.
-You should take the missus.

47
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,869
Hey, Cohen, you should invite the girl
from Saturday night. Yeah.

48
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,998
I forgot. She totally pulled a Houdini
on your ass.

49
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,597
Right. You must be talking about
Lindsay, not Alex, who I made out with.

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,469
Sorry. Alex. My mistake. And here
I'm feeling sorry for the wrong girl.

51
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,473
-I should get to class.
-Ensure she wears comfortable shoes...

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,029
...so she doesn't twist her ankle
while running away.

53
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,549
Yeah? Like him?

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,514
Zach! Wait.

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,756
That worked out rather nicely.

56
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,519
Caleb, it's me. I still haven't heard
from you about another meeting...

57
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,069
...with Renee Wheeler
and her attorney.

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,074
So do me a favor
and call me back, will you?

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,117
How about some eggs?

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,554
You okay?

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,836
Yeah. How about an omelet?

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,070
I know I shouldn't ask about the case--

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,198
Even if I could talk about it,
I'd have nothing to tell you.

64
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,914
-My dad still not talking?
-What could he have done...

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,310
...that he'd rather go to jail
than admit to?

66
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,517
Unless life with Julie Cooper
is tougher than we thought.

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,240
-What are you gonna do?
-The only thing I can do.

68
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,756
I'll ask for a continuance,
buy some time...

69
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,718
...and find out what he's hiding.

70
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,718
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hey. Good. I'm good.

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,797
I thought about what you said
all weekend...

72
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,474
...and you were so sweet
and so honest.

73
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,074
I'm glad because there's this dance.

74
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,598
Yeah. Actually, I don't think so.

75
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,676
I mean, I would love to go out with you,
but we're lab partners.

76
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,912
I mean, can you imagine how awkward
it's gonna be if we break up?

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,634
-We haven't even gone out yet.
-It's already awkward.

78
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,673
Let's face it,
relationships almost always end badly...

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,914
...and this way, we can be friends
for the rest of our lives.

80
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,909
-So you just wanna be friends?
-I think we should be.

81
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,316
-Hello?
-Hey. Is now a bad time?

82
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,871
-Where are you?
-I'm in the parking lot.

83
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,156
You think you can get away for lunch?

84
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,033
I really like our lunch breaks.

85
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,597
So, what's the SnO.C.?

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,556
It's just this dance.

87
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,311
We never get snow here, so we kind of
have to make it ourselves.

88
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,917
-Sounds like fun.
-Actually, it's very Harbor.

89
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,514
-You'd probably hate it.
-I guess it's a good thing...

90
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,148
-...that no one's asked me then.
-I would've.

91
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,515
It's just I'm kind of running it,
so I figured--

92
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,116
You don't want to be distracted
by having to finally introduce me...

93
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,599
...to your friends?

94
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,433
I'm sorry, but I figured I'd be so busy...

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,113
...I'd be a bad date. If you're--

96
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,838
It's cool.

97
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,150
I'd rather be alone with you anyway.

98
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,832
Well, we could go out afterward.

99
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,396
Or we could just stay in.

100
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,359
Marissa? Oh, my God.

101
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,312
-The yard guy?
-Mom--

102
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,552
-What are you doing home from school?
-I'm on my lunch break.

103
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,917
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back.

104
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,196
-I gotta work.
-No, you don't. You're fired.

105
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,237
And you, young lady, are grounded.

106
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,756
Like that's gonna keep me
from seeing him. Come on, DJ.

107
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,155
You stay away from my daughter.
You hear me?

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,752
Thanks, Michelle. Did my dad call?

109
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,115
-No. I've tried on his cell and at home.
-Hey.

110
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,032
Hey. How'd it go with the judge?

111
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,395
Not only was my motion
for continuance denied...

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,710
...but the trial has now been
fast-tracked.

113
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,156
We've got less than two weeks.
I'm calling Caleb again.

114
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,835
-How could I have not seen this coming?
-Honey, come on. How could you have?

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,709
-Your call has been forwarded....
-I've been working with him side-by-side.

116
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,952
How could I have not known
he was bribing a woman on city council?

117
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,190
-lf he did.
-What'd she say at her deposition?

118
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,794
Nothing. Her lawyer
wouldn't let her answer questions.

119
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,077
-You can't talk to her without a lawyer.
-Well, I could.

120
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,595
-That would be unethical.
-Yeah. Strictly speaking.

121
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,878
But desperate times.... I'm just saying,
if I happen to run into the woman....

122
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,474
I don't want you getting
in trouble over this.

123
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,073
Oh, honey...

124
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,391
...it's a little late for that.

125
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,636
Hey, Ryan. You know where
I can buy my SnO.C. tickets?

126
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,916
-Can't say I do.
-You're not going?

127
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,479
-No.
-No one to go with?

128
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,076
I had someone to go with.
She just didn't wanna go with me.

129
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,437
-Are you going with Summer?
-Definitely. It's a given, right?

130
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,919
Except, of course, for Cohen.

131
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,310
I don't think he's asking Summer.

132
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,835
I don't think he has to.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,353
Even if he doesn't ask her...

134
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,636
...somehow the night's gonna end up
about them.

135
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,031
I get that. Believe me.
But I think it's really over.

136
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,953
-I mean, Seth has a new girl now.
-Really?

137
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,156
-So he's over Summer?
-Yeah. Definitely.

138
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,193
I think so.

139
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,191
He wants to be.

140
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,675
Hello, Alex. How are we today?

141
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,593
You're here finally.
Can you carry these to the storeroom?

142
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,796
The storeroom. Sure.

143
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,315
Maybe you'd like to show me
where it is?

144
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,673
-All right, Cohen, we need to work.
-Okay. By "work" you mean "make out. "

145
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,229
No. By "work," I mean "work. "

146
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,436
All right. No romance in the workplace.

147
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,352
That's fine. I can respect that.

148
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,274
But in that case, Harbor School's
annual SnO.C. ball is coming up.

149
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,954
What do you say?
A little dancing, a little faux snow?

150
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,793
Obviously, you got the wrong idea
Saturday night...

151
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,918
...because you and me,
it's not happening.

152
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,752
Okay. Okay, except
you did kind of kiss me.

153
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,638
It was fun.

154
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,679
It was fun? That's it?
It didn't mean anything to you?

155
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,114
Dude, it was just a kiss.

156
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,033
Then why didn't you just shake hands?

157
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,909
Thanks, Homer. See you Thursday.

158
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,638
Thank you.

159
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,635
-You just kissed the beer guy.
-So? It is just a kiss. Right, Mandy?

160
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,954
Right.

161
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,153
So Saturday night was fun,
but that's all.

162
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,639
Those sodas aren't gonna carry
themselves to the storeroom.

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,549
Do you think it's offensive to say that,
like, all women are crazy?

164
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,517
-Probably to women.
-lt makes no sense.

165
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,274
Alex kisses me, then she
turns around and kisses Homer.

166
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,159
-Who's Homer?
-The beer guy.

167
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,959
And he's not a looker, either.
Then she turns around...

168
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,111
-...and kisses Mandy.
-Mandy's a girl?

169
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,554
-Yeah.
-Wow.

170
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,790
I couldn't even enjoy it,
so consumed was l...

171
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,632
...with how crazy women are.

172
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,074
Believe me, I know.

173
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,630
I spent all night at a bus stop
talking to Lindsay. Everything's great.

174
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,314
Next thing I know, she dumps me
before we even go out.

175
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,754
-Crazy.
-I know.

176
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,876
I know. I'm telling you, man...

177
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,679
...women are so freaking crazy,
I wouldn't be surprised...

178
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,718
...if next time we see them,
Alex drags me to the storeroom...

179
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,474
-...and Lindsay asks you to the dance.
-I don't think so.

180
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,313
Which part? You and Lindsay,
or me and Alex getting it on?

181
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,709
-Hey.
-Hey.

182
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,313
How are you? You need a hand?

183
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,754
-Sure.
-All right.

184
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,150
Ryan, be a gentleman.
I've got class.

185
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,992
What do you need me to grab?

186
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,232
-ln my car is a penguin.
-A penguin.

187
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,798
-Be careful.
-Don't worry. I'm fine.

188
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,394
It's the penguin I'm worried about.
He's expensive.

189
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,118
-ls he? Well....
-What?

190
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,918
-Oh, no.
-Ryan.

191
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,396
The penguin likes Marissa.

192
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,278
That's not funny.

193
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,191
It's not too late.

194
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,157
You can still ask him to the SnO.C.

195
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,590
You have no idea how hard it is
to plan one of these events.

196
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,791
The man loves to dance.

197
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,235
But he's gonna think I'm crazy.

198
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,754
He knows you're a girl.
He expects it.

199
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,232
I have your tickets for the dance,
and no arguments, okay...

200
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,233
-...because it's for charity.
-lf I buy them, do I have to go?

201
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,676
-I'm kind of dateless at the moment.
-Yeah. Me too.

202
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,876
How about you and DJ?
I thought you were--

203
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,235
We're hanging out...

204
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,710
...but it's a school dance,
and I think he'd feel weird about it.

205
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,717
It's my school. I feel weird about it.

206
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,950
Yeah, me too,
and I'm the one throwing it.

207
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,153
-Guess you can't not go, huh?
-I wish. Both my parents are hosting.

208
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,515
Hey, you know what?
Why don't we go together?

209
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,911
As friends, of course, but at least
we wouldn't have to be alone.

210
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,991
-That's true.
-Great. So 7 is good?

211
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,192
Hello, Summer.
You look lovely today.

212
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,237
-Are those Manolos?
-What do you need?

213
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,516
-Well, I need help.
-No argument here.

214
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,114
See, it turns out
Ryan's good for some things.

215
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,236
Comic books, bench-pressing,
engine repair.

216
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,674
But sometimes...

217
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,751
...a more feminine point of view
is required.

218
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,435
-You're asking me for girl advice.
-I know it's weird because you and l...

219
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,512
...are not anymore.
The thing is, Summer, truthfully...

220
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,878
...you are the only person
in my life that l....

221
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,399
You're right. This is really weird
and bad. I'm sorry.

222
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,678
-No, it's--
-It's really-- It's--

223
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,319
It's okay. I'm listening.

224
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,516
-Really?
-Kind of.

225
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,479
Okay. All right. So you remember
that girl from Saturday?

226
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,959
-The one l--
-Made out with...

227
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,792
...and were rubbing my nose in it?

228
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,520
I thought, "She likes me,"
so I asked her to the dance--

229
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,671
-She said no.
-Then she kissed two people...

230
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,115
-...right in front of me.
-Damn. She's good.

231
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,829
-At what, besides kissing, though?
-Well, she's playing you hot and cold.

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,753
And so far, Cohen,
you've just been hot.

233
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,558
-Summer.
-Not that kind of hot.

234
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,996
You need to cool down, Cohen.
You gotta go, like, lceman on her ass.

235
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,549
-See how she likes it.
-Was that an X-Men reference?

236
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,438
-Top Gun.
-Top Gun. Hey.

237
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,398
That's one of the greatest love stories
of our time.

238
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,957
An F-1 4.

239
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,919
Downward dog.

240
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,950
Ms. Wheeler!
Sandy Cohen, Caleb's attorney.

241
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,272
-I can't talk to you without my attorney.
-All due respect, you didn't say a word...

242
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,069
-...when your attorney was present.
-I had nothing to say. I'm not on trial.

243
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,629
Then why did the DA indict you too?

244
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,036
Ask my lawyer.
You'll be hearing from him...

245
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,270
...as well as the Bar Association.
Goodbye.

246
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,237
You're hiding something.
We both know it.

247
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,516
Whatever is going on
between you and Caleb--

248
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,719
-There is nothing going on between us.
-Okay. Well, there was.

249
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,479
Wasn't there?

250
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,834
So you had an affair.
So what? It's over.

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,672
Why not come forward?

252
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,798
Why risk both of you going to jail
over nothing?

253
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,791
I have to go. I'll see you in court.

254
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,034
Hey.

255
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,034
Hey.

256
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,434
So I've been thinking, and, well....

257
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,474
Yes.

258
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,554
I would love to go to the dance
with you.

259
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,278
-You would?
-Yes.

260
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,515
I'm kind of going
with someone else now.

261
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,314
Yeah.

262
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,789
-With Marissa?
-Yeah.

263
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,355
God. Of course.

264
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,590
-But only because you said--
-No, no. I know.

265
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,917
And I was right the first time.

266
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,392
Really, I don't--
I don't even like dances, so....

267
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,516
Have fun.

268
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,756
Hey. I missed you at lunch.

269
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,673
Yeah, I was in the library.
I had to finish a history paper.

270
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,274
Library. God,
how can you work in there?

271
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,714
It is, like, so quiet.

272
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,235
Look, I got World Lit, so I gotta go.

273
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,039
Well, hey, I was thinking
maybe before the dance...

274
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,351
-...we could, like--
-Yeah. About that.

275
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,869
It turns out
I'm not gonna be able to go.

276
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,078
I've got family stuff. Sorry.

277
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,678
Okay, well, unless you're, like, grieving
over the death of a family pet...

278
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,114
...we're going to the SnO.C.

279
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,753
Why don't you just ask Cohen?

280
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,036
I'm sure he'd love to take you.

281
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,878
Hey, great. You're here.

282
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,031
The floors need sweeping and mopping.

283
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,316
I know how much you love
cleaning bathrooms...

284
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,754
...so I saved them for you.

285
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,990
But you can start
with clearing those empties.

286
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,390
Great. I'll get right on it.

287
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,995
Not very chatty today, are you?

288
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,159
I don't know. Is there something
you wanted to talk about?

289
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,154
-No. Not really.
-All right.

290
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,952
You know what?

291
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,672
There is something
that I think we should discuss.

292
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,838
Here's the thing.

293
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,436
First of all,
I love working here. I do.

294
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,672
But right now, for me,
with school and homework...

295
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,434
...and this dance coming up...

296
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,189
...I don't know
that I have time for a job.

297
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,388
-You're quitting?
-Yeah.

298
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,033
Because I wouldn't make out with you
in the storeroom?

299
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,869
What? No. Look, just-- Come on.

300
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,350
Listen, I asked you to a dance,
you said no.

301
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,715
I respect that, okay? I do.

302
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,996
I just-- For me, I have...

303
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,631
...just a lot of obligations right now
outside of the Bait Shop.

304
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,110
-So, you know....
-Okay.

305
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,516
Okay.

306
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,916
This is what I owe you
for the week, so....

307
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,479
Okay. Y eah. Well, you know.

308
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,915
It looks like it's all there.

309
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,275
-It's been really great working with--
-You too.

310
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,635
You've been lovely, so....

311
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,872
-See you.
-Yeah.

312
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,559
Take care.

313
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,117
Caleb, it's your lawyer
leaving you yet another message.

314
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,919
Call me back, will you?
I've had a breakthrough.

315
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,313
I was wondering
what you wanted to do tonight.

316
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,315
-You okay?
-Yeah, sure. Are the boys still here?

317
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,517
We should get some pictures
before they head out to the big dance.

318
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,916
Come on. Off your ass.
Come to the party.

319
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,674
Thanks, but I'd like to sit
and watch my kung fu movie...

320
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,114
...if you don't mind.

321
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,795
Well, Marissa and I are only going
as friends. We can all go together.

322
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,793
That's how lame I've become.
I can't even be a third wheel...

323
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,791
...to an actual relationship.

324
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,669
Look at you. You look sharp.

325
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,831
So you taking that girl
Seth told me about?

326
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,390
-No, it didn't really work out.
-Seth. Why aren't you dressed?

327
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,109
-Yeah. You'll be late for the party.
-Not the Seth Cohen pity party.

328
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,111
Could you take this discussion
elsewhere?

329
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,238
Sammo Hung is about to face off
with his arch nemesis.

330
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,913
It's kind of a big deal.

331
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,354
You know,
I kind of feel like kicking back...

332
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,919
-...with a good movie.
-Me too.

333
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,832
No.

334
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,395
So, what are we watching?

335
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,189
Masters of Martial Arts.

336
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,273
This is Masters of Martial Arts?
I hear this is wonderful.

337
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,238
-Why is that ninja smoking a cigarette?
-Honey, honey.

338
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,393
I don't actually think that's a ninja.
Ninjas usually wear capes. Right?

339
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,796
So a ninja's like a superhero.

340
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,350
Mom, Dad, you two enjoy.

341
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,308
-Ryan, give me five minutes.
-Where you going? Come on back.

342
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,040
-Nice work.
-Never underestimate a parent's ability...

343
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,553
...to mortify his child.

344
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,518
So no SnO.C. for DJ?

345
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,355
With my mom and dad hosting?
He'll just pick me up after.

346
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,750
Then maybe Zach will show,
and we can all go out.

347
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,319
I don't care if Zach shows.

348
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,278
In fact, honestly,
I would rather go by myself.

349
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,317
Oh, really?

350
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,755
-You would?
-No.

351
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,070
Good. Because you're going
with me and Ryan.

352
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,472
Great. Now I'm gonna be dragged along
like the homely cousin from lowa.

353
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,757
Well, you know, at least I won't have
to deal with Cohen knowing...

354
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,399
...I'm going alone.

355
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,670
-Oh, God.
-Hello, Summer.

356
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,474
Where's Zach?

357
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,154
-So just like old times, huh?
-Seriously, man.

358
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,039
Four people, and not one of us
could get a real date.

359
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,198
I guess we'll win the award
for biggest losers in Newport Beach.

360
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,430
You must win that award a lot.

361
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,473
I'm sorry. Is Zach in here?
Is he hiding somewhere?

362
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,437
-Zach? Zachary?
-Okay.

363
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,239
At least he didn't kiss two people
right in front of me.

364
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,152
-Who did that?
-Seth's girlfriend.

365
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,912
Sorry, that's right.
She dumped you.

366
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,430
-She kissed two guys in front of you?
-I think it was a guy and a girl.

367
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,192
-What?
-Thanks for that, buddy.

368
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,272
Wait, she kissed another girl?
You didn't tell me that.

369
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,390
A gentleman never tells
when his girl kisses a girl and a guy.

370
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,279
It does kind of feel like old times.

371
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,354
-Oh, my God, Coop.
-ls it okay?

372
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,795
Okay? It's beautiful.

373
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,992
-Can't believe you did all this.
-Reminds me of when Mr. Freeze...

374
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,357
...attacked the Gotham Society Ball,
which is a compliment.

375
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,076
Well, I'm just glad people showed up.
And they're actually dancing.

376
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,795
-You don't wanna...?
-Dance?

377
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,234
Sure. Why not?

378
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,516
I'll see you later.

379
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,230
Don't even think about it.

380
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,675
How bad do you wish
DJ were here right now?

381
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,433
It's okay.

382
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,516
Just, if it's not too weird,
don't stand so far away.

383
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,516
It looks like we're in the fifth grade.

384
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,874
Right.

385
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,232
Jimmy, look. See?

386
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,637
Yeah. She looks beautiful.

387
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,475
Yes, but more importantly, she's with
Ryan who, right now, let's face it...

388
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,756
...Iooks like Prince Charming.

389
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,798
-So you're happy?
-So happy.

390
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,871
Thank you for coming.

391
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,752
-Jimmy.
-Oh, hey.

392
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,672
Hi.

393
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,553
Dad. Sandy didn't tell me
you were coming over.

394
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,075
He said he had something
that could save my hide.

395
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,515
Clearly, he didn't share it with you.

396
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,911
No, he actually respects things
like attorney-client privilege.

397
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,469
Y eah. I said, "Call me,"
not, "Come over. "

398
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,198
I was in the neighborhood.

399
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,910
So, what do you got?

400
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,469
What is this miraculous development?

401
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,799
I spoke with Renee Wheeler today.
I know about the affair.

402
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,076
-What?
-Relax. She didn't give you up.

403
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,073
-Why didn't you tell me?
-The details of my personal life...

404
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,514
...don't affect this case.

405
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,433
Yes, they do. The DA thinks
you've been paying her off...

406
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,478
-...to get building permits.
-The DA's an idiot.

407
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,428
Even if you were having an affair
with this woman...

408
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,552
... 1 6 years is an awfully long time
to be paying someone palimony.

409
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,710
Unless there was a child.

410
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,038
-That is the most preposterous--
-Caleb, was there a child?

411
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,515
We were together just a few months.

412
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,478
Renee came to me,
said she was pregnant.

413
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,552
I set up a trust.

414
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,398
It was a long time ago, Sandy.

415
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,238
I made a mistake.

416
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,351
Well, when you make a mistake...

417
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,359
...you really make a mistake.

418
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,755
First thing Monday,
you and Renee go to the judge.

419
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,878
-Tell him everything.
-I can't do that.

420
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,632
You're both looking at jail time.

421
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,870
I'm sorry, Sandy. I can't.

422
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,993
Hey, this is KHHS,
the Harbor School radio station...

423
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,469
... coming to you live
from the SnO. C. winter dance.

424
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,200
This song is for all you lonely hearts
out there.

425
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,154
Fine. But no talking.

426
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,595
Ryan. Hi.

427
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,792
-You look so handsome.
-Thanks.

428
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,872
I know that we've had
our differences in the past...

429
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,071
... but with you and Marissa
back together--

430
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,117
You know,
with you gone this summer...

431
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,111
...she got a little bit out of control.

432
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,316
But with the both of us
looking out for her--

433
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,278
Hi, sweetie. We were just
talking about you.

434
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,554
Well, we don't wanna keep you
from your hosting duties.

435
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,358
Okay.

436
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,598
-She told you you were handsome?
-Yeah.

437
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,957
A year ago, she wanted to have me
committed because I was dating you.

438
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,998
Now somehow you've managed
to find someone she hates even more.

439
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,391
I know. Can you imagine what
she would've done if I'd brought DJ?

440
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,711
Kind of. Which is why
I'm surprised you didn't.

441
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,599
You usually don't pass up a chance
to ruin your mom's night.

442
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,673
Yeah, but why put DJ through that?
I just told him to come after.

443
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,751
So it's not because
you're embarrassed?

444
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,031
I already told you.

445
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,078
The winter ball,
it's not his type of thing.

446
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,470
Did he decide that, or did you?

447
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,239
I figure we're probably the same size.

448
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,799
Thanks.

449
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,352
Hey.

450
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,391
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

451
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,597
Yeah. Actually,
there's something I have to do.

452
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,873
Can I talk yet? I just was curious...

453
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,837
...why Zach isn't here.

454
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,230
Because.... He was jealous, I guess.

455
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,550
He was jealous? Of what?

456
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,790
Of my good looks and charm?

457
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,234
Of my modesty?

458
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,913
Of your big mouth.

459
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,792
-He saw us talking.
-When?

460
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,632
In the hallway.

461
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,518
-ln the lounge.
-Yeah.

462
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,309
Before, during and after school.

463
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,592
-I mean, we were just talking.
-I know.

464
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,632
Hey, guys.

465
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,237
Zach! You came.

466
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,233
Yeah. I thought you might still
need a date.

467
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,750
-Stupid, huh?
-Zach, it's really not like that.

468
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,959
Yeah, it is. And I get it.
You're just one of those couples.

469
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,874
Even when you're not a couple,
you'll always be a couple.

470
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,031
You're Joanie and Chachi,
Luke and Leia.

471
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,756
Luke and Leia were brother and sister.

472
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,593
Yeah, well, may the Force be with you.

473
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,957
Hey, so...

474
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,112
...I was just in the neighborhood.

475
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,756
It-- It's Freud.
I have slippers with Freud on them.

476
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,230
They're my Freudian slippers.

477
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,710
So, what are you doing here?

478
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,791
I just wanted to tell you...

479
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,395
...that I should've gone to the dance
with you.

480
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,870
I wanted to go with you.

481
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,759
-That's why you're here?
-I was hoping we could, you know...

482
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,239
...do something. Hang out.

483
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,993
No. I'm sorry.

484
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,916
-Okay. What about tomorrow night?
-Ryan, this just isn't gonna work.

485
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,399
Why not?

486
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,157
-Because you're.... You're you.
-What does that mean?

487
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,870
I mean, you're this tough kid
from Chino...

488
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,352
...who lives in
some rich family's pool house...

489
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,072
...with an ex-girlfriend who's maybe
the most intimidatingly beautiful girl...

490
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,789
-...in the history of high school.
-Yeah, but right now I'm here with you.

491
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,511
And I will see you at school,
in the hallway, in class, and....

492
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,477
I'm not giving up.

493
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,673
Because I like you.

494
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,919
Who knows why.

495
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,272
But I think that if you got to know me,
you'd like me too.

496
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,034
So good night.

497
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,278
Hello, Renee.

498
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,237
Thank you for agreeing
to meet me here.

499
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,311
What's this all about, Caleb?

500
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,920
I understand you had a run-in
with my son-in-law.

501
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,795
-He came to see me, but I said nothing.
-I know, and I appreciate that.

502
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,714
This must be tough on you.

503
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,156
We just have to get through
the next few weeks.

504
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,153
Then what?
And then you go to jail?

505
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,069
You really willing to do that
to protect this secret?

506
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,676
It's not the secret I'm trying to protect.
It's my family.

507
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,237
-This would devastate my daughter.
-And what about mine?

508
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,559
Ours.

509
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,838
I could arrange for you both
to leave the country.

510
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,432
Not permanently.
Just until this blows over.

511
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,832
What are you gonna do?

512
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,952
I don't know anymore.

513
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,749
-Pretty quiet around here.
-Yes, all the kiddies...

514
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,388
...are at their various winter dances.

515
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,311
A Y oo-hoo, please. One.

516
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,191
You were at The Killers show here,
right?

517
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,035
I go to a lot of shows here
because I work here.

518
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,834
No, yeah. You were here with Ryan.

519
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,558
Yeah, at the time. Why?
You go to Harbor?

520
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,674
Why aren't you at
the SnO.C. winter wank-off?

521
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,116
It's complicated.

522
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,833
Or not.

523
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,390
The girl I like is in love with another guy
and probably always will be.

524
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,154
Right now your girl is at the dance
with the other guy...

525
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,594
...and you're here.

526
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,070
If she didn't love you before,
this display of courage and dedication...

527
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,356
...should definitely do the trick.

528
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,876
I'm sensing a low level of sarcasm here.

529
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,592
-What am I supposed to do?
-Be a man.

530
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,876
Put down your chocolate soda
and fight for her.

531
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,555
I'm not much of a fighter. I know
I look big. I just have broad shoulders.

532
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,397
No. What I mean is that she can't fall
for you if you're not there to catch her.

533
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,957
You're right.
At least threaten to fight for her.

534
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,476
And even if it turned into an actual fight,
I could take Seth Cohen.

535
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,273
Thanks.

536
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,116
Did he just say Seth Cohen?

537
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,717
-Look. That's our gardener.
-Oh, God.

538
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,554
-No, you don't.
-Jimmy!

539
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,312
-Let go.
-Come on. Come with me.

540
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,472
-Jimmy, I have to--
-What? Embarrass Marissa?

541
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,030
When we were kids,
no one could keep us apart.

542
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,159
First of all, it is not the same. Second,
am I the gardener in this scenario? No.

543
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,551
My parents threatened to cut me off
if I didn't break up with you.

544
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,273
-You never told me that.
-I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

545
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,476
-And what did you tell them?
-To go to hell.

546
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,437
I told them I was in love with you.

547
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,798
I was.

548
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,800
Well, I was easy to love back then.

549
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,236
I was beautiful and much nicer.

550
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,193
Jules, come on. You're still beautiful.

551
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,354
And we both know
you were never nice.

552
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,793
We said that we were gonna stay away
from each other.

553
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,236
Yeah, except Ryan left with the car.

554
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,553
I have to wait for DJ and Marissa
to finish making out, so....

555
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,111
We've done really well for ourselves.

556
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,918
-Very impressive.
-Yeah. Nice going.

557
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,798
Right back at you.

558
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,318
Zach!

559
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,634
Hey, man. You came back.

560
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,756
Listen, I wanted--

561
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,518
Oh, my God!

562
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,154
Oh, my God.

563
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,639
Oh, my goodness.

564
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,109
-You hit him?
-I know. I don't know what happened.

565
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,555
-I never hit anybody before.
-You'd never know it.

566
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,431
I'm so sorry.

567
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,636
-I probably deserved it.
-Seth?

568
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,115
-Alex?
-Alex?

569
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,356
-Alex.
-What are you doing here?

570
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,710
I felt responsible for you.

571
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,951
I can take it from here.

572
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,589
Yeah, l-- I guess you can.

573
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,239
Come on, Zach. See you guys.

574
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,197
Sorry, Cohen.

575
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,636
Come on. We have a first-aid kit
back at the club.

576
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,473
-ln the storeroom, perhaps?
-Do you wanna get hit again?

577
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,030
-Here.
-Thanks.

578
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,508
Look, I'm really sorry.

579
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,956
It's just, every time I turn around,
it's you and Cohen.

580
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,192
I know. I'm sorry...

581
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,430
...but he's not my boyfriend.

582
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,874
He's not. He's just....

583
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,557
He's Cohen.

584
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,837
So, what am l?

585
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,837
Well, you were my boyfriend...

586
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,279
...until you decided not to take me
to the dance.

587
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,438
So can I ask you a question?

588
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,914
Will you go to the dance with me?

589
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,396
Let me think about it.

590
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,959
-You sure you're okay?
-I'm fine.

591
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,429
It's just a shame you got there
when you did...

592
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,149
...because I was about ready to,
you know, bring the hurt.

593
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,516
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah. You bet.

594
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,033
I'd like to see that.

595
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,714
Yeah? A little bit of....
A little bit of that?

596
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,678
No. What are those?

597
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,751
-These? These are fists, okay?
-Oh, God.

598
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,276
Or, as I like to call them,
the twin ambassadors of pain.

599
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,317
Come here. Stand up.

600
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,278
-You're touching the twin ambassadors.
-Hold them like this.

601
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,072
Like this. Okay?
Okay.

602
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,798
-Okay.
-What are you doing?

603
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,997
-I'm teaching you to defend yourself.
-Why? Against who? You?

604
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,513
Please. This is really fun.

605
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,591
-All right.
-Defend yourself.

606
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,079
I don't know how.

607
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,911
-I'm sorry. Oh, my God.
-God, my eye.

608
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,150
-I think you scratched my cornea.
-No! No way.

609
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,072
-It's blurry.
-Hands down. Let me see.

610
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,749
-It's blurry.
-What are you talking about? It's fine.

611
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,911
Then why does it hurt?

612
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,076
There. Is that better?

613
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,190
A little. A little bit.

614
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,556
Did I get you anywhere else?

615
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,753
You kind of nicked me right there
a little bit.

616
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,919
Come in.

617
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,835
After you left, I tried to read.

618
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,037
I do this thing where I put
a red dot at the bottom of the page...

619
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,997
...to see how efficiently I'm reading.

620
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:14,280
Sometimes I have to read a page over,
so there'll be two or three red dots.

621
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,510
Well, after you left...

622
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,674
...I made 1 1 red dots
at the bottom of the page.

623
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,552
-Eleven.
-Lindsay.

624
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,990
I'm talking too much, as usual.

625
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,559
I'm sorry. I-- I just--

626
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,269
I get nervous, and I start talking,
and then nothing can shut me up.

627
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,835
Except that, I guess.

628
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,076
I know something we can do
that doesn't involve a lot of talking.

629
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,752
-All right, throw the grenade. Throw it.
-Wait, wait, wait!

630
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,229
Wait. What happened to my head?

631
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,799
It rolled under the truck.

632
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,354
That's not good.

633
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,151
So this is hanging out, huh?

634
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,594
Yeah.

635
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,675
-Ms. Wheeler.
-Sorry to come by so late.

636
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,472
Who is it, Sandy?

637
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,035
Is everything okay?

638
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,437
-I'm Kirsten Cohen.
-Renee Wheeler. Hi.

639
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,395
Renee is a witness
in your father's case.

640
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,869
Let's go out back where we can talk.

641
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,552
We won't be long.

642
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,071
I shouldn't talk to you.
If anyone finds out--

643
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,196
They won't. You have my word.

644
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,277
I just need to know,
what has Caleb told you?

645
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,556
I know everything,
without any help from Caleb...

646
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,837
...which is why I need you.
If you came forward to the judge...

647
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,833
...with the right documentation,
the charges would be dropped.

648
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,274
The case would go away.

649
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,714
Mom.

650
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,431
What are you doing here?
