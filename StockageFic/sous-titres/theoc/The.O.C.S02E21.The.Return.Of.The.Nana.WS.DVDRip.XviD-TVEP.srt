1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,752
Previously on The O. C.:

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,593
-How many wines have we tasted?
-I stopped taking notes.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,672
A little too much lndian spirit, huh?
Well, drive back in the morning.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,154
I need to go home.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,390
The nana's not nice.
I love her, but she's not.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,190
I hate this state! I hate the sunshine!
I hate the ocean! I hate Schwarzenegger!

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,398
I don't believe it, Ryan. Bright Eyes
has two albums in the top 1 0.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,913
-You okay with that?
-Yeah.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,913
I just feel like the rest of the world's
finally caught up to me.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,275
-It's a little bit scary.
-Yeah, it's a lot scary.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,032
Tell me I'm still special.

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,155
-Hello?
-Setheleh.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,912
Nanaleh. How you feeling?

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,878
Well, if you were all that interested,
you would've called me.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,952
And would it kill you to cash
that birthday check I sent you?

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,351
-I'm finished sending you things.
-Okay. I' m sorry. I forgot.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,637
-Make my life very difficult.
-No, l' m sure that $20 outstanding...

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,917
-... has the bank just going crazy.
-Smart ass. Where's your father?

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,479
-I don't know--
-Who is it, Seth?

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,915
Actually, my mom came in
if you wanna talk to her.

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,752
-It's the nana.
-No.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,117
What do you want me--?
Hello. My dad just showed up.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,589
Awkward family moment
avoided for everyone but me.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,637
-Love you.
-You could've fooled me.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,472
It's the nana.

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,997
-Ma. Hey. How are you?
-He gets so much louder...

27
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,628
-...when he talks to her.
-They're a family of screamers.

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,711
-How's the grandma feeling?
-The nana, Ryan.

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,950
"Grandma" evokes homemade cookies
and knitting.

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,795
-Someone who's actually nice to you.
-The nana? Definitely not nice to us.

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,474
-But she's doing great.
-Which confirms my suspicion...

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,232
...that she is, in fact, immortal.

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,113
What, so soon?

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,588
Oh, my God, Ma.

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,750
Let me call you back.

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,236
-What happened?
-ls everything all right?

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,919
The nana...

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,638
...headed for the altar.

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,917
-She's getting married?
-Pack your bags. We're going to Miami.

40
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,877
All right. Shuffleboard, mahjong...

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,713
...dinner at 4. This is gonna be
the best spring break ever.

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,308
Hey, man.

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,516
I know you think you're excited
about Miami...

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,070
...but I cannot wait for you
to meet the guys at Nana's condo.

45
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,073
We got Abe, we got Stu,
we got Stanley.

46
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,476
Although I think Stanley
may have passed on.

47
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,278
He had a prostate thing. I hope not.

48
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,271
-I can't go.
-What? Why not?

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,919
Everything with me and Marissa.

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,355
-ls awesome.
-Fine, okay. But there's Trey.

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,479
Who's also doing awesome.
Ryan, face it, you got no excuses.

52
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,631
Everything's great.
You deserve a vacation.

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,030
We, actually, deserve a vacation, Ryan.

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,792
And it would mean a lot to my dad.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,468
-Yeah. He is kind of worked up.
-He's gonna need company.

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,198
-Well, he's got you.
-I can't, man.

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,588
My schedule's all booked up.

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,716
I got pinochle with the ladies
on Saturday.

59
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,313
Bridge Sunday with the fellas.

60
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,558
Gotta see if I can get on that
bingo cruise. That'll be awesome.

61
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,234
-What about you and Summer?
-I'm gonna go apologize...

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,311
...extremely sincerely...

63
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,552
...and then I'm gonna get out of town
before I do anything else wrong.

64
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,598
What do you say? Miami. Miami.

65
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,069
Miami? Miami. Miami.

66
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,470
Miami. Miami.

67
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,952
-Miami.
-Miami.

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,715
Honey, do you have
my American Advantage number?

69
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,553
I'm on AA.com and I'm trying
to use my miles to upgrade.

70
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,870
You know me, l--
I hate sitting in the middle.

71
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,268
It's in my purse.

72
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,398
But what's the rush? It's not like
she's getting married tomorrow.

73
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,233
Well, I know. It's just....
I love my mother.

74
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,391
-But who else would?
-That's terrible.

75
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,357
You wouldn't say the same
about your dad?

76
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,273
-You make a good point.
-She was so happy on the phone...

77
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,352
...I just wanna make sure
everything works out of her. Great.

78
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,159
You know, especially after
the year she's had.

79
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,595
You are a good son.

80
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,513
Oh, yeah? How about husband?

81
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,597
Definitely top five.

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,033
Miami, huh?
Well, have a hell of a time then.

83
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,193
-Thanks. You'll be all right?
-Don't worry, Mom. I'll be fine.

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,359
Yo, Ry, look, I gotta jump.

85
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,717
I-- Probably the landlord
complaining about something.

86
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,438
Yeah.

87
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,794
Well, have fun.

88
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,234
See you.

89
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,868
Definitely not the landlord.

90
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,959
Hey, you.

91
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,993
So...

92
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,630
...I just wanted to come by
to say thanks again.

93
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,791
For not selling me out.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,592
Have you met Don Julio?

95
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,311
Yeah. Me and the Don go way back.

96
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,115
-Thanks for the gift.
-Oh, that's not the gift.

97
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,235
I figure a guy's been in prison
for 1 8 months...

98
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,994
...probably got pretty lonely.

99
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,794
You have no idea.

100
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,556
Hey, Summer. Busy?

101
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,792
-What do you want, Cohen?
-To talk.

102
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,034
Yeah?

103
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,078
-Hold my bag.
-Anything for my million-dollar baby.

104
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,318
-So look, I just came to apologize.
-Why?

105
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,155
Because I was humiliated in front of
all your oh-so-hip, super dorked out...

106
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,959
...indie-music-loving comic-book geeks,
who looked at me...

107
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,111
...Iike I was some dimwit
Orange County ho?

108
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,879
Yeah. But that was never
my intention, okay?

109
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,157
I really only wanted you there
to be a part of everything with me.

110
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,756
There's no point in you apologizing.
You can no longer make me upset.

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,718
-You're just immune to my charms?
-Working on it.

112
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,677
But you know what I could use?

113
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,159
A timeout.

114
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,828
Okay. Well, you know....
Good.

115
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,197
Actually, that's good timing because...

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,079
...I'm headed to Miami to see
the nana, so....

117
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,868
Well, perfect.
Go to Miami, get wasted...

118
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,600
...and wind up on Music Video Nation's
Spring Break special.

119
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,672
It's not like that. The only thing
I'll be drinking is Metamucil.

120
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,831
Oh, yeah, like I'm gonna believe that.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,956
Look, just go. Go sow your oats.

122
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,476
Get all of your Cohen-y, Cohen-ish
Cohen-isms out of your system.

123
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,868
And when I get back?

124
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,954
We'll see.

125
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,159
Hi.

126
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,353
Hey.

127
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,792
So just imagine...

128
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,476
...a whole weekend of nothing but this.

129
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,270
If you could hold that thought
till next weekend.

130
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,998
Why? You going somewhere?

131
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,754
Yeah, actually. Miami.

132
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,950
South Beach
for a little spring-break action?

133
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,712
-Meet come college girls?
-Not quite.

134
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,155
Going with Seth and Sandy
to see the nana.

135
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,278
-That's really sweet. That'll be fun.
-Yeah. No, it will be.

136
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,796
It's just, I don't know, I kind of feel
weird leaving Trey here by himself.

137
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,154
I can hang out with him.

138
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,995
Yeah, really? Because I was kind of
gonna help him find a job.

139
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,753
-I got it covered.
-Thanks, I owe you.

140
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,639
Yes, you do.

141
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,079
You do owe me. A whole weekend
of nothing but this.

142
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,551
That I can do.

143
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,918
All right, you got all the numbers?
My cell phone, Fontainebleau...

144
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,593
-...the nana?
-I got the numbers.

145
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,070
And you remember how to set
the alarm to "no delay. "

146
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,312
-lf the alarm goes off, the code is...?
-"Greased lightning. "

147
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,994
-Yes. Do you need any cash?
-I have plenty of money.

148
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,151
-I gassed up your car.
-Which I so appreciate.

149
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,675
-Are you gonna be fine?
-I'll be fine.

150
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,398
I love you.

151
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,557
-The question is, are you gonna be okay?
-Oh, yeah.

152
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,918
Fellas, you got everything?

153
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,913
I got my cardigan,
my orthopedic shoes and my humidifier.

154
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,274
Now take me to my people.

155
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,433
-Bye.
-Bye.

156
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,556
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

157
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,993
Is Carter in the office?

158
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,314
In the immortal words of Will Smith:

159
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,313
"Welcome to Miami. "

160
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,597
There's too many young, tan,
healthy people here. I don't like it.

161
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,079
Well, let's check in anyway.

162
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,593
-Who wants some dinner?
-Yeah.

163
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,352
It's 4 p.m. in Orange County.

164
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,715
They put us on the early-bird circuit.

165
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,913
-Hey.
-Hey.

166
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,230
I have the weekend to myself.

167
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,914
I thought we could roll up our sleeves,
really dig in...

168
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,877
...and maybe even get
a few issues ahead.

169
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,873
Well, I'd hold on to that thought
if I were you.

170
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,635
Turns out Newport Living, which l
thought was the last nail in the coffin...

171
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,475
...that is my career,
is actually the thing that saved it.

172
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,997
You got another job offer.

173
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,633
Well, Carter, that's great.

174
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,028
Thanks.

175
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,037
Yeah, so l-- I fly out on Monday.

176
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,239
Fly out where?

177
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,631
New York. That's where the job is,
and they're relocating me.

178
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,313
-You're leaving.
-I am.

179
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,910
But my publisher is lining up someone
to replace me.

180
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,755
You know, someone who is smarter
and better at this than I am.

181
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,319
So...

182
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,678
...I hope you don't think
I'm jumping ship.

183
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,588
Because you are.

184
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,598
It's really great.

185
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,390
I was thinking we could have
a farewell dinner.

186
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,192
-You know what? We should.
-Great.

187
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,112
I'll make a reservation at Arches.

188
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,317
Or you could come by the house
tomorrow.

189
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,072
I'll cook.

190
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,992
Man. I thought Newport was nice.

191
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,479
-This is something, huh?
-Yeah.

192
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,553
If you're a fan of the vibrant nightlife.
Why can't we go see the nana tonight?

193
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,278
You know the nana and her schedule.

194
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,759
-Friday night's mahjong.
-What?

195
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,797
-Yeah.
-Since when is Friday night mahjong?

196
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,872
-That totally throws off my schedule.
-Breathe it in, boys.

197
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,918
We got a weekend away
with nothing to worry about.

198
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,556
Oh, hey. Sorry.

199
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,278
Marissa. What's up?

200
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,873
Ryan took off for Miami, huh?

201
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,874
Y eah. So I just wanted you to know
that while he's gone, I'm here.

202
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,633
Cool.

203
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,551
You know, you don't have to
if you don't want.

204
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,153
No, I want to.

205
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,153
And, you know, I thought maybe
tomorrow we could go job-hunting.

206
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,431
That sounds great.

207
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,428
I thought with Ryan gone
I was gonna be alone in Newport.

208
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,273
No, not on my watch.
So I'll see you tomorrow.

209
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,032
-Can't wait.
-Okay.

210
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,958
You and Marissa Cooper?

211
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,838
Yeah, right.

212
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,920
-It's not like that.
-lt sure isn't.

213
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,957
Not in this lifetime.

214
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,678
Or in this town.

215
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,519
Your move.

216
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,591
-You're playing with him?
-Yeah.

217
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,796
-I thought you were playing with me.
-With him.

218
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,552
No, l-- I just moved.

219
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,472
-Now we're talking.
-I'm with him.

220
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,950
-All right, so I'll watch.
-Abe, Stu, Stanley.

221
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,951
-Hey, look who's here.
-How are you?

222
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,236
-Terrible.
-Worse, worse.

223
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,799
How's your nervous stomach?

224
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,997
-You still got shpilkes?
-Why don't you have a seat.

225
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,559
-You need my heating pad?
-Back's a little sore. Back's a little sore.

226
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,234
All right. Now I'm officially terrified.

227
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,311
He doesn't have
this many friends at school.

228
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,313
So they do fly airplanes
from Orange County to Miami.

229
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,311
I wouldn't know. I see so little of you.

230
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,118
Ma.

231
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,638
-You look better than ever.
-Yeah? I'm getting married.

232
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,919
-You remember Ryan.
-Of course.

233
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,594
Who would forget with those arms?

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,037
You know, if I weren't engaged....

235
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,837
There's my grandson.

236
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,878
-Hello, bubeleh.
-Hello, Nana.

237
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,195
I want you to tell me everything that's
gone on for you this whole last year.

238
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,792
I can barely remember
what I had for dinner last night. Please.

239
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,393
-Welcome to the club.
-Me too.

240
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,391
You know.

241
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,509
-You wanna talk?
-Sure I do.

242
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,195
You keep an eye on him, make sure
he doesn't die of old age, huh?

243
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,993
Is this Metamucil malted?

244
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,676
-Kirsten couldn't make it?
-Well, she wanted to.

245
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,594
So how are things with you two?

246
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,593
To be honest, they've been better.

247
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,390
You two will work it out.

248
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,917
Since when did you become
such a romantic?

249
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,911
Falling in love will do that to you.

250
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,072
Speaking of which,
I have photos from the place...

251
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,755
...where we're holding
the ceremony in June.

252
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,990
So you should book your tickets now.

253
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,878
Whoa, June. What's the rush?

254
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,110
-You pregnant?
-Yeah, yeah. Very funny.

255
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,193
Listen, you go through a year like I did,
you don't wanna waste any time.

256
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,670
Besides, I wanna move
before the summer storms hit.

257
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,991
-You're moving?
-Yeah. Bobby is 1 2 years my junior.

258
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,991
This place skews a little old for him.

259
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,754
We're gonna move to the condo
you bought me in Sarasota.

260
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,832
-lt was meant to be lived in.
-Bobby flipped when he saw it.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,037
Beachfront, unbeatable location.
Why wouldn't he?

262
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,189
I know what you're thinking, Sanford.

263
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,555
And cynicism is a Cohen family trait.

264
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,792
-Yeah, well, I learned from the master.
-Yeah, well....

265
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,155
Nonetheless, he's a good guy.

266
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,992
And he can move his practice anywhere.

267
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,993
Everybody always needs
a good chiropractor.

268
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,471
Not another word.

269
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,870
-I can't wait to meet him.
-Very good.

270
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,270
-Eat your lunch.
-Yes, Ma.

271
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,559
Summer.

272
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,756
Hey, Summer.

273
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,794
Oh, God.

274
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,838
Zach, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
I was in a rage blackout.

275
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,150
My therapist said boxing
might help me through it.

276
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,754
I came to see if you were okay
after the other night.

277
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,229
I'm in gym clothes,
and my hair is in French braids.

278
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,719
So I'm terrible.

279
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,348
Cohen and I are on a timeout.

280
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,070
He went to Miami to party it up
like he always does this time of year...

281
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,471
-...when we're on a timeout.
-Are you too full of rage to hang out?

282
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,154
-Maybe come over for dinner?
-No offense, but hanging...

283
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,869
-...with your family sounds bad.
-Oh, no, I totally understand.

284
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,558
They're in Aspen
for an economics conference.

285
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,512
Come on. I'll cook. Italian.

286
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,796
Francesca gave me a great recipe.

287
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,954
Choke.

288
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,519
Sit down.

289
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,874
Sorry, figure of speech. Victory lap.

290
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,558
My people.

291
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,549
-You cleaned his clock.
-Not that he'll pay up. Cheap bastard.

292
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,671
Hey, Seth, what do you say?

293
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,435
-You ready to roll? I'm really hungry.
-Hey, I'm famished too.

294
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,909
It doesn't seem like
there's anybody left to beat...

295
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,516
...so why don't we go into the dining
hall. We're gonna have lunch. My treat.

296
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,113
-I can't beat that. That's great.
-Can I get in on the action?

297
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,758
Mary Sue. Nice to meet you.

298
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,672
This is my grandma, Mary Ellen.

299
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,639
Hello.

300
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,995
Actually, we were gonna go eat.

301
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,230
-Right?
-Yeah. Well, you like food?

302
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,518
One round?

303
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,713
Sure.

304
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,472
Sure. This will just take a second.

305
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,437
Okay. Rack them, sir.

306
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,671
-Hey, how'd it go?
-My dream's come true.

307
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,637
-I'm cleaning toilets.
-You got it?

308
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,234
-I start tomorrow.
-Oh, that's great.

309
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,599
So we....
We gotta celebrate tonight, okay?

310
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,991
-I will make margaritas.
-I'll bring the guacamole.

311
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,913
It sounds like a party.

312
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,269
But I gotta stay here,
fill out some paperwork...

313
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,633
...so I'll see you tonight.

314
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,677
-Okay.
-And hey, thanks.

315
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,073
-I feel like my life's coming together.
-Hey, I'm happy to help.

316
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,912
So I'll see you later.

317
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,992
I do believe we have
a new shuffleboard champion.

318
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,312
-I can't believe she beat me.
-I can.

319
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,153
-Can we eat now?
-No. I won't go down like that.

320
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,073
These people look up to me.
I'm like a god to them.

321
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,231
You wanna lose again?

322
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,517
I wanna play again. Only this time,
why don't we make it interesting?

323
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,797
A little wager. You wanna do money?
You wanna do food?

324
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,758
You want me to streak naked
through the bingo hall?

325
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,558
Actually...

326
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,593
-...I do need a partner.
-Partner?

327
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,558
-What kind of partner?
-Well...

328
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,350
...besides being down here to visit my
grandma, I entered into a dance contest.

329
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,790
-A dance contest?
-For Music Video Nation.

330
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,191
For their big Spring Break special.

331
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,070
And the winner gets $5000, which
would really help with my college loans.

332
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,719
That sounds very reasonable, Mary Sue.

333
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,716
Only move she's getting out of me
is a victory dance.

334
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,555
What up, what up, what up?

335
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,029
Yeah. My name's Swerve.

336
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,474
The host of MVN's Sp-- Sp--
Spring Break.

337
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,953
Coming at you live from South Beach.

338
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,678
Hi, I'm Pixie, one of the star's
of Sherman Oaks: The Real Valley.

339
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,911
All right. I hope you' re all crunked up...

340
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,719
... because this next performance's
gonna be off the chain...

341
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,269
...and totally
bananas-oh-bananas-oh-bananas.

342
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,955
Bring them out from my dogs
from the dirty South:

343
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,473
T.I.!

344
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,879
Who knew, man? I've never played
anyone under 85 before.

345
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,474
-Right.
-The registration tent is over there.

346
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,232
-We need to sign in.
-Okay. So...

347
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,234
...what kind of dancing are we talking?
A little jazz step, a little soft-shoe?

348
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,675
-Actually, it's not quite a dance contest.
-lt isn't?

349
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,034
No.

350
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,757
-She's got whipped cream, Seth.
-I know. Maybe she's baking a cake.

351
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,117
I'm gonna cover myself in whipped
cream, and you're gonna lick it off...

352
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,795
...and eat a cherry out of my mouth
before any of the other contestants.

353
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,234
Did she say "cherry"?

354
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,675
If we win, it would mean so much
to my grandma.

355
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,876
Not having to worry about
my college loans.

356
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,431
With all the money she spends
on medication.

357
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,393
Yeah.

358
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,439
It's her grandma.

359
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,874
What does she have?

360
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,032
Yeah, well, just hope Summer
hasn't paid her cable bill.

361
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,390
-Ryan.
-Hello?

362
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,357
Hey, what's going on?

363
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,070
It's actually kind of a long story.
Can you do me a favor?

364
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,676
If you see Summer, could you please
keep her away from the television?

365
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,116
Well, actually, I was going
over to Trey's to celebrate.

366
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,157
-He got a job.
-Really?

367
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,719
That's awesome.

368
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,952
They disqualified me
from the wet T-shirt contest.

369
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,350
But don't they look real?

370
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,278
Wait. That wasn't the nana, was it?

371
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,556
Oh, my God. I'm gonna puke.

372
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,597
Actually, I'm...

373
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,473
...kind of wishing I was home now.

374
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,474
Yeah, I'm kind of wishing that too.

375
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,430
-Stay out of trouble, okay?
-All right. Back at you.

376
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,193
-It's like an Olive Garden around here.
-Buongiorno, Summer.

377
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,830
So, what is gnocchi?

378
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,355
I don't know. I'm making gnocchi.

379
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,593
You've never had gnocchi before.

380
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,116
No, I've never heard of it until
five seconds ago. How do you say it?

381
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,713
Gnocchi.

382
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,313
Gnocchi.

383
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,388
Listen, I'm gonna be a while,
so I'm gonna turn on the TV here.

384
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,757
MVN's Spring Break special.

385
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,040
I took the ltalian thing
a little too far there, didn't l?

386
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,918
You had me at buongiorno.

387
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,914
Thanks for having me over.

388
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,111
And don't worry,
I won't talk about Cohen.

389
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,317
Oh, Cohen or no Cohen,
I'm just here for the gnocchi.

390
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,068
-I really want you to like him, Sandy.
-Oh, me too, Ma.

391
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,719
-Me too.
-There he is.

392
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,832
-Hey. Sandy Cohen. Pleasure.
-Bobby Mills.

393
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,958
Heard a lot about you. Hey, sweetie.

394
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,874
It's unbelievable.

395
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,679
You look way too young
to have a son this old.

396
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,308
-Hey, no offense.
-Why would I be offended?

397
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,188
I have to tinkle, so....
You two have a lot to talk about.

398
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,998
Mainly me.

399
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,830
She's a great lady, huh? Your mom.
What a pistol.

400
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,070
I always thought of her
as more of an AK-47.

401
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,670
I gotta tell you, since she's met you,
she has mellowed. My mother in love.

402
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,559
-I never thought I'd see the day.
-She came into my clinic...

403
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,712
...I cracked her back,
and the rest is history.

404
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,589
That is so romantic.

405
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm just so happy she's met
a nice guy, you know.

406
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,229
An honest guy.

407
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,116
-Well, thank you, Sandy.
-Oh, thank you.

408
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,829
Listen, there are a lot of guys, they see
an older woman not in perfect health...

409
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,560
...with a million-dollar condo
in her name....

410
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,752
We've all seen 60 Minutes, haven't we?

411
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,276
Well, I'm more a Dateline guy.
I like that Stone Phillips.

412
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,793
Who doesn't?

413
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,799
You know, I was a public defender
for many years...

414
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,678
...and my tendency is to be suspicious.

415
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,071
It's a problem for me, Bobby.
You know, I've got trust issues.

416
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,357
I'm working on it. I'm working on it.

417
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,074
But I got a ways to go.

418
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,160
-You can trust me, Sandy.
-Well, that's what I figured.

419
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,754
You know, I tell my cop friends,
my buddies at the FBl.

420
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,593
They say, "Sandy, let me run
a background check on this guy. "

421
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,957
You know what I say? I said, "No. "

422
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,799
Sophie Cohen is still pretty sharp.
If she trusts you...

423
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,998
...I trust you.

424
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,358
Great news. They have fresh crab.

425
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,193
Oh, it can't be better than Joe's.

426
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,158
Bobby, you like Joe's stone crab?

427
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,834
Yeah. I love them.

428
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,113
I figured you've been out of the loop.
You need to catch up on your movies.

429
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,430
Margaritas and movies. Sure.

430
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,113
What do you got?

431
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,428
The best movie of, like, all time.

432
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,033
The Notebook.

433
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,114
I'm kind of more of a shoot-'em-up
type guy, where people, like, die.

434
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,910
Well, James Garner doesn't fair so well.

435
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,435
Great. If it's your favorite movie...

436
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,794
...I'm in.

437
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,838
A toast to you.

438
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,714
-Thank you.
-Oh, to me? I like that toast.

439
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,870
Hey. I'm a little early.

440
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,031
It's okay. I-- I just finished.

441
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,238
You made all this?

442
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,675
It's amazing what I can do
when I'm off work.

443
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,074
Who knew?

444
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,879
Would you like some wine?

445
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,152
Hi.

446
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,595
I've been doing, like,
a little bit of thinking...

447
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,990
...and I'm not so sure
I'm the guy for this job.

448
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,196
-You're backing out on me?
-No, no.

449
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,032
It's not that. It's just, you know...

450
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,476
...there's whipped cream,
and I'm a little lactose intolerant, so....

451
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,029
If you back out on me,
I have no chance to win.

452
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,430
And Grandma Mary Ellen
won't pay her medical bills.

453
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,909
And I'll have to drop out of college.

454
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,073
Well, I'm a fan of Medicaid
and education...

455
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,719
...so okay.

456
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,792
-Thank you. Thank you so much.
-Sure.

457
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,554
-It's almost time to get ready.
-Okay.

458
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,472
What do we do?

459
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,119
Hey, man. Can I get
a bottle of water, please?

460
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,508
How you doing?

461
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,955
-I'm all right. You?
-Bad.

462
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,838
-I can't find my girlfriend.
-Oh, yeah?

463
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,956
-Lost her in the crowd?
-I lost her last night.

464
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,395
Told me she was coming to Florida
to see her grandma.

465
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,552
But her best friend told me
she entered some contest down here.

466
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,597
Immodestly revealing her body
for money.

467
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,029
Yeah, well, spring break.

468
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,112
-That does happen.
-Doesn't happen where we're from.

469
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,350
-Where's that?
-Bob Jones University.

470
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,080
They find out what she's doing here,
she'll be expelled.

471
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,708
Which won't matter
when she's burning in hell.

472
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,197
-Yeah, that's rough.
-The worst part is...

473
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,352
...I think she's cheating on me
with whoever her partner in sin is.

474
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,750
That's why I brought my boys with me.

475
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,195
-Oh, yeah? Your frat brothers?
-Bible-study buddies.

476
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,955
We get a hold of who's corrupting her,
it's gonna be Judgment Day for him.

477
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,633
And Mary Sue.

478
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,788
Did you say Mary Sue?

479
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,518
This is scandalous. I've never finished
a full bottle of wine before dinner.

480
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,434
Is it a bad sign when you drink so much
that you can't open a new bottle?

481
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,875
Yeah, I think it means
we should stop drinking.

482
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,199
Who are we kidding? Here.

483
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,433
There.

484
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,471
We definitely need to eat.

485
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,797
Well, it looks like the Fontainebleau
and I seem to be aging nicely.

486
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,110
But the Fontainebleau has had
a lot of work done.

487
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,078
This au naturel thing is why
I'm beating them off with a stick.

488
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,758
Speaking of which, where is Bobby?
He should've been here by now.

489
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,992
Didn't he say he was gonna be
stopping off at his office?

490
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,197
-How far is that from here?
-Not all that far. I hope nothing's wrong.

491
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,108
Look at Ma with a cell phone.

492
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,111
-I'm very hip.
-I guess so.

493
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,238
-I just can't read the buttons.
-Let me see.

494
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,199
Hello?

495
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,670
Bobby, where are you?
We're waiting for you.

496
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,194
What?

497
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,477
A malpractice suit?
Sweetheart, that's terrible.

498
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,313
Come over here
so we can talk about it.

499
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,796
The airport? Where are you going?

500
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,713
Well, how long before you think
this thing blows over?

501
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,998
I see.

502
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,512
Okay.

503
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,954
Goodbye.

504
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,992
Bobby won't be joining us.

505
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,356
Just like that, huh?

506
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,319
What did you say to him?

507
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,477
Oh, man. Okay, you are
way too good at this...

508
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,234
...because I've lost, like,
1 0 times in a row.

509
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,632
Yeah, well, I was All-Chino in drinking.

510
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,392
Yeah, I thought I was All-Newport...

511
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,074
...but clearly you're in
a league of your own because...

512
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,673
...I'm....

513
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,075
Maybe we should watch that movie.

514
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,200
Coming soon to DVD and VHS:

515
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,316
When Vivian Michaels
landed her dream job...

516
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,631
...she thought she was
the luckiest person in the world.

517
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,710
Hey, how you doing, Viv?
Nice haircut.

518
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,792
You know, maybe we should
get some air first because...

519
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,510
... I don't wanna fall asleep during
the movie. It's-- It's really good.

520
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,555
-Y eah. Sure.
-Okay.

521
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,592
Let's do it.

522
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,517
Okay, yeah.
I definitely need some air.

523
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,955
Hey, you know what?
I will be right there.

524
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,554
-I just need to grab my jacket.
-Okay.

525
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,870
This next contest is dirty, y'all.

526
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,750
It's off the chain.
It's bananas-oh-bananas-oh-bananas!

527
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,800
-Come on!
-Who likes whipped cream?

528
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,033
Now let's see which of these four guys
is truly whipped.

529
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,519
Give it up, you all.

530
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,511
Bring them out.

531
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,551
Come on, who has the whipped cream?

532
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,359
Yeah.

533
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,476
Paint that body!

534
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,478
Paint that body!

535
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,714
There she is.

536
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,431
It's time to bring fire and brimstone
down on her and that skinny little sinner.

537
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,638
Come on. Winner gets 5 large.

538
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,756
Hot chick sundaes. Go!

539
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,837
Come on, y'all.

540
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,195
Lick some cream. Yeah!

541
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,319
Oh, my God. I love gnocchi. It's like
an ltalian dumpling. What a concept.

542
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,632
-Do you want more? I made tons.
-Yeah. Thanks.

543
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,349
This is the event where you eat
whipped cream off a girl.

544
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,592
That is so disgusting. What girl
would agree to that? And what guy...

545
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,230
...would be pathetic enough to humiliate
himself on national television?

546
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,233
Lick some cream.

547
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,877
I hope this is enough sauce.

548
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,790
I made a whole bunch, so....

549
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,830
I guess you liked the gnocchi.

550
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,111
Somebody done won!

551
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,113
Yeah!

552
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,118
Hey, Swerve.

553
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,034
Ryan, we won.

554
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,633
-Yeah, now we gotta go.
-What?

555
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,711
-That looks like my boyfriend.
-Your what?

556
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,438
Whoa, contestants only.

557
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,036
-Who are those guys?
-They're in the same bible-study class.

558
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,158
-Think they'll turn the other cheek?
-Prepare to meet your maker!

559
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,958
Looks like not.

560
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,189
Hey.

561
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,233
I'm sorry, Ma.

562
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,476
I was looking out for you.

563
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,678
I know.

564
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,389
I guess part of me knew.

565
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,271
I guess that's why I wanted you
to come down here.

566
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,028
I just wanted to believe...

567
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,839
...I wasn't gonna be spending...

568
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,468
-...the rest of my life alone.
-I could extend my trip.

569
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,234
-Spend some more time down here.
-Please, sweetheart.

570
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,359
You have someone you love back home.
You should be with her.

571
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,029
But it would be very nice if you visited
your old mother a little more often.

572
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,919
All right.

573
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,432
I think that was the best meal
I have ever had.

574
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,477
Well, I'm glad you liked it.

575
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,189
-I'll tell the chef.
-Well, I thought I was telling the chef.

576
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,070
-Okay. Confession.
-Yeah?

577
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,991
I had the meal catered.

578
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,037
I am the world's worst cook.

579
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,112
-Yeah.
-Well, okay.

580
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,989
But so you went to all this trouble.
Why blow your cover now?

581
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,556
Oh, maybe it's the wine.

582
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,515
But I think it's because
I can't lie to you.

583
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,712
I know the feeling.

584
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,151
So while we're being honest
with each other...

585
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,359
...you know this incredible job I was
just offered? I almost didn't take it.

586
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,919
Because I didn't wanna leave.

587
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,273
That's nice. Because in the beginning
you hated Newport.

588
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,795
Well, it wasn't Newport
I didn't wanna leave.

589
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,595
Good luck with your new job, Carter.

590
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,351
So long, Kirsten.

591
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,750
-How you feeling?
-Better, thanks.

592
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,831
Yeah, how could you not?

593
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,911
What a night.

594
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,472
I mean, look at this place.

595
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,555
Yeah. It's pretty great.

596
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,951
It's amazing.

597
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,951
I've got a job.

598
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,758
A great place.

599
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,348
Great friends.

600
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,829
Come on, come on, come on.
Howl with me.

601
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,228
Come on.

602
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,752
-Dude, that was terrible.
-What? I'm not one for the howling.

603
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,150
Oh, no? No, you just need
to be woken up.

604
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,910
Hey, you know, when I'm with you,
I feel like I can do anything.

605
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,791
And I've never felt that way before.

606
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,875
-That's sweet.
-You know...

607
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,154
...we're not so different, you and me.

608
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,471
Hey, you know, I think
maybe it's time we go.

609
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,074
Wait, wait, wait. Where you going?

610
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,151
-Trey, what are you--?
-Come on, come on.

611
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,914
I've seen the way you look at me.

612
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,476
-No one's ever been this nice to me.
-Yeah, because you're Ryan's brother.

613
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,359
No, it is more than that,
and you know it. And I get it.

614
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,839
You don't want to hurt him.

615
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,949
-But he doesn't have to know.
-Trey, no. No way, okay. Never.

616
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,669
What? What? Wait, wait.
I'm not good enough?

617
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,229
-No, look, I don't mean it like that.
-Come on, what?

618
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,278
Ryan gets all the good life, huh, right?

619
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,148
Get off of me!

620
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,954
Come on, come on, one night.
No one needs to know.

621
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,917
Get off of me!

622
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,634
Please, no!

623
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,838
No!

624
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,233
No!

625
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,749
Dude, look what you've done!

626
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,470
So I guess those guys
really do believe in an eye for an eye.

627
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,396
-Hungry?
-I'll pass.

628
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,990
It's too bad we can't tell anyone
what happened.

629
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,071
No one would believe us anyway.

630
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,276
Yeah, it's probably best
I don't tell Summer.

631
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,512
Yeah. Hey, you know what, man?
I'm gonna call Marissa. Check in.

632
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,116
-See how she and Trey are doing.
-Okay. I'm gonna go back to the room...

633
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,840
...and lick myself clean. Good night.
