1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,670
- <i>Previously on</i> The O. C:
- You gotta have a plan.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,955
Yeah. Right.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,510
- Who are you?
- I stole a car. Crashed it.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,069
Then my mom threw me out.
So Mr. Cohen took me in.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,595
- You brought him home?
- What do you guys do around here?

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,593
- What do you think of Newport?
- I can get in less trouble where I'm from.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,115
- You have no idea.
- Shouldn't her boyfriend do this?

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,475
Sure they're not doing anything
we didn't do.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,234
- My dad's not here.
- It's just a thing with a client.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,799
- Put him down.
- Hey, Ryan.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,558
- Welcome to the O.C., bitch.
- I don't want this kid in my house.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,595
Guys, come on. Out of the pool.
Dinner's almost ready.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,116
Dad, I know.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,677
I understand how important the model
home is to the new development.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,756
We'll sell the lots by Christmas,
I promise.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,838
Okay. Bye.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,592
I wish there was more we could do.

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,638
Honey, you're his lawyer,
not his guardian.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,475
I know. In the morning
I'll take him to Child Services.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,911
What kind of mother
just abandons her child?

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,513
- What happens if they don't find her?
- He'll go into the system.

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,558
Foster care till he's 18.
I mean, they'll try and place him...

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,996
...but at his age it'll be impossible.

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,430
You know what I was thinking?

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,396
This being your last night and all,
we should do something special.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,512
I don't know what.

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,071
Possibly get a couple of tattoos or some
hookers and lose our virginity, right?

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,391
Okay, dude, there's a shark movie
at the IMAX if that's what you're into.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,912
I think I just want to take it easy.

30
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,955
How was your swim?

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,792
It was great.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,632
What's that?

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,590
It's a model home.

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,156
I build them.
Well, the real ones, not that one.

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,958
Can you build me one?

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,195
Sorry. Bad joke.

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,713
Thanks.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,988
So...

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,116
...the last supper, huh?

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,192
Sorry. Bad joke.

41
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,237
It's just a laugh riot around here.

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,755
- This all looks really good.
- Too bad you're leaving.

43
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,310
- We never eat like this.
- That's not true. I cook all the time.

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,833
Dad.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,514
I'm sorry, honey.

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,469
Let's just eat.

47
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,876
We're not saying
we want you to cook more.

48
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,793
- Remember the meat loaf incident of '98?
- That was brisket.

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,952
Yeah, that's my point exactly.

50
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,796
As your attorney, I'll cosign these forms.

51
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,272
They basically say that you don't have
a legal parent or a guardian available.

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,433
So I'm now property of the
government, nickname 0382965.

53
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,433
Hey, it's better than "Death Breath Seth."

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,318
Or so I would imagine.

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,908
So we'll meet with your social worker
in the morning...

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,631
...and she'll be the one
to take you to the group home.

57
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,278
My contact at Child Services got you in
with only two other kids, which is good.

58
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,989
- It can get crowded.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,358
And, you know...

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,988
...they do find foster homes
for kids your age.

61
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,833
Yeah, because everybody wants
a brand-new teenager.

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,960
I'm sorry if I'm the only one
that'll state the obvious...

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,554
...but we have all this extra room.
We have a pool house.

64
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,190
Yet you guys are gonna ship him off
to a group home? Am I the only one...

65
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,875
...who gets how much that sucks?
- It's okay. Really.

66
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,556
Good luck with it. It looks perfect.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,833
- Good night.
- Good night.

68
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,154
Hey, how about a little...

69
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,276
...PlayStation perhaps?

70
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,352
- Are you running away?
- Go back in the house, Seth.

71
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,636
Hey, you can't just run away.

72
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,236
What are you thinking?
What about Child Services or my dad?

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,116
Okay, then wait.
I want to come with you.

74
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,396
Know what I've always wanted to do,
besides sail to Tahiti? That Kerouac thing.

75
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,155
Hit the road, stop at diner to diner,
the pancake tour of North America.

76
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,794
- No.
- Fair enough.

77
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,520
- Where you going?
- I don't know.

78
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,631
New town, get a job, save some money.

79
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,756
Great plan.
You've given it a lot of thought.

80
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,751
Got a better idea?

81
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,311
Actually, I do.

82
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,078
Seth?

83
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,790
Can I talk to you?

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,832
Dad?

85
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,836
- What, is it morning?
- You're asleep?

86
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,115
Yeah, I was. What's going on?

87
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,192
Well...

88
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,873
...I wanted to talk about Ryan.

89
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,270
Yeah, I know. It's cool.
We don't need to discuss it.

90
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,592
I think we do. I know you're upset,
your mother and I are upset.

91
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,115
But our responsibility is to our family.

92
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,113
It's okay. I get it.
This is a person's life we're talking about.

93
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,635
We need to leave it
in the hands of the authorities.

94
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,473
- There's no need for sarcasm.
- I'm not being sarcastic.

95
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,071
Well, it's hard to tell sometimes.

96
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,231
Dad?

97
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,868
It's okay. Really.

98
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,792
- When you want to talk about it...
- I know. You're the one to talk to. Got it.

99
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,279
Good night.

100
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,549
- Good night.
- Night.

101
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,998
Come on, Seth.

102
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,916
Okay, got it. I'll be there in,
like, 20 minutes.

103
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,958
- Hey.
- Hey.

104
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,915
I didn't think I'd see you again.

105
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,154
Look, I wanted to say thanks
for the other night.

106
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,911
You always drink like that?

107
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,192
- I thought you left.
- I did. I am.

108
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,796
Ryan. Ryan, I'm all set. Ready?

109
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,472
Hi there, Marissa.

110
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,359
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. We're just hanging out.

111
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,592
Look, it's somebody's birthday.
My invitation got lost in the mail.

112
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,796
It's my friend Summer's birthday.

113
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,076
Summer's birthday is not till Wednesday.

114
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,116
That's what I heard.
I don't know. I guessed.

115
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,475
You guys are up to something.

116
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,395
- Dude, what did you tell her?
- I didn't tell her anything.

117
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,549
Maybe the black turtleneck in August
tipped her off.

118
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,633
Okay, I was going for stealth.
Also, it's slimming.

119
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,234
We should really go.
Have fun at your party.

120
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,312
You should probably be off.
The Newport social scene awaits.

121
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,111
Oh, yeah?

122
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,795
Why won't you tell me where we're
going? This is pretty far away.

123
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,272
Oh, wow, complaining. That's interesting,
considering nobody invited you.

124
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,716
Before I came along
you were on a skateboard.

125
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,791
- You like them?
- Yeah, I guess.

126
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,191
- Well, what do you like?
- Everything.

127
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,636
I don't know,
I don't really listen to music.

128
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,560
- Dude, that's kind of weird.
- Why? What do you like?

129
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,588
Right now, punk.

130
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,830
Avril Lavigne doesn't count as punk.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,915
What about the Cramps?
Stiff Little Fingers. The Clash. Sex Pistols.

132
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,756
I listen to the same music
as Marissa Cooper?

133
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,832
- I think I have to kill myself.
- You listen to punk, huh?

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,672
I'm angry.

135
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,872
That's it right there.

136
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,356
- Looks scary.
- Then you can stay in the car.

137
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,030
Do you recognize this place, Ryan?

138
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,918
- This isn't...
- Where are we?

139
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,594
Well, it's one of my mom's
housing developments.

140
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,593
Her and my grandpa own a bunch
of them. This is supposed to be...

141
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,991
...the model home,
but it never got finished.

142
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,789
Why? Did someone die here
and now it's haunted?

143
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,757
Yes. That's exactly what happened.

144
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,718
- What did happen?
- I don't know.

145
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,235
<i>How do contractors just disappear?</i>

146
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,870
If we don't have a model home,
we don't have a new development.

147
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,513
It's been a month.
I'm not waiting for you guys anymore.

148
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,677
- You know where to reach me.
- No luck with the contractors?

149
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,239
Vanished.

150
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,638
My father's never gonna
let me hear the end of this.

151
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,750
Did you...? Did you talk to Seth?

152
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,836
I think so. Don't blame yourself.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,835
I'm not blaming myself. But how can I
allow a strange boy to live in this house?

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,275
Seth needs to know
it's what any mother would do.

155
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,711
I was talking about the contractors.

156
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,350
So you want him to stay here?

157
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,592
Well, I mean, I know the place
needs some sprucing up, but...

158
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,593
God, did I just say "sprucing"?

159
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,671
So, Ryan, what do you think?

160
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,751
I haven't really had time to think.

161
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,309
But how much better is this place
than some group home?

162
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,675
And wait till you see the best part.

163
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,198
- It's an empty pool.
- To some people.

164
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,316
So your mom... I mean,
she has to come back, right?

165
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,758
I don't know.
My mom's kind of a train wreck.

166
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,669
So's mine.

167
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,193
What about your dad?
Can you call him?

168
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,557
Dad's in jail. Armed robbery.

169
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,034
Impressive, huh?

170
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,840
My dad, he's, like, a financial planner.
And I think he's in trouble.

171
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,551
I don't have any stock tips.

172
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,631
He stopped going to the office.

173
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,759
And these guys keep showing up
at the door, like cops.

174
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,150
But he won't answer.

175
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,717
- Look, I haven't told anybody that.
- I can keep a secret.

176
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,353
- Hey.
- <i>Where you at, girl?</i>

177
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,193
It's time for you to get your buzz on.

178
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,595
Nordlund is so faded
he can't even feel his feet.

179
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,955
There goes the left leg!

180
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,352
I miss you, babe. You know
it's not a party without you.

181
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,511
- Oh, you're sweet.
- <i>What's the deal?</i>

182
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,432
<i>You were supposed to be here</i>
<i>an hour ago.</i>

183
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,511
Okay, I'll be there soon.

184
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,513
Say hi to everyone.

185
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,350
All right. Love you.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,592
Love you too.

187
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,594
Bye.

188
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,430
So how long you been with him?

189
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,158
Luke?

190
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,272
- I don't know, really.
- I know.

191
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,150
Fifth grade, when you two
got your mack on...

192
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,517
...during our class trip to the
Museum of Tolerance, back of the bus.

193
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,669
Classy lady.

194
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,355
You know what?
What's your problem, Cohen?

195
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,830
- I mean, what did I ever do to you?
- Nothing.

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,788
I've lived next door to you forever, and
you've never done or said anything to me.

197
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,630
Oh, my God. You're the one
who never talks to me.

198
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,836
You think you're so much better
than everyone.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,672
I do?

200
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,357
Well, if you're talking about Luke,
then, yes...

201
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,954
...because that guy shaves his chest!

202
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,679
He plays water polo.

203
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,434
We know. Half the team
tried to kill us the other night.

204
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,516
I'm not too popular around here.

205
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,113
And your boyfriend...

206
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,349
...a little bit angry.

207
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,433
- You didn't try to hit him back?
- Actually, I hit him first.

208
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,558
Well, hard to believe
you're not more popular.

209
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,228
I thought this could be your room.

210
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,748
I still don't know if it's a good idea
for me to stick around.

211
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,876
You should stay.

212
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,271
- Okay. For a little while.
- So when she says it, you listen?

213
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,798
- Hey, Summer.
- Hey, is that Summer?

214
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,309
- Tell her I said happy birthday.
- Okay.

215
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,789
Coop, where are you?
We're coming to get you.

216
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,030
Oh, no, don't. I'm coming.

217
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,034
- Tell her I said happy birthday.
- Seth Cohen says happy birthday.

218
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,953
- Who?
- She says thanks.

219
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,199
Look, I gotta go. Okay. Bye.

220
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,436
I gotta go meet my friends.

221
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,633
My other friends.

222
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,756
I should get back too
and protect my cover.

223
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,913
But wait. Listen. We have to promise
not to tell anyone about this place, okay?

224
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,231
Now, Ryan's not going to, obviously,
and I could get grounded.

225
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,073
So that leaves Marissa.

226
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,356
I can keep a secret.

227
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,596
Okay. See you tomorrow.

228
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,191
Me too. We'll fix this place up.

229
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,396
- Cool.
- I'm telling you, Ryan...

230
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,511
...this plan is foolproof.

231
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,358
Ryan?

232
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,830
Hey, Ryan? You ready?

233
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,674
Okay, the key here is not to panic.
Do you have your supplies?

234
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,196
Yeah, but there are cops at your house.
Do you think it's safe?

235
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,591
I'll handle Johnny Law, unless...
Are you losing your nerve?

236
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,954
Meet me in the driveway.

237
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,389
He couldn't have gotten far.
We'll search the neighborhood.

238
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,030
Seth, I was just gonna get you.
We gotta talk about Ryan.

239
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,239
Marissa, look who's here.

240
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,070
- Luke, hi.
- Hey.

241
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,993
Just grabbing a little grub
before we take the boat out.

242
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,593
Boat?

243
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,512
I thought we'd take my dad's Donzi.

244
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,433
Do a little waterskiing,
have a little lunch.

245
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,556
So you have no idea
where Ryan might have gone?

246
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,153
I don't know.

247
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,470
He did say something about
going down to Mexico...

248
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,200
...and gambling on cockfights.
I mean, I don't know what...

249
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,510
Quit joking. Answer his question.

250
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,754
Yes, I did. I really don't know. I do not
know the guy. I never got the chance.

251
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,149
Hey, there's eggs.

252
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,673
Oh, I'm taking Kaitlin to the stables,
so I need that check.

253
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,678
Does Kaitlin really need a pony?

254
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,195
In a couple months,
she's not even gonna like horses.

255
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,193
What? I love China.
She's the prettiest pony.

256
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,509
We're not giving up China.

257
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,513
Wait in the car, sweetie.
Mommy will be right with you.

258
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,150
Jimmy, all this work
is making you so tense.

259
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,992
Look, I gotta...

260
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,957
I've gotta talk to you
about work.

261
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,680
You know I don't like to talk
about work.

262
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,912
Yeah, well, I've made...

263
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,071
...a few mistakes...

264
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,878
...and I don't know really...

265
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,032
Jimmy, you don't have cancer.
No one is dying.

266
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,239
Whatever it is, whatever you've done,
I'm sure you'll fix it.

267
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,437
Can you write that check?
I don't want Kaitlin to be late. Okay?

268
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,350
It's just, Suki is amazing. It doesn't
hurt at all when she's waxing you.

269
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,112
It's really hard to get an appointment.

270
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,635
Why don't you get a manicure?
You could come with me.

271
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,995
I mean, they're not just for girls.

272
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,390
You go. We'll catch up later.

273
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,278
Holly's having a...

274
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,111
- Holly's having a thing.
- Perfect.

275
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,750
- So did you tell him anything?
- No. But if anyone asks, you're Suki.

276
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,118
So you didn't tell them anything?

277
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,989
Actually, I told them you went
to Mexico for cockfights.

278
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,991
You know what,
even if they don't believe me...

279
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,991
...they'll never look for you here.

280
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,474
- Did you seriously bring a loofa?
- What's a loofa?

281
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,596
You said bring whatever
was around the house.

282
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,116
But I meant, like, survival supplies,
like rope or muskets...

283
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,512
...and not Kiehl's cucumber moisturizer.

284
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,672
- That's a pretty good call.
- That's nice.

285
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,759
Hey.

286
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,951
Here's a little bit of everything.

287
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,232
Let your education begin.

288
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,475
This place is perfect.
Seriously, it's totally safe.

289
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,108
Ryan, how perfect is this place, right?

290
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,511
- What else could you need?
- Anyone bring any food?

291
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,114
Food. Guess we're going on a mission.

292
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,232
Faster! Come on!

293
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,758
Call me if someone meeting that
description comes in. Thank you.

294
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,195
- Nothing at the hospitals.
- I'm sure he'll turn up.

295
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,078
I think Seth knows where he is.

296
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,438
Are you accusing him of lying?
That'll be good for your relationship.

297
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,309
- Let the police handle this.
- I wish you hadn't called the police.

298
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,789
They don't have the resources
or the manpower.

299
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,473
Ryan will slip through the cracks.

300
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,631
Sandy, how many of these cases
have you seen...

301
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,360
...have passed across your desk?

302
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,274
What is it about this kid?

303
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,669
I thought I could help him,
make a difference.

304
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,796
I was this kid.

305
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,676
If someone hadn't helped me...

306
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,397
...I wouldn't be here.

307
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,958
Hello?

308
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,034
- How are you?
- I'm good. I hate to ask, but...

309
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,156
...I need your help with something.

310
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,753
Of course.

311
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,549
China has alopecia.
We need to call the vet.

312
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,876
- Are you free for lunch?
- Yeah.

313
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,079
I have some stuff I need to do for work,
but lunch sounds great.

314
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,798
So, you guys,
I've been thinking about a plan.

315
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,313
You know, right now,
this could very well be...

316
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,119
...the first stop on our pancake tour
of North America.

317
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,953
Like in <i>On the Road?</i>
That's my favorite book.

318
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,078
Mine too.

319
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,473
So here's the deal.

320
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,553
My mom had this boyfriend, he hired me
to work construction last summer.

321
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,157
But then they broke up.
He moved away to Austin.

322
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,079
In Texas.

323
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,710
- He said if I was ever there, look him up.
- Well, I mean...

324
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,668
That's kind of far. We were thinking, like,
Long Beach, so we could still hang out.

325
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,673
I'll need to get a couple days of work
so I can get travel money.

326
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,637
Well, I mean, we can get you money.

327
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,354
Well, I mean, you know,
I guess in a way you're lucky.

328
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,354
You get to move to a new place,
start over, be whoever you want to be.

329
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,954
That's really not so bad.

330
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,074
Hey.

331
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,715
- What's it take to get a menu?
- I'll handle it.

332
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,916
- No, I'll handle it.
- And ruin your popularity?

333
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,470
You know what, why don't you guys
just sneak out the back.

334
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,717
What's going on with you two?

335
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,515
Hey, how's it going?

336
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,310
Oh, it was great. It was really good.

337
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,840
Hey! Front door.

338
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,357
- I was thinking we could go to Holly's.
- Thanks.

339
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,397
- Sounds good.
- Awesome.

340
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,835
So, what did you guys do today?

341
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,837
Hi. How you doing? You like
the food here too? It's pretty awesome.

342
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,797
Shut up, queer.

343
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,357
Well, at least I don't shave my chest.

344
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,431
- What did you say?
- Luke, come on.

345
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,319
I said, you look nice in a sweater vest.
It was a compliment.

346
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,517
- Do you want me to break you, Cohen?
- Hi.

347
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,234
No way. Look who's back.

348
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,188
- You're a little far from 8 Mile.
- Luke, don't.

349
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,318
What are you, like, spokesperson
for Geeks of America or something?

350
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,428
You know what I like about rich kids?

351
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,629
Nothing.

352
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,755
- That was awesome!
- Come here, you punk!

353
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,797
Come on, man! Come here!

354
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,309
Cohen, you're dead meat, man!
You're dead meat!

355
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,879
Go!

356
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,508
Come on, chump! You're dead!

357
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,436
"You know what I like about rich kids?

358
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,594
Nothing. " Hey, Ryan...

359
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,196
...you wouldn't consider me rich, would
you? I'd be more upper-middle class.

360
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,913
What's up, fool?

361
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,716
- You know, you didn't have to hit him.
- Sorry.

362
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,189
You know, the cashier called the cops.

363
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,792
Look, I don't know why
Luke does that.

364
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,235
- Did that. He's just...
- An ass?

365
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,551
Protective.

366
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,991
God, it's my mom.

367
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,794
And your dad.

368
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,437
It's been a while.

369
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,479
I have to figure out
what kind of shape this place is in.

370
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,514
That's what those contractors
have been doing.

371
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,674
This place is fantastic.

372
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,990
- You don't think it's too much?
- Are you kidding?

373
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,469
You're talking to a guy
whose wife just imported...

374
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,950
...ceramic shower-curtain rings
from Morocco.

375
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,074
This is gorgeous,
with the high ceilings and the molding.

376
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,390
It reminds me of...

377
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,516
- Your parents' house.
- On Elm Grove.

378
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,595
With the vaulted ceilings and those
great beams. Remember that?

379
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,796
Yeah. I loved that old house.

380
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,714
Yeah, I loved that place too.
I had my first kiss there.

381
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,518
Me too.

382
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,560
So, what's going on, Jimmy?

383
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,876
I had a really bad year
with the market and...

384
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,919
Well, it was disastrous. It's gonna
be a struggle just to remain solvent...

385
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,196
How much do you need?

386
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,229
It's... It's a lot of money.
It's too much.

387
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,311
Jimmy.

388
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,315
- It's $100,000.
- I'll call the bank.

389
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,512
- No, I can't.
- I can.

390
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,590
I'll pay you back.

391
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,790
But it's gonna take me
a couple of months.

392
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,712
I know where you live.

393
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,630
This place is gonna be perfect.

394
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,272
I hope so. The new contractors come
tomorrow. Better get the job finished.

395
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,876
New contractors.
Sounds like a nightmare.

396
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,996
Pretty much.

397
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,271
Are you okay?

398
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,999
So the contractors start tomorrow.

399
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,669
Guess that means I'm gone.

400
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,633
One bus ticket to Austin,
8 a.m. Tomorrow.

401
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,190
"Would you like to purchase?"

402
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,550
- Hey.
- Hey. We're not knocking anymore?

403
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,438
I'm sorry. What are you doing?

404
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,192
Just busy.

405
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,156
- You're always busy.
- It's the price of fame. I gotta go, Dad.

406
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,197
They found Ryan.

407
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,031
Or spotted someone with his description.
There was a fight by the pier.

408
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,669
Really?

409
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,876
Which means he's probably
still in the area.

410
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,476
We should find him before the authorities
do. Before he gets in more trouble.

411
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,359
Actually, do you need me to go?
I was going somewhere.

412
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,636
Seth, he's your friend.

413
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,798
Yeah, okay.

414
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,311
- Hey.
- Hey.

415
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,994
So, what's up?
You've been all weird-acting lately.

416
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,798
Yeah?

417
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,030
I don't know, I guess...

418
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,988
Do you ever wonder what your life
looks like through someone else's eyes?

419
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,197
This is what I'm talking about.
What is up with you?

420
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,351
Nothing. It's just...

421
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,988
- Fresh margs!
- This is some weak margarita.

422
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,310
Whatever. You're the lightweight.

423
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,112
- Say it over here.
- I hope your parents never come home.

424
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,272
Let's find that punk's trailer park
and burn it to the ground.

425
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,429
Who that?

426
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,397
That freak from Chino
was up in Luke's grill.

427
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,677
Maybe he's on OxyContin.
OxyContin is gnarly.

428
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,432
I heard he's a total psycho.

429
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,637
He's a little bitch. If I see him again,
I'm gonna beat his ass.

430
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,712
- Run him out of Newport for sure.
- I gotta go.

431
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,311
- Hey, wait up. Where you going?
- I can't be here right now.

432
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,152
- What's the matter?
- You don't know him.

433
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,958
You don't know anything about him.

434
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,630
- He could be anywhere.
- Dad, I'm sure Ryan's fine.

435
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,234
We should try again when it's light out.

436
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,029
- It could be too late by then.
- Maybe he's better off on his own.

437
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,158
What does that mean?

438
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,999
Okay, if we find him, then what?

439
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,392
Then, if he's lucky, he gets to go back
with his mom? I would run away too.

440
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,549
Promise me that you'd never run away,
no matter how bad things may seem.

441
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,871
- Your mother and I will always be there.
- Take it down a notch.

442
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,517
The minute you were born I knew...

443
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,670
...that I would never breathe easy again
without knowing you were safe.

444
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,833
So I'm like asthma?

445
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,788
I'm warning you, you run away,
I'm coming with you.

446
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,670
I guess we can keep looking.

447
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,189
This song reminds me of you.

448
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,398
- I thought you were with Luke.
- I was.

449
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,436
I don't know why I'm here.
I just wanted to see you.

450
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,513
I mean, you're leaving tomorrow,
and what if I never...?

451
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,318
We never...?

452
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,916
Maybe I could spend the night...

453
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,991
...just hang out.

454
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,796
You can't stay.

455
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,036
If you stay, if we spend the night...

456
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,430
- I don't know that I could leave.
- Then don't.

457
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,355
You'll go back to school in the fall,
and I'll just what? Hang around here?

458
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,110
Hiding like some ghost?

459
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,669
The cops find me
and I have to disappear again?

460
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,076
We're from different worlds.

461
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,033
That's not true.

462
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,991
I'm not like you.

463
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,358
Go.

464
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,158
Please.

465
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,959
Go.

466
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,076
Hey, Allen.

467
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,234
I'm good. I know it's late,
but I need to transfer some money.

468
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,716
Sure, I can hold on a sec.

469
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,751
Seth, I'm up here.

470
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,915
You get the bus ticket?

471
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,877
Bus ticket?

472
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,149
You're not going anywhere.

473
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,354
What are you doing here, man?

474
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,556
What are you doing with my girlfriend?

475
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,072
Nothing.

476
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,151
It didn't look like nothing.

477
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,878
Tell me...

478
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,271
...or I'll kill you.
- Then kill me and quit talking about it.

479
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,271
The place is on fire, man.
We gotta go.

480
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,318
Come on!

481
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,677
Let's go, man!

482
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,558
Run.

483
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,191
I thought basketball season was over.

484
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,875
This is ESPN Classic.
They play all old games.

485
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,793
So the Lakers-Pistons. Right?

486
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,351
1986, the finals, game seven.
You remember watching this?

487
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,432
You were pregnant with Marissa
when this was on.

488
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,830
I remember. I was so swollen.

489
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,911
I hated Detroit.

490
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,435
- Isiah, Laimbeer.
- Yeah.

491
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,431
Dumars. Oh, my...

492
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,513
But Worthy, James Worthy,
he saved us. He shot the lights out.

493
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,359
So fantastic.

494
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,355
You know that thing I was trying
to talk to you about?

495
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,354
- Jimmy.
- No, I'm just saying that I took care of it.

496
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,718
- I knew you would.
- You did?

497
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,990
I can't believe I'm old enough to have
watched people play in those shorts.

498
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,358
Hey, Marissa.

499
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,399
Marissa?

500
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,152
I'll go.

501
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,912
Here you go.

502
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,598
Hey.

503
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,996
What's the matter?

504
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,034
What's the matter? Come on.

505
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,589
You can tell me.

506
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,675
Come here. Give me a hug.
Give me a hug.

507
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,753
What's the matter?

508
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,309
You can tell me.
We tell each other everything.

509
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,879
Do we?

510
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,233
Hello?

511
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,111
I'll meet you there.

512
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,874
- Hi.
- Did Marissa come back?

513
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,110
You smell like smoke.

514
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,789
Yeah, we hot-boxed in Nordlund's car.

515
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,520
And didn't invite me?

516
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,074
Dude, that kid was messed up.

517
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,353
- He was breathing.
- I hope so.

518
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,313
I can't believe this.
This house is cursed.

519
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,789
- You the owner?
- Yes, I am. What happened?

520
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,713
Not sure yet. But it looks like
somebody's been living here.

521
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,233
What?

522
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,958
It's my fault.

523
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,953
- You're okay.
- Disappointed?

524
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,836
Where you going?

525
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,517
Don't know.

526
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,832
We both keep our mouths shut,
they may never know it was us.

527
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,830
- What are you doing?
- You're giving me a ride.

528
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,833
I don't know what happened.
I don't know why it burned down.

529
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,719
What was he even doing there?
Why didn't you tell us?

530
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,836
He didn't want to go to a foster home.

531
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,833
He didn't want to leave,
and I didn't want him to leave either.

532
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,958
It's like, you force me to live
amongst these pod people...

533
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,396
...and the first cool person I meet,
you kick him out of the house.

534
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,514
I did the best I could.

535
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,511
So did I.

536
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,757
Come on. The police want to
ask us some more questions.

537
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,150
<i>Dispatch, is there a description...?</i>

538
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,558
Thank you.

539
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,231
Just follow my lead.

540
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,712
You and I need to talk.
And this time I want the truth.

541
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,589
- I'm sorry.
- Ryan Atwood?

542
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,515
We got some questions for you.

543
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,035
- It was an accident.
- Yeah, you were there?

544
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,034
Yeah.

545
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,668
Then we got some questions
for you too.

546
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,759
Officer, I'm Mr. Atwood's attorney.

547
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,992
Please don't ask him any questions
unless I'm present.

548
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,952
Ryan, keep your mouth shut.

549
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,798
You too.
