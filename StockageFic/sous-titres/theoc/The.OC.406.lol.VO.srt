1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,100
What the hell you doing here,boy?

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,200
You're on a date with my dad?

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,400
You know each other?
Kiss me.

4
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,300
-Uh, what?
-If you don't feel anything,

5
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,000
I will never mention it again.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,800
One kiss.

7
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:22,010
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,900
What's cooking, Ryan?

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,500
SANDY:
Hey, Ryan?

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,900
Ryan?

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,400
I shmeared it for you.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,000
Thanks.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Is everything okay?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah.

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,200
I'm just gonna go see
if Seth's up.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,500
I am up, and I'm out of here.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,700
What? Where you going?

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,900
I didn't know you
were planning a trip.

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,900
Neither did Summer, but

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,300
RISD sent my dorm info,

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,700
so I figured I'd
check out my new home

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,100
and give her some moral

24
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,200
support for finals.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,900
Are you gonna eat that?

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,300
Are you sure that's

27
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,000
such a good idea?

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,200
Why, did Ryan do
something to it?

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,900
No, not the bagel,

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,300
the trip-- I thought
you were gonna give Summer

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,200
some more space.

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, a little space turned

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,800
into a lot of missing me.

34
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,900
That's my cab.

35
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,300
E-mail me a Christmukkah list.

36
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,100
I'm gonna be shopping
at the Providence Place Mall.

37
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,200
They have carpeting,

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,000
which is weird.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,100
They have a Dave & Buster's,

40
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,700
but parking sucks.

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,100
Listen, dude, I really

42
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,200
need to talk to you--
it's very important.

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,500
Okay, and I want to
hear all about it

44
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,200
when I land in Providence.
Just call me.

45
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,000
Call me.

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
So we've had a chance to

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,800
review your situation,

48
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
and the board has come

49
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,400
to a unanimous decision.

50
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,900
Effective immediately,

51
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,800
you are suspended

52
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
from this university

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,100
until next fall.

54
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,900
Suspended?

55
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,100
Breaking into that lab

56
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,600
was very serious.

57
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,300
If it wasn't for your

58
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,500
excellent record,

59
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,400
the board might have

60
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,500
involved the police.

61
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,900
I'm sorry, um, I'm just not sure

62
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,100
what I'm supposed to do now.

63
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,900
It's done.

64
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,800
You can go to the dorm

65
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,700
and start packing.

66
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,300
But I have finals, and friends.

67
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,300
I'm afraid you're no

68
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,500
longer a student here.

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,300
But my dad is living in Seattle

70
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,200
with the step-monste

71
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,300
And Taylor Townsend

72
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,900
is sleeping in my old bed.

73
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,500
And Seth was moving out here
so we could be together.

74
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,300
Ms. Roberts,
you need to go home.

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
This is my home.

76
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,900
 California, here we come 

77
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,200
 Right back where
we started from 

78
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
 California...

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
California... 

80
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,100
It's just you and me now.

81
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,800
Summer Bear.

82
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,200
So, I heard
the iron fist of justice

83
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,600
came crashing down on you

84
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,100
swiftly, without mercy.

85
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,200
Yep. Sounds like your plan

86
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
worked out perfectly.

87
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
Oh, come on, that's not fair.

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,700
Back at the reservation,

89
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,400
they taught us,

90
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,500
sometimes the weaker gazelle

91
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,400
 must be devoured
for the good of the herd.

92
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,900
Oh, Che, just shut up, okay?

93
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,200
Before I tie you up
with hemp

94
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,000
 rope, set you on fire,

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
and get high off the fumes

96
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,300
from your burning flesh.

97
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,100
Dark.

98
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,800
Mm.

99
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,000
I think the fact that

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you would use hemp

101
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,000
proved that I have made a
difference

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,700
 in your life.

103
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,800
Yeah, Che, you have.

104
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,000
You got me thrown out of school.

105
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
You know,
I really liked this place.

106
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,400
I liked
who I was becoming at it.

107
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,500
I mean, this was my life.

108
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,200
And you sacrificed it for the

109
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,700
good of the... the-the cause.

110
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,600
You're a martyr.
You're a hero.

111
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,900
I just wanted to be a student.

112
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Now if you'll excuse me,

113
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,600
I have to find my roommate

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,300
and tell her that
she now has a single.

115
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,800
Are you dirty, Ryan?

116
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,400
KIRSTEN:
Ryan?

117
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,200
Hello?

118
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,000
Hey.

119
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,600
I-I couldn't help but notice
that you 

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,700
wanted to talk to Seth.

121
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,800
Oh, did I?

122
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,100
Well, since he's
out of town

123
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,200
and he's gonna be
moving out next semester,

124
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,700
you're gonna need a new Seth.

125
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,300
Don't tell Sandy, but...

126
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,100
I thought I would audition

127
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,600
for the job.

128
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,200
Oh, uh, yeah, well, that's,

129
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,900
uh, very thoughtful.

130
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,800
So... how does it work?

131
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,800
Do I ask you
what's on your mind?

132
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,400
Uh, usually you talk
about yourself,

133
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,000
and I solve my
problems on my own.

134
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,000
I've noticed that you've been

135
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,600
spending time with Taylor.

136
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,500
Rea... Have I?

137
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
If we're gonna talk
about girls,

138
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,000
I am a far more knowledgeable

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,100
resource than my son.

140
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,800
Okay. But you can't
repeat this, all right?

141
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
Because if the real
Seth found out

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,100
I was telling the substitute

143
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,900
Seth a real secret...

144
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,100
It's in the vault.

145
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,400
Okay.

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I kissed Taylor.

147
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Or she kissed me.

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,400
Anyway, there was
a kiss, and, uh...

149
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,200
And now you can't stop
thinking about her.

150
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,800
Pretty much.

151
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,900
That is so cute.

152
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,100
Okay, Seth never
does that.

153
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,800
Sorry.

154
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,100
But it is, and so is she.

155
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,400
Yeah, I know, it's
just... me and Taylor?

156
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,900
After everything
you've been through

157
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,100
over the last few months,

158
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,300
if something good happens,

159
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,700
shouldn't you embrace it?

160
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,500
Or at least be open

161
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
to the possibility?

162
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,400
You're right.

163
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
You're right. Thanks.

164
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,200
Okay.

165
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,100
So do I get the job?

166
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,200
You're on the short list.

167
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,100
Spencer, what brings you

168
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,000
to Casa de Cooper? 

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Your racket.

170
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,100
You restrung it for me.

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,900
That's so sweet.

172
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,900
Yeah, I went with
the Pro-Flex Fiber Tour.

173
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,100
It should, uh... it should
cut down on the tension.

174
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,900
Good, because I've been having
a lot of stress lately.

175
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,500
I could use a little bit
of... relaxing.

176
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,800
String tension, Kaitlin.

177
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Well, now that you
and my mom are over,

178
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
maybe you can help me
with my stroke.

179
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,100
Yeah, right. 

180
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,700
Look, you got a great
backhand, but, uh,

181
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,000
no offense, I kind of have

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,200
a "no jail bait" policy.

183
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,300
Lame.

184
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,100
You know, maybe you
should try, uh,

185
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,400
try meeting guys
from your school.

186
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,300
-You mean boys?
-Exactly. Yeah, because

187
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,700
you're in high school.

188
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,400
You know, that place with desks

189
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,500
and chalkboards and kids.

190
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,000
Those are people
your own age.

191
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,700
I don't know, maybe...

192
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,800
maybe you should try
hanging out with them.

193
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,100
TAYLOR:Hi, Ryan.

194
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,300
I got to go, can't talk.

195
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm-I'm not here
to see you.

196
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,100
I'm just covering for
Seth while he's gone.

197
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,900
That's nice.

198
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,700
Sorry that I kissed you.

199
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,200
What?

200
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,300
No, its... it's cool.

201
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,400
It's obviously not okay.

202
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,100
You're totally uncomfortable
around me now.

203
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
No, no. Um...

204
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,600
It's... the kiss
is not a problem.

205
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,900
Really? Good, because

206
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,000
usually when I kiss a guy,

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,700
 it ends in tears.

208
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,300
His, not mine,

209
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,800
because, like,
I'm a bit of a lip biter

210
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,900
and, you know, sometimes
I draw blood and...

211
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,200
Taylor?

212
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah?

213
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,400
What are you doing tonight?

214
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,700
Oh, I'm updating my blog.

215
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,600
It's kind of
 Felicity by way

216
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,900
of Anais Nin, the erotic memoirs

217
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,800
of a soulful college girl.

218
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,000
Taylor, tonight,
are you busy?

219
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,600
Oh. Blog, shmog.

220
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
-Is-is that a yes?
-Yes, it is a yes, squared.

221
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,600
In all caps, with
a exclamation mark

222
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,200
and a smiley-fed emoticon.

223
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,100
A simple yes will do.

224
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Yes.

225
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,900
Great, all right, well,
I'll see you tonight.

226
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,200
Hey, do you just want to come
up to the comic book store?

227
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,500
There's a flat-screen TV,
SurroundSound, 

228
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,200
a bevy of Blu-ray anime.

229
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,300
All right. See you then.

230
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,100
Hey, Eric.

231
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Kaitlin, hey.

232
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,200
What are you doing here?

233
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
It seems like people at

234
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,900
this school like to watch
hairless wonders in banana slings.

235
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
I'm just trying to fit in.

236
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,700
Oh, cool.

237
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
Well, good to see you.

238
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,500
Ask her.

239
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,600
No, you ask her.

240
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,900
Do you bitches have a problem?

241
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,500
We saw you talking to Eric Ward.

242
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,400
Oh, my God, he is so hot.

243
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,600
Do you know him?

244
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
I know that his brother
shaves his chest.

245
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Seriously?

246
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
That is so...

247
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,800
Gayer than his dad, I know.

248
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,900
You're Kaitlin Cooper,
aren't you?

249
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
Yes.

250
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm Olivia.
This is Lea.

251
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,200
-Hi.
-Cool.

252
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,300
 Do you guys think
anyone would notice

253
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,100
if I sparked a jay
up by the bleachers?

254
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,700
That is so totally illegal.

255
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
Is there a reason why you guys
aren't home right now?

256
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,200
Riley, hey! We-we...

257
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,600
Came to cheer on
your boyfriend.

258
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,500
Connor's doing awesome.

259
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,800
That's because he is awesome.

260
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,400
Now, get going.

261
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Those party invites aren't
gonna address themselves.

262
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,700
Okay.

263
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,800
Okay, why do you guys
let her talk to you like that?

264
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,600
Well, she's having a
pimps and ho's party

265
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
for her sweet 16,

266
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,700
and it's gonna
be awesome.

267
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,000
But if we don't help out,

268
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,800
we don't go.

269
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,900
So don't go.

270
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
Yeah.

271
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,000
That would be social suicide.

272
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,400
Everyone who's anyone
at this school is

273
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
going to that party.

274
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,800
No offense.

275
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,200
Come on, Lea.

276
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,000
'Kay, well, if you guys
change your minds,

277
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
 I'll be by the bleachers.

278
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,100
Sure.

279
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,400
Gotcha.

280
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,100
Hey, man, how's the 
East Coast treating you?

281
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,000
Too soon to tell.

282
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,400
I had a layover in Salt Lake

283
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,600
and then I got delayed in Poughkeepsie.

284
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,100
It's hard to get a direct flight
last minute.

285
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,800
Yeah, well,

286
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,700
at least you made it.

287
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,100
Summer surprised to see you?

288
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,500
I'm headed over there right now.

289
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,400
I got an all-night study package.

290
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I scored a brick
of Dunkin' Donuts coffee

291
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,300
and some reasonably priced meth

292
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,200
from this homeless guy.

293
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Oh, I'm sure she'll appreciate

294
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,500
the pick-me-up, very thoughtful.

295
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,600
How are things with you?

296
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,900
I know you wanted to talk.

297
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,800
Things are weird.

298
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,400
And about to get a lot weirder.

299
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
That wasn't vague
or ominous at all.

300
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,600
I'll explain later.

301
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,700
Well, good luck.

302
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,500
Back at you.

303
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
I know you're unhappy,

304
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,000
but you've been out with
seven different men.

305
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,300
You mean seven versions
of the same man.

306
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,800
Republican
real estate developer

307
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
hates his ex-wife,
loves golf.

308
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
This is Newport.

309
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,200
You live in a monkey cage,

310
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,300
you have to date chimps.

311
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,200
Well, maybe you could throw

312
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
a gorilla into the mix.

313
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,200
I appreciate the analogy,

314
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,600
but, Pam, how do we fix this?

315
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,400
Find me a man
who will surprise me.

316
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,600
Someone different.

317
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,500
Her prayers have
been answered.

318
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,800
I tell you, the women are
well-preserved in this town.

319
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,700
If my slacks weren't
so damn tight...

320
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,800
Bullet, what are
you doing here?

321
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,300
I thought you were going
to be a silent partner.

322
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,700
Oh, I ain't here to work.

323
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,200
I came to see my girlfriend.

324
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
-What? No, I am not...
-Car's waiting outside.

325
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,100
Dinner's planned.

326
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,500
I'd invite Blondie,
but she don't look

327
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,600
much like an eater.

328
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,400
Oh, that's a shame.

329
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,900
I'm going to let you two

330
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
figure this out.

331
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,300
See you in the morning.

332
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,100
Kirs...

333
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay, I'm not having 
dinner with you.

334
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,500
A) You repulse me,

335
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,000
and B) I'm busy.

336
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,300
Well, A) that's cool;

337
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,100
2) busy doing what?

338
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,800
A client is unhappy
with our man base,

339
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,500
so I have to go on
a major recruiting mission.

340
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,800
Or you can just put them
in the Bullet's line of fire.

341
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,500
Okay, while the client is looking
 for something out of the norm,

342
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,600
"lunatic" probably isn't her type.

343
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,200
-Have dinner with me.
-No.

344
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,400
-A cocktail?
-No!

345
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Then let's just make out.

346
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,700
 I can hurt you.

347
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,200
Wow.

348
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,600
Call me.

349
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,900
Isn't this just great?

350
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,500
I mean, did you ever think

351
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
that decapitation could be so beautiful?

352
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,700
How many times
have you seen this?

353
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,700
Oh, I watch it every night.

354
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,400
It helps relax me.

355
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,000
Is everything okay?

356
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,300
I'm sorry.

357
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,900
So that's a "no."

358
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
I can't do this.

359
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,900
Okay, um...

360
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,600
I've done my fair share of

361
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,000
misreading signs in my life,

362
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,300
but you asked me to hang out.

363
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,800
You sat next to me,

364
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,900
you leaned in with 
a slight tilt to your head.

365
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,800
I know, I know,

366
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,500
and I'm sorry.

367
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,000
Uh, you're a great girl.
It's just,

368
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,100
this is too weird.

369
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,500
Well, that makes me
feel so much better.

370
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,800
Me!
Not you, me.

371
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,600
I'm... weird.

372
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Surprise!

373
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Cohen?

374
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,900
Cohen.

375
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,200
Hey, where are you?

376
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,000
Where are you?

377
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,300
I'm in your room.

378
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,100
I'm in your room.

379
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,600
Summer, I was going
to surprise you.

380
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,800
Well, I'm surprised.

381
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Yeah, me, too.
Why aren't you in school?

382
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,200
Because I got kicked out.

383
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,900
Summer, what'd you do?

384
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,800
I listened to stupid Che

385
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
and his stupid plan,

386
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,200
and he sold me down
the stupid river.

387
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,300
I knew anyone that sincere
was not to be trusted.

388
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,700
I miss it already.

389
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,000
I don't know what to do.

390
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
Yeah, well, I do.

391
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,800
What?

392
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,500
If he hurt you,

393
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,200
then I'm going to hurt him.

394
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,600
That's funny, Cohen.

395
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,700
See, I knew you could
cheer me up.

396
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,100
I'm serious.
You can at least act like

397
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,600
it's halfway feasible
that I could avenge your honor.

398
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,400
What, you're serious?

399
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
No, no, no.

400
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,800
I'm going to go
so Ryan Atwood on his ass.

401
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,400
Come on, Cohen,
I don't like this.

402
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Neither will Che.

403
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,300
No, wait, don't...

404
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
So Kirsten told me
she came in yesterday

405
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,400
and applied for the job
of substitute Seth.

406
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,100
She may have.

407
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,300
Well, you know, uh,

408
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,500
if anyone's qualified,

409
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,000
I think we all know it's me,

410
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,800
and I'm thinking the only
reason you didn't ask me

411
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,700
is because no interview
was necessary.

412
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Yeah, well, it turns out I may

413
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,900
not have to fill the position--

414
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,700
I handled the whole
Taylor thing--

415
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,800
although it may be a little
awkward for a while.

416
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,900
Oh.

417
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,000
What happened?

418
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,700
Nothing happened.

419
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,000
Which was the problem for her.

420
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,900
Yeah, yeah.

421
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,600
But now I don't know.

422
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,800
I mean, at first I thought
I was just caught up in

423
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,100
the whole Volchok thing.

424
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,000
And then I thought the 
problem might've been Taylor.

425
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,700
You know, because she can

426
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,400
be a little, uh, weird.

427
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,300
She's a touch eccentric.

428
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,400
But now I think
the problem is me.

429
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
Maybe it's too soon.

430
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,800
So keep it casual.

431
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,300
You know, just tell her you...

432
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,700
you need to be friends for now.

433
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,500
Yeah, that's a line
every girl loves to hear.

434
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,800
No, if it's the truth,

435
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
she'll understand.

436
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,600
Well, I don't have
any other choice.

437
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,900
All right,
I'll give it a shot.

438
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,800
Great, okay, listen,

439
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,000
if there's anything else
I can do for you,

440
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,300
I'll be in my room
reading comics

441
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,700
and listening to indie rock.
All right.

442
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,900
That was a good Seth.

443
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,100
Were you a good Ryan?

444
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,200
I was actually going
to borrow one

445
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,700
from the Julie Cooper playbook,

446
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,900
and wait till Che was asleep,

447
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,200
then smother him with a pillow.

448
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,300
Oh, my hero.

449
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,000
But the guy was at some

450
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,300
all-night candlelight vigil.

451
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,900
Still, he's got to sleep
sometime.

452
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,400
This place reeks of incense
and righteousness.

453
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,700
Oh, that's Che's musk.

454
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,600
Look, be careful.

455
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,800
He's not in his room.

456
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,100
Neither was your roommate
last night.

457
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah, that's because
she's a huge slut.

458
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,300
Wait a minute, what's this?

459
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,000
What, I don't know.

460
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,100
I'm on the phone, I can't see.

461
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Hello, Seth.

462
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,400
News of your vendetta
has reached my ears.

463
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,500
Is that Che?

464
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,200
What's happening?

465
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm a pacifist.

466
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,800
Until cooler heads prevail...

467
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,000
I will be underground.

468
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,600
Peace.

469
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,400
He's going to run?

470
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
That coward!

471
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm going to watch it again
for background noise,

472
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,600
visual cues,

473
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,800
anything that might tip me off

474
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,700
to his whereabouts.

475
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,400
No, Cohen, Che has had

476
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
survival training, okay.

477
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
He's probably hiding in a cave

478
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
somewhere with Osama Bin Laden.

479
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,900
Look, forget about him.

480
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,200
I need you, and I'm here.

481
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,600
All right, but for the record,

482
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,900
I did not back down.

483
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,600
And I love you for it.

484
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,500
Come home.

485
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,200
Okay.

486
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,600
Summer?

487
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,300
What are you doing here?

488
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,600
Oh, I slept out here.

489
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,200
Turns out I like nature.

490
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,000
And Taylor's in my bed.

491
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
No, I mean, what are you
doing here in Newport?

492
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,500
Oh.

493
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,600
Long story.

494
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,100
Oh.

495
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Well, then if you need anything

496
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,400
or just want to talk,

497
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,300
I'm here for you.

498
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,900
Thanks, Julie.

499
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,000
And you should go
reclaim your bedroom.

500
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,200
Taylor has boundary issues.

501
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,700
Mm.

502
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,000
Is that a bunny?

503
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,100
Okay, so if I don't
call your name,

504
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,500
that means you're not coming.

505
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
All the hot senior guys
already got their invites.

506
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,900
Jeanie.

507
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,300
Kristen.

508
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,800
Sarah.

509
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,700
She's got to
invite us, right?

510
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,200
She'd better.

511
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,500
We stayed up all night
licking envelopes.

512
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,700
Alexis.

513
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,600
Michelle.

514
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,100
Shana.

515
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,300
And lastly, me, duh.

516
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,000
Wait, what about us?

517
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Sorry,
but I didn't know

518
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,200
you'd ruin the envelopes

519
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,700
with your heinous saliva stains.

520
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
The whole school could get

521
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,700
gonorrhea of the throat.

522
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,100
But you promised!

523
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm afraid it'd be unsanitary.

524
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,900
KAITLIN:
You guys can all come to my party.

525
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,900
It's tonight, my house.

526
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,700
Well, I rented out Hide,

527
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,300
and did you know that

528
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,200
Chef Hu yells at people?

529
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,600
He's making sushi,
and Danity Kane

530
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,000
is playing a 25-minute set.

531
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,300
Well, sushi's high in mercury,

532
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,600
and Danity Kane sucks.

533
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,400
I've got five kegs,

534
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,300
a quarter ounce
and absolutely no parents.

535
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,200
Sweet!

536
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,500
Bring whoever you guys want.

537
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,000
And don't worry about
any lame costumes.

538
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,400
Thanks.

539
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Yeah, that was
really nice

540
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,200
inviting us
to your party.

541
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,800
It sounds like fun.

542
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,400
Oh, it will be.

543
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,800
You want to join New Match?

544
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,100
I don't understand.

545
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,000
The application fee
is rather steep,

546
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,400
and most of our female clients
are over 35.

547
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,500
Look, you need new recruits,
right?

548
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,800
So sign us up.

549
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,600
Here's a check to cover it.

550
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,500
And I believe this is for you.

551
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,600
Uh-huh, and I think
I know who it is.

552
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,300
Bang!

553
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,500
Am I good or am I good?

554
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,400
What do you think
you're doing?

555
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,600
Well, money may not buy
love or happiness,

556
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,700
but it'll buy a whole lot
of bachelors.

557
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,700
I think you owe me
a weekend as a thanks.

558
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,600
No, I can't.

559
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,700
I already have plans.

560
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,800
Cancel them.

561
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm going away for the weekend

562
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,100
with Kirsten and Sandy.

563
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,200
To the Montage,

564
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,500
it's their anniversary.

565
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,200
You're celebrating
 their anniversary?

566
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,900
They're having a recommitment

567
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,100
ceremony and, uh...

568
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,900
I am their witness.

569
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,300
Well, that's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

570
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,400
See you there.

571
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,300
The Bullet?

572
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,800
Bang.

573
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,200
Taylor.

574
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,600
Ryan.
Boo!

575
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Didn't run away that time,

576
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,300
so you must not be
that scared of me.

577
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,000
All right, look,

578
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,100
I just wanted to come by and 

579
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
apologize about last night, and...

580
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,700
And I didn't know
you had company.

581
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,600
Roger, Ryan.
Ryan, Roger.

582
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,500
-Roger.
-Ryan.

583
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
I've been helping Roger

584
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
track down this obscure

585
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,000
Kinji Fukasaku biography.

586
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,300
And it turns out he
watches Blood Bath IV

587
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,100
every night before
he goes to bed, too.

588
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,000
Well, that's...

589
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,100
Kismet? I know.

590
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,200
Maybe it's too soon
to talk about fate,

591
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,100
 but...

592
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,400
Yeah, well, anyway,

593
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,200
I just wanted, you know,

594
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,100
to see if you need
a ride home or anything.

595
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,200
Oh, I got my bike, thanks.

596
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,800
Not you.

597
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,900
Well, that is very 
friendly of you, Ryan,

598
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,700
since I'm assuming
that's what you want

599
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,900
us to be, just friends?

600
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,200
Well, if you're cool
with that.

601
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,800
 Ryan Atwood,
 "mon ami" sounds terrif.

602
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,800
But Roger and I
were just gonna

603
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,000
hang out
and, uh, order some takeout,

604
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,200
so if you don't mind.

605
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,100
All right, well, uh, you know,

606
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,900
I'll see you, then.

607
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,000
Bye, friend.

608
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
Bye, Ryan.
Nice to meet you, man.

609
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,100
Bye, Roger.

610
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,100
Let's come lat this.
I wanted to show you this.

611
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,800
I really think you guys
should work at this one.

612
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,600
This really why
you work here?

613
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah,
I talked to my dad today.

614
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
He was pretty 
disappointed in me.

615
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,400
Well, I'm leaving the Antelope
Valley Airport now,

616
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,800
so there's just the $100 cab
ride home.

617
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,100
Just get here soon, okay?

618
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,300
Okay, I love you.

619
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
That was fast.

620
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,500
I've come to atone for my sins.

621
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,100
around the block with the kegs.

622
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
have to get my mr of h.

623
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,300
What, or convince her to let me
throw a huge party

624
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,500
with underage drinking?

625
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Yeah, I have to get her out
of the house.

626
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,400
Are you going somewhere?

627
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,600
yeah, I'm go to the Mgeh
Sandy and Kirsten,

628
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,100
just for the weekend.

629
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,600
Going to a hotel
with Sandy and Kirsten?

630
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,900
They're not spg r
relationship up, are they?

631
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,700
Please, Sandy and Kirsten?

632
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,500
Yeah, they don't 
exactly scream threesome.

633
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,100
Just hld y

634
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,000
So I guess I can assume
you'll be fine

635
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,200
without me this weekend?

636
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,900
Oh, I think I can survive.

637
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,000
Now, if you need anything,

638
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,800
Summer and Taylor
are in charge.

639
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,000
it, Summer's here?

640
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,400
Fine, Che, you're really
 going to dehydrate,

641
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
ca oon the front lawn,
I'll get you some water.

642
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,600
Hi.

643
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,200
So you don't belie
that I'm thirstyh?

644
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,500
Now you think I'm a liar.

645
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,300
And a chicken and a snake

646
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,500
and a ra

647
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,600
Well, those are
all God's creatures.

648
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,700
Aneyalll.
I made a mistake.

649
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,400
It wasn't a mistake.
You deliberately used me.

650
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,600
Summer, I cannot go on with my

651
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,300
life with this issue unresolved.

652
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,400
So let's go out on the lawn

653
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,200
and have a truth circle.

654
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,000
 will be your
 opportunity to tell me

655
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
how you're really feeling.

656
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,800
I have.

657
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,300
I hate you. Now leave.

658
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,500
This can't be fixed by
some candlelight vigil oretn,y?

659
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,700
And I'm not some tree that you

660
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,100
can just chain yourself to.

661
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,800
We'll see about that.

662
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,400
What? What did you do?

663
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,900
This is fu 
Give me the key.

664
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,400
I cannot unlock us
until we are done healing.

665
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,100
Hmm. Okay, then be prepared
to stay here

666
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,000
for the rest of your life,
'cause that's never going to happen.

667
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,400
SANDY:A weekend away
at the Montage.neououe self.

668
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,300
I don't know about that.

669
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh, no, listen,

670
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
I'm going to be paying you
back later tonight.

671
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,800
Guess who packed Scrabble?

672
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,100
There's just one small
 wrinkle totherwisrrd

673
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,500
 romantic holidayth forgot to share.

674
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,300
Not to worry.

675
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,700
I TiVoed the Australian Open.

676
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,800
Tiger's going
to take it any

677
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,100
Just one more g.

678
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,500
Tell me at least he's got
a separate room.

679
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Sandy Cohen,

680
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
you're looking lovely tonight.

681
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,700
If my date didn't look so hot,

682
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,000
I might scope you out.

683
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
llI-I'm jealous.

684
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Now, who is the lucky date?

685
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,500
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

686
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,600
I owe you both big time.

687
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,900
I'll make this up
to you tight.

688
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,300
I am so damn honored
to be here with you

689
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,300
and Kirsten for your recommitment ceremony.

690
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,000
I am crying already.

691
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,300
Realrs

692
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,100
Come on, let's eat.

693
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,600

 Canop it.

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,000
It's packed in its original
packaging, so no groping...

696
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,700

735
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,200
Wh?

736
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,300
Kaitlin!

737
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Roger?!

738
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,100
Yon't believe your eyes.

739
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,400
ese girls are wild.

740
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,300
Get out ere now!

741
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,200
Ride with me, Ryan.

742
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,700
So the good news is,
my frequent-flier miles

743
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,000
just reached platinum.

744
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,400
The bad news is, they don't

745
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,600
change the in-flight movie,

746
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,900
and Failure to Launch
does not hold up

747
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,400
 on the third viewing.

748
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,600
What are you doing here?

749
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,700
Summer got kicked out of school

750
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,900
and I'm about to head over there.

751
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,300
Can I come with you?

752
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,100
I appreciate your interest
in Summer's future,

753
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,500
but I think this
is a conversation

754
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,900
that's just for the two of us.

755
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,800
Is Taylor going to be there?

756
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,700
I assume so.

757
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,300
I like her.

758
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,400
Say what now?
Why would you even think that?

759
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,700
Because I keep imagining her
on roller skates

760
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,800
and washing windows with a big 

761
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,000
bucket of soapy water.

762
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,400
Dude, your fantasies

763
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,800
are so pedestrian.
A sudsy girl?

764
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,000
That's... so average.

765
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,600
Doesn't mean it's not hot.
I guess they call them classics for a reason.

766
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Do you want to drive
or sh-should I?

767
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,900
Again!

768
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,200
Okay, game night!

769
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,000
Who wants to play Pictionary,
 huh?

770
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,500
Come on, guys, get high on life!

771
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,600
Hey! Hey!

772
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,800
Cut it out!
I tan on this chair.

773
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,400
Hey, if you are going
to consummate your union, be safe.

774
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,100
Out of my way, wasteoid.

775
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,300
Hey, stay alive.

776
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,200
Don't drink and drive.

777
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,100
Che, shut up!

778
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,100
Where's Kaitlin?

779
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,600
Again!

780
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,700
You guys, your seven minutes is up.

781
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,200
And I'm next.

782
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
It's Connor.

783
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,100
Oh, Riley's gonna die.

784
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,500
I mean, it's bad enough you

785
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,800
didn't go to her party.

786
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,700
She doesn't have to know.

787
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,000
Come on, Kaitlin.

788
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,900
Oh...

789
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,700
Oh, my gosh.

790
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Oh, man.
Whoo!You're so hot.

791
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,100
Why don't I ever see you
around school?

792
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,400
'Cause I don't really like school.

793
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,300
Huh.

794
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,000
So are we going to
make out or what?

795
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,500
'Cause the clock
is kind of ticking.

796
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Or we could talk more.

797
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,000
I mean...

798
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,200
Yeah, you seem
really interesting.

799
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,300
I'm not.

800
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,400
Let's make out.

801
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Are you afraid
to cheat on Riley?

802
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,000
No. I don't even like her.

803
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,900
So what's the problem?

804
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Are you... gay?

805
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,900
What?

806
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,200
No!

807
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,800
I don't, I don't,

808
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,600
I don't think so.

809
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,300
Sweetheart, you're so gay.

810
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,700
I know the Jews are good

811
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,200
with numbers and lending stuff.

812
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,800
Now, there's a generalization

813
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,500
that's not even
remotely offensive.

814
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Well, hold on there,
He-bro.

815
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,000
It's just,
if you all control the media,

816
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
why does everyone know?

817
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,900
Why not use the media to say

818
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,400
someone else controls it?

819
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,300
It would cause a lot less
resentment that way.

820
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,300
You know, we should talk
about something else.

821
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,800
Dinner was delicious.

822
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Like you ate!

823
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,400
Oh, I know what they say--

824
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
"Eat light on
Saturday night."

825
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,500
Less food in the stomach
for the booze.

826
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,300
Bullet, Kirsten
doesn't drink.

827
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,800
Time for bed.
I have a headache.

828
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,400
Uh-oh!

829
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
I guess she doesn't do that either.

830
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,600
Thank you, Gordon.

831
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Your point of view regarding
the Middle East is something

832
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
I will treasure forever.

833
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,100
Well, all I said
was Iran-Iraq war.

834
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,900
Whoever loses, we win.

835
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,000
Honey, let's see
if we can cancel our room.

836
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Sounds like a plan.

837
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,600
Good night, Julie.

838
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
-Good night.
-Good night.

839
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,100
What about their wedding vows?

840
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,200
That was a lie, Bullet.

841
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Told to avoid you, because you

842
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,600
are an ignorant buffoon.

843
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,700
Now, if you'll excuse me,

844
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,300
I'm going to try and salvage
my friendship with Sandy and Kirsten.

845
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,300
You want some more coffee?

846
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,600
-Let's split up.
-All right, good luck.

847
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,400
You, too.

848
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,500
Taylor?

849
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,900
Taylor?

850
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,400
Ryan?

851
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
Roger, hey.

852
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
Uh, keep doing
what you're doing.

853
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,000
I was looking for Taylor,
but clearly she's...

854
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,500
Who's Taylor?

855
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Uh...

856
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,200
Is this your boyfriend?

857
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,400
Uh, Taylor isn't in there

858
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,000
with you guys, is she?

859
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,600
No.

860
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay. What are you doing, man?

861
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,800
Um, I mean, I think Taylor
really likes you,

862
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,400
and you're kind
of leading her on.

863
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,600
I barely even know her.

864
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,000
She told me if I pretended
to like her,

865
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,100
she'd give me
her Kitano action figure.

866
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,100
It's extremely rare.

867
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,600
Wait, she paid you
to pretend to like her?

868
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
That sounds like Taylor.

869
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,500
All right, well, uh... carry on.

870
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,300
Well, well, well.

871
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,000
Looks like you finally crawled
out of your cave.

872
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,700
Seth, perhaps with your
presence, 

873
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,900
we could broker some peace.

874
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,300
What are you doing here,
Sandals?

875
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,100
Ruining Summer's life
at Brown wasn't enough?

876
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,700
Cohen, you're here!

877
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,800
Yeah.

878
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,000
Now I want to see what this

879
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,500
guy's got to say for himself.

880
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,400
Please, Seth.

881
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,300
Summer and I are on
a journey together.

882
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,000
Huh?

883
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,500
A journey towards the truth.

884
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,600
You're on a journey...

885
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,800
-to the pool.
-What?

886
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,900
What? No! Cohen! 

887
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,200

888
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,800
So you dress like a ho
for no reason?

889
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,800
-I changed before I came here.
-Oh.

890
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Look, you win, okay?

891
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,500
I'll... I'll serve your command.

892
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,400
The school is yours.

893
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,700
Except that I don't want it.

894
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,400
Just be nicer to your friends.

895
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,400
Oh.

896
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,100
Connor's totally gay.

897
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Hi, 911?

898
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,200
Yeah, I'd like to report
a totally lame partyer.

899
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,100
I'm a worthless coward,

900
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,300
and you're a
glorious m artyr.

901
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,100
Sorry,

902
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,000
I didn't realize
about the handcuffs.

903
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,300
Well, you know,
it's all Che's fault.

904
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
It's my fault.

905
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,800
Just know I hate myself more

906
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
than you could ever hate me.

907
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,200
I'm capable of a lot of hate.

908
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,900
It's true.

909
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,200
You're my best friend, Summer.

910
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,400
All those other kids,
they only  joined the cause

911
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
so it'd look good on their
grad school applications.

912
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,500
But you, but you really
believed in the good

913
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,400
we were doing.

914
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,900
We did a lot of good.

915
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,300
I let you down, I know.

916
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,200
I'm sorry.

917
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,300
I liberated those bunnies
because 

918
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,300
I believed that
they should be set free.

919
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,900
I knew the consequences
if I got caught.

920
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,000
Look, I can't spend
my whole life blaming you,

921
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,500
so I accept your apology.

922
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
With an asterisk next to it.

923
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,300
And there's a footnote
at the bottom.

924
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,500
And it says

925
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,800
you don't deserve it.

926
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,900
Yeah. (sighs)

927
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,800
You're so much more
enlightened than

928
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,100
I could ever hope to be.

929
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,600
I think I need
to blow my nose.

930
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,900
No, you...
Could you unlock us first?

931
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,500
Okay.

932
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,200
I guess
now we are

933
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,700
free to take
our own paths.

934
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,100
Yours leads toward the airport.

935
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,300
Yeah, okay, yeah.

936
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,200
I should be going.

937
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,300
You ready, Dalton?

938
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,700
Your bags are packed,
Winchester.

939
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,900
-Winchester?
-Winchester?

940
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,500
Why do they think
they call me Che?

941
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,900
Your father's G-4

942
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,700
is waiting
on the tarmac.

943
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,400
I thought you grew up
on a reservation.

944
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,900
It was a reservation--

945
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,700
a beautiful reservation--

946
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,000
Before it became
a family 

947
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
compound
that's all gated.

948
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,700
My dad owns
a pharmaceutical company

949
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,400
and some factories in Mexico.

950
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,400
Well, I guess every kid

951
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,700
finds a way
to rebel against their parents.

952
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,800
Good-bye, Caterpillar.

953
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,300
And defender of
Caterpillar's honor.

954
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,300
?????????????

955
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
So he was a liar,

956
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,500
a coward and a hypocrite.

957
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
At least he had depth.

958
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I guess I am really
back home again.

959
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Which is great,
except now I have to leave.

960
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,100
Taylor?

961
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,700
Ryan.

962
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,400
What are you doing?

963
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,600
Someone wrote I love poop

964
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,000
on this poor boy's face.

965
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You know, that kind of thing

966
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
can scar you for life.

967
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,200
No, what are you doing paying

968
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,400
your gay friend Roger to pretend

969
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,300
he's in love
with you?

970
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,000
Well, what if I did, hmm?

971
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,800
What if I did rent a homosexual
for the evening?

972
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,400
And pay him with rare
collectibles from Asian cinema?

973
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,000
What difference
does it make to you?

974
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,500
Well, it's a little strange.

975
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,900
Well, so am I.

976
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,700
Which is why you ran away

977
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,600
from me last night.

978
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,200
No, it wasn't 'cause
you're strange.

979
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,200
You don't find me strange?

980
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,000
No, I do, but that's
not why I took off.

981
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,600
Look, I'm not really ready

982
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,800
for a relationship right now

983
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,000
or a girlfriend.

984
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,500
Uh... girlfriend?

985
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,800
Cart, horse?

986
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,700
Aren't you getting a little
ahead of yourself there?

987
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,700
Well, I mean, just because

988
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,100
I want to use your body
as a jungle gym,

989
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,400
doesn't mean that
we have to get married.

990
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,000
-I see.
-I mean, my divorce papers

991
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,300
aren't even dry yet.

992
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,200
Look, you're a sweet, smart,

993
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,100
great guy, Ryan Atwood.

994
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,100
And hot.

995
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,500
Did I mention hot?

996
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,700
So whatever happens,

997
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,200
happens.

998
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,800
-Taylor, that's...
-Normal?

999
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,500
Yeah.

1000
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,700
Yeah, I have my moments.

1001
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,900
You know, this is
my first high school bash.

1002
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,900
Have you ever played
Seven Minutes in Heaven?

1003
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Thanks to you, Sandy and Kirsten
are packed and on the road.

1004
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,600
I'm sorry, Julie.

1005
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,300
When God was handing
out brains,

1006
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,100
I guess I was sitting
on the toilet.

1007
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,600
I swear you make me
all nervous inside.

1008
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,400
So you only act like a bigot
and a sexist pig around me?

1009
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,500
No, I just feel worse
about it when you're around.

1010
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,300
You're such a classy
and elegant dame.

1011
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,700
Well, that is true.

1012
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Look, I was trying so hard

1013
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,200
to make you laugh,

1014
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,000
and I know what a hard time
you've been through,

1015
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,700
and I...

1016
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,000
it just came out all wrong.

1017
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,800
I appreciate that, Gordon.

1018
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,400
I guess you're heading
on home now, too, huh?

1019
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,500
Are you kidding?

1020
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,900
I put the room on
the company card.

1021
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,200
I've got a mud bath
in the morning.

1022
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,000
So, since I ruined dinner,

1023
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
how about breakfast?

1024
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Breakfast?

1025
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,500
Okay.

1026
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,700
So, uh, should I

1027
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,800
call you or nudge you?

1028
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,000
Bang.

1029
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,800
That was funny.

1030
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,200
You have a pretty smile.

1031
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,400
My job is to get you
to use it more.

1032
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,700
Then you're going
to need better material.

1033
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,500
Well, I am working on it.

1034
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,200
'Night, Julie.

1035
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Can't we be left alone?

1036
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,700
It's probably Julie.

1037
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,500
She felt terrible.

1038
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,700
Well, I bet she did.

1039
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,400
She spent the night
with the Bullet.

1040
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,400
Hello, I was told you two

1041
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,600
are renewing your vows?

1042
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,400
I'm a justice of the

1043
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,800
peace, here to preside
over the ceremony.

1044
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,300
Oh, I'm sorry,

1045
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,600
that was an excuse.

1046
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,200
Yeah, we didn't call
for anyone.

1047
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,800
I was hired by a Gordon Bullet.

1048
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
-Hello.
-Julie.

1049
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,400
Hey, it's Spencer.

1050
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,700
I just wanted to, uh, call

1051
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,400
and say thanks.

1052
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,000
I had a great night.

1053
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I would assume so,
it's pretty late.

1054
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,400
I'll, uh, give you your cut
when you get back into town.

1055
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,400
My cut?

1056
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,100
Spencer, you pay
to join the service.

1057
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,400
Your date doesn't pay you.

1058
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,400
That... that's illegal.
You're not a gigolo.

1059
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,100
Right.

1060
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,500
Open phone line.

1061
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,600
Got it, my bad.

1062
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,300
Anyway, you got yourself
one satisfied customer.

1063
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,700
See ya.

1064
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,300
Spencer, wait...

1065
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,500
Spencer?

1066
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,300
I wish.

1067
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,600
But it's probably for the best.

1068
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,100
I am tin roof rusted.

1069
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,500
Pam.

1070
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,500
So you had a good night?

1071
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,800
Worth every penny.

1072
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,200
And I'll be telling
all my friends.

1073
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,200
And what will you be
telling them exactly?

1074
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,100
Okay, seven minutes are up.

1075
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,500
You said you wanted
to take it slow.

1076
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,600
Yeah, well, I don't think
eight minutes would be rushing.

1077
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,300
-Nine seems like a good pace.
-Mm-hmm.

1078
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,400
And ten is a nice,
round number.

1079
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,300
Mm, mm-hmm.

1080
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,500
We could try the
long-distance thing again.

1081
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,300
I've got a lot
of frequent-flier miles,

1082
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,800
and we survived
one semester apart.

1083
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah, barely.

1084
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,600
Why don't you move to Providence
with me and get a job.

1085
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,000
Oh, right. You'll be in school

1086
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and I'll be slinging
baba ganoush on Third Street,

1087
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,100
while all the kids are living
the life

1088
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,300
that I should be having.

1089
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,500
Well, you know, I've really
been enjoying home lately.

1090
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,400
Ryan's back and I've been
bonding with the Newpsies.

1091
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,600
Maybe, uh, I could put off

1092
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,700
RISD for a semester.

1093
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,500
We could both go back
together in the fall.

1094
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,400
You'd really put off
college for me?

1095
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,000
Rhode Island is a big place.

1096
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,300
Better we tackle it together.

1097
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,500
Cohen, Rhode Island's the
smallest state in the country.

1098
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,100
I was kidding.

1099
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,300
Right.

1100
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
There's just one more thing.

1101
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,800
This is Pancakes.

1102
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Pancakes is very
important to me.

1103
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,000
Then you can hold it.
I'm not really an animal person.

1104
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,100
Cohen, Pancakes is
my daughter, 

1105
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,900
or my son,
I'm not really sure.

1106
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,900
Oh...

1107
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,900
Oh, he's your son.

1108
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,700
He kind of looks
like you, Cohen.

1109
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,900
Feel how soft he is.

1110
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,700
Yeah.

1111
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,100
He's beautiful.

1112
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,500
Take a look around, Pancakes.

1113
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,100
This is your new home.

1114
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,000
