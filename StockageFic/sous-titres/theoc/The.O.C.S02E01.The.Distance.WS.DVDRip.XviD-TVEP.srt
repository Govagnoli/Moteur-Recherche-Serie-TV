1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,155
-Last season on The O.C.:
-Theresa's pregnant.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,878
-You don't have to leave.
-Then come with me.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,315
I'm leaving.
I can't let Theresa do this by herself.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,879
Oh, my God! It's a palace.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,679
Look, you're getting what you wanted.
I'm moving in with you.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,751
-You going somewhere?
-Like, say, San Quentin.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,911
-Thank you.
-Could we convince you to stay?

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,072
He's the first real friend I've ever had.
He's the only real friend I've ever had.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,312
I understand why you have to do this,
but I wish you didn't have to.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,870
Before he got here, I was the biggest
loser. This place was hell for me.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,918
I can't even imagine what
it's gonna be like here without him.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,510
So we've knocked down
the retaining wall...

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,274
-...to allow for more flow.
-Great. When do you think...

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,237
...we will have achieved flow?

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,516
When will we be done
tearing your house apart?

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,033
No, my house is torn apart.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,317
The construction's got nothing
to do with it. Ballpark, Archie.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,519
It's September now. I'd say two weeks.
A month tops.

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,558
-Six weeks.
-Well, in the meantime--

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,189
In the meantime,
could you please try to convince...

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,749
...the fellas here to wear something
in a shirt?

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,878
My neighbors have started to refer
to my home as "the manhole. "

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,792
-T oo Village People?
-Exactly.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,917
-I'll talk to my guys.
-Hey, Archie.

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,911
Sandy.

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,833
And don't ever get married.
And if you do, don't ever have kids.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,399
Well, good news. Archie thinks
the remodel should be done...

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,836
...anytime between now and....
Well, he didn't say never...

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,594
...but there was subtext.
I'd love some coffee.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,916
Thank you.
Boy, am I excited to head into court...

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,514
...for day one of this riveting
nuisance lawsuit...

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,513
...where one yacht owner
feels that this other yacht owner...

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,036
...is in violation of the noise ordinance
at Crystal Cove.

34
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,474
Butterscotch donkey, El Paso, lampshade,
truck stop, stethoscope--

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,835
I know you think
that l' m ignoring you...

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,436
...so you speak in gibberish
to see if I'm listening.

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,034
-You were listening.
-Nope.

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,875
I'm distracted by today's paper.
Actually, the date of today's paper.

39
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,793
-He's gonna come back.
-By the time school starts...

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,997
...or by the time Archie
finishes the remodel?

41
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,958
What do you want me to do?
Tie him up, stuff him in a trunk?

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,395
At this point? Y es.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,515
I have had enough of your hippie
parenting psychobabble.

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,114
So that's the problem.

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,430
It's not just smothering
overprotectiveness...

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,034
...that kept him from having a friend
until Ryan came.

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,953
Sometimes the best thing for a kid
is to have some space.

48
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,158
The Pacific Ocean?
That's not enough space?

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,999
If you force him to return,
he'll wanna run away again.

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,512
I don't care what he wants.

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,796
I don't care what he thinks is fair.

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,032
-He could have died out there.
-Okay, so you can blame me.

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,636
And he can blame us. And we can keep
passing the buck all summer long.

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,268
Summer is over. School is starting.

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,998
This is where he belongs.

56
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,516
-He's gonna figure that out.
-I'm tired of waiting for that.

57
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,512
Bring him home, Sandy.

58
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,159
Bring him home.

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,518
Could it be any hotter?

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,477
I feel like my flesh is melting.

61
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,995
I just hope it melts evenly.

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,349
Damn, girl. Break me off a piece of that.

63
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,716
He's totally checking you out.

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,834
So my mom's trying to drag me
to Cardio Barre again.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,831
It's her idea
of mother-daughter bonding.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,116
-Cardio Barre?
-She says it's the new Tae Bo...

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,068
-...so maybe I can learn to kick her ass.
-I don't think you need any more cardio.

68
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,876
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

69
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,272
It's just that-- Well, and I mean this
in the least scandalous way...

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,874
...but you're looking a little thin.

71
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,076
-I eat.
-Okay.

72
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,800
Oh, God. You definitely drink.

73
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,235
What's in this, lighter fluid?

74
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,636
This is a Newport Beach lced Tea.

75
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,394
This is 1 0:00 in the morning.
It's a little early.

76
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,153
For who?

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,392
This bikini is so uncomfortable.
I need to go get a new one.

78
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,312
-You wanna go to South Coast?
-Totally.

79
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,392
-There's a Paul Frank sale Wednesday.
-Wednesday? I can't.

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,199
-I have plans with Zach.
-More plans with Zach, huh?

81
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,512
Yes. The more time I spend with Zach,
the less time I have to think about....

82
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,150
God, what's-his-face.
Built like a beanpole, curly hair.

83
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,233
Runs away on a sailboat, leaving nothing
but a note for his girlfriend who cried...

84
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,757
...until July Fourth when she decided
she doesn't cry over bitches on boats.

85
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,354
Seth.

86
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,477
His name, it's Seth.

87
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,154
I know. I'm doing that thing
where I pretend I don't...

88
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,871
...and I have to use a lot of descriptive
insults to give voice to my inner pain.

89
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,673
So yeah, can't do it Wednesday.

90
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,114
More plans with Zach.

91
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,273
Well, it's a formality, really.
I refuse to get close to him.

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,829
I will never be close to a boy again.

93
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,590
Yeah, I know what you mean.

94
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,713
That's good.
All right, thanks for the ride.

95
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,711
Don't forget your lunch.

96
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,191
I peeled your orange for you.

97
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,673
Thanks, but it's probably not
the best way to fit in with these guys.

98
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,159
Right.

99
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,072
All right, well, I'll--

100
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,435
Yeah, you don't want
the foreman to get angry.

101
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,875
He's always angry. He's an angry man.

102
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,150
Maybe tonight we could rent a movie
or play pool or something.

103
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,958
Yeah. Pool sounds good.

104
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,799
See you.

105
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,910
Honey, I've got to pick up Kaitlin
from junior lifeguards.

106
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,117
Maybe she can save her sister
from drowning in self-pity.

107
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,477
What is that flower truck doing
in our driveway? I get the feeling...

108
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,438
-...that it's been there every week.
-Because it has.

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,840
We get flowers delivered every week?

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,150
Yes, Cal. They're living things.
They die.

111
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,875
Do you hear clicking on the phone? Every
time I dial out, I swear I hear a clicking.

112
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,270
Okay, Nixon. Paranoid much?

113
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,119
What's going on with you?
You're either hopped up on blow...

114
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,953
-...or something is seriously wrong.
-It's nothing.

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,792
It's my blood-thinning medication.

116
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,794
-Sometimes it makes me feel--
-Wacko? Like all summer long?

117
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,391
I'm taking Kaitlin
to go look at new ponies.

118
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,437
What's wrong with China?

119
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,149
China has alopecia.

120
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,592
I was hoping that the hair treatments
would work, but bald as a baby's ass.

121
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,877
It's just not right for a little girl
to love a hairless pony.

122
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,395
-I suppose that's fair.
-Thanks.

123
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,438
You're not charging that
on the company card, are you?

124
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,839
Why?

125
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,273
Because we can't claim Kaitlin's
new pony as a business expense.

126
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,510
-It's illegal.
-Oh, I know.

127
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,750
I was gonna put it on the black card.

128
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,512
Bye, sweetie.

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,870
Yeah, they're all done there.

130
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,477
-Hello?
-Luke, it's Kirsten.

131
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,279
Hey, Mrs. Cohen. How you doing?

132
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,749
Although I think I can answer that one
for myself.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,389
Yeah. Is he there?

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,433
It's for you.

135
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,590
-Hello?
-Seth. It's Mom.

136
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,432
Mom.

137
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
Blond, sharp Anglican features,
cute little nose?

138
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,439
Come home.

139
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,319
-Did Ryan come back?
-Seth Ezekiel--

140
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,074
Using the dreaded middle name
won't help to forge a bond.

141
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,753
This has gone on long enough.

142
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,597
Not yet. I signed up to teach
more sailing lessons through September.

143
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,955
-Portland needs me, Mother.
-So do l.

144
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,997
Here's the thing, though.

145
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,720
I hate it there. I'm never coming back
to Orange County.

146
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,395
If you and Dad want to move to,
say, anywhere else on the planet...

147
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,949
-...then we can talk.
-Here I was, crazy to think...

148
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,510
...that a simple appeal from a mother
to a son might get some traction.

149
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,796
Yeah, well, that is crazy. Bye.

150
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,190
So you're just gonna hang up on--?

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,390
-Gave in and called him, huh?
-He used to be such a sweet kid.

152
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,279
And he's turning out to be
quite the angry young man.

153
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,431
I had the same talk with him
this afternoon.

154
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,310
Doesn't he know that we didn't want
Ryan to leave any more than he did?

155
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,598
Well, right now it's--
It's not about what he knows.

156
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,830
It's about how he feels.

157
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,151
This house just seems so empty.

158
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,392
We're gonna have to rip up this floor
a little bit. Is that okay?

159
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,353
And yet so full.

160
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,153
Full of sweaty, shirtless men.

161
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,356
You'd think you'd be in heaven.

162
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,639
That's Jimmy.
I said we'd have dinner with him, but....

163
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,593
I'll talk to him.

164
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,318
Jimbo. How goes it?

165
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,392
It goes fantastic. You guys
still gonna join me and Hailey...

166
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,232
-...on the boat for dinner?
-No.

167
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,595
Kirsten's not feeling so great.

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,673
-Seth still won't come home, huh?
-No, he'll come home.

169
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,115
You know, he's got no real choice.

170
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,829
I'm just trying to figure out the best way
for him to realize that.

171
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,310
Well, if you're too tough on him, and you
bring him back kicking and screaming....

172
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,879
It'll only make things worse.

173
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,272
The last thing anybody wants is a bitter,
resentful teenager in the house.

174
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,077
He won't talk to me.
He won't talk to Kirsten.

175
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,118
Well, maybe there's somebody else
he'll talk to.

176
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,157
I wanted to ensure you weren't slacking
or trying to punch out early.

177
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,880
-I wish. How are you?
-Pretty good.

178
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,792
-You?
-That was real nice of Kirsten...

179
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,520
-...to send those baby clothes.
-Kirsten loves to shop.

180
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,069
-Even for the unborn.
-How's the remodel going?

181
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,228
A lot like this. A disaster.

182
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,632
-As long as it keeps her distracted, right?
-It's not really doing the trick anymore.

183
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,473
-Seth wants to stay in Portland?
-School is approaching...

184
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,155
...and everybody's digging in their heels,
holding their positions.

185
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,754
-So you going up there?
-Y eah, I've always liked Luke.

186
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,390
He's like a big golden retriever.

187
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,236
Actually, he kind of is.

188
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,158
You wanna come?

189
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,949
A one-two punch
might be more effective.

190
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,917
You and me...

191
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,991
...unbeatable combination.

192
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,671
He was pretty mad at me last time
I saw him.

193
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,513
-We haven't talked since.
-He's pretty mad at everybody.

194
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,672
I don't know.
Theresa's got some tests. I got work.

195
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,159
Well....

196
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,196
Just in case. Don't worry
if you don't use it. I got a great fare.

197
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,399
Good luck.

198
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,712
Take care, kid.

199
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,917
Breakfast is ready. My mom left early.

200
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,071
-There's plenty of food.
-Thanks.

201
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,159
-What's that?
-Nothing.

202
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,437
Sandy needed some help
convincing Seth to come home.

203
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,113
Is that why he came by yesterday?

204
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,350
-He said he was just checking in.
-Y eah.

205
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,159
No. I don't know.
I mean, Seth's still angry.

206
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,959
-I guess he blames his parents.
-For you leaving?

207
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,879
Yeah.

208
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,114
I can't imagine what he thinks about me.

209
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,031
So are you gonna go to Portland?

210
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,713
No, I can't.

211
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,276
-You should go if you wanna go.
-It's for them to figure out as a family.

212
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,359
-You're not part of their family?
-Not anymore.

213
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,272
I should get to work.

214
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,954
Hey, Cal.

215
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,272
Always a pleasure. Although, if I may,
why are we meeting in a parking garage?

216
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,431
Because my office might be bugged.

217
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,114
My home, your home.
Who knows what the feds are up to?

218
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,669
Wow, you've really flipped your noodle,
haven't you?

219
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,035
Hey, I could be wearing a wire.

220
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,430
You never know.
Sure you don't wanna frisk me?

221
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,797
-I don't have time for jokes.
-Nor do l. I gotta be at the airport...

222
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,234
...in half an hour.

223
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,356
-I'm heading up to Portland.
-To see Seth?

224
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,999
-Yeah.
-I don't get it.

225
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,916
His best friend leaves, so he runs off
with another boy and his gay dad.

226
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,230
You gotta admit
it sounds kind of strange.

227
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,231
This from a guy
who is one klick away...

228
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,356
...from wearing a wig
and a fake mustache.

229
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,548
-You think my paranoia is unfounded.
-It's entertaining, but entirely unfounded.

230
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,518
I haven't heard anything
from my friends at the DA's office.

231
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,070
That doesn't make sense. DA comes
to see me at the beginning of summer...

232
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,630
...tells me the sky is falling, and
he hasn't done a damn thing since.

233
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
Well, either they've realized
they got nothing...

234
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,439
...or they're building one hell of a case.

235
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,996
I got a plane to catch.

236
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,597
That looks just like....

237
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,115
Talk to her since
your Fourth of July blowout?

238
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,952
No. She stopped taking my calls...

239
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,998
...I stopped calling. She doesn't
understand it's not about her.

240
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,518
You've got some willpower
because she has a killer rack.

241
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,555
You guys missed the greatest
water-ski lesson ever.

242
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,837
This guy must have been 300 pounds,
and he wanted to drop his ski.

243
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,036
I've never seen a harder wipeout
in my life.

244
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,033
-He lost everything.
-lncluding his bathing suit.

245
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,749
-Hey, I'm sorry I missed that.
-Hey, what happened to you last night?

246
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,434
We went to Salty's,
and my lD finally worked.

247
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,353
-lt was so much fun.
-I don't know. I just wasn't up for it.

248
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,875
-Cohen had a little fight with his mom.
-Thank you.

249
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,396
-That was both honest and emasculating.
-Parents are turning up the heat?

250
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,313
I guess. It's time to tell them
about that homeschool plan.

251
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,392
I'm sure that'll go over really well.
We gotta get back out there.

252
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,879
Just wanted to share.

253
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,792
-All right, dude.
-All right.

254
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,552
Don't drown.

255
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,389
If you see any more naked fat guys,
be sure and let Luke know, okay?

256
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,998
He's so funny.

257
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,232
Dude. You need to close on Jane
before the summer's over.

258
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,709
I live here. So does she.
There's plenty of time.

259
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,199
Whatever you say.

260
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,556
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Dad. What time's dinner?

261
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,270
Half an hour. And we have a guest.

262
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,679
Hi. Sandy Cohen.

263
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,634
-Hey.
-Hey.

264
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,314
-New car?
-Yeah. My mom gave it to me.

265
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,070
-It's my getaway car.
-Not without me.

266
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,719
Thank you, you guys, for coming.

267
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,678
Hailey is stuck at work,
but we're happy to keep you company.

268
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,674
Yeah, being in the house by yourself
isn't as wonderful as I had fantasized.

269
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,229
So have you talked to Seth or Ryan?

270
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,279
I talked at Seth,
if it qualifies as a conversation.

271
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,158
Sandy saw Ryan last night.

272
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,311
-He seems to be doing well.
-That's good.

273
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,471
Do you guys still talk?

274
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,872
Yeah, not really. We used to...

275
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,508
...but it just sort of
made everything harder.

276
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,636
See? A kid doesn't need
to be in Portland to be distant.

277
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,351
So the last I heard, you were opening
a restaurant. How's that going?

278
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,274
Well, it didn't happen. It's a long story.

279
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,000
But, hey, there's plenty
of good restaurants in Newport.

280
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,755
I thought you said Newport's restaurants
were overpriced and over-sauced.

281
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,953
I have this thing about sauces.

282
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,795
Less is more.
So are you excited about school or--?

283
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,359
It's gonna be a little weird.

284
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,990
I gotta meet all the new kids, and
they don't have a water polo team.

285
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,674
Hey. Some would call that heaven.

286
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,276
Harbor School just broke ground
on the new gym. It should be beautiful.

287
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,113
Are you working
for the tourism board now?

288
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,999
Watch your mouth.
I was trying to be polite.

289
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,593
-You should try it.
-No, thanks.

290
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,591
-I'd rather be honest.
-You want honesty?

291
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,751
-Yeah.
-Let's talk about the spoiled brat...

292
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,388
...whose parents bust their asses
to make sure...

293
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,278
...he's happy.
How does he repay them?

294
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,759
-This isn't about you.
-lt is.

295
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,275
You're killing your mother,
and she is killing me.

296
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,671
You can't spend my entire life telling me
what's wrong with Newport...

297
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,114
...and expect me to go back.

298
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,191
-You can't do that.
-Newport is your home.

299
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,113
Like it or not. When you're 1 8
and you've saved up money...

300
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,431
...you can leave the parents you resent
and the town you loathe.

301
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,919
You let Ryan go. Why not me?

302
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,753
We invited Ryan into our home.
You don't get that choice.

303
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,833
But you didn't even try and stop him. I
mean, you didn't even make an attempt.

304
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,918
-Ryan had to do what he had to do.
-Okay, well, so do l.

305
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,633
Hello?

306
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,191
Hello? Who is this?

307
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,954
-Morning. You want some coffee?
-Please. Yeah.

308
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,712
I make it kind of strong.

309
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,792
Anything this side of motor oil.
I didn't sleep at all.

310
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,952
I'm sorry about
our little family drama last night.

311
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,509
He's a good kid, Sandy.
He's a smart kid.

312
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,755
-He's too smart.
-When is it that kids get all the power?

313
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,469
They've always had the power.
When they're 2 years old...

314
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,916
...you're running after them, trying
to make sure they don't get hurt.

315
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,594
Well, this is the teenage version of that.

316
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,597
-Carson. Father.
-Son.

317
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,270
I'm gonna go see what Luke wants
for breakfast.

318
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,948
I believe that was an excuse
to leave us to round two.

319
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,031
There is no round two.

320
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,789
-I'm backing your play.
-What?

321
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,270
-ls this, like, a Jedi mind trick or--?
-No, l--

322
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,874
I thought about what you said last night.

323
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,031
I don't know what else to do.

324
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,749
If this is really where you wanna be,
I can't force you to come back.

325
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,151
-So you're letting me stay?
-Well, at least I know you're safe here.

326
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,595
It's better than dragging you home...

327
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,797
...so then the next time you run away,
you might not leave a note.

328
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,757
You might not call.

329
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,276
Well, thank you.

330
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,512
Thank you. You know, I'm really sorry
to drag you all the way up here.

331
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,514
-lt was worth it just to see you.
-Yeah, you too.

332
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,518
So look, you know that I left home
when I was your age, and....

333
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,990
And I wanna say to you...

334
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,630
...what I wish my parents
had said to me.

335
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,993
We love you.

336
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,990
-And the door is always open.
-Yeah, I know. I know.

337
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,791
All right. Sailing lesson at 1 0.
I gotta go.

338
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,996
-All right.
-Thanks.

339
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,553
-Take care of yourself, huh?
-Yeah, bye.

340
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,311
Hey. So we should probably leave
in a half-hour.

341
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,278
-I don't work Saturdays.
-No, my doctor's appointment.

342
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,312
-Right.
-You forgot?

343
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,675
No, no, l....

344
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,954
Yeah, I forgot. Sorry.

345
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,674
-What's with the bag?
-I was gonna go to Portland...

346
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,319
...actually.

347
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,789
Before I remembered
your doctor's appointment.

348
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,678
-Except you didn't remember.
-I've been to every appointment.

349
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,118
-What are you saying? I don't care?
-No, it's just plane tickets showing up.

350
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,669
Phone calls in the middle of the night.

351
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,236
What's going on?

352
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,630
I left Newport to make life easier
for everyone.

353
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,873
It seems like all I did
was make everything more complicated.

354
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,798
That's funny.

355
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,833
I thought you left Newport
to be with me.

356
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,839
I did.

357
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,591
All right?
I just gotta make things right with Seth.

358
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,075
Why? It's not like you abandoned him.

359
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,593
Actually, it kind of is.

360
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,038
I just-- I just took off.
I didn't really talk to him about it. I....

361
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,479
I'm only going to Portland. Are you afraid
I'm gonna lose my construction job?

362
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,278
It's just a checkup.

363
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,752
It'll be a lot of sitting around, reading
old TV Guides, listening to bad Muzak.

364
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,310
My mom loves that stuff.

365
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,833
You sure?

366
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,759
Yeah.

367
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,639
All right.

368
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,679
I gotta run.

369
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,678
Marissa.

370
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,989
Marissa, you're not even ready.

371
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,710
Take your headphones off.

372
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,713
I said, take your headphones off.

373
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,798
I was listening to that, Mom.

374
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,430
We were supposed to leave
for Cardio Barre 1 5 minutes ago.

375
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,790
Oh, right.

376
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,996
Sorry.

377
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,073
Fine. I'm taking this away,
and you're grounded.

378
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,708
What are you talking about?
You can't ground me.

379
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,429
I most certainly can because I won't
spend another minute living like this.

380
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,239
All summer, you've ignored me,
acting like I don't exist.

381
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,072
I wish.

382
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,992
What did you say?

383
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,430
Why do we have to keep doing this?
Honey...

384
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,479
...instead of shutting me out,
just tell me what's bothering you.

385
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,876
You really want to know
what's bothering me?

386
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,349
Do you? Do you really wanna know
what's on my mind?

387
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,794
Yes.

388
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,278
Okay, thanks for the heads-up, Otis.
I'm gonna talk to Caleb...

389
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,273
-...as soon as I get back into town.
-Sandy. Cab's here.

390
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,237
All right, thanks.

391
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,077
I had a feeling I'd see you here.

392
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,118
-What, are you leaving?
-I took my shot.

393
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,759
Good luck.

394
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,238
And thanks.

395
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,239
Summer. Hello.

396
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,709
Hey, Mrs. Cohen. Can I come in?

397
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,111
Sure. Is everything okay?

398
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,596
-I'm here to get over Seth.
-Excuse me?

399
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,354
My therapist said the best way
to move on in my life...

400
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,354
...is to divest myself
of all of Seth's material possessions.

401
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,678
-I gotta dump off a bunch of his crap.
-Oh, right. Got it.

402
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,879
My therapist said it's my best chance at
ever again vibrating at a high frequency.

403
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,508
-Vibrating at a high frequency?
-Lynn Grabhorn?

404
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,593
Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting.

405
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,558
Humans have an electrochemical
currency running through us...

406
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,429
...which is affected by our emotions.
When you are feeling happy or joyful...

407
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,398
...that current, or energy,
vibrates at a higher frequency...

408
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,996
...than when you are feeling
sad or angry at, let's say, Seth Cohen.

409
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,755
When you're at a high frequency, you're
more likely to attract happy people...

410
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,992
...than when you vibrate at a low,
sad, bitter-at-Cohen frequency.

411
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,674
It's the law of attraction in physics.

412
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,313
You know where his room is.

413
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,239
-Thanks.
-Summer, for the record...

414
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,234
...if he wasn't my son,
I'd do the same thing.

415
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,912
I hope we can still be friends.

416
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,911
What do you say?
First up, Madden Football.

417
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,355
Dude, when are you gonna give up
the sports games?

418
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,829
Why would I do that?
Hey, Dad, is dinner ready yet?

419
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,798
Got the grill going,
and we've got another guest.

420
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,394
Yeah, who is it this time? My mom?

421
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,277
-You, I would not have guessed.
-What's going on, Chino?

422
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,317
How are you guys?

423
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,152
You know, good.

424
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,999
I'm sure you're probably here
to do my father's bidding.

425
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,720
But you might as well
stay for a burger, right?

426
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,233
Yeah.

427
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,999
Hey, man.

428
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,831
-Hey.
-So you learned how to work a grill.

429
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,912
-You got a step up on your mom.
-I've learned a lot this summer.

430
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,389
Portland seems nice.
From the airplane, anyway.

431
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,757
Yeah, it's awesome. Real people,
real weather. Cute girls too.

432
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,950
-So you and Summer....
-Not so good, actually.

433
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,953
She'll.... She'll probably
never speak to me again.

434
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,634
It's probably best she moves on, though.
I don't think...

435
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,837
...we're gonna be seeing too much
of each other. I live here now.

436
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,274
Listen, I'm sorry if l--

437
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,829
-lf I caused--
-Dude, honestly, stop.

438
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,356
You did not make me leave Newport,
okay? If anything, the truth is...

439
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,353
...you probably made me stay
a year longer than I should have.

440
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,080
Honestly. Like, boarding school,
Portland, whatever.

441
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,755
I was out of there sooner or later.
Me and the O.C. are a truly beatable...

442
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,673
-...combination.
-Well, it's still a pretty big deal.

443
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,752
-Dropping out of school, moving here.
-lt used to be normal...

444
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,832
...for teenagers to board
tramp steamers and travel the country.

445
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,956
The Depression.
They were looking for work.

446
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,917
Hobos are hot again.

447
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,674
So there's no chance
of you going back to Newport?

448
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,159
Are you?

449
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,516
Well, then, you know....

450
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,071
Yeah, but, Seth, I can't.

451
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,916
Neither can l.

452
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,832
I've gotta admit, Jules,
you've done well for yourself.

453
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,434
-It's all you've wanted.
-Careful what you wish for.

454
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,558
Thanks. So, what's the matter?
What's going on?

455
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,030
Aside from our daughter being the spawn
of Chucky and Keith Moon?

456
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,919
She is definitely going through
a hard time right now.

457
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,869
Jimmy, you have no idea
the level-four meltdown...

458
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,634
...I witnessed.
There was lawn furniture in the pool.

459
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,394
-Sounds like it constitutes a level-five.
-Sad part is...

460
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,711
...it's the most honest conversation
we've had yet.

461
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,156
Thank God Kaitlin's going
to boarding school.

462
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,833
This is no place for a child.

463
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,515
Marissa, however, will be seriously
screwed up for the rest of her life.

464
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,238
Permanent damage, Jimmy.

465
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,470
-Unless we do something.
-Like what?

466
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,234
Give her some semblance
of a normal family dynamic.

467
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,029
Maybe Sunday dinners
you can come over here with....

468
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,475
-Hailey?
-Right, right.

469
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,079
-You two are still...?
-Yeah, we're great. She's fantastic.

470
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,629
Sweet. Limber.

471
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,837
-How about you and Caleb?
-Not so limber.

472
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,958
I'll help. The best I can. Okay?

473
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,557
Thank you. And for the record,
I am happy for you.

474
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:37,159
For the record, I don't believe you,
but for Marissa's sake, I'll pretend to.

475
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,276
I can't believe you talked to the DA's
office yesterday and to me only now.

476
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,476
I was trying to bring
your grandson home.

477
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,110
-He's staying. Thanks for asking.
-He's staying?

478
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,475
Want me to talk to him?
I can be quite persuasive.

479
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,757
You better rest up. And stockpile
some of that persuasiveness.

480
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,990
Why? What did the DA say?

481
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,630
The clouds have gathered, Cal.
It's about to rain down on you.

482
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,759
On all of us. So put your storm
windows in, if you know what I mean.

483
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,797
-That bad, huh?
-Get your house in order.

484
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,669
The Newport Group. The family.
Do it soon.

485
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,759
Come on, Chino. Try and hurt me.

486
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,638
Make me feel pain.

487
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,995
-Wound me.
-Think of all the money Luke saves...

488
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,755
-...on therapy playing these games.
-I think he should still consider therapy.

489
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,194
You're gonna pay for that.

490
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,510
Ryan. Telephone.

491
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,275
-Good luck.
-I'll wait here.

492
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,475
Okay. Here we go.

493
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,993
-Hello.
-Ryan?

494
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,832
Hi. What's wrong?

495
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,953
I went to the doctor's for the checkup.

496
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,069
And they couldn't find a heartbeat.

497
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,794
I lost the baby, Ryan. I guess in the first
couple months this can happen.

498
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,633
Okay. Okay, I'm coming back.

499
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,553
-I'm getting on the next flight, and....
-No.

500
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,791
-What?
-I think...

501
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,349
...that maybe we should see this
as a sign.

502
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,675
You know, I think it's a sign.

503
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,600
Ryan, you're not happy with me.

504
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,316
You haven't been happy.

505
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,751
The only reason you've stayed
is because of this baby.

506
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,437
And now there isn't a baby.

507
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,513
You don't want me to come home.

508
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,790
You don't wanna come home.

509
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,869
Is this your battleground? Is this your...?

510
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,917
Hey, everything all right?

511
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,634
Theresa lost the baby.

512
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,037
Did you tell him?

513
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,717
Did he believe you?

514
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,031
Yeah, I think so.

515
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,630
It's for the best.
For you and him and for the baby.

516
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,791
What time's your cab get here?

517
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,918
Any minute.

518
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,234
-What are you gonna do now?
-I don't know.

519
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,359
Get my stuff out of Theresa's,
and then I'm homeless again.

520
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,314
Have I sold you
on the wonders of Portland?

521
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,072
We could take our show on the road.

522
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,678
I can't impose. Besides, I got this job.
It pays pretty well, so....

523
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,432
I'll figure something out.

524
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,955
-What about you, man?
-You know.

525
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,839
Just keep teaching sailing,
hang with Luke.

526
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,470
His dad's dating someone new,
so that should be interesting.

527
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,954
Sounds fun.

528
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,954
Plus, you know, my parents are kind of
okay with this now, so it's good...

529
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,192
-...because I don't have to feel guilty....
-That's great, man.

530
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,232
Yeah, it's awesome.

531
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,714
It's awesome.

532
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,356
Chino, your cab's here.

533
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,471
All right, well...

534
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,197
...guess this is it.

535
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,437
Yeah, don't be a stranger.

536
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,514
All right.

537
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,159
See you.

538
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,788
-Hey, so I was thinking--
-I was thinking too.

539
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,954
You know, they don't even have
a water polo team here.

540
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,429
That's just gonna be a problem for me.

541
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,713
-We don't have to hug or anything?
-No.

542
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,757
Okay, come on in.

543
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,948
I kind of like eating
amongst the furniture. It's....

544
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,712
It's cozy.

545
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,078
So we leave for three months,
you tear the whole place apart.

546
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,514
You're back?

547
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,912
There was a two-for-one special...

548
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,913
-...on brooding young men.
-Are you coming back too?

549
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,878
Yeah, yeah. It's a long story,
but I figure this is where I belong, so....

550
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,473
Yeah.

551
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,432
What he said.

552
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,637
Good. Because nobody leaves
this family twice.

553
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,628
-Welcome home.
-Thanks.

554
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,269
Hey. What's going on?

555
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,918
All right.

556
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,478
-So? Good to be back?
-Yeah. Yeah, it is.

557
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,914
You?

558
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,835
My room felt so much smaller to me.

559
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,754
I don't know. Or perhaps I have grown
quite a bit in the last few months.

560
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,396
Summer had been there. She dumped
everything that reminded her of me...

561
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,950
-...so that should be fun come Monday.
-Y eah, Monday's gonna suck.

562
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,112
Do you need anything?
Want me to...

563
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,635
...fire up the grill? Because, Ryan...

564
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,916
-...I can do that.
-No, I'm good. I'm good.

565
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,548
-Tired, but good.
-Well, then.

566
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,837
Hey, wait, wait. How did you make
it all the way to Portland...

567
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,434
...from Newport in that little catamaran?

568
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,798
Well, Ryan, sit down, my son.
It was a long and torturous journey...

569
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,118
...and I'm not gonna sugarcoat
any of the details for you.

570
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,396
-Please don't.
-Because we're friends.

571
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,553
First...

572
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,914
...I sailed to Catalina.

573
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,876
Then I sailed to Santa Barbara.

574
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,430
Santa Barbara, I ran out of snacks,
freaked out a little bit...

575
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,797
...pawned my boat for cash,
took a Greyhound to Portland.

576
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,554
-T ook a bus?
-But don't say it like that. It was a local.

577
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,269
Okay, have you ever been on one
of those? Not for the faint of heart.

578
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,476
Can't believe after all that,
you took a bus.

579
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,349
We should come up with a better story
for school, though. That'd be good.

580
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,990
-No, no, I like the bus idea. It's cool.
-Okay, but what about maybe...?

581
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,394
Boat sank, saved by whales.
It's very Whale Rider.

582
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,834
What else you got?

583
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,515
I took the boat. The boat sank.
Saved by a mermaid.

584
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,919
The boat sank. Stranded on
a desert island. Volleyball....
