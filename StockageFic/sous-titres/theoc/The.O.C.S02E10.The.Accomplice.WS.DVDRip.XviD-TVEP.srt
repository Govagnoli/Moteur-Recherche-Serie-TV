1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,834
Previously on The O. C. :

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,434
Ryan, have you seen...? Lindsay.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,359
Hi.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,796
My ex is in town,
but we never really broke up.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,075
Did you meet the ex?

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,310
-I know you did.
-All right. Y es, I did.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,118
-And who is he?
-He's a she.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,952
-Jody went to sleep.
-Cool.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,716
-So, what do I do?
-What do you wanna do?

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,395
What I wanna do is drive over to her
apartment now and ask her flat out:

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,551
"Alex, are we in a relationship...

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,517
-...or not? "
-Good. You should do it.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,989
-He's not doing it.
-It's been almost a week, okay?

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,789
I still don't know where Alex stands.
Is she back together with her lesbian ex?

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,599
If so, are they open
to some sort of ménage à three-way...

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,672
-...as in the film Summer Lovers?
-I didn't even think of that.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,637
Yeah, well, I did. Quite a bit.

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,995
If you have to wonder,
it probably won't happen.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,709
Which part?
The threesome or the relationship?

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,998
So you never had a moment's doubt
about you and Lindsay?

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,630
-Not really.
-Denial. Is there pollen or something?

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,836
All right, there may have been
a moment.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,274
Or two.

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,352
-So, what'd you do?
-He showed up on Lindsay's doorstep...

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,990
...and he said he's not going anywhere
until she gave him a shot.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,869
That's what you should do. You should
go to Alex, but instead of asking her...

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,996
...what she wants,
tell her what you want.

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,154
Is that how it works
with you and Summer?

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,517
Or you should just focus
on the good stuff in your life.

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,557
Like school.

31
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,357
Or comics.

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,394
-Yeah, I got nothing.
-At least I've got my friends.

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,959
Yeah.

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,872
Well, if it isn't the Three Amigos.

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,314
Hi.

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,797
I'm so hungry. The step-monster
keeps raiding my Zone breakfasts.

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,633
-Hey. You didn't order yet, did you?
-Hey.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,472
No, you're just in time.

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,039
Thanks.

40
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,597
Hey, come on. We can squeeze you in.

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,555
-It's okay. I'm gonna see you later.
-Oh, no, no, no. Where are you going?

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,312
To get what I want.

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,880
"Husband seeking to satisfy
wife's curiosity.

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,350
Enjoys tall--" Careful.

45
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,590
Here's one, honey. It's a guesthouse.
Close to the beach.

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,069
It's got parking, fridge and hookups.

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,435
Why look for a guesthouse
instead of an office?

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,512
A guesthouse can be a great office.
Plus, this one has hookups.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,070
This high-rise office complex has
panoramic ocean and country-club views.

50
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,629
Sounds like Partridge, Savage
and Kahn. Where is it?

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,837
Next to Partridge, Savage and Kahn.
Your old clients can find you.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,468
I'm not taking
any of my corporate clients with me.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,269
I'm returning to public-interest stuff.
That stuff made me want to be a lawyer.

54
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,750
You can still be a public-interest lawyer
in a private-sector office.

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,196
This guesthouse is 850 a month.
Yours is?

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,430
-I can get a deal through work.
-No, thanks.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,116
Well, I gotta go meet my realtor.

58
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,714
-Maybe I should go with you.
-No, no. I'll be fine.

59
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,235
It's the same lady who got Jimmy
his bachelor pad.

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,279
Right.

61
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,158
I'm going with you.

62
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,112
Marissa.

63
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,919
What are you doing in here?

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,593
I'm sorry. I heard the music.

65
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,354
-You're not at school.
-Yeah, you're not at work.

66
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,717
Yeah, I know. I'm running late.
I'm down to my last clean shirt.

67
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,792
We're out of coffee. When your mom
is away, my life falls apart.

68
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,997
Yeah, you should have gone too.
You seem like you need a vacation.

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,879
She's not on vacation.
She's doing research for a magazine.

70
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,719
In Europe, researching
for a magazine about Orange County?

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,150
Do you need a ride to school?

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,958
I'm not going. I'm not feeling so well.

73
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,713
I'm sorry to hear that.

74
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,668
I'll tell you what. I'll call my physician,
have him drop in on you after lunch.

75
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,079
That's okay. I figured I should
just stay home and rest...

76
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,233
...in case, you know,
it's West Nile or something.

77
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,518
All right. I'll be in my office all day if you
need me. I'll call in and check up on you.

78
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,753
I may not pick up, you know.
I'll just be sleeping.

79
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,510
-Hello?
-So, what are we doing today?

80
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,194
-I'm sleeping.
-No, you're not.

81
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,158
We're going to breakfast,
and then we're going shopping.

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,594
Don't you have school?

83
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,957
Yeah, but my mom's in Europe,
and my stepdad's completely clueless.

84
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,432
Aren't you sick of me yet?
We've hung out every day this week.

85
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,113
No. Why? Are you sick of me?

86
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,911
No, no, of course not. It's just...

87
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,639
...Jody's still here.

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,477
-I thought she was going back to L.A.
-Yeah, yeah, she was, she was...

89
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,111
...but we got into this huge fight,
and then....

90
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,078
And then you spent the rest of the night
making up?

91
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,310
Who's knocking on my door
at 9 in the morning?

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,959
Yeah, right. Saved by the bell.

93
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,634
Are you calling me
from outside my door?

94
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,234
Because that would be...

95
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,038
...creepy.

96
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,191
-Good to see you too, Alex.
-Seth.

97
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,550
-Seth?
-Can I call you back?

98
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,873
-Doesn't anyone go to school anymore?
-Listen, I'm sorry to wake you. I--

99
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,035
-Do I hear water running?
-Yes.

100
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,318
Jody's taking a shower.

101
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,835
Jody. Jody's still here.

102
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,189
That's great. That's fantastic. At least
you're not taking a shower together.

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,314
-Look--
-I just need to know where I stand.

104
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,472
Seth, I told you. I just--
I don't do relationships.

105
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,517
Yeah, well, you did Jody. So to speak.

106
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,511
Yes, and look how well that turned out.

107
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,557
What is that supposed to mean?

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,075
-Jody.
-Seth.

109
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,470
Sorry. I would have introduced you guys,
but I didn't want you to meet.

110
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,039
I'm going back to bed.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

111
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,517
You maybe wanna grab breakfast?
We could go down to the....

112
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,395
--which you see in the center
of the diagram here and multi-angle here.

113
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,074
Okay? All right, see you next time.

114
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,471
So are Kirsten and Sandy gonna care
that Seth skipped first period?

115
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,949
They won't be excited,
but they're easygoing.

116
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,439
Really? Kirsten is?

117
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,238
Sandy is. Kirsten's more....

118
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,472
-Like her dad.
-ln some ways, I guess.

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,359
Am l?

120
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,710
I mean, he's my dad too, so....

121
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,154
Is this a trick question?

122
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,632
No. It's just I don't know him,
and you do, so....

123
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,030
Why? Is he a monster?

124
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,909
Well, he's not the greatest person
in the world. To me anyway.

125
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,995
He thinks I'm after the Cohens' money.
Yeah, I know.

126
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,233
But other than that, he's great.
You should call him.

127
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,949
And say what? "Hi. It's your illegitimate
daughter. Wanna have lunch? "

128
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,552
-You could have Kirsten ask him for you.
-Yeah, she has. Couple times.

129
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,712
So he'll call, right? I mean--
I mean, he's got to, sooner or later.

130
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,950
Yeah, right, sooner or later.

131
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,359
At the moment, this is
the only beach-adjacent property...

132
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,988
...we have in your price range,
Mr. Cohen.

133
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,871
As you can see,
it's a bit of a fixer-upper.

134
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,434
That's one way to put it.

135
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,910
Who are you kidding, Gail?
This place is a first-class dump.

136
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,552
And I like it.

137
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,994
Sandy, no, you don't.

138
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,754
You just want to have an office
near the beach...

139
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,798
-...so you can surf between clients.
-I hadn't thought of that.

140
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,076
Sandy, this is a surf shack,
not a law office.

141
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,038
That's exactly why I like it. Hello?

142
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,875
Max? Unbelievable. How are you?
It's my professor from law school.

143
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,679
Now's a great time.
I'm just moving into my new office.

144
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,793
I'll be right back.

145
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,431
-Sandy. You're moving in?
-I'll take it.

146
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,477
So, what are you doing in town?

147
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,037
Really? Everything okay?

148
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,710
I understand.
We can talk about it when you get here.

149
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,192
What's up with Cohen?

150
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,998
I guess it didn't go well with Alex.

151
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,310
-She broke up with him?
-I don't know. Maybe.

152
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,916
Well, why don't you go find out.
And then report back to me.

153
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,996
So how'd it go?

154
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,949
The good news is, she told Jody
to get the hell out too, so....

155
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,239
I'm sorry, man.

156
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,630
-Thanks. It's all right.
-Now you can get back...

157
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,360
-...to your life, right?
-I don't have a life, remember?

158
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,795
Then you should get one.
Do something for you.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,718
-Go sailing.
-All right.

160
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,633
-Continue to doodle.
-Okay.

161
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,712
-This is what you should be doing.
-What?

162
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,111
Drawing the women who wronged me
as whip-wielding warrior princesses?

163
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,236
-Yeah, in your own comic.
-Yeah, okay.

164
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,231
-Dude, you're awesome.
-I appreciate it.

165
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,916
Hey, Cohen, I got you a double latte
because you looked sad.

166
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,116
-Thanks.
-Cohen's gonna do his own comic.

167
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,191
-He is?
-No, I don't-- Well, I don't know.

168
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,920
What are you talking about?
Do you not wanna do it?

169
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,072
-No, I do, sort of.
-Then let's bounce some ideas around.

170
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,390
-Study hall, right now. Let's go.
-All right.

171
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,711
-Thanks for the coffee, Summer.
-Yeah, thank you very much.

172
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,434
You're welcome.

173
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,154
So you and Seth are...?

174
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,756
Friends. I hope. Someday.

175
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,836
-And you and Jody are...?
-Over. Finished. For good.

176
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,357
Really? How does she feel about that?

177
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,838
She hates me now, but, I mean, we
mean too much to each other to let....

178
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,637
That bitch. She stole my necklace.

179
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,109
-Which one?
-We bought each other these matching...

180
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,158
...heart-shaped necklaces,
like, a year ago, and mine's gone.

181
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,833
I can't believe her.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,912
-How do you know she took it?
-Because she was using the fact...

183
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,312
...that I still wear mine as a sign that
I'm not over her, which I am. I just....

184
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,119
I loved it.

185
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,029
Well, so let's go get it.

186
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,475
You wanna go to L.A.? Now?

187
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,951
-I can't. I have work.
-We'll go tomorrow.

188
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,951
-How? You have school.
-No.

189
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,678
I have a mom who's spa-hopping...

190
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,116
...and a stepdad who doesn't care
about anyone but himself.

191
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,240
Come on.
You can't let her steal your heart.

192
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,879
At the tone, leave a message
for Julie, Caleb or Marissa.

193
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,429
We 'll get back to you
as soon as we can.

194
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,957
-Kirsten's not here.
-l' m actually here to see you.

195
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,633
-lf you have a second.
-I don't.

196
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,958
It's about Lindsay.

197
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,038
Shut the door.

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,560
-What about her?
-She's been asking questions about you.

199
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,315
Who you are, what you're like. I told her.
She still wants to get to know you.

200
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,159
She sent you to tell me this?

201
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,199
She has no idea I'm here.
I just thought maybe I should--

202
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,796
Continue to position yourself between
me and members of my family.

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,753
If I wanted a relationship with Lindsay,
I would have one.

204
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,831
-Funny. That's what she said.
-Smart girl.

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,513
You have no idea.

206
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,358
You should, though.

207
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,593
How's your relationship
with your father, Ryan?

208
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,432
Is he still in jail?

209
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,628
And you would be, too,
if it weren't for Sandy.

210
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,634
So I guess Lindsay and I are both better
off. Thank you so much for your time.

211
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,114
I was under the impression
that you'd become a successful lawyer.

212
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,636
Oh, my God.

213
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,998
How are you, Max?

214
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,830
It's hard to believe it's been 20 years
since you were my favorite student.

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,358
It is so good to see you. Well,
come on in to my-- My new office.

216
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,916
So, what have you been up to?

217
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,789
Well, l-- Let's see, l-- I left Berkeley.

218
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,552
I moved to Princeton.

219
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,190
-I am retired now.
-Congratulations.

220
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,234
So, what brings you here?

221
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,551
Sandy, I need your help.

222
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,751
I have to find Rebecca.

223
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,473
Why now? After all this time?

224
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,189
Well, Sandy, I've....
I've had a couple of strokes.

225
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,271
The doctors told me...

226
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,468
...that I should get my affairs in order
as soon as possible.

227
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,919
I just wanna be able to see
my daughter once again before....

228
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,839
I understand.

229
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,715
Well, you know, I haven't heard a thing
since she ran away to Canada...

230
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,559
...22 years ago.

231
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,393
-You haven't heard from her?
-No, no, no. She and l...

232
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,430
...weren't exactly on speaking terms,
even before the accident.

233
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,391
I just thought that if she'd get in touch
with anybody, Sandy, it'd be you.

234
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,357
You were the love of her life.

235
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,996
That was a long time ago.

236
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,031
-We were kids.
-No, she loved you, Sandy.

237
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,836
Now, will you help me find her?

238
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,230
I'll see what I can do.

239
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,076
Thank you, Sandy.

240
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,234
You know, I hate to stir up things when
you have a wife and a family and--

241
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,994
No, my wife will understand.

242
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,639
Will she?

243
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,431
-You're going to prison?
-Just for the day.

244
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,114
I have to drive to Lompoc
to see a prisoner there.

245
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,077
-Who?
-An activist I knew...

246
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,310
...back in my Berkeley days,
Joe Zukoski.

247
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,754
I'll be back before dinner.

248
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,310
-What do you have to talk to him about?
-Well, you know, a missing person.

249
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,199
-Doing a favor for a friend.
-Your old law school professor.

250
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,238
-Yeah.
-Who's missing?

251
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,068
-Rebecca.
-As in Rebecca Bloom?

252
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,629
-Love of your life?
-She is not the love of my life.

253
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,156
-Sandy, you were engaged to be married.
-We were engaged to be engaged.

254
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,550
Until she burned down a nuclear lab site.

255
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,517
We don't know if she did that for sure.

256
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,992
-Sandy, she fled the country.
-Well, I know, but her dad is dying...

257
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,630
...and he asked me to find her for him.
He was my mentor in law school.

258
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,995
I wouldn't be a lawyer
if it weren't for him.

259
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,515
-I can't say no.
-What will you do when you find her?

260
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,591
If I find her, I'll try convincing her...

261
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,548
...to turn herself in and, you know,
let the case go to trial.

262
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,035
Well, seems someone's
feeling better today.

263
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,668
-Not really.
-Sorry to hear that.

264
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,518
I called several times to check up...

265
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,910
-...on you yesterday.
-I must have been asleep.

266
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,832
Then I came home,
and you weren't here.

267
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,555
-I was worried.
-Gotta go.

268
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,995
-Where?
-Out. To the doctor.

269
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,799
-Marissa, come back here.
-Or what?

270
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,997
You're not my dad. You know what?
If you want to parent someone...

271
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,232
...why don't you go over
to Lindsay's house and ruin her life.

272
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,830
That's right, you already have.

273
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,672
Don't wait up.

274
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,478
So, what's it about?

275
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,912
Heroes and, you know, villains.

276
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,559
-Good and evil.
-Sure.

277
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,312
Darkness, and then you have light.

278
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,516
-You guys have no idea, do you?
-Not so much.

279
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,877
But you have to admit, it's pretty
exciting. Our very own comic book.

280
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,670
-Hey. It could be autobiographical.
-Yeah, it could.

281
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,799
Yeah, the life of, like, a young Jewish
boy growing up in Orange County.

282
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,918
-I like it very much already.
-A young Jewish boy with powers.

283
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,513
Sure. A kid with a secret.

284
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,319
-ln a town full of secrets.
-Fistfights, fashion shows.

285
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,074
-Basically, life in Orange County.
-But with powers.

286
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,958
I like it a lot, and--

287
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,869
-What have you done to my boyfriend?
-Look, it was his idea in the first place.

288
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,315
-We just had a major breakthrough.
-Y eah, we did.

289
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,277
You realize how lame you just sounded?

290
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,519
Now, now, Summer, if you're not nice,
somebody's not gonna be in the comic.

291
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,519
Yeah. Shaking in my boots, Cohen.

292
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,713
Sweetie.
I will see you out front after school.

293
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,675
Actually, we're working after school.

294
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,669
But I would love to, you know,
hang out with you a little bit later.

295
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,276
Perhaps dinner and a movie?

296
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,670
Well, I guess.
Just not a comic-book movie.

297
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,072
-Comic-book movies suck anyways.
-True.

298
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,232
-Dude, you didn't like X2? Really?
-I've seen better.

299
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,868
What have you done to him?
I swear to God, Cohen...

300
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,838
...if Brainstorming Boy
doesn't turn back into my boyfriend--

301
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,310
-Brainstorming Boy. Brainstorming Lad.
-Brainstorm.

302
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,630
Let's work with this. Brainstorming Kid.

303
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,270
Brainstorming young ward
with a secret identity, which is...

304
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,797
...at night he's Brainstorming Man,
and what that is, is he's a genius.

305
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,430
The contracts have been vetted twice,
so I just need you to sign.

306
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,198
Dad? Are you okay?

307
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,555
Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry.

308
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,189
You take good care of me.
Better than I deserve.

309
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,828
-What's that mean?
-I haven't been the best father.

310
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,952
Pretty much, no.

311
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,952
-Are you still in touch with Lindsay?
-Y eah. Are you?

312
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,511
-No. She doesn't ever bother calling me.
-Dad, she's in high school.

313
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,436
If you wanna hear from Lindsay,
you have to call her.

314
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,152
You were right.
Caleb Nichol is not a good guy.

315
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,958
Why, what happened? Did he call you?

316
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,111
No, but I A9-dot-com'd him
last night...

317
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,590
...and, according to the OC Weekly,
he's everything that's wrong...

318
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,911
...with Western civilization
all wrapped up in one guy...

319
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,516
...so even if he did call me....

320
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,239
Oh, my God. He's calling me.
It says the Newport Group.

321
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,358
-Why is he calling me?
-No, it's not. It's probably Kirsten.

322
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,191
Right. Sorry.

323
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,796
-Hey, Kirsten.
-Lindsay. Caleb Nichol.

324
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,710
I was thinking it's time
you and I sat down.

325
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,192
What was that about?

326
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,032
It was Caleb.
He wants to have dinner tonight.

327
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,476
-You're kidding.
-Will you come with me?

328
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,313
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-Please.

329
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,636
I'm not gonna go without you.

330
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,638
-He won't be happy about this.
-Do you care about his happiness?

331
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,554
-I care about yours.
-Well, then I will see you tonight.

332
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,589
So, what does the butterfly mean?

333
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,319
It means I was drunk.

334
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,754
No way.

335
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,514
I was drunk. I had just been
emancipated from my parents.

336
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,831
The words "Mom" and "Dad" with
an X through them was too expensive.

337
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,151
You got emancipated?

338
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,518
-I thought only child stars did that.
-Yep. Me, Hilary Duff, Lil' Bow Wow.

339
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,354
Wait, so how did you do it?

340
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,469
I petitioned the court. I had my parents
sign the form, which they were happy...

341
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,155
...to do when they found out about
me and Jody, and that was it.

342
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,473
I was free.

343
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,596
Well, I wish I could do that.

344
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,758
-Piss your parents off bad enough.
-Believe me, I've tried.

345
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,315
Well, then I guess they really love you.

346
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,872
Do you ever miss yours?

347
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,394
Sometimes.

348
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,028
But my friends are my family,
you know?

349
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,674
I know.

350
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,757
Let's open up A.

351
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,111
Sandy Cohen.

352
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,154
Couldn't believe it when they told me.

353
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,953
How are you, Joe?

354
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,999
Well, not as good as you.
You look good. Successful.

355
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,276
What happened? You sell out?

356
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,190
No, actually. I did 1 5 years
in the public defender's office.

357
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,394
Good for you. Maybe you can work
me up an appeal and get me out of here.

358
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,471
How? You confessed.

359
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,555
To an act of civil disobedience,
not manslaughter.

360
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,234
You set the place on fire,
and a man died.

361
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,915
It was an accident. The custodian wasn't
supposed to be there. You know that.

362
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,749
Like any of that matters now.

363
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,759
What do you want, Sandy?

364
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,713
I'm looking for Rebecca.

365
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,078
Sandy Cohen has come to me
looking for Rebecca.

366
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,798
Let it go.

367
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,916
This isn't about you and me.

368
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,516
When it comes to Rebecca,
it's always been about you and me.

369
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,352
Well, not anymore.

370
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,751
Okay.

371
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,279
-Then what's this about?
-Her father.

372
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,914
He's sick. He's looking for her.

373
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,237
I'll tell you what.

374
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,752
He can look as far and wide
as he wants to.

375
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,116
He's never gonna find her.

376
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,710
-So you're not gonna help me.
-I can't help you, Sandy.

377
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,872
Rebecca...

378
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,994
...she's dead.

379
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,158
She's dead?

380
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,113
I'm so sorry.

381
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,190
I can't believe this.

382
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,230
I can't believe it either.

383
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,594
-Are you calling Max?
-No, an old friend of mine.

384
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,911
A guy in the group. He's a lawyer
now in Vancouver. Hello, yes.

385
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,277
-Directory assistance for Vancouver.
-Why? What will you find out?

386
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,194
Y es, please, I'd like the number
for Mark Denham, D-E-N-H-A-M.

387
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,634
Thank you.

388
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,835
If she was sick, there'd be insurance
forms or hospital records or something.

389
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,595
And, God forbid, if she were dead,
there'd be a death certificate.

390
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,471
So you don't think she's dead.

391
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,028
I can't believe that if she were dying,
she wouldn't try to contact her dad.

392
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,474
Or you.

393
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,234
We'll just get what we came for,
then get out of here.

394
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,436
You all right? You seem nervous.

395
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,238
No, I'm not. I just--

396
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,949
Don't let her intimidate you, okay?
And let me do all the talking.

397
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,678
And don't mention anything
about the necklace.

398
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,712
-I thought you were over her.
-I am.

399
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,236
I am. I just-- Don't let her
talk me into staying the night.

400
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,436
You can't. You have to take me home.

401
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,160
Right. Good one. Remember that.

402
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,392
I had a feeling it might--

403
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,517
What is she doing here?

404
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,550
We came to get Alex's stuff.

405
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,871
And we're not staying.

406
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,677
If you say so.

407
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,076
-Hey.
-Hey.

408
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,552
Bryan Gatwood, a.k.a. Kid Chino,
the strong but silent youth...

409
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,598
...from the wrong side of the tracks,
who, when provoked...

410
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,069
...unleashes his fists of fury.

411
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,353
Maybe we should change
his superhero name to Overdressed Lad.

412
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,954
Lindsay asked me to be a buffer
between her and Caleb.

413
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,270
I thought we'd work tonight.
Grandpa hates you.

414
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,829
-I said that. She thinks I'm overreacting.
-Hey, man.

415
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,788
At least you're on his radar. He once
asked my mom if I was mildly retarded.

416
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,554
-Wait till he finds out about your powers.
-What powers?

417
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,792
Turns out I don't make
a very convincing superhero.

418
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,591
Well, you do have powers.

419
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,433
-Hey, can I see these?
-Yeah, sure.

420
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,713
-What are these?
-They're just sketches I did in Portland.

421
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,359
-The summer without Summer.
-Has Zach seen these?

422
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,034
-No, I'll show him tonight.
-No, you won't show Zach.

423
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,589
-They're drawings.
-Of a girl you were obsessed with.

424
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,230
First of all, "obsessed,"
it's a pretty strong word.

425
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,190
Maybe you're right.
Therefore, I won't show him.

426
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,790
-They're really good, though.
-Thanks.

427
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,428
Hey. Don't let Grandpa
scare you, all right?

428
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,478
Remember, you're Bryan Gatwood,
fists of fury.

429
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,229
-Sure you don't want a beer?
-We have to drive back. T onight.

430
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,679
Okay, so far I have found two T -shirts,
a bra and my Phat jeans.

431
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,559
-What else do you have of mine?
-Nothing, I swear.

432
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,554
-So you won't mind if I kept looking.
-You can look all night if you want.

433
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,273
I won't be long.

434
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,637
Breakups, huh?

435
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,189
Get ready. You're next.

436
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,834
-No, I'm not her--
-I'm sure you're not.

437
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,274
My motorcycle boots.

438
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,715
-Those are mine.
-How can you say these are yours?

439
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,236
-Because I bought them.
-Okay, see, that is your problem.

440
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,550
Okay. Here we go.

441
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,236
-I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
-Tell me what my problem is.

442
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,834
-I can't wait to hear.
-I don't know where to begin.

443
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,594
You know what? Keep my boots.
Keep my records. It's fine.

444
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,638
-It's not fine.
-What are you talking about?

445
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,870
You can't just come here,
take all your stuff.

446
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,315
Actually, I can.

447
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,196
What do you want from me?

448
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,393
I want you to stay.

449
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,078
I want to talk about
what's going on here.

450
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,312
Why don't you take Alex's jeep home.

451
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,471
I'll bring her back later.

452
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,994
I can't.

453
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,435
-Why?
-You think I'd leave my girlfriend alone...

454
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,558
-...with you overnight?
-I thought she wasn't your girlfriend.

455
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,711
Yeah, well, think again.

456
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,593
Let's go.

457
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,793
Okay, that was awesome.

458
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,518
Really? You think she bought it?

459
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,511
She thought we
were sleeping together...

460
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,989
-...when you met at the club last week.
-She did?

461
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,196
-I defended your honor.
-I appreciate that.

462
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,436
Are you kidding?
I owe you so much now.

463
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,358
I got my Phat jeans, I got my CDs...

464
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,956
...and who cares if I didn't get--
My heart.

465
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,395
-How did you...?
-I'm sneaky like that.

466
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,915
And now you have both.

467
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,519
No.

468
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,434
This one's yours.

469
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,998
-How's it look?
-Good.

470
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,870
-I guess we gotta get you home, huh?
-No. I have a better idea.

471
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,714
-What do you think?
-I think you're the missing link...

472
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,509
...between Jack Kirby and,
I don't know, Eric Wight.

473
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,797
-Hey, thanks, man.
-Zach.

474
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,278
I'm pulling the plug. You were supposed
to get me an hour ago.

475
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,590
I know. I'm sorry.
Seth and I were working--

476
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,116
I don't want hear it. What are
you guys, like, Kavalier and Gay?

477
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,838
-That's funny.
-I know.

478
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,874
I'm sorry. Listen, Seth, I'll call you.
We're leaving.

479
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,031
Wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa.
No, we're not.

480
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,270
Is that supposed to be Marissa?

481
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,551
Cohen, did you do these?

482
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,114
Is that Ryan? Captain Oats.

483
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,758
Is that you?

484
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,393
Well....

485
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,872
Where am l?

486
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,517
Not finished yet.
Just wanted to get the attitude right.

487
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,116
There's a lot of attitude.

488
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,750
-We made good progress today.
-It's definitely keeping my mind off girls.

489
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,117
Keep talking comics, I don't think
girls will be an issue ever again.

490
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,191
She's so supportive.
That's why I like her.

491
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,749
Shoot. I left my purse upstairs.
I'll be right back.

492
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,718
-We're gonna miss the movie.
-Whose fault is that?

493
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,273
Sorry, Captain Oats.
Hope you don't pull up lame.

494
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,790
Come on, Sum. We're gonna be late.

495
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,598
What are you doing up there?

496
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,919
Thank you.

497
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,237
So, thank you...

498
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,671
...so much for calling this afternoon
and suggesting dinner.

499
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,558
-lt was--
-Long overdue.

500
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,793
I meant to call you after the holidays,
but work has been all-consuming.

501
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,436
Yeah, I'm sure. I mean...

502
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,752
...I can imagine.

503
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,196
So, what about you, Lindsay?
How is school?

504
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,990
-What are you studying?
-Hey, sorry I'm late. Traffic.

505
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,952
That's okay. We just got menus.

506
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,829
My apologies. If I'd have known we'd be
three, I'd have asked for another one.

507
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,639
Sorry. It's my fault.
I should've said something earlier.

508
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,597
I should have assumed
Ryan would want...

509
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,230
-...to make himself part of this.
-He didn't. I asked him to come.

510
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,351
-Look, I can leave if you want.
-Yes, Ryan.

511
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,478
You scammed your way into one
of my daughter's lives. Why stop?

512
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,029
-This isn't about me.
-lsn't it? You set this up.

513
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,238
-You came to my office and to dinner.
-You went to his office?

514
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,674
I was trying to help.

515
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,512
He said you wanted a relationship.

516
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,229
If that were true, he wouldn't be here.
So, what do the two of you really want?

517
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,073
Money?

518
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,311
-What?
-A new car?

519
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,233
An lvy League education?
Have your accomplice here...

520
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,915
...drop by my office with a list
of demands. That should cover it.

521
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,479
Good night.

522
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,512
Hey, Mark. Sandy Cohen again.

523
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,399
I know this is my fifth message today,
but I'm still up.

524
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,394
So if you get this,
please call back. Thanks.

525
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,109
-You gonna stay up all night?
-Well, I'm not tired, that's for sure.

526
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,032
No word from your lawyer friend?

527
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,432
No. No.
And no confirmation she's dead.

528
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,910
What if she's not?
What if your suspicions are right?

529
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,070
One way or another, she's gone.
What will it take for you to let her go?

530
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,118
-What are you talking about?
-Rebecca Bloom.

531
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,715
The smart, political, Jewish woman...

532
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,714
...that you were supposed to marry
before you ended up with me.

533
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,311
You're still in love with her.

534
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,998
-That is not true.
-Then come to bed.

535
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,915
Hello? Mark. Hey.

536
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,834
I'm sorry to be harassing you,
but, you know, time is of the....

537
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,158
Okay.

538
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,192
Well, thanks for calling back.

539
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,118
All right, take care.

540
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,114
She's dead.

541
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,313
-What are you gonna do?
-I gotta call the professor...

542
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,119
...but l-- I can't tell him this
on the phone.

543
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,591
I'm sorry.

544
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,270
It was a long time ago.

545
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,956
Maybe I need to let go of her too.

546
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,752
I'm gonna go.

547
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,512
I won't be long.

548
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,117
Princess Sparkle,
you are not going to believe this.

549
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,269
-I'm sorry.
-Why are you sorry?

550
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,113
I made you come to dinner.
I know how much you hate him.

551
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,669
-I don't hate him.
-Yeah.

552
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,239
Well, he hates you.

553
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,711
So for you to have gone to his office...

554
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,314
-...for me was--
-A mistake.

555
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,110
I really didn't want anything from him.

556
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,390
I just wanted to ask him
some questions, you know?

557
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,156
Stupid stuff.

558
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,350
Maybe I don't need a dad.

559
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,273
You know...

560
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,354
...I've gone all this time without one.

561
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,631
I turned out okay.

562
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,998
Right?

563
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,233
-Maybe I could talk to him.
-No.

564
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,516
-Or ask Kirsten to talk to him.
-No.

565
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,398
You've done enough.

566
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,631
More than enough, and....

567
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,311
You said it yourself.
He's not a good guy.

568
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,118
Yeah, but he's your dad.

569
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,111
-Are you sure I can't--?
-I'm sure.

570
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,392
But thanks.

571
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,836
Let me just change my shirt,
then we can go.

572
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,357
-Your shirt is fine. I'm telling you.
-Then why is it sticking to me?

573
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,360
-Am I bleeding?
-Let me see.

574
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,469
Wow. No, you're not bleeding.
See for yourself.

575
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,596
Oh, my god. That is so hot.

576
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,318
Oh, my God.

577
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,799
What have you done?

578
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,110
Nothing. Get out of here, Caleb.

579
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,077
This is my house. My home.

580
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,231
Fine. You know what, then?
We'll leave.

581
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,629
-You're not going anywhere.
-Oh, really? Are you gonna stop me?

582
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,988
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Come on, Alex.

583
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,674
Nice house.

584
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,192
Come in.

585
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,988
Hey. What are you doing here?

586
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,870
I-- I came to return something
that I stole.

587
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,310
Oh, you found it.

588
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,553
Great.

589
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,388
Okay, here's the thing.
I know it's totally creepy.

590
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,596
Okay? I know that.
It was a very long summer.

591
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,110
I'm sorry. I will destroy
all of them right now.

592
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,352
-I just need to find my X-Acto knife.
-No, Cohen. Don't.

593
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,318
-I think they're really good.
-Yeah?

594
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,710
Yeah. I mean, well...

595
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,429
...the boobs are a little big, but....
Well, I mean, aren't they?

596
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,155
-We can redo the boobs.
-And, you know...

597
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,471
...I'm not so sure
about the mask either.

598
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,668
-Now, that's what I'm talking about.
-Yeah? So then you don't mind?

599
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,355
No. Well, not as long
as I have boob approval.

600
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,192
Okay.

601
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,112
Do you mind if I have one of these?

602
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,838
Yeah, sure. You can actually
have them all if you want.

603
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,998
-Yeah?
-Although, maybe it's not a good idea...

604
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,833
...to tell Zach about them all.

605
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,594
-Or any of them.
-I was thinking the same thing.

606
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,671
Just because it may
upset the partnership.

607
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,912
-Yeah, and it could be bad for business.
-Exactly.

608
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,432
Okay. I'll let you get back to work...

609
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,070
...because I expect my own action figure
by Chrismukkah.

610
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,835
-Wow. Okay. Well, I'll see what I can do.
-Okay.

611
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,156
-Thanks, Cohen.
-Yeah.

612
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,111
Hey, professor.

613
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,196
Well, any chance
you could meet me tonight? Yeah.

614
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,317
How about my office?

615
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,713
I'll see you then.

616
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,872
Hey, how was dinner?

617
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,237
I wouldn't know.
Caleb took off before we could order.

618
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,835
-Because you punched him in the face?
-No.

619
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,278
But you wanted to.
I could tell you wanted to.

620
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,795
That's good. Hey, listen,
he deserved it, I'm sure.

621
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,632
I love the guy, but come on.

622
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,394
-He's Lex Luthor.
-It's my fault. I keep trying to help.

623
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,757
-I keep making everything worse.
-Well, Ryan, that's what heroes do.

624
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,390
Okay, what else are you gonna do with
fists of fury? Homework? The dishes?

625
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,791
-How'd it go with Zach?
-Great, until Summer came over...

626
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,234
...and stole my sketchbook.

627
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,552
-What? What'd she do?
-I thought she'd get a restraining order...

628
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,359
...but it turns out she'll just get
her own action figure.

629
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,036
-So she liked it?
-Yeah.

630
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,794
Summer and I may be
stepping forward in our relationship.

631
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,235
Knowing us, Lindsay and l
will take a step back.

632
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,109
-Hey, so between the two of us....
-We're right back where we started.

633
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,590
Well, at least
we haven't lost any ground.

634
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,912
Except you won me. Here we go.

635
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,272
Well, l....
I see you've got your hands full.

636
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,317
I'm sorry to call you here so late.

637
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,234
No, no, no. Actually, Sanford,
I was gonna call you.

638
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,189
I have something to show you.

639
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,993
What is it?

640
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,032
Sandy Cohen.

641
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,478
Rebecca.
