00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,395
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,357
- You gotta have a plan.
- Who are you?

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,149
I stole a car. Then my mom threw me out,
so Mr. Cohen took me in.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,515
- What is it about this kid?
- I was this kid.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,557
- Ryan's gonna stay with us now.
- That's awesome.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,951
- Do you wanna do something tonight?
- You're not, like, into him, are you?

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,678
What are you doing with my girlfriend?

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,434
Do you know what girls find sexy?
Confidence.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,636
Might I remind you of something
that I call:

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,234
"The time that you kissed me
at my grandfather's party."

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,594
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,751
I never should have
broken up with you in the first place.

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,195
- I don't know what I should do.
- Let me know when you decide.

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,955
Jimmy's been siphoning money out of his
clients' accounts to cover his own debts.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,793
- Daddy!
- Put your personal feelings for him aside.

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,757
He's one of my oldest friends.

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,310
This whole community thinks
you're a criminal, Jimmy.

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,278
- You're getting a divorce.
- I'm so sorry, kiddo.

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,556
- What are you doing?
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,950
- I have no one.
- She's gone.

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,111
And so are my stepmom's painkillers.

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,358
Wake up.

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,112
Wake up.

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,153
I have three sesame and one plain.

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,752
I'm okay.

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,474
Look, we're not gonna hear
from the hospital for a while.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,153
You guys get showered and dressed.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,754
And you can't be late
for your meeting with the dean.

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,189
- I'll take them to school.
- You can't be late for your first day.

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,713
Well, if we're not gonna eat,
let's just go.

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,591
Oh, hey. Hey.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,594
She just fell back asleep.

33
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,435
But she was awake and aware.

34
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,828
Thanks for calling the hospital.
And finding her.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,595
If they hadn't airlifted her out, she...

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,911
- When can she go home?
- They said in a day or so.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,356
- They wanna keep her under observation.
- That's hospital policy.

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,670
So I guess there's no need
to worry, right?

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,990
I mean, a teenage girl palms
a dozen painkillers...

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,673
...and washes it down with tequila.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,515
That's perfectly normal, right?
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,750
I called them.

43
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,310
What Marissa needs right now
is to be with her family. No visitors.

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,431
Well, let's go. We should go.

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,397
- Lf you need anything...
- Thanks.

46
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,834
Don't take it personally.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,639
Julie's just been through
every parent's nightmare.

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,360
- I'm sure she'll apologize.
- You are?

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,556
It's Julie Cooper we're talking about.

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,269
Excuse me.
Ryan, can I talk to you for a sec?

51
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,790
I don't know what happened in Mexico,
but here's what I do know:

52
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,871
Since you showed up,
Marissa's been a wreck.

53
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,554
Comes home crying,
doesn't wanna go to her cotillion...

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,438
...having problems with her boyfriend.

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,670
And now you can add another
shining accomplishment...

56
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,159
...to your list of achievements.

57
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,672
In addition to stealing cars,
burning down houses...

58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,479
...and befriending
would-be assassins...

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,392
...you've almost killed my daughter.

60
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,674
You can blame me all you want...

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,918
...but I would never do anything
to hurt Marissa.

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,231
Well, you're not going
to get the chance...

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,595
...because you're never
going to see her again.

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,719
You even try, and I'll make sure you're
thrown back in juvie, where you belong.

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,710
Wait. I don't get it. Luke's the one
she should be blaming, not you.

66
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,394
- She doesn't know that.
- So why don't you tell her?

67
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,790
I'm just glad Marissa's okay.

68
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,954
I'll check in with the events committee.
I'll catch up with you at the dean's office.

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,839
Ryan, don't be nervous.
You're gonna do great.

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,396
This is school?

71
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,959
Registration week, Ryan.
It's my favorite time of the year...

72
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,874
...because fellow students
aren't around to ruin it. Except them.

73
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,990
You guys have tennis courts
and a swimming pool?

74
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,071
I'm guessing you didn't
at your old school.

75
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,798
Well, we had a basketball hoop.

76
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,193
- Oh, hi, guys.
- Dr. Talley, Miss Kimrey. How are you?

77
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,397
Okay.

78
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,396
My mom's more popular than me.
That's a little bit pathetic, I realize.

79
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,677
After your meeting, we gotta get
your photo taken for your school ID.

80
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,912
- Another mug shot?
- Lf you must be so cynical.

81
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,554
Oh, yeah. That one's a keeper.

82
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,790
- So when do we do the retina scan?
- Friday.

83
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,951
- I was joking.
- So was I.

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,236
Good thing we didn't hire you
for your quick wit.

85
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,118
Well, God doesn't give with two hands.

86
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,998
Come on.
Time for you to meet your team.

87
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,037
You'll have a researcher,
two paralegals...

88
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,668
...and a file clerk to do
all the heavy lifting for you.

89
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,070
Speaking of which,
let me show you our gym.

90
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,073
- Oh, you guys have a gym?
- You didn't at the PD's office?

91
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,878
Well, we had a basketball hoop.

92
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,355
Everything's gonna be fine.

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,039
It's just...

94
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,829
...at Chino Hills,
you sort of showed up.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,037
No essays, interviews, tests.

96
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,792
The Harbor School is one of
the best private schools in the country.

97
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,191
If you graduate from here, you can
get into any college in the UC system.

98
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,952
Maybe even an Ivy League.

99
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,997
I don't think I'm an Ivy League
kind of guy.

100
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,789
- After a year or two here, you will be.
- College, huh?

101
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,188
Yeah.

102
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,793
What did you get?

103
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,430
AP History, English, calculus
and physics. And French 4.

104
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,512
Good thing I don't have a life.
What is wrong? Are you nervous?

105
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,752
Seth, would you please tell Ryan
that Dr. Kim is very nice.

106
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,638
Oh, yeah. She is sweet.

107
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,713
- Kirsten, how are you?
- Hi, nice to see you.

108
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,997
Seth. Always interesting to see you.
And you must be Ryan.

109
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,628
Why don't we step into my office.

110
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,392
Well, this doesn't suck.

111
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,551
That eloquence will serve you nicely
on the stand.

112
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,711
Like you guys ever actually
go to trial.

113
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,190
You're one of us now, Sandy.
Better start wrapping your head around it.

114
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,032
So is your family all excited
about your first day?

115
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,589
My wife loves being married
to a corporate sellout.

116
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,317
Right, right, right.
Wrapping my head around it.

117
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,950
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Yeah.

118
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,758
I figured you'd wanna dive right in.

119
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,232
Chemical peel gone awry. Fascinating.
Bad Botox injection.

120
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,118
Noise complaint on a yacht.

121
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,192
- Scintillating?
- In the purest sense of the word.

122
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,794
- Don't be a snob.
- Just defend them. Right.

123
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,473
Rich people need lawyers too.

124
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,917
Weak grades, truancy.

125
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,833
Notation regarding some criminal activity.

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,389
It was a misdemeanor. Probation.

127
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,915
Nonetheless, not exactly
Harbor School material.

128
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,631
Dr. Kim, Ryan's had a lot to overcome...

129
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,430
...but Sandy and I feel that in the right
environment, he could really excel.

130
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,070
There's no doubt that Mr. Atwood
has extraordinary promise.

131
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,198
I'm just concerned that he hasn't had...

132
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,033
...adequate preparation
for the rigors of our curriculum.

133
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,998
Or are you concerned about
the pressure from parents...

134
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,388
...who don't want Ryan here?

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,788
That's definitely a consideration.
But not a decisive one.

136
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,112
Kirsten, you know as well as I do how
bright and motivated our students are.

137
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,592
Those that aren't bred for USC
go off to Harvard and Yale.

138
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,035
I just think a place like Newport Union...

139
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,192
...might be a better fit for a student
with Ryan's background.

140
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,112
My background?

141
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,676
I can't change where I'm from,
but I can change where I'm going.

142
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,479
Ryan, you understand
that if you did fail...

143
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,915
...you'd lose a year,
not to mention self-confidence.

144
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,991
With all due respect, Dr. Kim...

145
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,948
...if you think not letting me in
is gonna inspire self-confidence...

146
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,677
Give me a shot.

147
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,630
You got great test scores.

148
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,315
I definitely responded
to your personal essay.

149
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,517
Your grades are borderline,
but acceptable.

150
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,031
If you could pass a placement exam...

151
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,112
It's not an aptitude test.
It measures your preparedness...

152
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,838
...not how bright you are.

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,956
Just tell me where and when.

154
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,430
Summer, hey.

155
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,828
Hi.

156
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,317
It's so weird being in school right now...

157
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,473
...surrounded by all these people
who have, like, no idea.

158
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,200
I know. Have you talked to Marissa?

159
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,791
I spoke to her mom. You?

160
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,713
We went by this morning,
but she was sleeping.

161
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,599
- They said she's gonna be okay, though.
- I still can't believe it, you know?

162
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,989
- I thought she was dead.
- Me too.

163
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,789
Maybe when she's feeling better, we'll
take her out and try and cheer her up.

164
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,953
Take her to a movie.
Or Six Flags, I don't know.

165
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,793
Yeah. I guess.

166
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,068
Maybe before then, if you want...

167
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,994
...I don't know, you and me could
go see a movie or something.

168
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,596
- Hey, Summer.
- Hey, Summer, how's it going?

169
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,193
Hey, you guys.

170
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,151
What a nerd.

171
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,991
Look, Cohen.
This year's all messed up.

172
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,359
I mean, Marissa's in the hospital,
I'll never speak to Luke or Holly again.

173
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,431
- You and I...
- No, I get it, it's fine.

174
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,034
We're back in school now,
old rules apply.

175
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,512
Sorry.

176
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,631
Strong sedative, huh?

177
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,916
Yeah, she needs to sleep.

178
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,916
And we need to talk.

179
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,878
Look, Jimmy...

180
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,393
...you and I, we need to
present a united front.

181
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,438
It's hard enough, this forcing us
to be in the same room together.

182
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,511
Thanks. You got a great bedside manner.

183
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,194
Calling the Cohens was
completely inappropriate.

184
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,476
- You know I don't like that Brian.
- Ryan.

185
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,918
- I don't want him near Marissa.
- Marissa said it was an accident, okay?

186
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,399
There's no one to blame.

187
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,711
That's a convenient position to take,
since you let her go to Tijuana.

188
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,599
Oh, so now it's my fault.

189
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,557
You're the one
who destroyed this family.

190
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,792
You lied to us. You stole money
from your clients and friends.

191
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,996
Why do you think
she took all those pills?

192
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,829
You cannot honestly believe that.

193
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,471
I left her in your care for one weekend
and look what happened.

194
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,949
Which is why I'm asking the judge
for sole custody.

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,116
Julie, come on. You can't.

196
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,478
Getting the girls away from you is my only
chance to give them a semblance of a life.

197
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,039
And if you fight me on this...

198
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,749
...I'll take you to court and you'll be lucky
to even get supervised visitation.

199
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,390
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to,
because I am not giving up my kids.

200
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,516
You may not have a choice.

201
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,112
I'm going back to check on
Kaitlin and the sitter.

202
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,953
You should get cleaned up.
You're a wreck.

203
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,358
Good thing I never
throw anything away.

204
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,590
The questions will be different,
but you get it.

205
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,629
- Yeah, but I'm gonna fail.
- You're not gonna fail. You have to get in.

206
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,870
I won't spend another year
at that school alone.

207
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,076
Please, thank you, study.

208
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,709
Especially, though, if all it takes is
a couple of cheerleaders walking by...

209
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,350
...and suddenly it's like Summer and I,
we just didn't happen.

210
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,279
I'm sorry. You study.

211
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,593
Here's the thing, though.
We connected. And it was awesome.

212
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,830
Especially the part
where she kissed me...

213
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,309
Seth. I have two hours
until I take this test.

214
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,357
Unless you plan on going to
Newport Union...

215
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,829
Right. Got it.
Less talking, more studying.

216
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,515
Don't move. I'm gonna get that.
And you keep studying.

217
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,878
Hello?

218
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,713
Hey, Marissa. Hi.

219
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,677
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Sure.

220
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,077
Hi.

221
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,792
Okay. All right.

222
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,678
Okay, I'll be there. Bye.

223
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,754
She's upset.
Something with her parents.

224
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,399
And her mom's going home, so...

225
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,073
- What about the test?
- I'll be there.

226
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,755
- I'll just do the best that I can.
- But what if that's not good enough?

227
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,754
Well, then Dr. Kim was right.
I'm not Harbor School material.

228
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,431
Hi.

229
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,117
Hi.

230
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,478
These are for you.

231
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,631
It's all they had left at the gift shop.

232
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,279
I'll just...

233
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,396
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,709
I was so dumb.
What I did, I wasn't...

235
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,632
Hey, come on.

236
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,433
I didn't want to kill myself.

237
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,998
I didn't.

238
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,431
I just wanted to...

239
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,393
...escape.
- I know.

240
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,196
Excuse me, nurse.
When you get a chance, lunch, please.

241
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,793
You should...

242
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,671
Oh, sweetie, you're awake.

243
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,400
How are you feeling?
Your sister sends her love.

244
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,993
My throat hurts.

245
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,594
That's because they had to
pump your stomach, honey.

246
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,230
Where did that thing come from?

247
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,999
I...

248
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,078
I don't know.

249
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,357
It's from him. He came here, didn't he?
After I told him not to.

250
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,034
- After everything he's done to you.
- He didn't.

251
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,511
- It wasn't his fault.
- You keep saying that...

252
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,116
...but before he got here,
you were happy.

253
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,679
You think I was happy?

254
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,432
If you weren't,
you never told me about it.

255
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,591
- I tried, but...
- I need to talk to the nurse.

256
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,228
The security in here is appalling.

257
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,954
I'm sorry about that.
You know, about her.

258
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,350
That's okay.
I should go and take this test.

259
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,317
But I'll be back first chance I get.

260
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,677
I don't know. With my mom...

261
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,512
I'm not afraid of your mom.

262
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,276
Well, I am.

263
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,190
Did you ask Ryan
what he wants for lunch?

264
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,952
He doesn't wanna eat.
He's on a diet.

265
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,591
Why's he on a diet?

266
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,515
- Why is he on a diet?
- I'll ask him. I wanna see how he's doing...

267
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,277
Mom, Mom. He's in a state of deep, deep
Zen-like concentration right now, okay?

268
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,668
Well, he still needs to eat.

269
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,990
He's naked. All right? He's naked,
he studies in the nude. It's a Chino thing.

270
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,709
I think that if you were to walk in on him
naked and Dad was to find out...

271
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,950
...I think suspicions might be raised.

272
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,111
A house divided will not stand.

273
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,671
You and I still need to talk about
your little surprise trip to Tijuana.

274
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,070
Okay. I can't wait.

275
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,629
Jimmy, hi. Is Marissa okay?

276
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,473
Yeah, she's doing better, thanks.

277
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,358
It's Julie who's giving me the problem.

278
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,955
Is Sandy coming home for lunch?

279
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,032
No, he just started a new job today.
Why? What's going on?

280
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,637
She's suing me for sole custody.
Maybe even supervised visits.

281
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,712
- Why would she do that?
- Well, my question is, can she?

282
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,110
I need to know what shot I have
at joint custody...

283
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,430
...given what I've put my family through.

284
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,355
- I wanna know what kind of case she has.
- Come in. I'll get Sandy's new number.

285
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,838
I'll just... I'll wait out here.

286
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,274
I mean, you know...

287
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,039
Jimmy, we have been friends for too long
to let something like this...

288
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,393
It was just a...

289
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,076
It was stupid.
It was monumentally stupid.

290
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,958
And I'm sorry.

291
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,473
It's okay.

292
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,757
I mean, it's not okay, but it's okay.

293
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,957
I mean, you and Sandy are
the only friends I have left.

294
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,350
- And I definitely don't wanna lose you.
- Won't.

295
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,113
So are you coming in or what?

296
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,554
<i>Hi, you've reached Jimmy Cooper.</i>
<i>Please leave a message and I'll get back</i>...

297
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,958
Security said they'd do what they can,
but I don't know.

298
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,556
You know, this is exactly why I thought
San Diego would be good for you.

299
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,950
- San Diego?
- Dr. Burke has a facility there.

300
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,998
- Who's Dr. Burke?
- Well...

301
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,674
She's a psychiatrist.
Highly recommended.

302
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,389
She runs an institute
for young women who are troubled.

303
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,436
You're sending me
to a mental institution.

304
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,913
It's a recovery center.

305
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,753
Honey, I know you don't understand...

306
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,629
...but I would rather have you hate me
now than risk losing you again.

307
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,234
Does Dad know about this?

308
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,836
Well, I think some time away from
your father would be good for you too.

309
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,629
- Well, what if I don't wanna go?
- That's for Dr. Burke to decide.

310
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,230
She'll be here after lunch
to evaluate you.

311
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,073
Please, honey, just talk to her.
Let her help you.

312
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,069
And then we can get you out of here
and you can start to get better.

313
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,357
Yeah. If it's okay,
I just need to use the bathroom.

314
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,839
Of course.

315
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,716
Not now, Mom. I'm studying naked.

316
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,753
Summer?

317
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,634
- Come in.
- No way.

318
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,030
- I'm not naked.
- No, no, no!

319
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,629
Okay. I don't get it.
What kind of family do you have, Cohen?

320
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,189
The kind where mothers and sons
wear clothes.

321
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,396
Always. Even in the shower.

322
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,110
What is this?

323
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,271
I don't know.
I've never seen it before.

324
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,749
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

325
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,275
Captain Oats. What are you doing here?

326
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,316
Coop just called. She's freaking out.

327
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,914
Her mom's threatening to ship her
to the insane asylum.

328
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,311
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm serious.

329
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,994
I've gotta do something, Cohen.
I need to get radical.

330
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,393
- I need Ryan.
- You can't have him.

331
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,597
He's taking an exam. What's wrong
with me, not radical enough?

332
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,718
Well, that depends.
Are you ready to take on Julie Cooper?

333
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,837
- We need Ryan.
- Yeah.

334
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,595
- That's my bed.
- Okay.

335
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,352
Just wanted you to know.

336
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,719
- I have a feeling you'll be...
- Okay, let's go.

337
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,949
It's a very fair offer,
given the merits of the case.

338
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,950
Okay. Well, think it over.

339
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,348
Goodbye.

340
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,353
My wife does that with her hands
when she's pissed off at me.

341
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,995
Your wife and I have a lot in common.

342
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,479
You've been here half a day...

343
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,030
...and you've booked
court dates for five of your seven cases.

344
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,918
Do I win the free set of steak knives?

345
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,674
Sandy, this isn't how
they do things around here.

346
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,037
And I can keep this off the partners'
radar, but you gotta understand...

347
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,079
Understand what? I'm going to court. I'm
taking them on, I'm bringing them down.

348
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,473
Especially this bastard who won't let his
neighbor grow hedges over his own fence.

349
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,918
Look, you know how much time
and energy goes into trying one of these.

350
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,469
If you settled, you could handle
twice as many cases.

351
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,359
- And we're in a volume business here.
- Like Costco.

352
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,355
I thought the reason you brought me here
is because you wanted a trial attorney...

353
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,476
...who's committed and passionate and...

354
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,235
Yes. And when one of these cases
actually deserves to go before a jury...

355
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,153
...the courtroom is all yours.
But in the meantime...

356
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,632
...I need you to pick up the phone and
passionately negotiate some settlements.

357
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,316
Come on. I put my ass on the line
to get you this gig.

358
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,517
Please. Do it for me.

359
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,914
Hey.

360
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,991
What are you doing?
Dr. Kim will be back any minute.

361
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,675
Yeah, I know this isn't the best time,
but Marissa needs you right now. Or us.

362
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,400
Her mom's gone psycho.
She's having her committed.

363
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,312
- What is going on in here?
- Hi, Dr. Kim.

364
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,596
This isn't what it looks like.
It's an emergency.

365
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,432
We need to borrow Ryan for a while.

366
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,512
- He's not going anywhere. You two, out!
- You don't understand!

367
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,750
- There's an emergency...
- Goodbye!

368
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,514
Okay. We'll be out here.

369
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,478
Actually, I gotta go too.

370
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,200
- Have you finished the test?
- No. But I...

371
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,035
Ryan, if this is too difficult, tell me.
If the Cohens are pressuring you...

372
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,509
- They're not. I wanna be here.
- Then prove it.

373
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,955
- Sit down, finish the test.
- I can't.

374
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,556
Ryan, if this is the level of commitment
you plan to bring to your studies...

375
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,712
- Dr. Kim, I really don't have time to argue.
- There is no argument.

376
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,758
You walk away from this test,
you walk away from this school.

377
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,117
You're probably right.
It wouldn't have worked out anyway.

378
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,793
Sorry for wasting your time.

379
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,311
Let's go.

380
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,391
So your mother tells me you struggled
with anorexia in the ninth grade.

381
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,711
My mom's convinced it was anorexia.

382
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,674
It was just tennis season,
I was really stressed.

383
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,793
That's all.

384
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,835
And in 10th grade
you were caught shoplifting?

385
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,199
It was just a lighter
and a pack of cigarettes.

386
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,112
Do you still smoke?

387
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,512
Not really.

388
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,838
Drink?

389
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,236
Would you say you drink a lot?

390
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,434
I guess. I mean, what's a lot?

391
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,831
Have you ever had so much to drink
that you blacked out?

392
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,517
Tell me about this past year.

393
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,832
Your dad's legal troubles,
bankruptcy, your parents separating.

394
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,636
Home's probably the last place
you wanna be, right?

395
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,713
Your mom mentioned a boyfriend. Luke?

396
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,994
- He's not my boyfriend anymore.
- Really?

397
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,875
You wanna tell me what happened?

398
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,433
Anything I say, you'll just use against me
to prove to my mom...

399
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,909
...that I'm troubled, right?

400
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,675
I'm not here to judge.
I'm here to listen and try to help.

401
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,037
You're here because my mom
would rather ship me to an institution...

402
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,031
...than deal with what's really going on.

403
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,034
I'm here because, accidentally or not,
you nearly killed yourself.

404
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,596
And you wanna tell me what's actually
going on with you and your mom?

405
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,592
How much time do you have?

406
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,751
Not good. Summer should've
been here by now.

407
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,751
She better be here soon.

408
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,993
What if something happened? Right?

409
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,152
Marissa's dad can't even get her
out of here. How are we supposed to?

410
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,878
Not by waiting for Summer.

411
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,156
Hi. We're here for Marissa Cooper.

412
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,834
It's okay, Denise. They're with me.

413
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,117
Good Lord.

414
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,396
What? I told you I was a candy striper.

415
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,916
- I thought you were kidding.
- It's for charity. All the girls do it.

416
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,674
- I should be hospitalized more.
- Lf you need any help...

417
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,195
Okay, guys. Can you get us
in the psych ward or not?

418
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,113
- Just try to keep up with me.
- Cool.

419
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,157
Seth, you're on lookout.

420
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,995
Hi, Gloria. I know it's my day off, but
I just cannot get enough of sick people.

421
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,116
These guys are helping
with the sponge baths.

422
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,430
Dibs on that guy.

423
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,875
We don't need to keep her
on suicide watch...

424
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,998
...but there are underlying issues
she hasn't been dealing with.

425
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,469
- But you can help her?
- I can recommend treatment.

426
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,598
- Psychodynamic therapy, group work.
- At the institute?

427
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,230
At the institute or here in Newport.
I see patients, or I can refer you.

428
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,551
No. I want her to get out of Newport.
It's too chaotic for her here.

429
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,188
She can't leave now.
She's got school, her friends.

430
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,191
Uprooting her will do
more harm than good.

431
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,794
She almost died, Jimmy.
How much more harm can she do?

432
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,152
All right, you decide.
I need to check in with the institute.

433
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,959
Thanks.

434
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,388
- She's going to the institute.
- She's not going anywhere.

435
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,632
- Don't make me call my lawyer.
- Go ahead. I'll call mine.

436
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,917
I'm gonna go talk to Marissa.

437
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,559
Excuse me, doctor.
Marissa's father and I have discussed it.

438
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,759
I've got a bag for her in the car
and I can drive her down myself tonight.

439
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,831
I'll make the arrangements.

440
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,753
Thank you.

441
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,594
I know this may be difficult
for you to hear...

442
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,228
...but Dr. Burke and I think
it's for the best.

443
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,308
Well, what about Dad?

444
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,471
Well, he just wants
what's best for you too.

445
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,712
Now, Dr. Burke and I
have some paperwork.

446
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,440
So you should get dressed, okay?

447
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,674
I'm glad you're taking this
so well, Marissa.

448
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,149
Yeah, well, if it's for the best, right?

449
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,436
I love you, honey.

450
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,915
- Okay. Get dressed. I'll be back.
- All right.

451
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,834
- How'd I do?
- Almost had me convinced. Here.

452
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,191
It's Summer's idea. It's for cover.

453
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,874
Sure. Summer's idea.

454
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,634
Hey, no peeking.

455
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,911
Hey, <i>Madame Bovary</i>.

456
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,434
That Flaubert could really turn a phrase.

457
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,716
I guess. It was kind of a bummer.

458
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,110
I know Emma got her heart,
like, totally broken...

459
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,430
...but why'd she have to
go and eat arsenic?

460
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,830
- You've read <i>Madame Bovary</i>?
- Five times.

461
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,911
It's Tom Shayle's favorite book.

462
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,311
I should go check on him. He's two
floors down. He's, like, incontinent.

463
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,914
You're a strange and mysterious
woman, Summer.

464
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,038
The most important thing is that
we make sure Marissa feels safe.

465
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,113
I don't know what that means, Cohen.
I wasn't in Panama.

466
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,669
- It means...
- Just go and I'll run interference.

467
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,035
Yeah, that's what I said. 10-4.

468
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,755
- Hi, Mrs. Cooper. How are you?
- Hey, Summer. You here to see Mariss?

469
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,549
Yeah. I was just volunteering today,
I thought I'd stop by. How is she?

470
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,234
Well, she's going to be fine eventually.

471
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,790
- Are you her doctor?
- Therapist. We're on our way to see her...

472
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,350
Therapist? Do you have a second?
Because I keep having this dream.

473
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,832
I'm in the woods, trying to find this
restaurant, but I'm lost and so hungry.

474
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,230
I have a reservation, can't be late.
You following?

475
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,037
You ready?

476
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,273
Yeah.

477
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,114
Go away.

478
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,431
I just wanted to see you.
I'm so sorry about everything.

479
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,239
- Yeah, that's what you said in Mexico.
- That was a mistake.

480
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,628
No kidding.

481
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,791
What are you doing dressed like that?

482
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,754
Hey, your mom and the doctor
are on the move.

483
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,552
You're running away?

484
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,352
Look, Luke, please, l...

485
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,756
Take the stairs.

486
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,235
Are you sure it's okay?
I don't wanna interrupt.

487
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,437
His office said he was having
welcome drinks with a few of his...

488
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,919
Thank you.

489
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,672
Associates.

490
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,877
- Can I have another one?
- Sure.

491
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,593
Hey!

492
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,237
Hey. What are you two doing here?

493
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,751
When I couldn't reach you, I called the
office. Jimmy needs some legal advice.

494
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,994
- I'm Kirsten.
- Hi, I'm Rachel.

495
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,435
- Oh, so this is Rachel.
- This is Rachel.

496
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,431
I'm Rachel.

497
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,513
- Hi, Rachel. I'm Jimmy.
- Hi.

498
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,512
So are you suing a tequila company?
Doing some research?

499
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,229
- Apparently, we don't sue anybody.
- Now, you say that like it's a bad thing.

500
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,832
Kirsten, you're lucky to be married
to somebody so hilarious.

501
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,351
I am.

502
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,236
You know what, I'll just take care
of this myself. I'm gonna go.

503
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,118
- Jimmy.
- Stop by the office tomorrow.

504
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,875
Yeah, no, tomorrow's gonna be too late.

505
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,632
Thanks, Kirsten.

506
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,878
I'll see you at home,
when you've finished work.

507
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,474
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

508
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,517
Hey, Dad.

509
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,030
What are you doing here?

510
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,632
I checked out.

511
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,916
Does your mother know about this?

512
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,477
- We're gonna wait in the car.
- Yeah. Yeah. Right.

513
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,190
You ran away?

514
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,750
- I didn't know what else to do.
- Sweetheart.

515
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,639
Mom was getting ready to
drive me down to San Diego.

516
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,199
What?

517
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,919
What...? You didn't know.

518
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,595
I should have guessed.

519
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,196
Look, I don't want to go to San Diego
and I don't wanna live with Mom.

520
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,230
- I wanna stay with you.
- Look, I want that too. Okay?

521
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,868
But I don't know if that's possible.

522
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,271
Your mom is suing me for sole custody.

523
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,195
And after everything I've done,
she kind of has me over a barrel, kiddo.

524
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,952
Look, if I do even the slightest thing
wrong, I could never see you again.

525
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,756
Okay?
And I don't ever want to lose you.

526
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,358
Hold on.

527
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,713
- Just give me a second, okay?
- Yeah.

528
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,713
Hey. Yeah, hi.

529
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,079
No. She's here.

530
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,674
Look, I didn't have anything
to do with this, Julie.

531
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,231
Well, you were gonna take her to
San Diego without telling me about it.

532
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,109
All right. I'll keep her here.

533
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,351
What do you wanna do now, Coop?

534
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,637
I don't know what to do.
What can I do?

535
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,553
I could hide you in one
of my mom's developments.

536
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,268
I'm kidding.

537
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,270
I mean, how is any of this even possible?

538
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,032
My mom wants to lock me up
in an asylum...

539
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,270
...while my dad can't do anything
about it.

540
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,874
- We'll figure something out.
- Well, we better hurry.

541
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,713
She just escaped from a psych ward
in a candy striper outfit.

542
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,519
If they didn't think
she was crazy before, they...

543
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,990
- Sorry, Coop. I'm gonna get another slice.
- As will I.

544
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,469
Well, if you wanna skip town,
I guess I could go with you.

545
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,517
My mom would love that.

546
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,070
Look, if your mom's doing all this
just to keep me away from you...

547
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,468
...I'll stay away.

548
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,990
I don't want that.

549
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,108
So, what are we gonna do?

550
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,872
If I could just get her to listen.

551
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,431
- Hey.
- Back from work?

552
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,318
I don't understand why you're so upset.

553
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,790
I mean, I understand, but it's nothing.
She works at the firm.

554
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,190
She doesn't look old enough
to be served in a bar.

555
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,715
She's 33. She graduated Berkeley
four years after you.

556
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,711
- What's her favorite color?
- Pink.

557
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,195
Oh, Kirsten.

558
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,794
Sandy, I'm not saying
anything's going on.

559
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,713
Good, because you spent the weekend
painting Jimmy's house...

560
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,589
...and I said nothing,
because I knew nothing was going on.

561
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,835
- Right?
- Right, of course.

562
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,911
So, what were you two
doing together tonight?

563
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,197
Jimmy's got custody issues with Julie.

564
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,156
Well, I guess we're all having issues.

565
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,397
So, what are we gonna do?
I have to work with this woman.

566
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,993
- I trust you.
- Okay.

567
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,313
- I trust you.
- Okay.

568
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,078
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Ryan.

569
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,878
Hey. What's going on?

570
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,433
I'm with Marissa,
and I need your advice.

571
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,394
Well, if I've learned anything today...

572
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,869
...you don't wanna go to court
with this.

573
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,156
You're gonna want to settle.

574
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,276
- What is going on?
- Come with me.

575
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,198
What does this have to do with Marissa?
Do you know where she...?

576
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,789
Well, no surprise
you're involved in all this.

577
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,871
Where is she?

578
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,352
I don't know. At a bus station.
On a tropical island somewhere.

579
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,273
I cannot believe
you're chaperoning this farce.

580
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,432
- Julie, sit down.
- No. I don't want to sit down.

581
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,989
All right, let's all talk.

582
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,116
Talk about what?
What is there to talk about?

583
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,158
Well, if you ever wanna
see your daughter...

584
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,719
Watch it.

585
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,790
Julie, I know you've been through a lot,
but Ryan isn't the problem.

586
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,550
What is that supposed to mean?

587
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,473
You tell me where she is
and then I am taking her home.

588
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,155
- She just ran away from a hospital!
- She ran away from you.

589
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,032
Look, you're from Riverside, right?

590
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,350
Well, that's not too far
from where I grew up.

591
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,714
I am calling the police...

592
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,872
And I know this place has
everything we never had...

593
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,634
...and I know you're afraid
you're gonna lose it all.

594
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,789
I'm done.

595
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,996
But you and Marissa
want different things.

596
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,993
- You don't know what she wants!
- I know what she doesn't want.

597
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,037
She doesn't want to go to San Diego.

598
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,316
And she doesn't want to live with you.

599
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,395
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say to any of this.

600
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,152
Just say yes.

601
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,675
Oh, honey.

602
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,434
- No, no, you don't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

603
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,394
Look, I know you're only trying to help,
but you're just making everything worse.

604
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,874
You have no idea how scared I was.

605
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,317
I'm sorry.

606
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,355
But, look, I'm not gonna hurt
myself again.

607
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,350
And I'll even see a therapist if you want.
But I wanna do it here.

608
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,433
And I wanna live with Dad.

609
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,596
I mean, at least for now.

610
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,959
This isn't over, Marissa.

611
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,910
I'll let myself out.

612
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,591
You okay?

613
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,312
So you still think that,
after everything that happened today...

614
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,472
...when we get back to school,
you're gonna be able to ignore me?

615
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,792
- Well, all I can do is try.
- I admire your will.

616
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,959
Hey!

617
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,759
Hey. How'd it go?

618
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,071
- Oh, it's over.
- Yeah?

619
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,869
Somebody should take Marissa home.
To her dad's.

620
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,277
Bye, Summer.

621
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,312
It's just a little thing we do.

622
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,558
Okay. Now, let's talk about
that surprise little trip to Tijuana.

623
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,870
It's pronounced "Tijuana."
You're so white, Mom.

624
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,750
- I've never heard you talk so much.
- I like to save it for when it counts.

625
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,148
Good.

626
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,356
So I heard what happened
with your test today.

627
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,590
Or what didn't happen.

628
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,870
You're suddenly not so talkative.

629
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,792
Look, I get it.

630
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,269
Marissa needed help,
you were worried about her.

631
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,749
Believe me, I understand.

632
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,831
I'm worried about you.

633
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,635
I'm okay going to public school. It'd be
a hell of a lot better than where I went.

634
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,270
- Go to Dr. Kim and explain yourself.
- I don't think she wants to hear from me.

635
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,032
Ever again.

636
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,799
You're afraid of her.

637
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,516
You, who went toe-to-toe
with Julie Cooper, the dragon lady.

638
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,593
You can take Dr. Kim. Talk to her.

639
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,433
If there's a problem,
you'll have your attorney present.

640
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,037
I got your back.

641
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,868
Now, you and Summer seemed
pretty chummy yesterday.

642
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,076
Dad, "chummy"?

643
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,594
- It's okay, you can tell me.
- No, really, I can't.

644
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,079
If you can't tell your dad,
who can you tell?

645
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,075
Gee, I don't know. Ryan, Mom.
That tree over there.

646
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,471
- You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
- When are you leaving?

647
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,794
- What's the verdict?
- He passed. He did very well.

648
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,634
Congratulations! Dude, you're a Pirate.

649
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,916
- You guys are the Pirates?
- Yeah, it's a bit minty.

650
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,275
Thank you for giving Ryan
another chance.

651
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,718
Mr. Cohen, I told Ryan that if he ever
pulls a stunt like that again...

652
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,952
...he's going to need a much better
lawyer than you to get him out.

653
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,278
Welcome to the Harbor School, Ryan.
I'll be watching you.

654
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,114
You thought juvie was tough.

655
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,555
You ready to get your photo taken
for a student ID?

656
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,631
- Another mug shot?
- So cynical.

657
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,314
Hey. Check out my new mug shot.

658
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,552
God! Dad, those eyebrows
