1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,110
Previously on The O. C.:

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,277
Goodbye, Lance.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,756
-Where have you been?
-You' re leaving.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,797
Good luck with your new job, Carter.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,234
So long, Kirsten.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,759
-No one's ever been this nice to me.
-You're Ryan's brother.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,194
No, it is more than that.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,677
Get off of me.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,788
Kirsten, did the paper come today?
I can't find it.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,635
Yeah, I put it on the couch
in the living room.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,198
Hey.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,669
Do you think I look at all like Tony Blair?

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,432
-You have nicer hair.
-Thank you.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,794
Good hair.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,313
Leader of Great Britain.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,959
I would call that a wash.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,838
-What you drinking?
-Oh, tomato juice.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,718
Lots of antioxidants.

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,552
So, what do you think of this?

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,870
-Palm Springs.
-Palm Springs?

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,395
This weekend. You, me and the desert.

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,518
Oh, Sandy, I know we talked
about a weekend, but right now--

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,159
-You asked my opinion.
-Yeah.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,276
-Morning.
-But I wanted you to agree with me.

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,793
-Morning.
-Morning.

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,154
-What's up?
-Well...

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,675
...today's the first day back
from spring break...

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,956
...and I was planning
on telling Summer...

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,759
...about that little misunderstanding
in Miami.

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,990
You licked whipped cream
off a girl's stomach...

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,958
-...and ate a cherry out of her mouth.
-Why would you tell her?

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,394
Because I have a conscience.

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,199
And it'll be on national television,
so she'll find out.

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,635
Look, I know the idea
of telling her is scary...

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,030
...but believe me,
when you start hiding things...

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,830
-...that's when the trouble starts.
-All right, let's go. We're late. Come on.

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,553
Well, there goes the weekend.

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,749
Unless we drive up Sunday morning,
and I take Monday off.

39
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,712
You're right. We need this.

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,196
Well, I'll make the plans.

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,515
-Hello?
-Marissa, don't hang up, okay?

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,468
-Look, I told you to stop calling me.
-Let me exp--

43
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,994
I guess she didn't want to chat.

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,874
What happened?

45
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,635
Stable boy get fresh with the princess?

46
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,752
Don't you have school?

47
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,074
-I was hoping we could....
-I'll pass.

48
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,230
You know, it's not many girls
that would spend the night with a guy...

49
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,551
...and not only not mind him
calling another girl the next morning...

50
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,234
...but still be up for round two.

51
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,158
Sure you're not taking me for granted?

52
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,759
Look, we both know what this is.

53
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,233
Well, we know I'm not Marissa.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,789
I leave my marks on your back.

55
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,518
Hey, Summer.

56
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,519
Hey, Cohen.

57
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,238
Okay...

58
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,836
...the easiest way for me to do this
is just gonna be to say it...

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,471
...but before I do, I want you to know
how totally, you know, awful--

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,232
-I know.
-What?

61
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,958
Miami, whipped cream girl.

62
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,118
We do have cable.

63
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,111
So you saw me?

64
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,271
I saw you.

65
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,397
Okay, so look. I know you're angry,
and that's...

66
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,312
-Not really.
-...perfectly--

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,870
You're not?

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,437
You know, I really thought things
were gonna be different this time.

69
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,472
But you haven't changed at all.

70
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,679
You've found new and even more
public ways of disappointing me.

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,390
Zach and I kissed.

72
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,514
-What?
-Yeah.

73
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,070
We were having dinner,
and you came on TV in that stupid--

74
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,037
Okay, you know what?
Fine. That's okay.

75
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,998
You know, you'd seen me,
and you kissed.

76
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,754
Just a quick, cousinly--
What else happened?

77
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,913
Nothing much.

78
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,633
So, what does this mean?

79
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,552
I don't know.

80
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,909
It shouldn't be this hard.

81
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,079
There you are.
Just in time for your surprise.

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,673
I'm late for work.

83
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,990
You'll want to make time for this.

84
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,712
Bon appétit.

85
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,717
-What is that?
-Eggs Benedict.

86
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,394
My specialty. Well, my new specialty.

87
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,754
It's my first time.

88
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,114
I already ate breakfast.

89
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,475
Well, consider this a midmorning snack.

90
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,832
I was going to give it to you at 7,
but it took a little longer than I expected.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,390
You spent hours making eggs Benedict
for a man with a heart condition.

92
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,032
Doesn't that seem a little insane to you?

93
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,510
I am trying to make an effort here, Cal.

94
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,956
If nothing else,
I expect you to acknowledge that.

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,270
I do. A wasted effort.

96
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,837
-I have to go.
-Why do I even try?

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,878
I ask myself the same question.

98
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,918
Hey.

99
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,119
Sorry. You okay?

100
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,434
Y eah. No, I guess I'm just not used
to the hallway kiss yet.

101
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,238
Oh, sure, of course.

102
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,038
So tell me, how was Miami?

103
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,350
It was a lot like Orange County.
How about you?

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,752
Anything crazy happen while
I was gone?

105
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,879
No. No, it was pretty much
just business as usual.

106
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,237
So we still have our date.
How's your weekend?

107
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,759
What, you got something?

108
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,952
No, just my mom wanted to go
shopping, but this weekend's great.

109
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,109
Okay, great. So....
Well, let's do something special.

110
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,431
Something you wanna do?

111
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,238
No, nothing special.

112
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,960
I mean, nothing in particular.
It'll be special.

113
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,192
So let's just talk about it later, okay?

114
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,352
Yeah.

115
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,272
Come in.

116
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,598
-Oh, hey, Clare. What is it?
-The men were cleaning Carter's office.

117
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,035
They found this,
saying it should be given to you.

118
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,954
Oh, thank you. You can put it there.

119
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,791
Hey, Summer, wait.

120
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,278
-Hey, Zach.
-I need to....

121
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,753
Here.

122
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,550
-Did you talk to Seth?
-Yeah. I told him everything.

123
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,518
Okay, so, what does that mean
about us?

124
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,713
Zach, I can't do this right now.

125
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,156
I need to know if what happened
was just, like, a revenge thing...

126
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,719
...or if it was something more.

127
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,509
Honestly, in the moment,
mostly revenge.

128
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,070
But also, I guess, something more.

129
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,032
Well, well, well.

130
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,839
If it isn't my old friend,
the big fat traitor.

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,353
-Hey, Seth.
-Cohen.

132
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,317
Relax, Summer, I won't make a scene.

133
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,392
-How can you look in the mirror?
-I need to tell you something.

134
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,831
-You know what? Save your apology.
-It's not an apology.

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,433
-I'm quitting the comic.
-What?

136
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,194
-What?
-It's caused too many problems.

137
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,590
-It's not worth it.
-The launch party is Saturday.

138
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,069
Yeah, Zach, you can't.
It means too much to you.

139
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,196
Not as much as you do.

140
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,635
I have to go.

141
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,873
Oh, I see what you're doing.

142
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,952
Let me tell you something.
It's not gonna work, okay?

143
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,430
She will see it for the cheap ploy
that it is, eventually.

144
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,955
Look, Seth, I've always liked you.

145
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,033
But if I have to sacrifice our friendship
to be with Summer, I'll do it.

146
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,668
Amazing. This whole time
I thought you were a nice guy.

147
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,831
Wake up. I'm a water polo player.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,228
We're never nice guys.

149
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,836
Looks like I won't have to add you
to Atomic County. You're already there.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,355
The Demon Water Polo Player,
the lronist's nemesis.

151
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,637
It's gonna take more than quips
and pop-culture-laden bromides...

152
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,028
...to win Little Miss Vixen.

153
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,316
-So it's war.
-It's war.

154
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,991
-My locker's this way.
-So is mine.

155
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,958
Fine, stay on that side of the hall.

156
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,034
What are you doing?

157
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,872
Summer.

158
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,113
Hey, I was-- I was waiting for you.

159
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,272
Look, my car's completely out of gas,
so would you give me a ride?

160
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,198
Sure. Come on.

161
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,471
The thing is, I left a book inside.
Could you pick me up around back?

162
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,473
Yeah. Whatever.

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,753
Oh, Sandy, l-- I thought you'd gone.

164
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,592
No, my first meeting's not till 1 0.

165
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,035
I hope you don't mind, l--

166
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,599
I finished the tomato juice.

167
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,194
But there's coffee.

168
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,272
You know, I'm just gonna go.
I'm a little late.

169
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,159
Hey, I made a reservation
at Korakia in Palm Springs.

170
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,312
It's supposed to be, you know,
really romantic.

171
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,475
Oh, yeah, I checked my schedule.
I don't think I can take Monday.

172
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,513
Come on. It's just one day.

173
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,068
I know, I'm sorry.

174
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,389
Maybe in a couple of weeks.

175
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,275
-But we'll talk about it tonight, okay?
-All right.

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,194
Hey.

177
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,759
What? I don't get a kiss?

178
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,997
Of course.

179
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,353
Oh, is that new?

180
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,396
Yeah. I got it at Featherbrook.
I picked it up at the gift shop.

181
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,272
Well, it suits you.

182
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,271
Have a good day.

183
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,234
-Hey.
-Hey, Zach.

184
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,231
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

185
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,392
Well, let's just go over
the details of the launch.

186
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,109
Yeah, listen, Reed, I only came here
today to let you know...

187
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,838
...I have to pull out of the comic.

188
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,156
-Excuse me?
-Personal reasons...

189
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,793
...which I'm sure Seth
can fill you in on at a later date.

190
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,394
But I wanted to tell you face to face.

191
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,959
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,395
Okay, I know you're young,
and it's a comic book...

193
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,632
...and it's fun, fun, fun,
but to us, this is a business.

194
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,679
And you signed a contract. So unless you
want a lawsuit for the next four years...

195
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,035
...I suggest you stay,
you order a sandwich...

196
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,033
...and let's go over
the details of the launch.

197
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,834
You did this.

198
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,316
Did you threaten to pull out too
if she didn't force me back in?

199
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,789
Zach, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

200
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,315
I'm glad you're back in,
if that's what's going on.

201
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,874
What's it gonna be, gorgeous?

202
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,191
Am I calling my lawyers, or are you
gonna order a crab sandwich?

203
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,069
Crab sandwich.

204
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,709
So, what's today's heart attack special,
Julie?

205
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,792
Deep-fried ribs? Steak tartare?

206
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,520
That Super Size guy ought
to spend some time with you.

207
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,114
This came for you at the house.
Listen, Cal...

208
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,431
-...we need to talk to a counselor.
-Excuse me?

209
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,192
A counselor. A professional.

210
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,591
Someone who can penetrate
that fortress of solitude you've erected.

211
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,236
Of all your ideas,
that has got to be the worst.

212
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,637
Well, then I'm out.
You're not interested in my cooking.

213
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,677
You're certainly not interested
in my body.

214
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,593
You said you wanted to try
and make this marriage work.

215
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,069
You may have a point.

216
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,229
I have been letting you do all the work.

217
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,550
I'm just not a counselor sort of guy.

218
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,395
Sitting on a couch,
talking about my needs.

219
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,677
How about a date?
T omorrow night, The Arches.

220
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,149
I will try.

221
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,634
We can make this work.

222
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,518
Sandy?

223
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,237
Hello?

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,310
Your call has been forwarded
to a voice messaging center.

225
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,040
Please leave a message at the tone.

226
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,953
Hi, Carter, it's-- It's me.

227
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,240
I wanted to thank you for the necklace.
It's beautiful, and....

228
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,515
I' m sorry. I shouldn't have called.

229
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,910
Please don't call back.

230
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,517
-Hey.
-Hey.

231
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,308
Jess. Marissa's pool?

232
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,630
-Floater girl?
-Oh, yeah.

233
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,680
You're Ryan.
Trey and I have been hanging out.

234
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,350
You and Trey.
Just what he needs, more trouble.

235
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,235
You think I'm trouble? You might be
even cuter than your brother.

236
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,916
-Listen, I gotta....
-Oh, right, Marissa's waiting.

237
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,036
Can't keep Marissa waiting.

238
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,955
Think I could borrow a pen?

239
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,840
-Thanks, Ryan. You're a sport.
-Yeah.

240
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,918
-Marissa.
-What are you doing here?

241
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,071
Look, just let me explain, okay?

242
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,753
There's nothing I want to hear.

243
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,512
-Just wait.
-Let go of me.

244
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,750
Marissa! Hi.

245
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,279
Hey.

246
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,839
-Hey, man.
-Hey, Ry.

247
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,592
-How you doing?
-What are you doing?

248
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,955
Just came to thank Marissa
for the Bait Shop gig.

249
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,599
It's really good.

250
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,952
-What'd you do to your head?
-Nothing. I just banged it on a cabinet.

251
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,758
-What's up? You guys wanna grab a bite?
-No. I have to get home.

252
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,512
You know, my mom needs help.

253
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,036
Yeah, I should probably get back to
work. But I wanna hear about Miami.

254
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,679
Definitely.

255
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,550
-Hey. Everything all right?
-Yeah.

256
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,508
-Yeah, just my mom's usual insanity.
-Gotcha.

257
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,275
So tomorrow night
is Seth's comic book thing.

258
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,516
I figured we hit that
then maybe grab dinner?

259
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,272
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah?

260
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,795
-I mean, if you want.
-No. Yeah, sure.

261
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,315
And I promise,
I'll be in a better mood by then.

262
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,510
Let me get you another drink.

263
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,552
-Honey, I'm home.
-Before Tony comes, I--

264
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,075
Hey, I thought we'd go out tonight.

265
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,310
I made a reservation
at that fancy steak joint.

266
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,153
You know, the one with
the really heavy silverware.

267
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,038
What do you say?

268
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,518
Honey.

269
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,073
Honey?

270
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,511
Mark, I know you think it's silly...

271
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,114
...but when you get to know Tony,
you 'll understand why.

272
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,239
Darling, I understand now, but that
doesn 't stop me from loving you.

273
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,311
It's not as simple as that.

274
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,358
Let's get you to bed. Come on.

275
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,476
One, two....

276
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,392
Tony's changed.

277
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,717
He 's a completely different person
to the one I used to tell you about.

278
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,552
Really? When did all this happen?

279
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,517
That night I came to say goodbye.

280
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,631
Rise and shine.

281
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,552
Rise and shine.

282
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,590
It's a beautiful morning.

283
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,349
Come on. Look what I brought you.

284
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,391
Oh, Sandy.

285
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,074
Black coffee, bacon, those waffles
you like so much...

286
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,356
...whipped butter, two fried eggs,
fruit and OJ.

287
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,748
I call it the Whaler.

288
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,399
How can I resist?

289
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,239
Thank you.

290
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,636
You were out cold
when I got home last night.

291
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,633
Yeah, well, I was exhausted.
Long week.

292
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,993
Seemed like it was more
than exhaustion.

293
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,558
What do you mean?

294
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,109
I'm worried about how much
you're drinking.

295
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,273
I-- I'm fine. I was exhausted.

296
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,955
-I had a couple of drinks. So what?
-I'm not just talking about last night.

297
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,869
Have you been watching me?

298
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,473
We do live together.

299
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,230
Should I be concerned?

300
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,557
I'm fine.

301
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,390
Look, maybe I've been drinking
more than usual...

302
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,074
...but, I'll-- I'll-- I'll cut down. Okay?

303
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,593
So it's not something at work?

304
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,349
Taking on too much?

305
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,349
Is it that Carter left?

306
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,230
-What?
-He left very suddenly...

307
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,432
...so I figured maybe you had to do
some of his work too.

308
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,199
I'm fine.

309
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,476
And I'd appreciate it if you'd trust me.

310
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,717
I have to shower.

311
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,633
-I'll put this in the microwave.
-Don't bother. I'm not hungry.

312
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,479
Is that the best you've got?

313
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,074
Yeah, you like that?

314
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,836
Now here's a little something
your master Y oda never taught you.

315
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,558
You just threw your light saber at me
and killed me.

316
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,312
I didn't know you could throw it.

317
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,471
New game, who knew?

318
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,070
Well, too bad Marissa's not here.
The ladies can't resist a young Jedi.

319
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,118
-Yeah, I don't know about that.
-Why, you guys in a fight?

320
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,675
I don't know.
Ever since I got back from Miami...

321
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,751
...she's been acting nervous around me.

322
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,229
Well, you could talk to Summer,
except you cannot...

323
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,915
...because she's off-limits until
phase two of Zach Attack is complete.

324
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,832
But Trey was around last week, right?

325
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,275
-Maybe he knows something.
-Did you say phase two?

326
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,796
Y eah, see, Zach being in the comic book
does me no good unless Summer knows.

327
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,076
And it ain't like he's gonna tell her.

328
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,193
Hello. Hey, excellent.

329
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,918
Is Guy Smiley still with her?

330
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,755
Okay, stay--
No, no, Leon, you can't leave.

331
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,832
I don't care if you got swim lessons.
I'll be there in a minute.

332
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,389
Please tell me you're not using the comic
book club to spy on Summer and Zach.

333
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,474
-Hey, Leon, they still in there?
-They just paid.

334
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,509
Is Zach really trying to destroy
the comic book club?

335
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,956
-What? Oh, yeah. Y eah, totally.
-Seth, I need to get something to eat.

336
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,633
-My blood sugar's all low--
-Okay.

337
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,233
I'll be back. Stay there.

338
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,599
Summer, Zach. Hey, what a surprise.

339
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,359
Cohen. What are you doing here?

340
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,069
Just filling up the tank. You know, got
a big day. Got the launch party tonight.

341
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,955
Hey, Reed wanted me to tell you we
should get there a half-hour early tonight.

342
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,395
Something about a Wizard magazine
interview.

343
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,348
Hey, Dementia Boy, Zach quit
your stupid comic book, remember?

344
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,909
Oh, did you not tell her yet?

345
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,597
Did I put my foot in it again?

346
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,716
-What's he talking about?
-I was gonna tell you.

347
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,950
I'm just gonna go. I'm sorry.

348
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,991
Yo.

349
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,152
Yo.

350
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,719
Hey, man. Got you working, huh?

351
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,711
Oh, yeah. Real slave-drivers.

352
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,478
-What's up?
-Nothing. Listen...

353
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,279
...I gotta ask you something.
Marissa's been acting weird.

354
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,149
She didn't happen to say anything when
you guys were hanging out, did she?

355
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,992
-Nope. I don't think so.
-You sure?

356
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,310
-You didn't notice anything?
-I got a lot of work.

357
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,948
No offense, but I don't want them
to think I'm slacking.

358
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,838
-Yeah, yeah.
-But hey, man...

359
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,191
-...we'll talk later, right?
-Yeah.

360
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,717
Well, well, if it isn't baby brother.

361
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,633
-I just came by to see Trey.
-Me too.

362
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,392
But I could be talked out of it.

363
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,312
Whatever's going on between you two...

364
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,189
-...he needs to get his life back together.
-Come on, it's not like we're serious.

365
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,158
I mean, how could we be?
He's completely obsessed with--

366
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,512
-Well, with someone else.
-Fine. I'm not getting involved.

367
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,355
Well, the fact is, Ryan...

368
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,148
...I've always had this fantasy
about two brothers.

369
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,875
I think that's gonna stay a fantasy.

370
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,274
I get it.

371
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,590
I used to think it was strange too.

372
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,753
But apparently, I'm not the only one
into the brother thing.

373
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,398
I have a problem.

374
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,073
Come on in and join the party.

375
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,472
Okay, I have been shopping
all afternoon, and-- What are you doing?

376
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,270
I'm just erasing every vestige
of Seth and Zach from my life.

377
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,749
As far as I'm concerned,
Reed can have them.

378
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,468
What's up?

379
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,753
Okay, I have this really important date
with Ryan later...

380
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,672
...and I need it to be perfect.

381
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,672
But I can't figure out what to wear.

382
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,435
Please, you could dress as Grimace
and stop traffic.

383
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,674
Man, I look good in this picture.

384
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,879
Okay, what do you think?

385
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,190
Well, let me see.

386
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,395
-What is that?
-What? What?

387
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,232
That.

388
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,836
Coop.
What were you doing, playing rugby?

389
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,956
Yeah, well, I just slipped.

390
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,833
-And fell on your collarbone?
-Wait, so who's Reed?

391
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,310
Oh, she's that busty comic book tart
that turned Seth into an egomaniac...

392
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,710
...by agreeing to publish
his graphic novel...

393
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,395
...and then threatened to sue Zach
if he pulled out of the comic.

394
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,391
Oh, my God. This is so her fault.

395
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,232
-What?
-Don't you see?

396
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,789
Before she came, there was
no scheming, no fighting...

397
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,997
...the comic book was deader than dead.

398
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,110
Wait. Where are you going?

399
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,840
Nobody messes with my men but me.

400
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,638
Oh, it is ass-kicking time, Coop.

401
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,354
Wear the black.
He won't know what hit him.

402
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,916
Julie. What are you doing here?

403
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,469
I need to talk.

404
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,350
Come to the kitchen.

405
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,993
You want a drink?

406
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,549
Isn't it a little bit early?

407
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,593
What do you want to talk about?

408
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,350
Well, your father.

409
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,030
-It's not too early.
-Good point. Okay.

410
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,274
Here's the thing. Has he said
anything to you about us?

411
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,435
My dad doesn't exactly tell me
about his romantic life.

412
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,398
Yeah, I figured.

413
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,393
It's just that I really, really want
this marriage to work, Kiki.

414
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,076
I mean, he says he does,
but I don't know if he means it.

415
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,912
I mean, he's--

416
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,478
Oh, my gosh.

417
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,230
-What?
-How much vodka did you put in this?

418
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,993
A normal amount.

419
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,799
-A little less.
-Okay.

420
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,438
-ls everything all right? Where's Sandy?
-Out.

421
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,479
-Did something happen? You two fight?
-No.

422
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,475
Yes. Oh, God, I don't know.

423
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,878
Seems like we've been fighting
since September.

424
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,712
Kirsten...

425
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,153
...now, I know that I'm probably the last
person you want to bare your soul to...

426
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,232
...but it's better than getting smashed
in the middle of the day.

427
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,198
-What happened?
-What happened?

428
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,516
The boys left for the summer,
Sandy and I stopped communicating...

429
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,990
...Rebecca Bloom came along
and made things worse.

430
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,596
And then Carter.

431
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,432
Well, he was cute.

432
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,552
Something happened
between me and Sandy.

433
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,474
This wall came between us.

434
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,077
And Carter just made me feel
less alone...

435
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,675
...Iike Sandy used to.

436
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,757
And now he's gone.

437
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,349
Make sure Kid Chino's
not blocking Cosmo Girl.

438
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,669
All right.

439
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,517
I have a question.

440
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,715
Where's your cutout?
Or have they not made Super Bitch yet?

441
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,233
Is this about Seth and Zach?

442
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,918
You and your comic have turned
those two idiots into complete idiots.

443
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,354
Graphic novel.

444
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,317
And I'm trying to run a business.

445
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,591
You have played one against the other.

446
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,196
Manipulating Seth, threatening Zach
so you'd end up with all the power.

447
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,476
-Sorry you feel that way.
-Well, you're gonna be.

448
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,791
I'm going to tell them if either of them
has anything to do with you...

449
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,757
...I'm never speaking to them again.

450
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,593
Seth and Zach have talent.
They could have careers in comics.

451
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,035
But you're the Nico of the group.

452
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,794
I'm sorry.
I don't get references before 1 990.

453
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,916
It's your picture
people are gonna ask for.

454
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,870
It's your face on the magazine covers.
What do you want?

455
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,871
A career in fashion? Movies?

456
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,476
This is the perfect launching pad.

457
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,712
Do you think I'll be able to control them
once you have the limelight?

458
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,075
It'll be your show.

459
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,356
You're manipulating me.

460
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,590
But I think I like what you're saying.

461
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,672
I have some outfits I want to show you.
Tell me about Super Bitch.

462
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,628
-Think she could support her own comic?
-No. Not so much.

463
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,558
-Hey.
-Hey. I was gonna pick you up.

464
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,474
Oh, that's okay.
I wanted to surprise you.

465
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,399
Is this okay for a comic book launch?

466
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,471
It'll do.

467
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,358
So listen...

468
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,312
...you've been....

469
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,990
Is everything okay?

470
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,391
Why don't you tell me?

471
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,797
-No one's ever been this nice to me.
-Yeah, because your Ryan 's brother.

472
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,279
It's more than that.

473
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,192
One night. No one needs to know.

474
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,555
Get off of me.

475
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,718
Nobody needs to know.

476
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,398
Hey, hey. What's wrong?

477
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,551
I' m sorry. I can't do this.
I thought I could.

478
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,551
It's been too long.
T oo much has happened.

479
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,359
-Okay. All right. Let's talk--
-I'm sorry.

480
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,756
Where've you been?

481
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,875
I was dropping your car off,
you know, at the shop.

482
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,838
It was making a weird noise.

483
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,036
-I got you a rental.
-Thanks.

484
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,152
-We need to talk.
-Why? Does the car need a lot of work?

485
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,551
About us.

486
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,032
Well...

487
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,148
...in that case,
I'm gonna get some more water.

488
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,871
Did something happen
between you and Carter?

489
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,838
-Don't do it like this.
-Just tell me.

490
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,639
-ls that what you really think?
-ls it so crazy?

491
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,758
You have a close relationship
when we're going through a hard time.

492
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,354
-When he leaves, you go on a bender.
-Nothing happened.

493
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,954
The same way nothing happened
between you and Rebecca.

494
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,111
-Why are you bringing that up again?
-Again?

495
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,236
Sandy, what do you think this is?

496
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,311
What do you think Carter was about?

497
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,869
-I want you to tell me.
-You left me.

498
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,632
Did you have an affair with him?

499
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,189
You don't get it, do you?

500
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,192
No.

501
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,432
And then the Demonic Water Polo Player
throws his plasma ball...

502
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,113
...at Kid Chino and the lronist...

503
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,114
...shouting, "Welcome
to Atomic County, bitch. "

504
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,910
Then the next panel here,
Kid Chino catches it. Catches it--

505
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,833
-Thank you, Seth. That was wonderful.
-I wasn't finished.

506
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,470
You read for an hour and described
every panel. You're finished.

507
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,471
Right?

508
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,669
That's right. Seth Cohen.

509
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,958
-That's my water.
-I'm thirsty.

510
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,395
Yeah, because you went on
about 45 minutes too long.

511
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,030
Why don't you get a haircut, okay?
We're sick of the Shaun Cassidy thing.

512
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,428
Guys.

513
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,751
As I was saying,
on behalf of Bad Science...

514
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,388
...we'd like to thank you
for coming to the launch.

515
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,238
We have one final surprise.

516
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,231
After getting your copy signed...

517
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,960
...you will get a photo
with a member of Atomic County.

518
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,949
I give you Little Miss Vixen.

519
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,676
-Nice whip.
-Yeah.

520
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,749
-Mrs. Nichol, you look beautiful tonight.
-Thank you.

521
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,519
Is Mr. Nichol with you?

522
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,878
No, he got held up at the office, so he
asked me to meet him here. Typical.

523
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,871
-Julie Cooper-Nichol?
-Yes?

524
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,758
This is for you.

525
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,434
Please sign to show
you've received them.

526
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,037
-What is it?
-I wouldn't know, ma'am.

527
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,472
You're divorcing me?

528
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,710
-Julie.
-You son of a bitch.

529
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,032
You have fun watching me trying to save
this marriage while you met lawyers?

530
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,634
-Did you enjoy it?
-Don't be ridiculous.

531
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,235
Okay. Fine.
You want out, you got it.

532
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,118
But let me tell you something.

533
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,077
I am going to make you pay.

534
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,674
Prenup or no prenup, I'll bleed you dry.

535
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,831
You won't have a--

536
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,080
You'll have to explain these first.

537
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,118
You had me followed?

538
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,115
You have been monitored to one degree
or another since before we were married.

539
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,312
The affair you had
with your former husband.

540
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,595
The tryst last year
with that high schooler, Luke.

541
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,348
Oh, my God.

542
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,313
I mean, your daughter's boyfriend.

543
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,198
What will people think?

544
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,188
Ex-boyfriend.

545
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,638
Despite all of this,
I was willing to give us a chance.

546
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,474
Until that.

547
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,553
-But nothing happened. This was just--
-Oh, stop it, Julie.

548
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,597
I don't have the stomach for it anymore.

549
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,352
I've gotten a hotel room.

550
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,398
You have a week to find
somewhere else to live.

551
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,074
Then I want you and your daughter gone.

552
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,831
Now get out of my office.

553
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,035
Oh, by the way...

554
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,990
...you're fired.

555
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,673
Thank you.

556
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,233
Cohen, what are you doing?

557
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,278
-Please, I need to talk to you.
-Can't you see I'm working?

558
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,591
Listen, I'm sorry about what
happened in Miami, okay?

559
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,830
I promise you, it will never happen again.

560
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,516
Okay, you'll never go on TV and eat
whipped cream off a naked girl again?

561
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,956
-That's reassuring.
-Look, Summer, I'm an ass, okay?

562
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,839
I know that. And I know
I don't deserve another shot.

563
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,271
But I love you.

564
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,550
And I think you love me too.

565
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,392
Please.

566
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,708
-I knew it.
-Zach, not now, okay?

567
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,599
-You were about to say something?
-Don't listen to him.

568
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,991
-I'm not gonna tell you again, buddy.
-Or what?

569
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,596
-Or you'll see.
-Come on, you guys, don't.

570
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,193
I'm sorry, I just--

571
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,516
Guys, guys, guys, stop.

572
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,110
-You're pinching me.
-You're biting me!

573
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,679
-Watch my eye.
-Stop--

574
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,556
-Stop pulling my hair.
-You guys, stop it!

575
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,916
Summer. Summer, I'm sorry.
Hey, you all right?

576
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,672
Is it bleeding? Can I see it?

577
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,195
Everybody, the reading is over.
Thank you for coming.

578
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,918
-Let me explain.
-Explain this.

579
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,999
Stop it!
God, what is wrong with you two?

580
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,912
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

581
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,914
Summer, look, you're just
gonna have to choose, okay?

582
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,310
-Once and for all.
-He's right.

583
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,596
-You have to choose.
-Fine.

584
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,433
You know what? I choose neither.

585
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,913
-Hey--
-I don't want to hear it.

586
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,469
Just clean it up. Now.

587
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,632
Marissa, hey, it's me again.
Listen, call me back, please.

588
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,552
Tell me what's going on.

589
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,352
Hey.

590
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,596
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, just--

591
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,799
Marissa and I got in a fight about--
I don't even know what.

592
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,715
Must be the night.
I've been trying to find Kirsten.

593
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,348
-I thought she might've come home.
-I haven't seen her.

594
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,118
I'm gonna go back. If she comes back--

595
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,592
-Yeah, yeah, actually, I was gonna--
-Oh, right, of course, go see Marissa.

596
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,073
Hey, you sure it's okay neither of us
are going to Seth's comic book launch?

597
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,800
If I find Kirsten,
I'll get over there before it's over.

598
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,993
-Yeah. Good luck.
-Right back at you.

599
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,708
-How did you get in here?
-The back door was open.

600
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,155
-Look. I just want to talk.
-Get out.

601
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,910
Look, I'm sorry, Marissa.
Okay, I was out of my mind.

602
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,274
And that's an excuse?

603
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,238
Look, I didn't plan it, okay?
It just happened.

604
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,799
I don't want to hear it.

605
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,635
Look, I just-- I just want things
to go back like they were.

606
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,470
-I never meant to hurt you.
-Me? Me? What about Ryan?

607
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,710
I mean, he's your brother. He loves you.

608
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,440
-He would do anything for you.
-Look, I said--

609
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,318
I said I'm sorry.

610
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,356
And so what?

611
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,039
You know, you don't even deserve him
as a brother.

612
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,034
You don't want to accept my apology,
that's fine.

613
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,557
But I want you to promise me
you will not say anything to him.

614
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,717
Get out.

615
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,679
Get out before I call the police.

616
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,638
You wouldn't.

617
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,877
Try me.

618
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,154
Hey, where are you?

619
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,313
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, honey, it was my fault.

620
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,199
You were trying to tell me something,
and I wasn't listening.

621
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,430
Tell me where you are
and I'll pick you up.

622
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,671
I'm coming home.

623
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,398
I thought I was losing you.

624
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,274
That's never gonna happen.

625
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,590
-I love you.
-I love you too.

626
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,830
Now pull over, and I'll come get you.

627
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,553
Kirsten?
