1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,301
Oh, hey,

2
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:10,934
I thought you were
hanging Christmas lights.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, I took a coffee break,
union rules.

4
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:15,334
Well, you better hurry up,
it's going to start
raining any minute,

5
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:17,568
and you know how Seth
loves his rooftop reindeer.

6
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:19,167
Yeah, don't worry,
it'll be up by dinner.

7
00:00:19,234 --> 00:00:21,834
Oh, speaking of dinner,
are you going to bring a guest?

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,867
That's pretty subtle,
Kirsten.

9
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:25,501
I'm not saying
you'd bring Taylor,

10
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:27,568
I'm just letting you know
that she's welcome.
Uh-huh.

11
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:29,534
Well, I don't know.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,201
I don't know,
it's, uh, it's just...

13
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:34,034
Oh, you think that if you invite
her, she's your girlfriend.

14
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:36,834
Boy, so predictable.

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,401
Hey, now, inviting a girl
over for Christmas Eve,

16
00:00:39,468 --> 00:00:41,167
that's like making
some sort of announcement.

17
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:42,401
It's Chrismukkah.

18
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:43,834
We make our own rules.

19
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,468
Fine.

20
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:46,501
Set a place for her.

21
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:47,800
I'll invite her today.
Great.

22
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:50,700
Okay.
Oh, my ham guy.

23
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:13,167
Can't believe we're spending
Christmas in the ghetto.

24
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:15,067
It's not the ghetto.

25
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:17,834
It's Riverside, and it's
where our family is from.

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,067
I thought we were
in denial about that.

27
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:22,367
Kaitlin, in case
you hadn't noticed,

28
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:24,334
we're a little short
on family these days.

29
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:26,134
I think we should
take all we can get.

30
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:29,201
TAYLOR:
* God rest ye merry gentlemen,
let nothing you dismay... *

31
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:31,334
Oh, God, now it's caroling.

32
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,534
Happy holidays.

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,633
Hello.

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,067
Is that a gift for me?

35
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,568
'Cause I forgot to get you one.

36
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:41,134
No, this is for Ryan.
I got him a George Foreman grill

37
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,234
because he likes lean meat,
obviously.

38
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:47,633
Lovely. So, Taylor, uh, Summer's
having dinner with the Cohens,

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,934
but you're welcome
to come with us to Riverside,

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
unless of course you're doing
something with your mother.

41
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:54,134
Oh, no, no.

42
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,900
She sent me a mass E-mail
last week.

43
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,900
She's spending Christmas
in Cabo.

44
00:01:57,967 --> 00:01:59,234
She would've
invited me,

45
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:00,967
but she knows that I don't like
Mexican food.

46
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,633
But it's not a problem because
I'm having dinner over at Ryan's.

47
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,267
Oh, I didn't know you
were invited over there.

48
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,733
I'm not...
well, yet.

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,834
But I'm sure he's
going to ask me.

50
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,234
Well, I mean,
I hope he does.

51
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,334
Well, he will.

52
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,633
So I better go over there
and give him his gift.

53
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,934
Last chance to come
to Riverside.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,834
You want to watch my Aunt Cindy
do whippets underneath the mistletoe?

55
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,267
Uh... no, thanks.

56
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,234
But you guys have
a good time.

57
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,367
Bye.

58
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:35,034
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

59
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,800
I know, where's
the mistletoe, right?

60
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,134
But don't worry,
we can kiss anyway.

61
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,301
Uh, Taylor, I'm a
little busy right now.

62
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,401
Well, don't you want
your present?

63
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:47,067
Just leave it right there.
I'll open it later.

64
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:51,934
You know I just ran into Kirsten
in the kitchen,

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,900
and she was talking to some guy
with a huge ham.

66
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,167
Are you guys having dinner
or something?
Uh, yeah.

67
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,201
Poor Ryan.

68
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:05,568
All of his muscles are so developed,
except for the ones in his mouth.

69
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:07,234
You want to invite me
to Chrismukkah,

70
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:09,834
but you don't know how,
so I will save you the trouble.

71
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,468
I would love to come.

72
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,767
Taylor, look, I don't know
what's going on between us,

73
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:15,434
but it's only been a few weeks.

74
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:20,334
And you think if you invite me
to Chrismukkah,

75
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,633
then that makes me
your girlfriend.

76
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,534
I don't want to hurt
your feelings, but yeah.

77
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:29,101
Hurt my feelings?

78
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,167
Why would that hurt my feelings?

79
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:34,434
Just because I spent
time and money

80
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:35,934
getting you the perfect gift--

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,534
which, by the way, happens to be
the deluxe version

82
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,000
of the George Foreman grill--

83
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:43,900
and in return you give me
a hot, steaming pile
of rejection.

84
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:46,167
Well, you know,
I think that's just fine.

85
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:47,667
(sighs)
Because I'm used
to it, okay?

86
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,301
So here, here it is.

87
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,468
Grill away.

88
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:51,501
Taylor, I don't want this.

89
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:52,967
No, I took your gift--

90
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,434
the holiday-themed
rejection--

91
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,534
so you should take it.

92
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,733
No, you take it.
I bought it for you.

93
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,900
You take it.
It's yours. I...

94
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,201
Taylor!

95
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:05,167
Whoa, it's going to pour.

96
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:07,534
Are you sure this
is a Virginia ham?

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,568
Taylor?

98
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:31,667
Taylor, are you...
are you hurt?

99
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,367
Only my heart, Ryan.

100
00:04:33,434 --> 00:04:34,568
Only my heart.

101
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,034
Come on up,
I'll get you some ice.

102
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:37,800
Oh, you're
offering me ice?

103
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:40,434
Hmm, I guess I should
jump at that.

104
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,067
Here.

105
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:43,367
The receipt's inside.

106
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:45,834
I hope you grill
your face.

107
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:18,334
Oh, so, I was just
in the pool house...
What are you doing in there?

108
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,034
I told the supervisor that
this is off-limits to the staff.

109
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,134
What?

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,134
Where is your supervisor?

111
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,733
Uh, Kirsten, what are
you talking about?

112
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,067
Excuse me, do I know you?

113
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:38,900

116
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:04,467
I said do I know you?

117
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:06,034
Uh, look, I don't know
what's going on, but...

118
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,933
I was up on the
roof with Taylor...

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,034
Is this one of your guys?

120
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,367
Nope, never seen him before.

121
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:13,534
Oh, great.So now I just have
strangers wandering around my house.

122
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:15,267
No, no, no.
Where's Seth?

123
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,200
Oh, you're a friend
of my son's.

124
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:18,800
He's at the comic
book store.

125
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:21,567
If you run into him,
will you tell him
that I need him home by 5:00?

126
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:23,200
Uh... I have a meeting.

127
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:24,367
Now shoo.

128
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,800
I don't want you wandering
around my house.

129
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,301
Hey, kid,I got the feeling
the dragon lady wanted
you out of here.

130
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:47,900
You see, this is why I feel
so strongly about this issue.

131
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:50,701
Take Daryl here.
Last week he was homeless.

132
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:54,601
But because of the money
we've raised, he has a future
to look forward to
in the new year.

133
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:56,334
Well, you're quite the
philanthropist.

134
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:57,367
Yes.

135
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:58,567
And I help people.

136
00:06:58,634 --> 00:06:59,768
Julie.

137
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,501
I love it when they call
me by my first name.

138
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,701
What are you doing?
What is all this?

139
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:05,933
Take this, it's a voucher
for the mission.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,434
Tell them I sent you.

141
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:08,434
You don't know me?

142
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:11,467
I know your pain.

143
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:15,134
See, people think that
Newport Beach is a cold city,
a place of privilege.

144
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,000
But even this poor street urchin
has found hope here.

145
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:20,034
Now you just run
along now, honey.

146
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:22,967
You heard the lady.

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
You guys, come on.

148
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,434
You guys, come on.
You guys, come on.

149
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:34,534
Would you...
would you give me back...

150
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:35,933
Would you give me back
my wallet?

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,534
(mockingly):
Would you... would you
give me back my wallet?

152
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:38,668
Seriously.

153
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,067
Seriously.
Seriously.

154
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:44,067
Hey, hey, give me that.

155
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:45,234
Why, is this
your boyfriend?

156
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:46,734
You guys should get a room.

157
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,601
Yeah. So you can
make love in it.

158
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,267
(scoffs)
I make love to ladies.

159
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:53,567
Hey, man, thanks.
Do I know you from Brown?

160
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:54,668
You go to Brown?

161
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:56,267
Yeah. Who are you?

162
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:58,534
You don't know me either?

163
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:00,100
I can't believe this.

164
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,134
Hey, dork,your girlfriend's
across the way.

165
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,267
Which one?

166
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:04,434
You should check her out.

167
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:06,768
She looks good.

168
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,900
How does Sandy Cohen
have such a loser for a kid?

169
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:11,768
Wait, Sandy Cohen?
You know where he is?

170
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,200
I think I heard he's
at a press conference over at the yacht club.

171
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:15,334
Press conference?

172
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:16,200
Press conference?

173
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:22,267
Oh, just... just
look at her.

174
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,267
Oh, I shouldn't be watching.

175
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,701
Why, bad luck
to see the bride?

176
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:39,134
Yeah, totally.

177
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,267
Oh, God.

178
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:41,334
You okay?

179
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:42,501
Oh!

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,967
MAN:
<i>So what are your plans</i>
<i>for the holidays?</i>

181
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:49,768
This holiday,I think my wife and I
are just going to take it easy.

182
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,134
Your wife?
I thought she
never rested.

183
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,034
True, she's
a very busy lady.

184
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,401
All right, Joe,
thanks very much.

185
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,634
Thanks for your
time, Mr. Mayor.

186
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,833
And thanks for
all your support.

187
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,933
As I always say,
I am mayor of the greatest
city on earth.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,867
Vote Sandy Cohen!

189
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:06,900
You're the mayor?

190
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,501
Why, you want to call
for a recount?

191
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,401
Happy holidays.
Uh, Sandy, Sandy.

192
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,267
Something terrible is happening.

193
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,301
And if anyone can make it
make sense, it's you.

194
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,768
This guy bothering you,
Mr. Mayor?

195
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,933
Uh, no.

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,967
It's fine.
All right, kid,

197
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:21,167
slow down, tell me
what the problem is.

198
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:24,800
Okay. So, uh, I fell off
the roof this morning,

199
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,401
and ever since then
nobody recognizes me.

200
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,401
Even Kirsten threw me
out of the house.
You saw Kirsten?

201
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:31,034
And Seth doesn't know
who I am either.

202
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,567
And he's marrying Summer?

203
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:36,967
I see that you're
having some trouble
and I sympathize
with that.

204
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:41,267
But stalking me
and my family
is not the answer.

205
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,501
Come on, and don't make a fuss.

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,933
Oh, the poor kid.

207
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:55,833
What's the matter?

208
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,867
Can't find your boyfriend?

209
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:27,634
Kirsten.

210
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:28,768
What happened?

211
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,467
Taylor and Ryan,
they were hanging decorations,

212
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:33,567
and I guess the ladder fell.

213
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,000
What did the doctors say?

214
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,334
Well, they said apparently
there's no serious injury,

215
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:38,800
we just have to wait
for them to wake up.

216
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:51,567
Ryan?

217
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:53,234
Is that you?

218
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:54,434
Taylor.

219
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:55,967
You know me?
Oh, my God.

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,467
I found you.

221
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:05,101
We're in a parallel universe.

222
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,467
Exactly.
Okay.

223
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,800
And I'm so grateful
that if I have to be
in a parallel universe,

224
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,134
that you're here with me.

225
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,433
Oh, that's...
Of course
you probably wish

226
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,368
you were with someone you
actually wanted to date.

227
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:15,700
That would be nice,
wouldn't it?

228
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,901
Oh, even in a parallel
universe, she never stops.

229
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:20,034
But I mean, we could also
be asleep, right? Or dead?

230
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,368
Ow.
You're awake.

231
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,201
As for being dead,
I'm guessing if we were,

232
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,433
there would be some kind
of white light situation,

233
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,667
maybe a guy
with a beard.

234
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:32,500
Process of elimination,
parallel universe.

235
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,800
How do you know all this?

236
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,767
Oh, tenth grade I had
a little sci-fi phase.

237
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,700
Alt-universes are huge.
Clearly, you and I

238
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,500
have entered a world
where we don't exist.

239
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,834
But don't despair.
I know the way back
to the real world.

240
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,967
Yeah? Does it involve
me dating you?

241
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:47,167
Well, well, look who's
funny in alt-world.

242
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:48,634
I know.
No, Ryan,

243
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,567
we have been sent here
to fix something.

244
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:52,234
It's the only explanation.

245
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:55,400
Someone or some ones
we know are in trouble.

246
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:56,433
Summer?!

247
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,001
Hi!
Hi!

248
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:59,467
Kiss-kiss.

249
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:00,368
Oh, my God.

250
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,400
Let me see
the hardware.

251
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,101
What, you mean
this old thing?

252
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,867
(squeals):
Oh, my God!

253
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:06,067
Four carats.

254
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:07,167
Oh, my God, it's so pretty.

255
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,368
Can I get a...?

256
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,433
* Ice, ice... *

257
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,834
* Baby! *

258
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:12,700
(humming bass line
to "Ice, Ice, Baby")

259
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,834
* Ice, ice, baby *
Hey, babe.

260
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,867
Whoo!

261
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:18,067
Alt-Summer is
a mindless bimbo.

262
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:19,967
Get it started, Newport!

263
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:21,101
Whoo!

264
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm so excited.

265
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:23,433
So where's the groom?

266
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,834
Oh, you know him,
he's parking.

267
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:27,034
He won't let any of
the valets touch his Hummer.

268
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,234
Right.
Because that's my job,
bitch.

269
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:30,734
Right!

270
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,667
Hey, Holly, looking ripped.

271
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,001
Hey, Chester.

272
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,134
What's up, Mrs. Me?
Mm-hmm, that's me.

273
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:38,834
Okay, wait a second. I thought
you said she was marrying Seth.

274
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:40,800
That's Che, or Chester,
I guess, in alt-reality.

275
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:43,433
What's he doing here?
I thought he goes to Brown.

276
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,700
Okay, what if three years ago
his family had planned to move here

277
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,967
but you did instead,
taking the last spot
at Harbor?

278
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:54,301
So without quality education for their child,
his family moves to Connecticut.

279
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:56,034
But in a world where
you don't exist,

280
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:58,767
the Harbor spot was open,
so his family moves here,

281
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:01,101
thereby allowing Che
to fulfill his alt-destiny

282
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,634
as a Newport bobble head.

283
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,967
Well, obviously this is what
we've been sent here to fix.

284
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:09,734
So, Summer, I saw the most rocked out
chairs at Bergdorf.
You have to come with me.

285
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,700
Ooh... baby.

286
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,034
Do you mind?

287
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:16,268
Um, no, I'll just
go get pumped.

288
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:17,368
But that's my job, bitch.

289
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:20,500
Oh, yeah, give it up.
Whoo!

290
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,067
Ooh...

291
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:25,433
(gasps):
Hey, bitch!

292
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,234
Okay, we need to get
started right away.

293
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:29,400
You go to Seth, find out
where it all went wrong.

294
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:31,433
I will follow Summer
and do some recon.

295
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,667
Uh, where do we meet?

296
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:34,800
It's alt-universe.

297
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,301
We'll just find
each other.

298
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:41,533
Their MRIs came back normal,

299
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,101
no brain damage,
no cause for alarm.

300
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,567
They'll wake up soon, I'm sure.

301
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:47,967
Is there anything
we can do to help?

302
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,167
Talk to them.

303
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:53,134
Make sure they're surrounded
by familiar voices,
music, even smells.

304
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,934
Anything that you think
might stimulate them.

305
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,134
Okay, thank you.

306
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:57,234
Thank you.

307
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:59,368
Well, somebody should
find Taylor's mom.

308
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:00,567
I guess I'll do that.

309
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:02,101
Ew, signing up for
the suicide mission.

310
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,734
Oh, my ham. I have to go home
and turn off the oven.

311
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,433
Seth and I will take
care of the ham.

312
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,167
In fact, she just said we should surround them
with familiar sounds and smells.

313
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:14,234
So I say we bring Chrismukkah
to the hospital.

314
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:15,700
KIRSTEN:
That's a great idea.

315
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,500
And I'll look after
Taylor and Ryan.

316
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:20,967
And you be careful
with my ham.

317
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,433
I'll be very careful.

318
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,533
We're still getting it checked
if it's real.

319
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:35,867
Uh, baby, this is business.
I've got to take this.

320
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:37,433
Okay.

321
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:41,001
Hey, baby.

322
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:43,800
Yeah.

323
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,767
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

324
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:46,967
I'll walk it.

325
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:51,901
You wearing that thong
I bought you?

326
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:53,134
Whoo-hoo.

327
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:54,767
Not for long.

328
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:57,001
All right, love you, too.
Bye.

329
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:04,934
Bye, baby.

330
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:22,667
Hello?

331
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:24,767
Hello?

332
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:26,500
Oh, it's you again.
Looking for Seth?

333
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,934
Uh, yeah, they told me at the
comic book store he came home.

334
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,101
Well, I haven't seen him yet.

335
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,368
You might want
to try him upstairs. Honey?

336
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:33,234
Could you bring
me my glass?

337
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:35,467
Here you go, sweetheart.

338
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:36,667
Oh, thank you.

339
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:38,533
Jimmy?

340
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,101
You know my husband?

341
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:42,533
I don't believe
we've actually met.

342
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:45,967
Oh, this is
a friend of Seth's.

343
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:48,334
Oh.
I know, it must be
a Christmas miracle.

344
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Well, you should come
to the party tonight.

345
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,234
All of Newport's
going to be there.

346
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:55,567
Well, they better be,
if they want to keep
doing business with
the Newport Group.

347
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:57,101
Seth!
JIMMY:
He's not home.

348
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,834
He's probably out
stalking Summer Roberts.

349
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:01,600
(Kirsten chuckles)
I'm going to go.

350
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:05,201
Well, you should stop by,
it starts around 7:00.

351
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,734
Interesting.

352
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:19,967
SANDY:
Oh, and "philanthropist"
means you help people.

353
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:21,800
Oh, well, you learn
something every day.

354
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,500
Listen, are you coming
home before the party?

355
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,034
You know how you sweat
through your shirts.

356
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:27,234
SANDY:
Can't we make some excuse?
Listen, honey,

357
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:30,134
as long as you're mayor
and she is head of
the Newport Group,

358
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:31,934
you're gonna have to
deal with each other.

359
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:34,901
Honestly, I don't know how
you were ever married
to that ice queen.

360
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:37,967
Well, we were different
people back then.

361
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,734
I'll be home
in a couple hours.

362
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,767
Bye.

363
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:04,700
Joinx!

364
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:21,101
(Chester barking)

365
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:24,268
(Julie squealing)

366
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,433
Double-O joinx.

367
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
Oh!

368
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,533
CHESTER (groans):
Oh, give it to me!

369
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,334
Oh! Daddy like!

370
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,533
Daddy like!

371
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,667
I'm a bad kitten!

372
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,500
Mima?

373
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,667
Hi.

374
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,067
No?

375
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:51,634
Yes, you don't know me.

376
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,467
Uh, I was just...

377
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:54,634
You come visit Missy Cooper?

378
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,667
Yes,

379
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:57,767
yes, that's
exactly what...

380
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,001
She come home 3:00.

381
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,634
Plane from Berkeley.

382
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:11,167
Triple-O joinx.

383
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:20,567
(laughing)

384
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:25,700
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, move over.

385
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:27,034
Taylor, why don't you
just sit over...?

386
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,334
Ryan, don't worry.

387
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,067
It doesn't mean we're
boyfriend and girlfriend.

388
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:32,101
I have huge news.
Yeah, well, me, too.

389
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:34,167
Sandy and Kirsten are divorced
and she and Jimmy are married.

390
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:36,101
Ew, yikes, that is huge.

391
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,533
I can beat it, though.

392
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,700
Sandy Cohen
is married to Julie.

393
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,034
What?
And she's having
an affair with Che.

394
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:43,767
Whoa.
Okay, all right,

395
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:47,167
so this means we need
to get Sandy and Kirsten
back together
and Seth...

396
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:48,834
Ryan, there's
something else.

397
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,034
Yeah, what else?
Um...

398
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,268
In this world, Marissa's alive.

399
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,334
I was in her room
and Mima said

400
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,368
her plane lands
at 3:00 from Berkeley.

401
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,067
Now it seems like everyone
is going to this party
at Kirsten's, so I think

402
00:19:06,134 --> 00:19:08,834
that we can use
this opportunity
to reunite the Coopers
and the Cohens

403
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:10,734
with their
rightful partners.
Uh, Taylor,
can you let me out?

404
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,368
Why? Do you have to go
to the bathroom?
I haven't had to go.

405
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,400
It seems like it's not
an issue in an alt-world.

406
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:16,767
Taylor, seriously,
let me out.

407
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:19,234
Are you going to the airport?

408
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
Ryan, she won't even know you.

409
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:24,467
It doesn't matter.

410
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,101
Even if Marissa is fine
in this world,

411
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,368
which, thank God she is,

412
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,134
we need to focus on
fixing what is broken.

413
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,167
Because that's
what's going to get us
back to the real world.

414
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:33,767
But if she's alive...

415
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:37,134
Then you don't want to go back?

416
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:43,567
Okay.

417
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,467
I get it.

418
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,734
You... you got to go.

419
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:57,268
Sorry.

420
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:09,400
I can't believe we have to drive
to Riverside in this.

421
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:10,834
Oh, no, honey,
I told you.

422
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:12,533
My family only drinks
wine coolers.

423
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,433
We're having a very
Britney Christmas, Mother.

424
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,301
Yes, watch out.
I might put you on my lap
while we drive
out there.

425
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:19,400
Oh, thank God
you're still here.

426
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:20,800
Ryan and Taylor
are in a coma,

427
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:21,934
but we're not
supposed to worry.

428
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:23,034
What are you talking about?

429
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:24,368
They fell off a ladder.

430
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,533
But the doctor says
they're fine.

431
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,967
We just have to wait
for them to wake up.

432
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,167
So it's a coma light?

433
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:29,567
Exactly. I have to find
Veronica Townsend.

434
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:30,734
Do you know where she is?

435
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,734
Taylor said she's
flying to Cabo tonight.

436
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,268
But she may have
already left.

437
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,934
I really don't
think that Veronica

438
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,834
is going to care if
Taylor's in a bogus coma.

439
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:39,634
Well, it doesn't matter.
Her daughter's in the hospital.

440
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,268
She needs to know.
Come on, I'll drive.

441
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,234
You don't have to.

442
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:43,533
Taylor is my
responsibility.

443
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,867
She's living in my house.
Come on.

444
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:46,034
So no Riverside?

445
00:20:46,101 --> 00:20:47,134
Sweet.

446
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:50,634
I mean, I hate comas.

447
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,368
Let's go find Veronica.

448
00:20:58,167 --> 00:20:59,201
Oh, Mrs. Cohen.

449
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:01,533
The EMT just came by.

450
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,034
He found this
in his ambulance.

451
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:04,700
Thought it might've fallen
out of your son's pocket.

452
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:07,134
Oh, thank you.

453
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:10,268
I've been talking to them
and reading to them
out loud.

454
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:11,734
I know the doctor
says not to worry...

455
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
I know, it's hard.

456
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,101
But in these situations,

457
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,400
a lot depends
on the patients

458
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:19,167
healing themselves,
mentally and physically.

459
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:23,067
When they finish whatever
they need to finish,
they'll wake up.

460
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:25,867
Thanks.

461
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:01,900
Marissa?

462
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:05,234
Who are you?

463
00:22:05,301 --> 00:22:07,767
Uh, I'm sorry.
I thought, uh...

464
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,034
What, you knew my sister?

465
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,568
I thought she was coming
home from Berkeley.

466
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:12,867
No, that's me.

467
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:14,634
The youngest in
my freshman class.

468
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,401
Sort of a prodigy.

469
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:19,467
Uh, what... what
did you mean "knew"?

470
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:23,568
She died three years ago.

471
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:26,867
What?

472
00:22:26,934 --> 00:22:30,434
She OD'd in an alleyway
in Tijuana.

473
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:37,067
Well, that's really the way
I want to start
my Christmas vacation.

474
00:22:37,134 --> 00:22:38,700
Wait, who are you again?

475
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:41,267
No one.

476
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:44,700
Oh, okay.
Well, Merry Christmas.

477
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:55,034
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:06,334
Ryan, you gave her
three more years.

479
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,201
She got to
fall in love.

480
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:09,267
She got to graduate.

481
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:10,733
And then she still died.

482
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,667
Which just means that you
weren't meant to save her.

483
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:15,134
So if there's
any part of you

484
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:16,267
that's still
blaming yourself

485
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:17,934
for what happened,
you have to let it go.

486
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,667
You've done so much
for everybody.

487
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,800
Yeah, like what?
Ryan, haven't you been
paying attention?

488
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,800
You saved the Cohens.

489
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:25,867
Without you, Seth is
the next unibomber,

490
00:23:25,934 --> 00:23:27,900
Sandy is married
to Slutty McSlutterman,

491
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,600
and Kirsten probably
hasn't had an orgasm

492
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,134
in, like, a year.
Uh, all right,
all right.

493
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,034
And if you think that I'm just
gonna let you give up,

494
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:34,434
you're crazy.
Taylor, I said
all right.

495
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:36,800
Oh. Oh, good.

496
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:38,301
Okay.

497
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:41,733
Has anyone ever
said "no" to you?

498
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,434
Once.
And I pushed him off the roof.

499
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,633
Kidding.

500
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,934
Let's save the Cohens
and go home.

501
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,767
All right.
Okay.

502
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,667
An alternate universe?

503
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:53,334
It's the only
obvious explanation.

504
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:55,733
"Obvious" might not be
the word I would use.

505
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,667
They both got knocked out
at the same time

506
00:23:57,733 --> 00:23:59,800
and neither is waking up.
Like Dorothy in Oz.

507
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:01,967
And just like Dorothy
had to go see the wizard,

508
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:03,568
they've got some mission
to accomplish

509
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:04,967
before they can return.
Like what?

510
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:06,667
Uh, anything.

511
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:09,334
Could be like our world,
only messed up.

512
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:11,501
They've got to
reset the balance.

513
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:14,000
Or could be a world ruled by
giant vegetables,

514
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:16,967
and they've got to topple
the vegetable despot
before they can come back.

515
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:18,367
You had me till
vegetable despot.

516
00:24:18,434 --> 00:24:19,468
It makes perfect sense.

517
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:24,167
Hello.

518
00:24:24,234 --> 00:24:25,468
Sandy,

519
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:28,201
I think I know why Ryan
hasn't woken up.

520
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:36,201
Hi.

521
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,301
Okay, now before we can reunite everyone
with their rightful partners,

522
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:40,568
we need to
prep them first.

523
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:42,867
So I will take Kirsten
duty and you can...

524
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:44,534
Ooh.

525
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,301
I already told you, I'm not
going to your stupid party.

526
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:49,034
Because Summer Roberts
is going to be here?

527
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:50,834
Since when are you
avoiding her?

528
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,534
Since she got engaged
to that burly ding-dong.

529
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,367
You have fun.

530
00:24:54,434 --> 00:24:55,434
I'm on it.

531
00:25:01,468 --> 00:25:03,000
Taylor, what
are you doing?

532
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:04,534
I told you not
to wear that suit.

533
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,167
Your ass looks like
the back of a truck.

534
00:25:06,234 --> 00:25:07,334
Oh, my God.

535
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:09,000
In alt-world, I'm a boy.

536
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:10,401
Maybe I should try Pilates.

537
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,401
They say it elongates you.
Outside.

538
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:14,401
Go stand against the wall.
Go, come on.

539
00:25:14,468 --> 00:25:17,534
And my mom is still a bitch.

540
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:30,568
Veronica.

541
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:31,633
Veronica.

542
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,167
Thank God,
we caught you.

543
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:34,900
Oh, Julie, please don't tell me
you're going to Cabo, too.

544
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,000
Veronica, you can't
go to Mexico.

545
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,568
Taylor is in the hospital.

546
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:38,401
Anorexia?

547
00:25:38,468 --> 00:25:39,867
No, she fell off a ladder.

548
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:42,301
Oh.
The doctor says
she'll be fine,

549
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:43,301
but she's not waking up.

550
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:44,568
Maybe if she
heard your voice.

551
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:45,700
Summer has a car
outside...

552
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:46,800
I'll call from Cabo.

553
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:48,267
Veronica, listen.

554
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:50,034
I know you're not
the warm and fuzzy type.

555
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:51,700
But it is Christmas Eve

556
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:53,967
and it would mean so much
if you could be there.

557
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:58,401
And if you get on
that plane right now,

558
00:25:58,468 --> 00:25:59,767
I'll tell security
you have a bomb.

559
00:26:01,134 --> 00:26:04,700
Wow, very
Jack Bauer of you.

560
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:06,967
All right.

561
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:08,700
All right, come on,
put this on.

562
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,468
No, hate my life!

563
00:26:10,534 --> 00:26:13,000
I hate my life...!

564
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:14,234
I hate my life!

565
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:15,733
Yeah, no wonder Summer
doesn't like you.

566
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,600
See?!
Even you think so.

567
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,534
And no offense,
but it's kind of weird,

568
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
you having such a vested
interest in my love life,

569
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,134
considering I just met you
this morning.

570
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:24,733
All right.

571
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,501
You want the truth?

572
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:26,900
Huh?

573
00:26:26,967 --> 00:26:27,934
Huh?

574
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,568
I know the truth.

575
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:31,267
You know the truth?
Yeah.

576
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:34,767
I'm from an alternate universe
where your dad adopted me

577
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:36,600
and you and Summer are in love.

578
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,767
And unless I fix
things here,

579
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:40,867
which means
getting your parents

580
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:42,600
and you and Summer
together,

581
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,101
I can't go home.

582
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:50,767
I always knew this would happen.

583
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:51,733
Doesn't surprise me.

584
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,334
Put this on.
Okay.

585
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:55,900
Now, I'm going
to tell you exactly
what you need to know
to woo Summer.

586
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:58,468
Have you ever heard of
a show called <i>The Valley?</i>

587
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:04,434
Hey.

588
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,301
It's a great party, huh?
Yes.

589
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:09,468
I'm so glad that the mayor
let me off so that I could come.

590
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:10,667
You work for the mayor?

591
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:11,967
Mm-hmm.

592
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:14,301
How... well,
what's that like?

593
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:18,967
Honestly, it's amazing that
anything ever gets done.

594
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:21,401
What with the mayor moping
and crying all day

595
00:27:21,468 --> 00:27:23,301
about how he's still in love
with his ex-wife.

596
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:25,800
But I probably shouldn't be
airing his dirty laundry.

597
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:29,167
I mean, she must be around here
somewhere, right?

598
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,834
Well, I better mingle.
Ta.

599
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,434
Good, you got
a jacket from Seth.
Yeah.

600
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,767
Did it go okay?
Great. He's going over
stalking points right now.

601
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:46,301
Well, I am doing some serious
Jedi mind tricks on Kirsten.

602
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:48,267
(Chester barking)

603
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,334
RYAN:
There's couple number two.

604
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:53,401
Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas.

605
00:27:53,468 --> 00:27:55,434
Oh!
That's my man.

606
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:58,367
Okay, so what we need to do
is get Kirsten and Sandy

607
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:00,534
and Seth and Summer alone
together for ten minutes.

608
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Which means removing
the obstacles.

609
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,234
You take Julie,
I've got Chester.

610
00:28:04,301 --> 00:28:05,900
Hey, wouldn't this
actually be fun,

611
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,700
you know, if you were actually
doing it with somebody

612
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:08,800
who you wanted to date?

613
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:09,967
Go.

614
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:11,167
Okay, I'll stop.

615
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,700
Hi.

616
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,301
Good grub.

617
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:24,967
Yeah.
So, listen,

618
00:28:25,034 --> 00:28:27,034
a red-haired lady wanted
me to give you a message.

619
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:29,034
She's in
the master bathroom

620
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:32,934
and she needs help
with something.

621
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,600
A little thong removification.

622
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,633
Charming.

623
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,633
Well, uh, she's waiting.

624
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,167
Hey, I have a good idea.

625
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:42,967
Hmm?

626
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:46,267
Why don't you come with?

627
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:49,900
Wow, really tempting.
Um, I'm going to pass.

628
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:54,900
Ew.

629
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,267
Good to see you again.

630
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,633
Thanks for coming.

631
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,867
Hi.

632
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:02,201
Hello.

633
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:03,201
Hi.

634
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:04,501
Do I know you?

635
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:08,000
There's some guy
who wants to meet you
in the master bathroom.

636
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:11,534
Something about
getting a thong on?

637
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,967
Oh.

638
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:15,301
That's charity talk.

639
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:20,000
"Thong" is an acronym for
The Homeless of Newport...

640
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:24,067
Go... or something.

641
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,301
Excuse me.

642
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:33,134
Just do me a favor,
and don't get caught.

643
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:34,600
Mr. Mayor.
Yes?

644
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:37,534
Hi, I was wondering,
do you have time for
a quick question?

645
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,967
I'm hoping it's about
the new hospital.

646
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:40,934
Because Dr. Henry Griffin
and I have some big plans.

647
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,767
Actually, it's about
relationships.

648
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:44,633
You see, you and I are kind
of in the same position,

649
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,000
because I just broke
up with this guy,

650
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:47,934
and he refuses
to move on.

651
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,101
I'm not sure how
this applies to me.

652
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,468
Mr. Mayor, come on.

653
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:52,234
I mean, your ex-wife will
tell anyone who listens

654
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:54,034
about how much she's
still in love with you.

655
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:55,267
I work at
the Newport Group.

656
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:57,267
And it is amazing that
anything ever gets done.

657
00:29:57,334 --> 00:29:58,501
Young lady, I don't know you.

658
00:29:58,568 --> 00:29:59,600
But I do know

659
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,134
that this is not
an appropriate conversation.

660
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,568
So please excuse me.

661
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:06,568
Uh, mail truck.

662
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:09,201
What?

663
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:11,000
Uh, yeah, um...

664
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:13,301
from the old days at Berkeley,

665
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,034
when you guys
first fell in love.

666
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:16,600
She won't shut up
about it.

667
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:17,834
Mail truck, mail truck,
mail truck.

668
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,501
It's just crazy, huh?
Bye.

669
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,800
SUMMER:
<i>So, wait,</i>

670
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,867
you're saying that you ride
horses in the valley?

671
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:33,900
No, no, I like plastic horses
and the show <i>The Valley.</i>

672
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:36,034
Hey, I like that show, too,

673
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,967
and plastic horses.
What's yours' name?

674
00:30:38,034 --> 00:30:40,167
Uh, Princess Sparkle.

675
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:42,367
Wait, no, no,
I mean Captain Oats.

676
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:43,800
I just said
"Princess Sparkle,"

677
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,134
'cause I think that's
a really cool name.

678
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:47,600
No way!

679
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,600
You are not going
to believe this.

680
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:53,167
How's it going?

681
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:54,900
Well, I read lips,

682
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:56,501
and in the past
two minutes, the words

683
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:59,000
"mail truck"
have come up nine times.

684
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,101
We might actually
pull this off.
Mm-hmm.

685
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,733
VERONICA:
Lots of teenage boys get lipo.

686
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,900
It's no big deal.

687
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:05,067
And stop picking
at your man girdle.

688
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:06,534
But, Mom?
What?

689
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,800
You have
something to say?

690
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,867
No.

691
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:13,134
You know what?

692
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:16,367
I think it's time
I talk to her as an adult.

693
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,067
Okay, you can do this.

694
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,201
Do what? Eat?

695
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:27,367
Well,
that's apparent.

696
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:29,501
Shut up.

697
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:31,568
Why do you have to be so mean?

698
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:34,401
Neither he nor I
are remotely fat.

699
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:36,867
We are smart and attractive,

700
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:39,134
and interesting
and people like us.

701
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:41,767
And we are not going to let you

702
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,767
make us feel bad
about ourselves anymore.

703
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:45,034
No?

704
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:46,900
Well, I imagine the mirror
does that for you.

705
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:49,234
You bitch!

706
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:50,468
Oh, my God.

707
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:56,733
You all right?

708
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,034
I just can't believe
I just said that.

709
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:01,034
I mean, I've been
waiting for so long.

710
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:03,167
I can't believe
I finally did it.

711
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:04,468
I'm proud of you.

712
00:32:04,534 --> 00:32:07,234
Thanks, Ryan, I...

713
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,867
Whoa.

714
00:32:08,934 --> 00:32:09,967
What is it?
What's wrong?

715
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:12,534
I don't know,
I ju...

716
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,733
Do you hear something?

717
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,733
Almost like rain?

718
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:19,800
Stay here, I'll get you
a glass of water.

719
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:21,534
Okay.

720
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:24,600
JIMMY:
In my own house?

721
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,468
In my own bathroom?

722
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:27,900
I have to brush
my teeth in there.

723
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,134
So do I, but I don't
use a toothbrush.

724
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:31,867
(laughs):
Yeah, dawg.

725
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:34,568
Oh, Julie, you haven't
changed a bit.

726
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,468
Maybe you should learn to knock.
What's going on in here?

727
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:37,934
Well, Mr. Mayor,

728
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,767
let me just tell you what
I found your wife doing.

729
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:40,800
Jimmy, don't.

730
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:41,633
Whoo...

731
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,667
Well, suffice to say,

732
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:44,834
her thong was

733
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,000
in his mouth.

734
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,700
Shut up!

735
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:53,234
Baby, it was stuck. I was only
trying to help her out.

736
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:55,034
Oh, but that's what you said
with Holly.

737
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:56,534
How come all these women
around you

738
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,067
keep getting their thongs stuck?

739
00:32:58,134 --> 00:32:59,501
I'm starting to get suspicious.

740
00:33:04,468 --> 00:33:06,000
Geek, move it or lose it.

741
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,501
Then I will lose it,
whatever it... is.

742
00:33:09,568 --> 00:33:10,568
Mm-hmm.

743
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:13,600
All right, well,
it's your funeral.

744
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:14,633
All right.

745
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,434
(whispers):
Oh, snap.

746
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:19,967
Thong emergency.

747
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:21,034
(growls)

748
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,568
That was, like, so brave.

749
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh, Julie, how
could you do this?

750
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:28,067
Please, Sandy,

751
00:33:28,134 --> 00:33:29,733
we both know
our marriage is a sham.

752
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,334
JULIE:
You only married me
so I could mastermind
your political career.

753
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:34,301
What are you doing with Miss
Queen of the North over here?

754
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:35,600
Don't you know?

755
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:39,867
He spends all day crying
about me at the office.

756
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,667
What are you
talking about?

757
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:42,534
Everybody knows, Sandy.

758
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,000
In the same way that everybody
knows how you go on and on

759
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,367
about the mail truck?

760
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:49,301
I never told anybody
about the mail truck.

761
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:51,334
Well, not according
to her.

762
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:54,401
Well, she's the girl that told
me you spend all day crying.

763
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,800
Uh-oh.

764
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:00,401
Sorry.

765
00:34:00,468 --> 00:34:03,700
Apparently, people don't stock
clean glasses in the alt-world.

766
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,201
What's up?

767
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:08,667
Oh, it's the street urchin.

768
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:10,000
I knew not to trust him.

769
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:12,534
I think you two
better start talking.

770
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,234
Absolutely.
Taylor?

771
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:16,034
Oh, don't worry.
I know exactly what to say.

772
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:17,733
Okay, people,

773
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,967
I can explain everything.

774
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:19,700
(startled gasp)

775
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,600
Sorry.

776
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:22,700
What?

777
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:24,401
TAYLOR:
Just feel a little dizzy.

778
00:34:24,468 --> 00:34:25,534
I...

779
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,101
Oh, no.

780
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,934
Ryan, I think I have to go.

781
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,201
What?
What do you mean?

782
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:32,201
It must be because I stood up
to my mom.

783
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:33,867
That's what I was here to do.

784
00:34:33,934 --> 00:34:35,434
Ryan?
Yeah?

785
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:36,967
You have to get everyone
together.
No.

786
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,234
It's the only way back.

787
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:40,134
RYAN:
Taylor, no,
I can't.

788
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:41,367
Taylor...

789
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:42,800
What?
Huh?

790
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:44,034
Just hold on.

791
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,667
Taylor?

792
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:02,434
Taylor, honey?

793
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:05,568
You need to be with Sandy Cohen.

794
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:07,900
I'm going to get the doctor.

795
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:21,133
SANDY:
So?

796
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,133
Are you going to explain
yourself?

797
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:26,901
The truth is,

798
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:30,300
things the way they are now
are completely wrong.

799
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,300
SUMMER:
Who's this random guy
we're all listening to?

800
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:33,601
And why am I not drunk yet?

801
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:34,968
Okay, look, none of you know me.

802
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,133
But, uh, the truth is
that each of you saved my life

803
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,501
just by being who you are.

804
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:42,300
And right now none of you
are who you are.

805
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,801
Like Summer, for example.
What are you doing?

806
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:47,434
What?

807
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:49,734
I mean, Che, Chester, he's, he's
completely wrong for you.

808
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:50,801
You should be with Seth.

809
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,133
Kirsten, all right, you don't
want to run the Newport Group.

810
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,300
That place makes you miserable.

811
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:58,834
And you may like your
Chardonnay, but

812
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:01,934
I got news for you, it doesn't
like you back, and Sandy,

813
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,367
you don't want
to be mayor.

814
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:05,667
You're all about saving the
little guy, not holing up

815
00:36:05,734 --> 00:36:08,067
in some mansion,
giving orders.

816
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,167
What you two are best at is
being married to each other.

817
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:18,400
There he is.

818
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,534
Get him out
of here.

819
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:22,400
Um, okay,
before I go,

820
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:25,968
Sandy, Kirsten, Seth and Summer,
promise me you'll be together.

821
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:30,400
KIRSTEN:
Hey, Veronica, good news.

822
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:33,367
Taylor's awake, and the doctor
said she's going to be fine.

823
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:35,234
I stay home from Cabo
and she's fine?

824
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,067
Hi, Mom.

825
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:38,567
And you're walking even?

826
00:36:38,634 --> 00:36:40,100
Geez.
Veronica, your daughter is okay.

827
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:41,734
You should be happy.

828
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:44,234
Oh, Julie, it's okay, I got it.
Mom, why don't you go to

829
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,634
the airport? I bet you could
catch the last flight to Cabo.

830
00:36:46,701 --> 00:36:49,300
Well, I guess
I could still make it,

831
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:52,334
but I'll probably
have to fly coach.

832
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,501
Merry Christmas, Mom.

833
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:01,734
Yeah.

834
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,000
You okay?

835
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,567
Yeah.

836
00:37:10,634 --> 00:37:14,200
I don't know why,
but I feel just fine.

837
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,701
Huh.

838
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:25,067
Julie?

839
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:27,701
Hmm?

840
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,901
You should see this.

841
00:37:29,968 --> 00:37:32,367
I haven't read it.

842
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:34,701
Oh, my God.

843
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,634
You, uh, you seen my hat?

844
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:57,934
You threw
up in it.

845
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,200
Right.

846
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:01,434
Atwood, there's someone here

847
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:02,767
to bail you out.

848
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,033
(weary sigh)

849
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,267
Thanks.

850
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:18,567
I don't know who you are,

851
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:21,767
but a lot of what you said
back at the house made sense.

852
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:25,234
So why do you care so much
about getting a bunch of
strangers back together?

853
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,901
Well, I guess I thought
it would get me back home, too.

854
00:38:27,968 --> 00:38:30,801
But I was wrong.
Can I ask what happened?

855
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:34,133
How'd your family fall apart?

856
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,968
Hmm.

857
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:40,467
I think it all goes
back to when Marissa Cooper

858
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:41,801
died three years ago.

859
00:38:41,868 --> 00:38:43,701
She was Jimmy and
Julie Cooper's daughter.

860
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:44,701
I knew Marissa.

861
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:47,100
Well, after she died,

862
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,767
it was like
everybody got stuck.

863
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,601
Didn't know how to say good-bye?

864
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,467
Maybe you're right.

865
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:56,567
What are you doing
for dinner?

866
00:38:56,634 --> 00:39:00,133
How about you come
over to the house?

867
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,133
There's someplace
I gotta go. Thanks.

868
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,801
You're welcome.

869
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:07,734
Oh, I was just
calling you.

870
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:09,534
Julie, Summer
and Kaitlin
are with Taylor.

871
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:10,501
She's awake.
Oh.

872
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:11,534
What'd you find out?

873
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:13,133
This.

874
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,400
It's from Marissa.

875
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:16,567
She sent it to Ryan
the day she was leaving.

876
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:18,033
I guess it got lost
in the mail.

877
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,133
Oh, that's odd.

878
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,801
Well, it's Chrismukkah;
stranger things have happened.

879
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:23,000
What's it say?

880
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:25,868
Well, that she had
to leave Newport.

881
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:29,300
That it was the only way they
could get on with their lives.

882
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,667
She loved him,
but she had to say good-bye.

883
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:36,367
Is that food?

884
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:39,701
Oh, thank God.

885
00:39:39,767 --> 00:39:42,901
Between you and me,
Taylor in a coma

886
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:44,968
is kind of a nice break.

887
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:47,167
How you doing, Julie?

888
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,868
I'm okay. Thanks.

889
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,601
(sighs)

890
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,634
Ryan, are you awake?

891
00:41:54,701 --> 00:41:57,400
(sighs)

892
00:41:57,467 --> 00:41:58,968
Hi.

893
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:01,767
Hi.

894
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:05,367
I just had the weirdest dream.

895
00:42:05,434 --> 00:42:07,868
You were in it, I think.

896
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:09,000
That's so funny.

897
00:42:09,067 --> 00:42:10,634
I think you were in my dream,
too.

898
00:42:11,968 --> 00:42:13,701
I can't remember what it was,
though.

899
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:15,400
Huh. Me, either.

900
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:22,667
I'm really glad you're here.

901
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,801
Look, the rain stopped.

902
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:31,234
Hey!

903
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,033
Look who's back in the land
of the living.

904
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,000
Oh, Ryan, we were
so worried about you.

905
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:38,567
(Ryan sighs)

906
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:40,033
Everything is going to be okay.

907
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,400
Yeah, I know.

908
00:42:54,234 --> 00:43:02,234
