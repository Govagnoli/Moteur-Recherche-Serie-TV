1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,513
Previously on The O. C.:

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,272
Is it just me or is Zach perfect?

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,317
He's like Newport's Price William.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,552
I get nervous, and I start talking,
and then nothing can shut me up.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,709
Except that.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,236
I have missed you all day.
Does this count as--? As adultery?

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,233
-You're not becoming friends, are you?
-Would that be so terrible?

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,278
-Really? You don't go to school?
-I got kicked out of Corona...

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,396
...Mater Dei and even Newport Union.

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,120
Sixteen years ago,
I made an error in judgment.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,311
One that almost ruined my marriage.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,113
You're my father.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,872
-Hey, man, what's going on?
-Studying.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,430
Will you punch someone, please,
for old times' sake?

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,110
All right, fine. Logarithms
are the new uppercut, I got it.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,194
Now I see it.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,430
-See what?
-I've been looking at old photos...

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,273
...of my mom for resemblances
to Lindsay. Look at that.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,911
You trying to make this
more awkward for me?

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,310
What? It's not like
you dating Lindsay is incest.

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,358
You're not even related.
You're not. You wouldn't get arrested.

22
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,750
You won't have
chromosomally challenged children.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,559
Kirsten's like my mom. Lindsay is...

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,790
-...clearly her sister.
-lt is kind of weird.

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,236
The fact your mom doesn't know
I'm dating her sister. It's a lot weird.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,789
I think they did a storyline like this
on The Valley.

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,279
Great. Tell me how it ends.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,591
You just have to ask yourself
the question:

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,830
Is she your girlfriend,
or is she your aunt?

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,954
-Ah, yes, the age-old question.
-That's right. It's a story as old as time...

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,749
...really. Boy meets girl,
boy likes girl...

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,515
...boy finds out girl is surrogate mother's
illegitimate half-sister.

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,558
I'm guessing it's too soon to joke, Seth,
even for a Cohen.

34
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,439
I just don't know what to do, you know,
what to say.

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,113
Have you talked to Lindsay?

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,158
I wanted to give her space
over the break, let her figure it out.

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,834
That's all you can do.
If she comes back and decides...

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,833
-...she wants to be part of this family--
-We're done dating.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,070
Unless you want to move to the South.

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,959
-Kirsten doesn't know, right?
-She thinks we're friends.

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,078
Good, because I think it's best
if the missus doesn't find out.

42
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,516
Well, that's something
that every wife wants to hear.

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,636
Doesn't find out what?

44
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,672
How much I love you.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,875
-Sandy.
-Yes?

46
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,917
You don't have to lie to me.

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,196
I know that Renee's testimony
is today...

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,396
-...and my father's going free.
-Yeah.

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,152
-Sharp as a tack.
-Can't get by her.

50
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,709
-Laser beam.
-But I don't have to forgive him...

51
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,270
...not after what he did to Lindsay.
That poor girl.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,629
I've been thinking,
we should do something for her.

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,472
This girl grew up not knowing...

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,279
...who she is or where she's from,
and we're her family.

55
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,392
-lf she wants us.
-She wants us.

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,551
-I mean, you guys.
-Well, you too, Ryan.

57
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,508
You're as much a part of this family
as any of us. I mean, if she's my sister...

58
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,159
...she's your aunt.

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,199
-Thanks for clearing that one up, honey.
-She's so young, she's like your sister.

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,076
A sister,
I always wanted one of those.

61
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,390
Ryan, how about you?

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,472
-Don't worry about it. It's no biggie.
-What are you talking about?

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,757
When Seth met your dad,
it almost ended the relationship.

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,798
DJ meeting your dad can't be worse
than when he met your mom.

65
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,520
I suppose this time
he will be wearing clothes.

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,753
I don't know, DJ without
his clothes on, pretty undeniable.

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,998
Look, it'll be fine. Your dad's
totally chill. He won't judge.

68
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,549
It's just he's the only sane person
in my family...

69
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,439
...the only one who comes even close
to getting me.

70
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,068
And I really want him to like DJ.

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,318
Hey, Seth. What's up, man?

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,789
-What's going on?
-Did you get my Christmas card?

73
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,518
I did. I appreciate the apology.

74
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,472
So we're friends again, then?

75
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,519
We're real men, okay? Red-blooded meat
eaters. Occasionally, from time to time...

76
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,116
-...we'll brawl. It's our nature.
-So we can talk about confidential stuff?

77
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,350
-It's cool?
-After all the trouble I caused...

78
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,795
...I'm happy to have a chance to help,
so come on.

79
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,473
Okay.

80
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,279
While I was in Cabo with my family...

81
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,237
...I ran into an old girlfriend...

82
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,676
...and we were at Squid Roe, late...

83
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,559
...and we kind of kissed.

84
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,879
All right, well, first question:
this old flame...

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,396
-...do you still have feelings for her?
-Well, I really like her kids.

86
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,630
She's a little older than me.
She was my math tutor when I was 1 4.

87
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,228
Holy '80s teen-comedy plot.

88
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,239
She's in the middle of a divorce.
She had a lot of tequila.

89
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,914
-Chingy was playing--
-Ooh, Chingy and tequila.

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,674
-Seduction has no two finer allies.
-lt was a quick kiss.

91
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,310
And then l, like, ran out of there,
but I feel really guilty.

92
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,556
Well, man, if it was anybody else...

93
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,951
...I would say keep it to yourself.
You will lead a much happier life.

94
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,078
-No, I can't do that, man.
-I know. You have a conscience...

95
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,118
...whatever. So you got to be honest
with Summer, then.

96
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,794
Tell her you feel terrible.
Tell her that all it did...

97
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,589
...was make you realize how much you
like her. Definitely do not mention...

98
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,274
...the ex having kids and divorces.
You should be fine.

99
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,112
-You think so?
-Yeah, you'll be good.

100
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,748
-You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
-Zach.

101
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,515
Even if I wanted to,
the code, it dictates I cannot.

102
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,032
-Hey.
-Hey.

103
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,996
-How was your vacation?
-How have you been?

104
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,115
-I wanted to call you.
-No, I'm glad you didn't.

105
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,032
I mean, I wanted to talk to you, but l
haven't really been in a frame of mind...

106
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,589
-...to talk to anyone about anything.
-Even your mom?

107
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,311
Not until I've completed several hundred
hours of intense psychotherapy...

108
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,710
...which was a very thoughtful gift
from her.

109
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,236
If you need some more time-- If you
don't want to hang out right now...

110
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,470
-...or ever--
-I do.

111
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,799
We just need to find
our own personal Switzerland...

112
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,712
...someplace neutral.

113
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,518
And we can't hang out at my house...

114
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,672
...because my mom's there,
and we can't hang out at your house--

115
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,391
-Because your sister's there?
-She's not my....

116
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,632
I mean, I guess, technically, she is--

117
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,236
So I can be clear on what everybody
is to everybody, you and the Cohens...?

118
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,036
-Friends. They're my friends.
-And me and you?

119
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,037
More than friends.

120
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,430
-More than friends.
-And definitely not related.

121
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,955
I don't want this to be
like kissing your sister.

122
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,915
The thought never crossed my mind.

123
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,513
I got to tell you, Sanford.
You're one hell of a lawyer.

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,193
The charges have been dropped.

125
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,148
The secrets of our situation
have been sealed by the courts.

126
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,550
You did it. I'm a free man.

127
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,439
-And a smug one too.
-Excuse me for wringing a little joy...

128
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,114
...out of the one bit of good news
I had for some time.

129
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,716
Well, never mind the fact that the news
came at the expense of your family.

130
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,792
Didn't you notice Kirsten's absence
at the hearing this morning?

131
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,679
I know I got work to do
on my relationship with my daughter.

132
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,598
Which daughter are we talking about?

133
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,830
I'm not saying it'll be easy
with Kirsten...

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,514
...but once I get back to work,
I can lighten her load.

135
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,353
-Whoa. Wait. Back to work?
-Now that the scandal's gone...

136
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,353
...there's no reason to stay distant
from the Newport Group.

137
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,239
Except that the woman running
the company hates you.

138
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,799
Which woman we talking about?

139
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,077
Well, I hope he 's not expecting
a party in his honor.

140
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,229
Yeah, I'll see you back at the office.

141
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,753
Bye, Kirsten.

142
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,239
He's free.

143
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,072
He's free.

144
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,237
Might have to spike these drinks.
Don't know if they' re strong enough.

145
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,914
He won't serve any jail time.

146
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,718
-That's it. It's just....
-Over?

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,991
What are we talking
about here, Jimmy?

148
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,639
Caleb?

149
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,473
Or us?

150
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,315
Definitely not strong enough.

151
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,796
Well, I should get back to the office.

152
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,152
Back to my life.

153
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,431
But what if it wasn't my life?

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,195
What if I could just walk away from it?

155
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,750
Well, that would depend on
what you're walking to.

156
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,753
Maybe we just needed this time apart...

157
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,911
...to appreciate each other,
what we had.

158
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,958
But what if we can't ever have it again?

159
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,595
I'm willing to find out if you are.

160
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,712
Hi.

161
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,950
I hope you don't mind me
showing up like this.

162
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,588
I was wondering if I could give you
a ride home.

163
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,117
Thanks, but I have a car. And there's
a better than 50-50 chance...

164
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,999
-...it'll start.
-I know there's no right way to do this.

165
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,835
-FTD doesn't make a--
-"Happy surprise sister" bouquet?

166
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,955
I know you're not on the market for any
new relatives, but how about a friend?

167
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,351
We could go grab
a friendly cup of coffee.

168
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,997
Yeah, a friendly cup of coffee
would be cool.

169
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,592
You have nothing to be nervous about.
It's gonna be great.

170
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,035
What's he into? Does he like sports?

171
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,278
He really likes ESPN Classics.

172
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,988
Is that your mom?

173
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,071
Alex, it's Seth.

174
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,998
Come on,
I came over to welcome you back.

175
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,793
You've really changed over break. Wow.

176
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,393
Who are you?

177
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,712
Just a guy. I probably have
the wrong apartment. Sorry.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,353
Seth?

179
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,038
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

180
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,795
I came over to say hi, see how your
vacation was. I didn't realize I needed...

181
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,112
-...to bring my own tourniquet.
-Sorry. I didn't expect you to be here.

182
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,430
Especially so early in the morning.

183
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,352
It's 3:30 in the afternoon.

184
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,751
Family vacations really
take it out of you, huh?

185
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,993
Y eah, I bailed on family early. I just
came back to catch up with old friends.

186
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,517
Wait, so you've been back for a while,
and you didn't, I don't know, call me?

187
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,477
I've been catching up with old friends.

188
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,473
Who? The large, shirtless guy
that answered the door?

189
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,232
He asked, not remotely jealous.

190
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,630
You know, I am so hung over right now.

191
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,075
-I just think--
-Are you? Have you eaten anything?

192
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,198
You want me to maybe put some
coffee on or fix you a sandwich?

193
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,272
Fix me a sandwich?

194
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,352
Hey, Alex, we're gonna go grab some
smokes and some more beers.

195
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,511
-We'll be right back.
-Okay.

196
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,711
Okay, I'm trying to do the math here,
and I have a few questions.

197
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,556
I'll answer all of your questions tonight
at the Modest Mouse concert, okay?

198
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,917
It's just, my head is killing me, and....

199
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,709
So it was nice to see you.
Really nice of you to stop by.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,558
Really nice.

201
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,994
Nice?

202
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,232
She kept saying the word nice.
You know what that means, don't you?

203
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,994
-She thinks you're nice.
-Y eah, exactly, nice.

204
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,549
As in lacking any edge and/or danger.

205
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,473
Yeah, well, you did offer
to fix her a sandwich.

206
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,117
I know. It's like the more edgy
and dangerous she became...

207
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,396
...the more I became
like a Jewish grandmother.

208
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,198
Not your grandmother. Keep shucking.

209
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,954
I want dinner ready
by the time your mother gets home.

210
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,076
Maybe I don't feel like
shucking these.

211
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,550
Okay, maybe you should go
and shuck them yourself, old man.

212
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,358
That's good.

213
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,670
You had me shaking in my boots.

214
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,276
God, I'm so screwed. Bruce Banner
gets mad, he turns into the Hulk.

215
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,638
I get mad I turn into, like,
a 75-year-old yenta named Sylvia.

216
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,117
Hey, look at all this.
You guys making dinner?

217
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,873
We wanted to surprise you.

218
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,112
I have a little surprise myself.
Look who's joining us.

219
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,628
We were having coffee...

220
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,634
...and we were talking, and then we did
a little shopping. A lot of shopping.

221
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,995
And next thing you know,
it was dinner time.

222
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,754
-I hope you don't mind me crashing.
-No, no, not at all.

223
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,196
No, I think dinner with all of us
will be really nice.

224
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,998
Don't you, Ryan?

225
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,279
Nice, yeah.

226
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,353
-Hey, kiddo.
-Hey.

227
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,308
Why did you and DJ cancel
on me today?

228
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,837
-I was looking forward to meeting him.
-lt just wasn't a good time.

229
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,310
I had a lot of homework,
and he was really tired.

230
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,915
You were busy making out with Mom.

231
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,879
What?

232
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,480
Marissa, that-- That-- What?

233
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,676
Dad, I saw you.

234
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,199
Okay.

235
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,878
Look, I know how it must have looked.

236
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,995
Yeah, it looked a lot like it used to
when you would kiss Mom.

237
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,230
But that was before
she married someone else.

238
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,552
-I wanted to talk to you about it--
-How could you get back with her?

239
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,633
I mean, don't you remember
how she ruined your life and mine?

240
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,388
-Things are different now.
-Oh, really?

241
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,757
So you're not back to lying, cheating
and sneaking around again.

242
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,755
I thought you were past that. I thought
you were gonna take this new money...

243
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,229
-...and start over.
-Please, let me explain.

244
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,994
What's there to talk about?
We already know how it ends.

245
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,594
We already lived through this once.

246
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,511
You know, for once, I wish you would
just grow up and be like a real dad.

247
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,355
What are you doing?

248
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,069
Hey, I needed to borrow
a wife-beater for tonight.

249
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,038
-I thought you had several, so....
-Why are you wearing it?

250
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,432
Well, Alex, she called me "nice," Ryan.

251
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,070
So, what I'm trying to do is cultivate
more of a bad-boy image.

252
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,197
I don't think that'll get the job done.

253
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,033
You're right.
I need to borrow your wrist cuff.

254
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,430
Hey, also, remember that choker
you used to wear.

255
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,953
No. Just....

256
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,678
-No.
-All right.

257
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,069
You're extra brood-ish. What's up, man?
Is the Lindsay thing still bothering you?

258
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,438
Not at all. I mean,
we had a really nice family dinner.

259
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,832
I know, I thought so. Which is
part of the problem. Right, got it.

260
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,356
There shouldn't be a problem. I mean,
if Lindsay wants to hang out...

261
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,557
...with the sister she never knew
she had, I can't get in the way.

262
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,872
-Or make it all about me, right?
-No. That's something I would do.

263
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,713
Which is perfect,
because you're becoming more like me...

264
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,316
...which paves the way for me
to become the brooding bad boy.

265
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,351
You realize we're both screwed.

266
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,715
Dude, I'm wearing a wife-beater.

267
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,719
Hey.

268
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,799
Hello.

269
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,710
-What's that?
-What's what?

270
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,434
Oh, this?

271
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,914
Just my good friend, John.

272
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,071
-John.
-Yeah, he's a good friend of mine.

273
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,870
-What's John?
-No, I said-- I said Jim.

274
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,235
No, I meant--
What I meant to say was "Jack. "

275
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,197
They're all my friends.

276
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,673
Yeah, that ought to take the edge off,
right there.

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,072
-You guys seem real friendly.
-Super friendly. So if you need me...

278
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,676
...I'll be drinking by the speaker,
because I don't care about tinnitus.

279
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,634
I've got terrible news, really.

280
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,270
-I've fallen in love with my ex-wife.
-You were married before Julie?

281
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,715
-You're in love with Julie?
-I don't believe that.

282
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,077
Unfortunately, I do. Jimmy,
after everything she did to you before?

283
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,958
I know, that's what Marissa said.

284
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,838
Marissa knows?

285
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,271
She caught us.

286
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,632
And the things she said....

287
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,153
Well...

288
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,038
...they're all true.

289
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,315
Look, here's the deal.
I can't be here and be with Julie.

290
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,311
But right now...

291
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:20,118
...I can't be here
and not be with Julie.

292
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,558
What are you saying?

293
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,035
When Hailey left, I felt adrift.

294
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,078
So I made some calls
to see what was out there...

295
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,313
...and I came across this company
that charters yachts for sale...

296
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,115
...in Maui.

297
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,671
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

298
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,516
I need to get away from here before
I do any more damage to myself...

299
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,669
...or to my kids.

300
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,516
Or to Julie.

301
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,519
I love Newport, but it's--
It's no good for me right now.

302
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,429
In the last year,
I've nearly been arrested and bankrupt...

303
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,230
...for stealing from my clients. I got
punched out at my daughter's cotillion.

304
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,278
I lost my house, my family.
I tried to kiss you...

305
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,069
...which I still feel terrible about.

306
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,119
I spent the summer drunk on a boat
with your 25-year-old sister.

307
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,040
And now I'm getting back together
with the woman...

308
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,794
...who started this in the first place.

309
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,634
I just can't stay here any longer.
I just can't do it.

310
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,518
-So when would you go?
-Well, they faxed over a contract...

311
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,515
...a couple weeks ago.
All I have to do is sign it, and it's mine.

312
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,473
A couple of days, and I'm history.

313
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,752
You're giving me the pinky?

314
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,799
I'm not really into public displays
of affection.

315
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,949
All right, let's go. Outside.
We gotta talk.

316
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,677
-So too bad Coop couldn't make it.
-Zach, only I can call her "Coop. "

317
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,354
-It's kind of weird when you say it.
-Got it.

318
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,910
-Too bad Marissa couldn't make it.
-I'd freak out too if my mom and dad...

319
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,516
...were getting back together
and kept this huge secret from me.

320
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,990
Yeah, so we haven't had a chance
to talk about our winter breaks yet.

321
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,277
-I know.
-Hey, Modest Mouse!

322
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,352
Hey, volume, Cohen. It's not Metallica.

323
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,115
No, it's not Metallica,
it's Modest Mouse!

324
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,800
You're, like, so sweaty.

325
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,315
And you're-- Come here. Wait.

326
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,558
Your breath smells like Marissa.

327
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,951
-You are so drunk.
-You guys are hanging out. That's cool.

328
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,270
I guess she was cool with it, right?

329
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,269
-Cool with what?
-The tutor.

330
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,476
-Thanks, Seth.
-You're welcome.

331
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,994
Welcome.

332
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,032
Is the stage revolving or...?
No, it's us.

333
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,989
-They're really good. What's the matter?
-You.

334
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,038
You're the matter. I mean,
you've been weird all night.

335
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,839
You've been weird pretty much
since I came for dinner...

336
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,198
-...which was weird for me too.
-Well, what happened to Switzerland?

337
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,590
I don't know,
Kirsten wanted to hang out.

338
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,352
And then....
She's really cool.

339
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,909
She is. If you want to hang out
with her, you should.

340
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,878
But if the Cohens
are really my family...

341
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,476
...then you are my family.

342
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,553
Which means kissing me
is like kissing your sister.

343
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,950
-Or step-aunt.
-Ryan!

344
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,917
You have to take Seth home right now.

345
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,911
He is wasted and leaving a path...

346
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,595
-...of destruction in his wake.
-I cannot believe you.

347
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,115
And I cannot believe
that you told Cohen.

348
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,919
See? And he puked all over
the merchandise table...

349
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,036
...which I now have to go and mop up.

350
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,549
I know who lives here.
It's the Cohen residence in the heazy.

351
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,076
Okay, we got to be really stealth here.

352
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,596
I was All Camp Capture the Flag,
Camp T akajo.

353
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,557
-I invented the stealth.
-Fine, you did.

354
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,790
-I did.
-You're yelling. You need to be quiet.

355
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,758
I haven't been so wasted
since your first night in Newport...

356
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,276
...when we beat up those kids.
With a little bit, a little bit of that.

357
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,830
And a little bit of that.
A little bit of that and that--

358
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,756
What's going on? You guys okay?

359
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,398
Seth?

360
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,155
We're being stealth.

361
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,556
Look, everything you said yesterday...

362
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,992
...you were right. I'm making the same
mistakes all over again with your mom.

363
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,310
-So you're gonna end it?
-Yeah.

364
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,074
-Yeah, I am.
-That's great, Dad.

365
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,550
But it's--
It's more complicated than that.

366
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,156
I....
I need to get some perspective...

367
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,154
...on the world, or something.

368
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,915
You're right.
I need to learn how to be a real dad.

369
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,510
So I'm...

370
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,954
...Ieaving.

371
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,152
-What?
-Yeah, I'm moving to Maui.

372
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,236
That's your idea of being a real dad...

373
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,391
...abandoning me and moving to Hawaii.

374
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,152
It's not forever.

375
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,198
It's only for six months, maybe.

376
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,714
You can come visit any time you want.

377
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,078
Well, good luck with that.

378
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,551
I mean, I hear Maui's beautiful.

379
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,875
You know, there's gonna be
a goodbye party tonight at the Cohens'.

380
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,518
Are you okay?

381
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,639
Totally.

382
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,157
You were the last thing
keeping me sane.

383
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,153
When you leave, it should be interesting
to see how things go.

384
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,673
But I'll see you tonight.

385
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,753
Hello.

386
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,030
I just came by to tell you I'm dying
and thank you for your friendship.

387
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,993
Slowly, slowly.

388
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,550
And also to apologize
for whatever happened last night.

389
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,790
You don't have to apologize to me.

390
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,155
Did you talk to Zach?

391
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,072
No. Why?

392
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,954
You kind of destroyed
his relationship with Summer.

393
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,920
I violated the code of man.

394
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,308
Talked to Alex?

395
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,119
-She won't answer my calls.
-Might have something to do...

396
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,794
-...with all the vomit.
-All the vomit? How much vomit?

397
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,270
Like the little girl in Sixth Sense
or the fat guy in Monty Python?

398
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,352
Well, you wanted to be a bad boy.
You did bad.

399
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,912
Yeah, but not in a good way.
I've got to talk to Alex...

400
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,436
...show her I can be a good bad boy,
not a bad bad boy.

401
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,109
Good luck with that. Aspirin?

402
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,309
Thank you.

403
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,513
You have lobster rolls, right?

404
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,114
He loves lobster rolls.

405
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,551
-lf it isn't my son, the wino.
-You guys found out?

406
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,633
-You weren't exactly stealth.
-Damn. Lost a step since Takajo.

407
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,918
Your dad's been waiting for you to leave
the room so he can send you back to it.

408
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,352
That's great.

409
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,593
I know I should be used to this at this
point, but why are we having a party?

410
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,433
It's Jimmy Cooper's going-away party.

411
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,112
Great. Then I'll run an errand real fast,
then come straight home.

412
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,478
-You're not going anywhere.
-Dad, I'm grounded, I get it. I deserve it.

413
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,791
Okay? Even though this headache
is far worse than any punishment.

414
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,350
-No.
-I need to go see a girl very fast.

415
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,830
-Then I will come straight home.
-The girl who thinks you're too nice?

416
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,639
The one you tried to impress
by drinking a fifth of Jack?

417
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,870
I think his name is John, but yes.

418
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,759
And it went horribly,
so I need to talk to her really fast.

419
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,912
-And I need to, you know, sort of--
-Go upstairs and get dressed.

420
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,436
You know what, maybe if I'm grounded,
I shouldn't go to this party.

421
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,951
I'm gonna go get dressed. Stairs.

422
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,272
Hi. I got you something.

423
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,030
It's the novelization of The Valley,
season one.

424
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,630
I have the hardcover,
signed by Grady Bridges.

425
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,392
-I should go.
-That's why I'm here.

426
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,596
-I wanted to give you a ride.
-I'll go alone.

427
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,711
-You're going by yourself.
-Han Solo.

428
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,190
But if I change my mind, I'll have
Cohen get drunk and let you know.

429
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,634
-Bye.
-Summer, come on.

430
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,870
Hooking up with your tutor, Zach?

431
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,792
Not even that cool in the '80s.

432
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,953
I mean, she could have at least been a
hooker and helped you get into Princeton.

433
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,839
Hey, Julie.

434
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,832
Kik-- Kirsten.

435
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,309
Sad day, saying goodbye
to Jimmy Cooper.

436
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,198
I remember when he was a boy.

437
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,238
Taking him out on the boat,
inviting him over...

438
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,639
...for dinner.

439
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,114
-Hey.
-Hey.

440
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,514
-What's up?
-See you in a few. I'm gonna slip out...

441
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,511
...try to fix things with Alex.

442
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,511
-What about your parents?
-They're scary.

443
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,116
Which is why I need you to cover for me.
Okay? Just throw up a smokescreen.

444
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,350
Give them some famous
Ryan Atwood double talk.

445
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,239
-I barely talk.
-Good point. The less said, the better.

446
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,869
I don't think this is a good idea, man.

447
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,395
You call yourself a bad boy.

448
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,313
Jimbo.

449
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,476
I'm sorry it's not a better
turnout for you.

450
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,112
Well, considering I defrauded most
of my closest friends, it's not bad.

451
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,393
I'm gonna miss you, Jimmy.

452
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,313
Well, thanks, Sandy.

453
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,751
-How'd she take the news?
-I haven't talked to her yet.

454
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,839
Good luck with that.

455
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,513
Hey, Julie.

456
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,993
You just gonna send me a postcard?
I wouldn't have known...

457
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,517
...you were leaving if Kirsten hadn't
invited me to your going-away party.

458
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,717
Of course I was gonna tell you.
Can we talk about this...

459
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,155
...someplace a little more private,
please?

460
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,800
Hi. Look who stopped by.

461
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,872
-Hey, Ryan.
-Hey, Lindsay.

462
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,349
I'm gonna go grab some champagne.
You two have fun.

463
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,192
-Thanks.
-All right.

464
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,073
-Now we're waving at each other?
-I thought you agreed...

465
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,676
-...Kirsten can't find out about us, right?
-Right, then it might be weird.

466
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,831
Ryan, have you seen--?

467
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,797
Lindsay. Hello.

468
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,593
Hi.

469
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,994
Excuse me, I didn't mean to interrupt.

470
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,430
I'll find Julie myself.

471
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,113
Good to see you.

472
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,313
Bye, Dad.

473
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,592
Yeah, this isn't gonna be weird at all.

474
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,320
Do you really think
that this is going somewhere?

475
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,552
I don't know. I was under the impression
that this meant something.

476
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,479
It did.

477
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,670
It does.

478
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,673
But did you really think
it was gonna last?

479
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,110
You really think
that I would leave you again?

480
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,679
Well...

481
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,675
...history isn't exactly working
in your favor on that one.

482
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,117
Plus, you deserve to be happy
with Caleb.

483
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,998
Yeah, that's a storybook romance...

484
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,550
...with our illegitimate children
and our tapped phone lines.

485
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,438
At least it's real.

486
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,312
Jules.

487
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,989
You gotta go so soon?

488
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,870
I think it's probably best I go
before anyone knows why I'm going.

489
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,875
-I'm-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--
-It's fine.

490
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,591
We're just saying our goodbyes.

491
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,828
See you, James.

492
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,833
So long, Jules.

493
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,797
-Hi.
-Hey, people I know.

494
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,077
-Yeah. Where's Zach?
-He couldn't make it.

495
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
-Where's Cohen?
-He's hurting from last night.

496
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,474
Well, I'd like to hurt him for last night.

497
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,876
Kind of a boring party.

498
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,238
Not for long.

499
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,559
I'm fine.

500
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,911
Well, if it isn't the wicked witch
of the West Coast.

501
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,478
Are you drunk?

502
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,512
-Let me guess, tequila?
-She was like this when I picked her up.

503
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,150
-You don't have to defend yourself to her.
-But you do, young lady.

504
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,754
Let's go, DJ,
before she tries to sleep with you next.

505
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,639
-What did you say?
-You heard me, you whore!

506
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,514
Hey, guys, not here.

507
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,037
No, let's do it here, okay?

508
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,874
Let's tell everyone
why you're leaving, Dad.

509
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,952
Why don't you tell everyone
why you're leaving?

510
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,919
-Please, Marissa, just--
-Hello, everybody.

511
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,548
-Let's go, Marissa, you're drunk.
-Get off of me!

512
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,119
Guys, come on.

513
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,678
See what you're leaving me with.
See how screwed up she is.

514
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,435
Of course I'm screwed up.
I'm the daughter of a thief and a slut.

515
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,593
You know what, I just--

516
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,914
I just hate you both so much.

517
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,551
You wanted a good
old-fashioned O.C. party.

518
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,235
I just hope she's okay and she calls.

519
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,790
As bad as I thought she'd take it,
that was worse.

520
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,953
It's gonna be hard for her.

521
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,119
For all of us.

522
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,472
I was hoping that, while I'm gone...

523
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,269
...you'd go over to the house
and check up on her.

524
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,518
-My father lives in that house, Jimmy.
-I know.

525
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,796
That's why I want you to go there.

526
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,071
I need to know that someone
is watching over her.

527
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,353
For my oldest friend, anything.

528
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,828
I can't believe this.

529
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,198
If we had gotten married,
I'd be moving to Hawaii.

530
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,948
No.

531
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,829
If I had married you,
there's no way I would have left.

532
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,516
I just want to get the hell out of here.

533
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,950
Where did they park my car? Irvine?

534
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,591
Excuse me, Mr. Nichol.

535
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,511
There's a problem with your car.

536
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,069
You scratched my Aston Martin?

537
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,151
Your car's been stolen.

538
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,234
Wow. Whose car is that?

539
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,876
This? It's mine, Alex. I stole it.

540
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,589
-You stole a car?
-Yep. I do that sometimes, Alex.

541
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,553
I do it for kicks.

542
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,312
Are you trying to impress me?

543
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,436
-What?
-You know, with getting drunk...

544
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,909
...and stealing cars, and....

545
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,514
It's just....

546
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,514
Seth...

547
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,868
...I've been with a lot of bad boys.

548
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,913
And you...

549
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,116
...are not one of them.

550
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,635
Right.

551
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,234
I'm just gonna make a bundt cake
and put on some tea.

552
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,756
-See you later.
-No. Seth, you're a good guy.

553
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,592
And that's why I like you.

554
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,271
Really?

555
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,557
Good, because I don't think
this bad-boy thing's working out for me.

556
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,677
-Me neither.
-ls this your vehicle, sir?

557
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,995
Happy, high vibrations attract
happy, high vibrational....

558
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,390
What are you still doing here?

559
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,112
Your stepmom blocked my car in.
I tried to wake her up, but is she, like...

560
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,478
-...alive?
-Y eah, just heavily medicated.

561
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,878
-How was the party?
-Don't know.

562
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,794
Maybe I should hire you a tutor,
and she can catch you up on everything.

563
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,274
Look,
I've had a lot of time to sit here...

564
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,318
...vibrating at a very high frequency,
and think.

565
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,474
And I realize this
is a really important moment for us.

566
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,552
This is our first fight
that wasn't about Cohen.

567
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,798
I mean, he helped,
but this fight, it's ours.

568
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,359
I guess that's true.

569
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,237
I'm really sorry.
It didn't mean anything.

570
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,436
-Believe me.
-It's not about what happened.

571
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,797
It's just that you didn't tell me,
you told Cohen.

572
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,993
-From now on, I'll tell you everything.
-Why?

573
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,230
Planning on screwing up again?

574
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,470
Only one way to find out.

575
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,077
-We finally have a moment alone.
-Yeah.

576
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,755
Maybe a chance to talk
about everything.

577
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,038
You know what, I don't want to.

578
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,431
We keep hypothesizing how kissing me
might be like kissing your sister.

579
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,953
And...

580
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,115
...I think we should just find out.

581
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,872
So you want me to kiss you
as an experiment?

582
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,632
Yeah.

583
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,360
And if it truly is weird...

584
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,431
...well, then, that's our answer.

585
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,113
Okay.

586
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,150
-No pressure.
-Right.

587
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,190
Hey, guys, I was wondering
if you've seen Seth.

588
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,875
No.

589
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,110
We were just looking for him ourselves.

590
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,918
Okay, thanks.

591
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,955
That was close.

592
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,237
Maybe we should just
keep this to ourselves for now.

593
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,916
At least till we find out
if we're breaking any laws.

594
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,233
Hey, Dad. How was the party?

595
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,430
I think somebody called the cops.

596
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,034
Hey.

597
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,791
What are you doing here?

598
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,998
I called him.

599
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,756
Thanks, DJ, I appreciate it.

600
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,232
You mind if I join you?

601
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,874
I never thought I'd leave this place.

602
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,038
I guess...

603
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,150
...Iife doesn't always turn out
the way you think it will, huh?

604
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,271
I'll take that as pensive no.

605
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,590
I'm sorry, Marissa.

606
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,153
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry...

607
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,076
...I let you down. I'm sorry that l...

608
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,958
...I couldn't...

609
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,831
...give you the life...

610
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,030
...that you deserve.

611
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,395
Although I nearly went to jail trying.

612
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,672
You've got to give a guy credit for that.

613
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,196
Sweetheart.

614
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,998
Don't go.

615
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,469
Please, don't go.

616
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,712
Don't leave me.

617
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,958
I gotta go.

618
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,237
I gotta-- I gotta get a life.

619
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,315
I know. I know. It stinks, but....

620
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,709
But listen, anytime
you wanna come live with me...

621
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,269
...you just let me know, okay?

622
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,399
And I will send a boat or a plane,
whatever, okay?

623
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,112
It's getting....
It's getting kind of cold.

624
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,192
I think we should head back, huh?
Want to get out of here?

625
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,588
Wait.

626
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,393
Could we just...?

627
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,919
Could we just sit here for a while?

628
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,071
Sure, kiddo.

629
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,036
Put this on. You must be freezing.

630
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,110
I'll sit with you all night.

631
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,473
Hey.

632
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,478
-Hi.
-You okay?

633
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,594
Yeah, I was just seeing my dad off.

634
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,953
He left this morning.

635
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,915
I'm sorry.

636
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,588
-I brought bagels.
-That's the secret password...

637
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,399
...into the Cohen house. Come on in.

638
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,554
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey.

639
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,233
-Hey.
-Hey.

640
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,549
Marissa brought bagels.

641
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,636
Thank God. These ones are stale.

642
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,278
-Yeah, I almost chipped a tooth.
-Gather around, Marissa.

643
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,476
I am going to teach you how
to schmeer.

644
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,153
He's an artist with cream cheese.

645
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,073
-Well, thank you, honey. Slicer.
-Slicer.

646
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,471
-Cream cheese.
-Cream cheese.

647
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,834
You gonna be okay?

648
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,309
Of course. We got bagels.

649
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,232
Ah, yes, bagels.

650
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,039
Now, Marissa, this is perhaps
the most important part.

651
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,278
How we use the excess cream cheese.
