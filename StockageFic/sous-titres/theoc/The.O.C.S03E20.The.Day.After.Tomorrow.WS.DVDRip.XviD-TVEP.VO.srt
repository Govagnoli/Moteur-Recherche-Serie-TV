00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,153
<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,754
- What do I do to get you to stay?
- I think you're doing it.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,679
- You know this engagement is a trial.
- What?

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,077
- Griffin will not move unless you're gone.
- He's taking kickbacks from vendors.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,759
Totally and completely untrue.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,388
Give me your word,
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,749
What happened?

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,155
I know about Volchok.
What's gotten into you?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,831
- You're being so lame.
- Not as lame as you.

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,110
I'm hoping that you both
will apply to Berkeley.

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,437
The guy from Brown didn't say they
couldn't take more students from Harbor.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,637
- This might be the year.
- That's right.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,314
- Cohen, come out. I wanna see!
- All right!

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,557
I feel like Pa Kettle.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,479
Not bad. Try this on.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,232
Oh, wow, you got us
matching parkas.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,991
And matching hats
and matching scarves.

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,072
We're going to be the warmest,
most coordinated couple at Brown.

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,272
Think you're jumping the gun?
We don't get our letters till tomorrow.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,477
Oh, please. With your dorked-out grades
and my NASA-level SATs...

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,392
...we are so getting in.
- It's Brown.

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,198
Everyone's got good grades
and SATs.

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,750
It's very possible that neither of us
could get in. Or one of us could.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,075
- Which one of us would that be?
- Just as likely you'll get in and I won't.

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,076
- You really believe that?
- Where would you be?

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,272
Stuck in Providence, with one half
of a his-and-hers parka set.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,438
Yeah, like I'd go if you didn't.

28
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,154
- What?
- Cohen.

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,797
I applied to Brown so we could be
together. I'm not going without you.

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,269
Brown's one of the top
universities in the world.

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,873
People dream about going there.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,192
No, you dream about going there.

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,954
I dream about
being with the one I love.

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,951
Even all padded up,
you still look scrawny.

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,989
I need to get some water. I'm sweating
so much, I'm getting dehydrated.

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,956
- I thought you were making me dinner.
- I did.

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,394
Yeah?

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,791
- You didn't let me eat it.
- No one's stopping you.

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,598
Really? Okay.

40
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,159
- Well, in that case...
- Nope!

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,878
No. No.

42
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,473
What?

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,798
So with a 90-day escrow...

44
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,315
...that means you'll be in town for...

45
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,878
- Ninety more days, Einstein.
- Right. That makes sense.

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,833
Or till you get accepted
to whatever college you applied to.

47
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,758
Yeah.

48
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,033
Okay.

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,952
Should I not have mentioned it?

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,076
No, no, it's fine. You're right.

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,630
Your letter should be
arriving tomorrow, right?

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,114
Yeah.

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,716
I'm sorry, but I've found ignoring
the future never makes it go away.

54
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,280
Well, whatever happens,
we'll make it work.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,788
We should eat before the burgers
get cold. I'll grab some water.

56
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,678
- Hi.
- Hey. You want a water?

57
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,599
Sure.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,279
I was just
cooling myself off.

59
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,352
All this time, I thought getting into
college would make everything easier.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,193
Yeah.

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,677
Not gonna happen.

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,071
There's a cold front coming through.

63
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,878
Pass the milk.

64
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,830
That's cream. I said milk.

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,754
Eating breakfast, are we?

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,798
Does this mean
we're going to school?

67
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,111
Or you need strength for the children
you and Volchok plan to mug?

68
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,435
Big day, girls. College letters arriving.

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,272
- Are you excited?
- Yeah, delirious.

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,836
Don't be nervous. You're getting
into Berkeley. I feel it in my bones.

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,998
- I gotta get to school.
- Oh, Marissa.

72
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,119
Your friend, his motorcycle woke up
Neil. You might wanna apologize.

73
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,711
Why? In case he changes his mind about
marrying into our trailer-park family?

74
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,678
- That's not really my problem.
- Marissa.

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,232
She's really outdone herself again.

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,630
Summer, how worried
do I need to be about her?

77
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,630
I don't know. She's not exactly
confiding in me right now.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,275
- Morning, everybody. Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.

79
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,590
- Feeling lucky?
- Yes. My aura is green.

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,791
Oh, that has to be good.

81
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,473
- Where's Marissa?
- She...

82
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,871
Went to school early because she's
nervous with all the college stuff.

83
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,310
Berkeley would be lucky to have her.
Just think:

84
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,756
It's just a short
motorcycle ride away.

85
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,512
Well, that's a hell of a forehand.

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,592
Imagine that
connecting with somebody.

87
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,193
I didn't know you were coming.

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,272
The gate was unlocked. You should
be more conscious of security.

89
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,438
I'm assuming these are some references
to what happened to Matt.

90
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,551
- Hope he's okay.
- Let's skip to the part...

91
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,029
...where you tell me you had
nothing to do with it.

92
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,919
- Is he implying that I did?
- Matt hasn't said anything.

93
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,755
This is me talking. I want this
hospital built more than anything.

94
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,036
But if you haven't resigned
within 48 hours...

95
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,637
...I'm gonna do everything in my power
to take you down.

96
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,433
And I was lying.

97
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,556
Your forehand sucks.

98
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,356
I don't know about that. That just
doesn't look right to me. You guys.

99
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,511
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Hey. What's up?

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,990
- Have you spoken to Marissa lately?
- lf you count, "Pass the milk."

101
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,715
I need to talk to her about the sweatshirt
bonfire. You guys are coming?

102
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,031
Where the seniors wear sweatshirts
of the colleges they're going to?

103
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,549
Because that always struck me
as incredibly lame.

104
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,035
- Oh, and I need your help.
- I gotta get to class.

105
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,589
- I gotta too.
- I know you're just making an excuse...

106
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,593
...to get away from me.
It's okay. It's cute.

107
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,149
- Anyway, about Marissa.
- I wouldn't count on her.

108
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,670
That's great.
She's supposed to get the food.

109
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,598
This is so typical. You know?

110
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,638
People join Social Committee,
they think it's fun and games.

111
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,713
Who ends up doing work when someone
decides to go <i>Last Exit to Brooklyn?</i>

112
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,871
- Taylor. That's who.
- I think she's just...

113
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,157
...going through something right now.
- Seung Ho, it's Taylor. Hi.

114
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,551
Listen, how much kimchi
can you get me by tomorrow night?

115
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,676
You are saving my ass, Seung Ho.
You are really saving my ass.

116
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,638
Hey, I'm glad you called.

117
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,479
That's the first time
anyone's ever said that.

118
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,676
- What's up?
- Nothing.

119
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,799
Well, college letters are arriving today.
My mom's been pressuring me about it.

120
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,951
<i>And Summer and I are fighting.</i>

121
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,392
So I guess, maybe everything.

122
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,993
Well...

123
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,236
...the guys are gonna party
on the beach.

124
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,273
Maybe you should come, you know?
Take the edge off.

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,670
- Can you pick me up?
- Be there in a half-hour.

126
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,154
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

127
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,788
- Thought I'd stop by.
- Well, I'm flattered.

128
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,749
Taking time out of your day to see me
when you have a letter waiting for you.

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,076
What can I say?
Couldn't help myself.

130
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,558
I could probably tell if you got in.

131
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,876
- Yeah?
- I never mentioned I could read palms?

132
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,071
- Must have slipped your mind.
- Must have.

133
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,995
- You're gonna be rich.
- That's nice to know.

134
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,674
Oh, sorry.

135
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,917
- I read it upside down, so flip that.
- Well, easy come.

136
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,117
This is important. It's warning against
dark-haired beauties...

137
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,599
...who walk into your life.

138
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,428
Really? And what does it say?

139
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,716
It says if you're not very,
very careful...

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,991
...they'll steal your heart.

141
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,194
In all that, there's...
There's nothing about college?

142
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,719
Oh, yeah. You got in.

143
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,274
All right, I just need to grab a jacket.

144
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,396
Any chance you can get
some beer money?

145
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,073
I'm a little short.

146
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,834
Sure. I'll be right back.

147
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,594
Oh, my God!

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,353
Oh, my God.

149
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,153
Oh, my God.

150
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,995
- Hello?
- Summer?

151
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,712
- Hey!
- I got in!

152
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,276
What? Yeah! All right!
Congratulations. Amazing.

153
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,714
- Thanks. Did you?
- Yeah.

154
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,916
- Really?! Oh, congratulations.
- Yeah.

155
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,354
Where's Cohen?

156
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,794
- I don't...
- Hey.

157
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,311
Hey. So you guys both got in?

158
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,918
Yeah. Are you...?

159
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,878
Oh, my God.

160
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,994
Pack your muffler.
We're going to Brown.

161
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,913
Yeah!

162
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,516
- Oh, man. That's awesome, dude.
- Yeah, yeah.

163
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,159
- I'm so happy.
- I'm proud of you.

164
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,594
Hey, hey, hey.

165
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,714
Hello? Hi.

166
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,912
I've been on hold since 5 in the morning,
so here's my question:

167
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,197
Is there some sort of a possibility
that a mistake was made?

168
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,318
Because I mean, mistakes can happen.
Right? Even at Brown.

169
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,360
No, no. I'm not trying
to be sarcastic at all.

170
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,229
Let me ask you this: Is there
some sort of appeals process or...?

171
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,237
Next year?

172
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,917
Lady, my girlfriend is... Is... Is... Is...

173
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,158
Hello?

174
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,593
Sandy?

175
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,788
- Oh, hey.
- Good morning.

176
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,112
Whatever problems you're thinking
about right now, let them go.

177
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,515
Our kids got into college.
It's a big day.

178
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,634
- You're right. We did it.
- We did it.

179
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,109
- We did it.
- I see the self-congratulation...

180
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,918
...has begun.

181
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,238
We are so proud of you.

182
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,234
A Cohen in the Ivy Leagues.

183
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,472
You did the work. But I think our genes
deserve some of the credit.

184
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,517
- Thanks.
- We knew you could do it.

185
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,950
Oh, hey. There's Ryan.
He got into college too.

186
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,350
- Give him some hugs.
- Congratulations.

187
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,518
Our next generation Berkeley man.
Congratulations.

188
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,638
- Thank you.
- We're so proud of both of you.

189
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,274
You know, we should have
a celebration dinner tonight.

190
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,833
- Invite your ladies.
- Yeah.

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,912
- You think you're making too big a deal?
- Your father's right.

192
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,389
- Seven-thirty.
- Sure, sure. Thanks.

193
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,068
No more hugging.
Physical contact freaks me out.

194
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,229
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

195
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,235
I don't know where you were
or what you think you're doing...

196
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,231
...but call me as soon as you get this.

197
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,391
I've had it, young lady.

198
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,400
Neil, you're up.
Can I get you some coffee?

199
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,834
Yeah.

200
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,353
Summer just left.

201
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,791
She's excited about Brown. Wanted
to stop by REl on the way to school.

202
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,712
Something about a subzero
sleeping bag.

203
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,309
Marissa must have left
super early this morning.

204
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,597
I'm worried she didn't get in...

205
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,950
...and maybe is embarrassed to tell me.

206
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,230
- She got in.
- Excuse me?

207
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,438
I found this in the trash
when I got home last night.

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,274
- Oh, my God.
- Julie...

209
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,749
...we both know she didn't
spend the night here.

210
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,479
I don't know what's going on.

211
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,712
But we have to stop pretending
that it's not happening.

212
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,038
You've gotta talk to her.

213
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,114
You late for something?

214
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,158
I figured I'd make an appearance
at Harbor. It's fourth period.

215
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,793
So, what are you doing
tomorrow?

216
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,997
My school's having this party thing
I have to go to.

217
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,516
All the seniors wear the sweatshirt
to the college they got into. It's...

218
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,273
Gayest thing I've ever heard.

219
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,959
So you're really thinking
about going to college?

220
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,439
Why? You don't see it?

221
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,708
So me and some of the guys
are going to Baja for the weekend.

222
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,558
You know, surf.

223
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,950
Smoke some Mexican green.

224
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,272
Wanna come?

225
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,120
Or can't you miss
your gay sweatshirt party?

226
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,395
Hey. Atwood,
have you seen Skeletor?

227
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,120
- No, why?
- Well, I bought us thermal facemasks.

228
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,554
I wanted him to try his on.

229
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,399
Oh, well, why don't you just
bring them to dinner tonight?

230
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,670
Sandy and Kirsten? The celebration
thing? I'm sure he meant to tell you.

231
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,799
- Oh, well, yeah. Probably.
- Probably.

232
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,515
When you see him,
will you give him this?

233
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,119
Hey, man.

234
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,234
Summer was looking for you.
I invited her for tonight.

235
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,074
Cool. Good.

236
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,877
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, no.

237
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,589
It's just, if she sees me,
she'll dress me like a Timberland Barbie.

238
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,479
Did you invite Sadie?

239
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,154
- I'm going over to her place.
- You tell her you got in?

240
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,151
No. No, that's kind of difficult.

241
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,157
We haven't been
going out long...

242
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,198
...but what do you do when only
one of you is going to college?

243
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,512
Man, I wish I knew.

244
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,794
- Hi.
- Hey!

245
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,673
Perfect timing.
I just finished working.

246
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,275
So, congratulations.

247
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,918
Psychic, remember?

248
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,355
- And when you didn't call last night...
- Yeah.

249
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,999
Well...

250
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,113
Yeah.

251
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,273
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

252
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,394
You wanna mention the elephant
in the room or should I?

253
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,275
I've been thinking, I don't
have to go till August.

254
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,993
We could have the summer.

255
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,674
Not so into relationships
with an egg timer on them.

256
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,755
Sadie, the last few months...

257
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,070
Okay, Ryan. Pet peeve:

258
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,755
Having a guy tell me how amazing I am
while dumping me. Rings kind of false.

259
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,357
I was gonna say I've been happier than
I've ever been with anyone I've dated.

260
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,119
I'm in Newport
because of you.

261
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,834
Making jewelry.
Very portable business.

262
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,797
You see where I'm going with this?

263
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,918
You would move to Berkeley?

264
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,874
Yeah, I would. If you want me to.

265
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,034
Yeah, I do.

266
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,991
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cohen.

267
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,356
- Well, hello, Summer!
- Hi, Summer.

268
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,514
- My dad just dropped me off.
- Hey, is dinner ready?

269
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,279
Oh, my God.

270
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,393
Get used to it. This is what you're gonna
be looking at for the next four years.

271
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,874
Hey, we're not late, are we?

272
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,678
Not at all. We're glad you're here.

273
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,274
Now, everybody, outside.
Dinner is served.

274
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,079
All right.

275
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,553
So Ryan told me that you guys
actually went to Berkeley.

276
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,194
- Yes.
- Don't have him tell the Halloween story.

277
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,233
Let's just say we met
under unusual circumstances.

278
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,960
It's a beautiful place.
You should try and visit.

279
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,589
Sadie's gonna be coming up
to Berkeley with me.

280
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,193
When you go look at the school?

281
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,194
- No, to live.
- What?

282
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,149
I don't understand.
Did you apply to Berkeley?

283
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,432
No, no. It's just... My business
can kind of go anywhere...

284
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,114
...and Ryan's gonna be up there.

285
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,271
So we figured, why not?

286
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,079
So when did you decide this?

287
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,834
- This afternoon.
- It was my suggestion.

288
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,912
No, actually. I think I asked you.

289
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,557
Well, I think it's great.
Finding the right person...

290
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,190
...and then deciding to be with them.
That's what life's about, right?

291
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,830
- You know, I'm actually kind of tired.
- Sadie.

292
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,479
- I'm gonna go home.
- Oh, no, no.

293
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,914
Thank you both for dinner.

294
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,718
- Oh, wait.
- I'll walk you out.

295
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,592
You've been, like, so quiet tonight.
Is anything wrong?

296
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,478
- No, I'm fine.
- I can't believe...

297
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,756
...that Ryan and Sadie
are moving to Berkeley.

298
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,673
- That is so romantic.
- I don't know what Ryan's thinking.

299
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,072
- What are you talking about?
- He's 18. College should come first.

300
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,670
Not if you're with the one you think
you should be with. Forever be with.

301
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,632
Well, who really knows that at 18?

302
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,319
I do.

303
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,272
Oh, my God.

304
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,432
- You don't.
- Summer.

305
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,751
- That's not what I mean.
- You know what? I have to go.

306
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,914
If you're here about the sweatshirt party,
I'm not going.

307
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,355
So if you wanna yell, yell.

308
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,875
Actually, I was hoping
that we could just talk.

309
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,839
Marissa, I don't know what's going
on with you or what I did wrong...

310
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,434
Although, I'm sure we could come up
with a few things.

311
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,512
- but I just can't bear to see you
doing this to yourself.

312
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,959
Mom, this isn't about you.

313
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,797
I just keep trying to picture
myself at Berkeley and I can't.

314
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,838
That... That just means you're scared,
honey, and that's fine.

315
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,998
Look, Marissa,
I've been in that place before...

316
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,276
...where you lose faith in yourself.

317
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,557
But, honey, I believe in you
and you deserve this.

318
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,597
I don't know, Mom.

319
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,753
Marissa, please don't
give up on yourself.

320
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,435
You've no idea
how much I want this for you.

321
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,877
I'll think about it.

322
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,318
That's all I want.

323
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,159
Hey.

324
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,279
- Thanks, man.
- Sure.

325
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,358
- Did you talk to the parents?
- You know what? In hindsight...

326
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,796
...breaking the news to them that way?
Probably not a very good plan.

327
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,312
At least my dad didn't have an actual
heart attack at the table. That's a plus.

328
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,112
True. Anything happen after I left?

329
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,840
Summer and I got into a soul-crushing
fight about Brown.

330
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,276
- I'm sorry. Have you talked to her?
- No.

331
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,718
But even if I did, man, and she forgave
me, it's, like, then what? You know?

332
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,759
It's just... I don't know.
It's complicated.

333
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,311
Seth, I gotta ask.
Did you really get into Brown?

334
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,519
Did I get in...?

335
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,591
Ryan, now who's smoking pot?
Listen to me.

336
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,275
The only class that I've ever
gotten less than an A in was gym.

337
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,908
My essay on the Ioneliness
of being Superman...

338
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,399
...made Mrs. Rushfield cry.

339
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,633
So, you know, of course...
Oh, God, how did I not get in?

340
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,593
- Why are you lying about it?
- For Summer.

341
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,677
Think she's gonna notice
you're not there?

342
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,190
Well, she said if I didn't get in
and she did, she wouldn't go to Brown.

343
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,918
I'm not gonna let her do that.

344
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,390
- It's the opportunity of a lifetime.
- Well, I think that's up to her.

345
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,835
Sorry, man, I think
you gotta tell her the truth.

346
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,154
Hey, sorry I'm late.

347
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,355
No, it's fine. I just got here myself.

348
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,869
So Harbor's having this party tonight.

349
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,871
Everyone wears
their college sweatshirt.

350
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,231
- lf you wanna go.
- Sure. Yeah. That will be fun.

351
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,876
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

352
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,433
And I'm sorry about last night.

353
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,511
That was not the way
it should've happened.

354
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,995
- Or maybe it was.
- What do you mean?

355
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,953
In the heat of the moment,
we decide to go to Berkeley together?

356
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,594
- Maybe we need to think about it.
- You don't want to?

357
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,916
Make sure we're doing this
for the right reasons.

358
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,429
We are.
Because we wanna stay together.

359
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,194
Right?

360
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,477
I just feel like a lot of people
go to college to find themselves.

361
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,432
And maybe you're
one of those people.

362
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,758
I wouldn't wanna get in the way.

363
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,388
I feel more myself with you...

364
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,394
...than anyone.

365
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,431
Those are some
pretty big words, mister.

366
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,394
I am going to Berkeley.

367
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,908
Seung Ho, you dog.

368
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,396
Oh, let me give you my credit card.

369
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,637
Summer. Come on, cheer up.
It's gonna be fine.

370
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,233
You and Seth will work it out.

371
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,833
I know, I just don't get it.

372
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,718
We had a dream.
The dream comes true.

373
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,791
Suddenly he's, like,
"What a crappy dream."

374
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,552
- I mean, who does that?
- Summer...

375
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,990
...getting a man is like capturing...

376
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,754
...a wily, silverback gorilla
in the Ugandan highlands.

377
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,636
You see, nature is telling that gorilla
to stay in the wild.

378
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,832
But both you and I know
that gorilla would be much happier...

379
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,309
...back in the zoo,
on a normal feeding schedule.

380
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,239
But sometimes he's just gotta roar
and beat his chest...

381
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,709
...before he'll let you shoot him
with a tranq.

382
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,478
So, what you're saying is, he's trying
to exert his gorilla independence?

383
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,558
Yes. That is exactly
what I'm saying, Summer.

384
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,149
Now come help me set up the bonfire.
Seung Ho...

385
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,272
- Yeah. What she said.
- Oh. Bye, guys.

386
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,234
- Hey.
- Hey.

387
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,913
- Got a sec?
- Yeah.

388
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,798
I was about to head to the bonfire.

389
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,752
I found this in the closet.

390
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,997
- It's a little worn, but...
- Wow. Wow, that's great, thanks.

391
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,118
And Kirsten was wondering
if maybe Sadie could use this.

392
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,599
Yeah.

393
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,354
Sorry about last night.

394
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,752
We both think she's a great girl.

395
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,399
She is. She is.

396
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,075
And, you know,
I know it seems kind of fast...

397
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,595
...but I really care about her.
- I'm sure you do.

398
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,431
It's funny.
Before you sprung your news...

399
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,558
...I was about to tell you I'd spoken
to Paul Glass at Berkeley.

400
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,154
He told me that he could
get you into my old dorm.

401
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,756
Of course, living with Sadie, you're
gonna have to find off-campus housing.

402
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,871
She's not gonna be
part of the meal plan.

403
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,510
So between food and rent
you're both gonna have to have jobs.

404
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,439
Now, Kirsten and I,
we're gonna cover your costs.

405
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,319
- But now with Sadie in the mix...
- I would never ask that.

406
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,717
I guess we just haven't had time
to really figure everything out.

407
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,831
No, of course not.
How could you?

408
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,038
It all happened so fast.

409
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,709
I ever tell you I almost
didn't make it to Berkeley?

410
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,953
I was driving across the country
that first summer.

411
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,197
I spent the night in this little town
1000 miles from home.

412
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,832
And I was terrified.

413
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,194
I'm not doing this
with Sadie because I'm scared.

414
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,152
Okay.

415
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,478
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Where are you? I'm ready to go.

416
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,432
I can't go to Baja tonight.

417
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,632
- All right.
- But call me when you get back.

418
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,717
Yeah, sure, whatever.

419
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,917
Sadie?

420
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,429
Glad you're here.
I've something huge to tell you.

421
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,835
- Yeah, so do I.
- Oh, okay, you wanna go first?

422
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,913
No, no, no, that's fine.
Go ahead.

423
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,634
I called the guy who sells
my jewelry in the Bay area.

424
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,673
It turns out he runs
an artists' co-op in Berkeley.

425
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,038
So I could live there.

426
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,470
Or we could live there. Together.

427
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,875
- Isn't that awesome?
- Yeah, that's amazing.

428
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,199
See, I told you I was psychic.

429
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,276
Okay, what was your news?

430
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,598
I talked to Sandy.
He and Kirsten are fine about us.

431
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,271
That's awesome.

432
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,835
Okay, we gotta leave
for your party, right?

433
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,359
Yeah.

434
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,109
Gonna be weird
that I'm not wearing a sweatshirt?

435
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,749
No, no, you'll be fine.

436
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,197
- Okay. I'm gonna go grab my purse.
- All right.

437
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,713
Summer?

438
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,874
Hey.

439
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,758
Hey. Where have you been?

440
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,111
Oh, I had to help Taylor
set up for the bonfire.

441
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,954
That girl can handle a chainsaw.

442
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,279
Hey, Seth hasn't called, has he?

443
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,114
No, I don't think so.

444
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,679
Everything okay with you guys?

445
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,834
Don't worry about it.

446
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,114
Look, Summer, I'm sorry
about the way I've been acting.

447
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,594
Just give me a chance.

448
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,035
Remember the boys made us watch that
movie about gay guys on the mountain?

449
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,959
- <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>
- Yeah.

450
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,111
And you remember that Gollum guy...

451
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,272
...how he got more evil
the closer he got to that fiery thing?

452
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,435
That's kind of how Seth is
about Brown.

453
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,116
Hey, you guys will work it out.
You love each other.

454
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,793
Thanks.

455
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,389
So no offense, but what
has been going on with you?

456
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,159
I don't know.

457
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,796
I keep trying to get back
to the life I remember, but I just...

458
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,679
I can't. It never seems to work.

459
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,152
You couldn't talk to me about this?

460
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,997
I've been your best friend
since the first grade.

461
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,912
I know.

462
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,037
I'm sorry.

463
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,071
I forgive you.

464
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,231
But you have to come with me
to the sweatshirt party as penance.

465
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,273
Oh, I would,
but I don't have a sweatshirt.

466
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,278
Oh, yeah.
What are we gonna do about that?

467
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,428
I bought this a few months ago.

468
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,319
Looks like somebody believed in you.

469
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,833
Hey.

470
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,873
You okay?

471
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,998
- Please, I just... I can't do this right now.
- Do what?

472
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,749
Be tested as wife-mother material
while I'm worried about my daughter.

473
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,270
I get it, okay? It's not
what you expected. I failed, fine.

474
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,274
But right now,
I need to think about Marissa.

475
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,715
Julie, I'm sorry if I...

476
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,633
If I made you feel
like you were being tested.

477
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,512
I was wrong.

478
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,559
And you've hardly failed. I think
Marissa's lucky to have you for a mom.

479
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,711
Hey. Guys, we're going to the party.

480
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,798
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dr. Roberts.

481
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,592
What I tell you?

482
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,555
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

483
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,228
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, you too. Hi, Sadie.

484
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,431
Hey.

485
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,871
- Has anyone seen Cohen?
- Someone say my name?

486
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,595
Hey. You're not wearing
your sweatshirt.

487
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,791
You guys are all here.
The core four.

488
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,399
I need a picture. Go.

489
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,158
Go.

490
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,909
- Sorry. Do you mind?
- No, no, it's fine.

491
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,951
Everybody say,
"Higher earning potential."

492
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,471
- So cute.
- All right.

493
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,558
- Can I talk to you a second?
- Yeah.

494
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,432
I'm hungry. Do you want anything?

495
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,108
- No, I'm good.
- I will show you where the food is.

496
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,073
Hi, I'm Taylor. I used to be
total enemies with those guys.

497
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,231
But I'm pretty much
second-circle core now.

498
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,272
- Like your sweatshirt.
- Thanks. Yours isn't so bad either.

499
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,034
You doing okay?

500
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,238
Besides this thing choking me?

501
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,038
No, honestly I'm beginning to think
all of this is a bad idea.

502
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,359
- What's that?
- The sweatshirt. The party.

503
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,349
You know, even though
we're not together...

504
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,995
...I'm here if you ever wanna talk.

505
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,198
Thanks.

506
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,434
Means a lot.

507
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,713
So this is my friend Seung Ho.
And this is Sadie.

508
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,630
You could have told me
your answer on the phone.

509
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,438
Well, I wanted us to talk.

510
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,068
So you're not pulling out? Fine.

511
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,549
The DA's office
are gonna find who attacked Matt.

512
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,278
They're not gonna keep it quiet.

513
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,948
Look, I had nothing to do
with what happened to Matt.

514
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,190
I can't offer you
anything but my word.

515
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,072
Which doesn't carry weight with me.

516
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,953
- How about $ 700 million?
- Excuse me?

517
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,119
With the hospital going up, the city's
interested in revitalizing the entire area.

518
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,278
Parks, affordable housing, restaurants.

519
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,869
Head of the Appropriations Committee
is a friend.

520
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,635
- He's asked about your firm.
- Wow.

521
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,153
So now you're trying to bribe me?

522
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,555
The face of this city's
changing, Sandy.

523
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,790
You can be a part of that.

524
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,476
- Oh, my God. What...? Come inside.
- No, that's all right.

525
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,433
- Sandy here?
- No, he's out. What happened to you?

526
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,473
Some guys
broke into my apartment.

527
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,353
- Tell him I stopped by with a proposal.
- No, Matt. Wait.

528
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,636
Wait, did you call the police?

529
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,149
- They have to find out who did this.
- I know who.

530
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,271
What are you talking about?

531
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,236
Look, I really like Sandy.

532
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,472
But you just gotta...
You gotta get him to quit this.

533
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,790
Because pretty soon
it's gonna be too late.

534
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,716
- So are you gonna talk or what?
- Yeah.

535
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,872
It's just not easy.

536
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,351
Then I'll go.

537
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,352
Look, I get that you're a guy, okay?

538
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,796
And I know you have
that whole simian brain thing.

539
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,916
If we're gonna
go to college together...

540
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,395
...you can't keep
freaking out on me all the time.

541
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,120
- Yeah, Summer, that's just it.
- What is?

542
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,956
I'm not sure I wanna
go to Brown next year.

543
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,070
- What?
- I've just been thinking a lot about it.

544
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,078
And I'm not sure that Brown
is the right choice for me.

545
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,639
For you, I think it's great.

546
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,195
We applied to Brown
so that we could be together.

547
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,039
Yeah, I know. I just...
I guess I just changed my mind.

548
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,117
So we just suddenly
apply somewhere else?

549
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,197
No, I think you
should still go to Brown.

550
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,473
You should.
I'll just go somewhere else.

551
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,674
Do you really mean this?

552
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,991
I'm sorry. I think it's for the best.

553
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,476
Okay.

554
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,397
Well, I guess,
if this is how you feel, fine.

555
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,638
We're over.

556
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,871
Hey, been looking for you.

557
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,958
Yeah, Taylor went off
with that food guy.

558
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,759
I'm sure they were
talking dirty to each other in Korean.

559
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,393
Do you wanna leave?

560
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,835
Know it's kind of hard on you
not knowing anyone.

561
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,310
You're a nice guy, Ryan.

562
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,471
But I'm not coming
to Berkeley with you.

563
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,277
Don't you see? This is what
it would be like next year.

564
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,677
You'll have this other world
and I'll be pulling you away from it.

565
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,558
You won't get to experience college
the way you should.

566
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,474
- I'm not gonna do that to you.
- Sadie, come on.

567
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,517
You know I'm right.

568
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,391
I'm gonna go home.

569
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,677
I have to start packing in the morning.

570
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,035
- I'll drive you.
- I wanna walk.

571
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,872
And I'd rather say goodbye here.

572
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,516
Keep in touch, Ryan.

573
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,996
I'm gonna miss you.

574
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,679
Sandy.

575
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,148
What are you doing
sitting in the dark?

576
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,231
- Matt came by.
- What did he say? Because you know...

577
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,197
Promise me you're gonna
quit this thing.

578
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,278
Oh, honey. It's complicated.

579
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,550
- It's not.
- It's about more than the hospital.

580
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,828
Do you forget that I worked
at that company for 15 years...

581
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,831
...and I saw what happened
to my father?

582
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,316
I'm not gonna become your father.
But I can't just quit.

583
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,191
