1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,635
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- Are we doing this?

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,910
It's not like we haven't before.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,231
You can't drink, you can't have sushi.
What are you, pregnant?

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,358
One of our partners went behind
our backs to a friend at city council...

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,317
...and got them to deny us
the liquor license.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,948
So he's profiting from our loss.
He's Caleb Nichol.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,792
You're upset because
she's marrying Dad.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,949
Yeah, for his money.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,873
Last time I talked to Marissa,
she was planning on moving in with us.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,270
Manipulate me?!
Hold my daughter hostage?!

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,634
Theresa's pregnant.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,358
And it might not be Eddie's.

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,269
Thor. It's a strong name.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,554
- No one's gonna mess with Thor.
- Thanks.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,836
Seth's a good name for a boy too.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,833
Although, at Camp Tokaho,
I was often referred to as a girl...

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,558
...so I guess it works either way.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,951
- Can we not play the name game?
- Right. Sorry. It's premature.

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,633
She's probably not even pregnant.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,836
- Maybe you shoot blanks.
- I feel much better.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,556
Sorry. If you're in no mood to kid,
l..."Kid."

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,517
That's an unfortunate choice of a word.

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,315
- We don't even know if this kid is mine.
- We don't even know if there is a kid.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,516
How much faith can you put
in a pee swab?

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,908
Seth, don't say "swab."

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,196
Ryan Atwood just made a joke.

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,351
Yeah. Gotta keep
a sense of humor, right?

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,433
Hey, stuffed in a locker, shoes full
of the water-polo team's urine...

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,158
...never funnier.
- Good to know.

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,470
Yeah. In fact, having you around
to defend me...

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,279
...I've kind of gotten soft
not having anyone picking on me.

32
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,513
So really been no need
for the Seth Cohen retaliatory zinger.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,834
My dad hates cilantro.
If you put cilantro on anything...

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,831
...I may be uninvited to the wedding.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,638
Somebody get me some cilantro.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,394
Colored lights? No way.
White lights only...

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,269
...because colored lights remind my father
of a carnival, and he hates carnies.

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,352
Note to self: Hang with carnies.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,479
Yeah. Great.

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,030
I'll see you on Saturday. Thanks. Bye.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,116
Well, the wedding rehearsal is confirmed.

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,517
This wedding is actually happening.

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,591
Never have people deserved
each other more.

44
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,990
I can't believe my dad is
walking with a black eye.

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,549
I know. That's because
Jimmy punched him.

46
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,756
If I had, he'd be walking
with a broken nose.

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,036
What are the odds of you
making up before the wedding?

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,873
I would say not good at all.

49
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,792
It's important to me.

50
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,838
A daughter wants her father to be happy
on his wedding day.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,879
And here I was thinking it was
supposed to be the other way around.

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,915
Well, what if I...

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,071
...begged?

54
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,798
Groveled?

55
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,996
- Maybe cajoled?
- Oh, honey, come on.

56
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,479
He sabotaged my restaurant.

57
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,430
He committed fraud. There's no way
I could possibly forgive him.

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,672
Well, maybe I could pretend...

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,837
...to forgive him.

60
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,559
Maybe I could apologize
with my fingers crossed.

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,631
Hey, you're not at school.

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,518
Yeah, we were at the doctor's office.

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,716
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. It's fine.

64
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,798
I'm pregnant.

65
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,399
Well, except for that.

66
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,913
So it's official?

67
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,911
Yeah. It is.

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,036
And does she know who the father is?

69
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,553
No.

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,473
They don't like to do paternity
tests until the baby's born.

71
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,517
Too dangerous, I guess.

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,956
But there's a chance
that it could be yours?

73
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,796
- We were broken up.
- Oh, right.

74
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,916
No, totally.

75
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,872
- We were broken up for, like, a week.
- I'm sorry.

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,112
I wish I could take it back. Believe me.

77
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,792
If you wanna...

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,396
- You know, I'll understand.
- Like there's a choice.

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,154
I mean, if you're the father, then...

80
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,715
...well, you and Theresa...
- No. No, I want to help her out...

81
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,472
...but I also...

82
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,870
I want to make this work...

83
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,996
...between us.

84
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,312
These are decaf, right?
If they're not...

85
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,994
...I'm gonna be up for days. Thank you.

86
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,799
Thanks.

87
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,476
- I'm freaking out, Cohen.
- You're freaking out?

88
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,039
You hear about Ryan and Theresa?

89
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,236
What about my best friend?

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,153
- Princess Sparkle is freaking out?
- Marissa, dumb-ass.

91
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,993
I always get those two confused.
They have really shiny hair.

92
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,037
How can you even joke about this?

93
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,872
Because, I don't know, I have to.

94
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm not emotionally equipped
to process this information.

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,354
It's not bad enough she has to live
with Lucifer and Julie?

96
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,876
- I get those two confused as well.
- What'll happen to Ryan and Marissa?

97
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,678
They're, like, the perfect couple.

98
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,479
Based on your parents' marriage,
I sort of understand that.

99
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,110
- I'm holding hot coffee, Cohen.
- Look, I don't know what's gonna happen.

100
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,714
I just wish there was something
I could do to help him.

101
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,871
We just got past all this drama...

102
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,110
...and this summer was supposed
to be all-time.

103
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,919
Yeah, well, now it's all up in the air.

104
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,071
- We're not having sex, by the way.
- Excellent.

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,310
There's not enough pain
and suffering already.

106
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,279
Excuse me.

107
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,476
Sorry about the wait.

108
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,628
Hi.

109
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,554
Hi.

110
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,551
I wanted to see if you wanted to talk.

111
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,475
We're a little understaffed.

112
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,837
Eighty-five cents. Great. I'll put it
towards baby's college tuition.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,356
If you want to talk about it... That.

114
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,476
Theresa, the register's broken.

115
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,551
Sorry.

116
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,958
Now, there's a portrait of a man
headed to the altar.

117
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,588
- What the hell do you want?
- No, it's not what I want.

118
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,716
It's what Kirsten wants.

119
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,677
D Átente. Peace.

120
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,957
- The promise of a feud-free wedding.
- You've come to the wrong groom.

121
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,236
You wanna apologize, do so,
but do it quick.

122
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,960
You have no idea how much cajoling
it took to get me here.

123
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,271
- I'm only here because of Kirsten.
- It's always because of Kirsten.

124
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,791
When you railroaded my dinner...

125
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,758
...was that because of her too?
- No, that one was for you.

126
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,796
So, what are you gonna do...

127
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,110
...when I'm not around to make you
feel better about yourself?

128
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,589
- You going somewhere?
- Maybe.

129
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,591
Like, say, San Quentin.

130
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,670
- What the hell are you talking about?
- What did you think I was doing in Vegas?

131
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,876
Besides flipping my restaurant
for a tidy sum?

132
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,871
I was trying to save the Newport Group.

133
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,556
Selling that property was supposed to
keep this company from going bankrupt.

134
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,199
Kirsten never said anything.

135
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,909
That's because residential real estate
is our only profitable division.

136
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,039
She doesn't know anything about the
bad investments, the debts, the losses.

137
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,476
Sell to somebody else. Robert Campbell
can't be the only buyer in town.

138
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,189
It doesn't mean as much to anyone else.
Campbell owns the rest of the coastline.

139
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,113
This property was the last piece
of the puzzle he was missing.

140
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,919
So that's why you wanted us
out of the restaurant so fast.

141
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,230
You sneaky...

142
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,039
...not-so-successful son of a bitch.

143
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,236
Enjoy it while you can.

144
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,868
I got the DA all over me again.

145
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,838
Must smell blood in the water.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,434
Have a nice day, Sandy.

147
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,039
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

148
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,908
What are you doing?

149
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,311
You know, preparing to move
into the house on Haunted Hill.

150
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,318
You know...

151
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,392
...you don't have to do this.
I'd sooner give back the check...

152
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,791
...than have you move in with your mom.
- Then you're left with nothing.

153
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,552
You'd have to move to Phoenix.

154
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,632
Well, at least this way,
I can still see you.

155
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,594
Life just wasn't this complicated
when I was growing up.

156
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,359
Yeah, I know. It feels like we're
constantly being punished for something.

157
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,597
- Mom just keeps on ticking.
- Hey.

158
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,957
Your mom has to wake up every
morning and be Julie Cooper.

159
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,790
That is punishment enough.

160
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,596
Come on. Let's take a break.
What do you say?

161
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,876
Go down to the pier and get a Balboa Bar?

162
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,074
I can't.

163
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,470
I've just got so much to do.

164
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,198
- Does Theresa's mom know?
- No, not yet.

165
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,032
Theresa's not ready to tell her.

166
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,872
Besides, it'll make it feel too real.

167
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,871
I have news for you. It's real.

168
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,508
- Sandy.
- There's no point in sugarcoating it.

169
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,114
You know how many unwed mothers
come through my office?

170
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,599
We all know how real this is.

171
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,558
- Can we just eat dinner?
- All right.

172
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,797
Hey, look...

173
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,520
...we are what we are,
and we'll help you through this.

174
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,593
- We can do it together.
- Hey, man.

175
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,955
They raised me, okay? Proof pudding.

176
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,994
Speaking of pudding, Mother,
do I have any tapioca on tap?

177
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,277
- You are king of the segue.
- I just love pudding. It's so fun to say.

178
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,829
Pudding. Pudding.

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,195
Our child-rearing skills speak
for themselves.

180
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,713
Pudding.

181
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,108
Oh, hi, sweetie.

182
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,350
I have my secret recipe, takeout.

183
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,158
- No, thanks. I ate at work.
- Pudding.

184
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,869
- Ryan, can we talk?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

185
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,791
So, what's going on?

186
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,158
I've been thinking.

187
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,514
We haven't really talked about it.

188
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,475
You're not ready for this.

189
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,235
- I'm not ready for this.
- Yeah, I know, but we can...

190
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,118
I can't do this.

191
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,756
I'm not gonna do it.

192
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,030
I'm not gonna have it.

193
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,316
The baby.

194
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,758
You're not?

195
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,116
You can tell the Cohens...

196
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,872
...but I can't tell my mom.

197
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,110
Hey, you're off the hook.

198
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,273
I have to go down and renew
my dock fees for my boat, man.

199
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,318
You wanna go down there with me,
maybe take her out for a spin?

200
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,391
- Sure, sounds good.
- No, it sounds great.

201
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,790
Come on. We haven't even been on
since last summer.

202
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,679
Remember last summer? We were
just getting to know each other.

203
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,308
Now look at us. Best friends.
Brothers, even.

204
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,835
What do brothers do, Ryan?
You know what brothers do?

205
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,956
Brothers sail.

206
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,792
What brothers sail?

207
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,713
The Wright Brothers.
Before they invented airplanes.

208
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,518
How do you think they got everywhere?

209
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,272
The Ringling Brothers...

210
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,433
...with their chimps and their tigers.
It was like Noah's Ark on that boat.

211
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,319
- Hanson. Playing cruise lines.
- Okay, we'll go sailing.

212
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,029
No, get excited, okay?
You dodged a bullet.

213
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,034
Not that... Not that... It's... You...

214
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,918
Bullet.

215
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,718
I just think that it's cool.

216
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,154
Not so much cool, but...

217
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,880
Okay, I just... I don't know.
I thought you'd be relieved.

218
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,508
No. No, I am. It's complicated.

219
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,592
Too complicated for banter
about boats and Hanson?

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,956
- Hey.
- Hey.

221
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,476
Can I get you anything?
Tea? Toast? Dramamine?

222
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,073
No, thanks.

223
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,913
I don't want to be late.
I'm only working a half-day today.

224
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,191
I have an appointment
at Planned Parenthood.

225
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,756
Is Ryan gonna go with you?

226
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,037
No, I haven't told him.
He's freaked out enough as it is.

227
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,350
What about your mother?

228
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,431
No, I can't.

229
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,192
She's extremely religious.

230
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,751
Well, you'll need someone there
to listen to the doctors...

231
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,559
...because you're gonna have
a million things on your mind.

232
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,513
You won't want to drive.

233
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,353
I'm an excellent driver
and amazing parker.

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,753
Thanks. I hate parallel parking.

235
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,832
So how are you doing with it?

236
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,199
- Are you relieved, sad, disappointed?
- All of the above. Yes.

237
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,670
- Well, did she say when she was gonna...?
- Soon.

238
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,112
I guess.

239
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,758
Well, then at least maybe everything
can go back to normal.

240
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,639
Not that anything around here
ever is normal.

241
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,030
More normal than this.

242
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,832
I think we should spend this whole
summer just being normal.

243
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,710
- We won't hold Seth to that, will we?
- No. No, that would be impossible.

244
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,308
I was talking more about us.

245
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,193
You're just full of surprises.

246
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,229
I hear water. And by the way, Caleb...

247
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,073
...we should hold on to this blindfold.

248
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,879
- Oh, gosh.
- Good to know.

249
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,393
Oh, my God! It's a palace.

250
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,959
Fit for a queen?

251
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,550
Oh, Cal. It's amazing.

252
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,039
I built it just for you.

253
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,711
It's more than I ever
could have imagined.

254
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,069
I want to live here forever.

255
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,040
Oh, I've missed you.

256
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,679
It's been too long.

257
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,798
- You're talking to a boat, Seth.
- I talk to a plastic horse too...

258
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,190
...but that never worries anyone.
- It worried me.

259
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,032
Hey.

260
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,112
I forgot about this.

261
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,555
This compass is gonna lead me
all the way to Tahiti.

262
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,156
Yeah, whatever happened to that
big plan to sail to Tahiti?

263
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,072
You showed up, man.

264
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,037
Suddenly, I had much less reason to flee.

265
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,959
Newport became kind of...

266
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,676
- Kind of all right.
- Yeah?

267
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,119
- Could've done it in 42 days, though.
- Guess we'll never know.

268
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,350
Yeah, but now that we've got...

269
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,318
...the <i>Summer Breeze</i> back in action,
we can sail to Catalina.

270
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,072
We can take our ladies.

271
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,356
Catch fresh fish right off
the side of the boat.

272
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,795
Cook them right there.
Sounds good, man.

273
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,630
Sounds great.

274
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,439
So I'll take you
to your appointment tomorrow.

275
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,195
You're not taking any anesthetics, so you
don't have to worry about what to eat.

276
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,430
We'll get there about
a half an hour before...

277
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,999
...and fill out some forms.

278
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,234
Everyone there seems really nice.

279
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,633
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

280
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,397
You don't have to.

281
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,155
Yeah, I do. I mean...

282
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,039
...I'm in high school, or I should be.

283
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,475
I make $ 11 a day in tips.

284
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,835
Not having this baby...

285
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,594
...makes the most sense.

286
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,838
You don't have to make the decision
that makes the most sense.

287
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,709
Right. Coming from you... I mean...

288
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,279
...your life is so together.

289
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,318
You know, you have
an amazing family...

290
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,913
...great job.

291
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,354
It's perfect.

292
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,876
Nothing's perfect.

293
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,872
Sometimes...

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,515
...things just happen.

295
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,797
Yeah, but never to someone
like you, right?

296
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,197
- I'm sorry. L...
- It's okay.

297
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,555
I don't regret the decision I made.

298
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,958
I just wish that when I was
trying to choose...

299
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,112
...there was someone there for me.

300
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,914
Whatever you decide...

301
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,358
...we're here for you.

302
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,313
Hi.

303
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,959
How you feeling?

304
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,997
Pretty lousy.

305
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,072
Remember that part last night
about me not having the baby?

306
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,595
As hard as it is to imagine
having a baby...

307
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,355
...I can't really imagine not having it.

308
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,870
So you're gonna have it.

309
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,156
I have to.

310
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,513
Well, what did you say to her?

311
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,908
I didn't say anything.

312
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,753
So all of a sudden she just decided
to change her mind?

313
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,912
No, it's all of a sudden that
she made all of her decisions.

314
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,799
What? You talked her
into having this child.

315
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,474
So I should let her make
a totally uninformed decision?

316
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,074
They're kids with nothing.
How can they start a family?

317
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,912
That's not our choice.

318
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,638
You know what Ryan's going through?

319
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,553
Not as well as I know
what she's going through.

320
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,679
What does that mean?

321
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,229
Nothing.

322
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,949
It's just, she's alone. She can't talk to
her mother. She's scared and confused.

323
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,076
All I did was listen.

324
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,037
- Oh, hey. You want some breakfast?
- No, thanks. I'll get something later.

325
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,668
I just want to see if Theresa
wants anything.

326
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,070
I should call my dad.
He has to be here by 8.

327
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,310
Have you talked to him?
He doesn't seem himself.

328
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,358
I can't blame him.
I wouldn't want to be him either.

329
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,556
He's about to be bound by law
to Julie Cooper.

330
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,429
Don't remind me. Denial is a
very effective coping mechanism.

331
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,828
It should be some weekend.

332
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,958
Hi.

333
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,918
Want some breakfast? Pancakes?
Waffles?

334
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,718
- You're leaving.
- I'm going home.

335
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,108
I talked to my mom.

336
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,032
I told her everything.

337
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,838
I should have left last night
when I saw the look on your face.

338
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,077
You don't have to leave.

339
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,755
We can figure this out together.

340
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,990
Then come with me.

341
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,193
Never mind breakfast.
I'll grab something on the road.

342
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,712
This place is huge.

343
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,108
It's a castle.

344
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,919
The torture chamber must be
in the basement.

345
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,752
Jimmy, what...?

346
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,117
You should not be here. Caleb's due
back any minute, and thanks to you...

347
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,669
...he has to take his wedding photos
with a black eye.

348
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,752
It'll match the black lump of coal
where his heart should be.

349
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,036
Why can't you be happy for me? I am.

350
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,714
Julie, you can't be happy.

351
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,077
- And that makes me happy.
- Classy choice, Jimmy.

352
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,710
Although, it's obvious you're with her
because you can't be with Kirsten.

353
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,314
I think, in psychology,
that's called "transference."

354
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,035
And you marrying Caleb,
I think, in psychology...

355
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,316
...that's called "shameless gold-digging."
- No.

356
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,040
- That's what his youngest daughter's for.
- Don't make me...

357
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,998
Make you what? Go back to life
as a stripper or a coke whore?

358
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,553
- Someone forgotten about the '80s?
- At least I'm not a criminal.

359
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,314
- Yeah, you're just marrying one.
- Okay, stop it.

360
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,234
Just stop it. No more fighting, okay?

361
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,915
Look, you're getting what you wanted.
I'm moving in with you.

362
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,437
Well, that's what you wanted too,
right, sweetie?

363
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,552
I've got some more stuff in the car.

364
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,393
I'll get the rest of my stuff
out of your house tomorrow.

365
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,718
I can't believe your boat's name
is <i>Summer</i>. What a coincidence.

366
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,519
My name's Summer.
Your boat's named <i>Summer</i>.

367
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,911
- It's kind of crazy.
- Yeah, it's just crazy.

368
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,548
Well, it's the only Summer
you'll be riding for a while.

369
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,950
Right. Yeah, no sex. I got it. Thank you.

370
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,429
- Hey, Seth.
- Hey.

371
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,114
- You got that paperwork?
- Yeah.

372
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,116
So it's still in really good condition.

373
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,431
I got a guy, I think he'll offer 6000.
He's been bugging me a while.

374
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,477
Great. Will you remember to get cash?

375
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,993
- I told him.
- All right. Thanks.

376
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,832
- Come by tomorrow.
- I will.

377
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,912
Six thousand dollars in cash?

378
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,640
- Are you fleeing the country, Cohen?
- No, it's for Ryan.

379
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,233
What? For vintage wife-beaters?

380
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,829
It's actually for Theresa.

381
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,718
For Ryan to give to Theresa.

382
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,272
Listen, don't say anything, okay? Because
I don't even think Ryan's told Marissa yet.

383
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,112
But...

384
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,111
...I think Theresa's gonna have her baby.

385
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,713
What?

386
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,514
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

387
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,709
And she's gonna need money, and, you
know, I spent all mine on Vegas hookers.

388
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,553
So this is the only thing
I have that's worth anything.

389
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,038
I just don't know how else to help.

390
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,798
Cohen...

391
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,390
- What the hell's he doing here?
- He's family too.

392
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,278
- Hey.
- Hey.

393
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,317
- How you doing, Caleb?
- Get away from me.

394
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,993
- Dad.
- Well...

395
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,835
...congrats. She's a hell of a woman.

396
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,308
- Congratulations, Mrs. Cooper.
- Oh, thank you.

397
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,677
Seth. You excited
about being a groomsman?

398
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,552
It's the fulfillment
of a lifelong dream, yeah.

399
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,192
- Hey, guys.
- Marissa.

400
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,477
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

401
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,038
Hey, have you guys seen Ryan?
He didn't call me back earlier.

402
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,553
- Do you think he's okay?
- Yeah.

403
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,154
- He takes a long time with his hair.
- His hair, yeah.

404
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,279
- Bangs. I don't know. Mousse. Product.
- You should see him. It's weird.

405
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,678
So, Cal...

406
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,030
...I talked to the DA.

407
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,509
- Otis?
- Yeah.

408
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,036
What did that pantload have
to say for himself?

409
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,758
It's over.

410
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,550
What the hell am I supposed to do?

411
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,036
Well, have you told the future Mrs. Nichol
about your financial situation?

412
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,679
What are you saying, Sandy?

413
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,717
That Julie's only marrying me
for my money?

414
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,518
No, never.

415
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,636
Course not.
But you might think...

416
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,836
...about postponing this thing.
- Impossible.

417
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,991
The wedding is tomorrow.

418
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,312
I have never let anyone push me around,
and this is no exception.

419
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,636
But thanks...

420
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,199
...for trying.

421
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,157
I appreciate it.

422
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,116
It's ironic.

423
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,919
Julie leaves Jimmy, marries you.
Now he's worth millions...

424
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,750
...and you're gonna be broke.

425
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,148
I don't believe in irony.

426
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,436
Well, that's too bad...

427
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,512
...because it might be just the thing
to get you through this.

428
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,752
Hey. What are you doing?

429
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,194
I'm just...

430
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,271
...you know, hiding.

431
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,113
Yeah. I can't blame you.

432
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,909
- So where's Theresa?
- She went back home.

433
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,911
To have the baby.

434
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,598
Well, did she and Eddie make up?

435
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,638
So she's having the baby alone.

436
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,833
I'll keep it brief, I promise.

437
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,915
First, I'd like to thank Kirsten
for hosting a wonderful dinner...

438
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,672
...and to say...

439
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,196
...tomorrow is a truly important event.

440
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,476
As a father, it's a great joy to have
a family and to watch that family grow.

441
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,914
We've all been through
a great deal together...

442
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,798
...for better and for worse.

443
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,188
But tomorrow...

444
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,151
...the Nichols, the Cohens
and the Coopers become one family.

445
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,476
And I feel very lucky to be
at the head of that family.

446
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,359
Cheers and many thanks.

447
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,118
Cheers.

448
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,473
Hey, are you okay?

449
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,915
I just need some air.

450
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,394
- Hey.
- Hey.

451
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,676
Everything okay?

452
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,435
- Can we just get out of here?
- Please.

453
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,350
You know, Ryan, I...

454
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,476
I think it was this very stretch
of beach...

455
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,438
...where we first got our asses kicked
by the water-polo team.

456
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,828
Yeah?

457
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,558
Could be.

458
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,314
Yes, it definitely tastes the same.

459
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,069
Wait, when was that?

460
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,312
- When I first got here.
- Yeah, it was after that fashion show...

461
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,799
...at Holly's beach house.

462
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,916
You guys were at that party?

463
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,516
Those were the days.

464
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,754
Hey...

465
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,831
...you feeling better?

466
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,191
I've been thinking.

467
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,717
I think...

468
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,596
...I need to go back.

469
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,272
I can't let Theresa do this by herself.

470
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,710
I'm leaving.

471
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,553
Hey.

472
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,870
So we all good? Proof of purchase?
Bill of sale?

473
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,794
Yeah, so the guy called me
this morning, said he...

474
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,315
...couldn't come up with the money.
- What?

475
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,835
What the hell, man?
You told me it was a done deal.

476
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,471
- He said give him a couple of months.
- I can't do that. I need it right now.

477
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,430
- Just forget it. It just figures...
- Sorry, man.

478
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,919
Yeah, well...

479
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,753
...that's the way it's been
going for me lately.

480
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,274
Hey. Okay, I have a plan.

481
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,954
Listen, Ryan doesn't want
to leave, right?

482
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,270
We don't want him to leave. So...

483
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,714
...let's not let him.

484
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,156
We can all get jobs. We can pool
our salaries and cover his apartment...

485
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,231
...an apartment up
in the numbered streets.

486
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,597
Except Theresa wants to be with
her family, and Ryan has to be with her.

487
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,796
What? You wanna give up?
You wanna let him go?

488
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,794
Look, there's nothing else we can do,
other than kidnap him.

489
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,831
If there was something I could do,
I would.

490
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,752
Well, I think you've
done enough, so...

491
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,990
- What does that mean?
- I don't think Ryan...

492
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,879
...would be back with Theresa
if it wasn't for you and Oliver.

493
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,234
- Cohen.
- Really...

494
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,995
...all you ever did was drag that kid
into your messed-up life. I just...

495
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,754
Right. You used him to meet girls
and get out of fights.

496
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,718
- Okay, you guys, come on.
- I don't really care.

497
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,270
I've gotta get ready. So as long
as you're cool with him leaving...

498
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,156
- Hey.
- Hi.

499
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,392
We'll probably leave in an hour
if Kirsten can get ready in time.

500
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,630
It is a mystery what goes on
in that bathroom.

501
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,030
- Think you'll be done by 6?
- God, I hope so.

502
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,079
That's what time I told Theresa
to pick me up.

503
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,435
You know, as your guardian...

504
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,872
...I can stop you.

505
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,835
But if you taught me anything...

506
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,436
...you gotta do whatever it takes
to protect your family.

507
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,797
- She's my family now.
- We are too.

508
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,594
You can stay here. So can she.
We can make this work as a family.

509
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,236
I can't.

510
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,390
I can't ask that of you.

511
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,957
You've done more than enough...

512
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,588
...more than I ever could've asked
of anyone.

513
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,591
I told you...

514
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,159
...you could've done worse.
- No.

515
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,150
When you took me in, I had nothing.

516
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,392
No family, no hope.

517
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,037
I don't want this kid
to grow up like I did.

518
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,998
Well...

519
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,195
...just because you're leaving...

520
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,279
...doesn't mean I'm letting you go.

521
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,549
Now, come on, get dressed.

522
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,951
We gotta witness the most
unholy of all unions.

523
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,270
You want to dance?

524
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,199
I just want you to know...

525
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,839
...I understand why you have to do this.

526
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,878
Thanks.

527
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,834
But I wish you didn't have to.

528
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,831
Me too.

529
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,196
I love you.

530
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,917
- Hey.
- Hey.

531
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,196
They sent me out to find you.

532
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,236
Found you.

533
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,035
I figured you'd be stuffing your pockets
with cocktail weenies.

534
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,556
You're still gonna see him.

535
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,438
Chino's not that far away.

536
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,830
I just can't believe he's leaving.

537
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,560
He's the first real friend I've ever had.

538
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,880
He's the only real friend I've ever had.

539
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,113
I know.

540
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,912
- You have me.
- Yeah, but that's not the same thing.

541
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,196
You don't get it. Before he got here...

542
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,114
...I was the biggest loser.
This place was hell for me, okay?

543
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,430
And I can't help him, and...
I can't even imagine...

544
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,068
...what it's gonna be like
here without him.

545
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,715
We'll make it through it. I promise.

546
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,836
Could you tell them that I'll be back
in a few minutes, please?

547
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,194
Sure.

548
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,311
Yeah, for the record...

549
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,639
...the boat was named after you.

550
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,228
Hey.

551
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,470
- Hi.
- Is Theresa here?

552
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,192
Should be soon.

553
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,431
A little something for the road.

554
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,873
Don't worry, I didn't make it.

555
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,996
But if I did learn to cook...

556
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,628
...could we convince you to stay?

557
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,119
Thank you for...

558
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,191
...inviting me into your home.

559
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,955
You guys...

560
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,315
This year was...

561
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,436
For us too.

562
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,874
And Kirsten's not even a hugger.

563
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,595
You always know how to ruin a moment.

564
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,796
That's what I do.

565
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,436
I'm gonna say goodbye to Seth.

566
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,952
- Hey, man.
- Hi.

567
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,873
Gotta jet.

568
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,268
Cool.

569
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,156
You really gotta go?

570
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,238
Yeah.

571
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,277
Well, if you need a nanny,
I'll take the graveyard shift.

572
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,715
I think we'll manage.

573
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,675
I was afraid you'd say that.

574
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,915
You can come down and visit me.

575
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,875
Hey, so I...

576
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,270
I got you something.

577
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,478
It's yours, you know.

578
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,359
- Always good for ideas.
- Map of Tahiti.

579
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,476
Cool, man.

580
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,638
So I'll see you, then.

581
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,597
See you.
