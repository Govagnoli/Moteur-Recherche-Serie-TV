1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,394
<i>If you haven 't watched</i> The O.C.,
<i>here's what you've missed.</i>

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,154
- I'm not interested in Marissa, all right?
- Then prove it.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,795
Just come down, Johnny, please?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,436
- You're glad he's gone?
- Not gonna answer that.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,919
- What do you want?
- You.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,513
Late night last night?

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,069
Boy likes girl. Girl has access
to influential father.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,639
Boy's boss needs to close a deal.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,949
- I'm in.
- You're in?

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,553
Caleb would've been proud.

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,517
- Where's the line?
- I'm not worried about you...

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,033
...knowing where the line is.

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,634
Are you a friend of Johnny's?
I'm his cousin, Sadie.

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,394
I was wondering if I could
give you a hand.

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,073
We got unfinished business.

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,834
Come on.

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,279
We should take our pants off.

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,237
You wouldn't have come
if you didn't want to see me.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,992
- Go away.
- What the hell's he doing here?

20
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,832
<i>Some might say as a teenage girl</i>
<i>growing up in Orange County...</i>

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,991
<i>... everything is ours for the taking.</i>

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,957
<i>But sooner or later,</i>
<i>we have to choose.</i>

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,753
- Hey.
<i>- You don 't choose to choose...</i>

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,956
<i>...choosing chooses you.</i>
- Okay, what's that?

25
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,556
<i>And when we choose,</i>
<i>we're left with our ch...</i>

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,155
Oh, my God, you're listening
to your own voice.

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
All the TV shows I watch,
all these women have voiceovers.

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,792
They gave one to April on <i>The Valley.</i>

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,349
Where most of these voiceovers
don't make much sense...

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,875
...they make your life
seem dramatic and meaningful.

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,712
Our lives need to be
more dramatic?

32
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,199
No, not yours.

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,875
It's our senior year, second semester.
I think things should be more poignant.

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,315
- We don't have much time.
- You're right about that.

35
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,471
We don't have much time.
We're late, come on.

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,915
- Seth and Ryan are waiting.
- I'll be right there.

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,997
<i>No one said choosing would be easy.</i>

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,355
<i>But not choosing is even less easy.</i>

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,829
<i>Or something.</i>

40
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,118
- So where is Atwood, anyway?
- I don't know, and I don't care.

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,077
Yeah, I haven't seen him for a while.

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,754
Yeah, but look at it this way:
The hot tub's roomier.

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,832
Plus, two girls and a guy.
I like those odds.

44
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,719
You know what? You're right, Cohen.

45
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,556
- Hot tub, house to ourselves...
- I have been kind of Ionely.

46
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,153
And I have kissed a girl before.

47
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,910
And I've always wanted to.

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,116
You guys are kidding.

49
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,077
You know what they say, Cohen.

50
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,312
- What happens in the hot tub...
- Stays in the hot tub.

51
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,278
Yeah, you guys are really committed
to this joke. I commend you.

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,192
- Who's joking?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,191
- Cohen, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,557
- You're not man enough for two girls?
- I gotta call Ryan.

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,634
- Be gentle, that pipe is old.
- lf you're such an expert...

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,394
...why'd you ask for my help?
- I didn't ask for your help.

57
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,437
- I almost got it. Almost...
- Wait, hold on.

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,194
- Not so hard, you're gonna break it.
- It's not gonna break.

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,590
- Don't twist so hard. Turn it off!
- I got it.

60
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,830
- Thank you for the help.
- Here's a towel.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,673
Anytime, at your service.
You're too dry, though.

62
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,796
- That's mean.
- You okay?

63
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,234
Fine.

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,511
I'll get that. And some towels.

65
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,714
Hey, man.

66
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,752
Is this the Harper residence?
We've got some questions, ma'am.

67
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,036
- You were supposed to be here.
- I know, sorry.

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,270
We just finished painting
and the sink clogged.

69
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,476
I've got girls in bikinis
trying to seduce me.

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,438
Which sounds awesome.
But I'm scared.

71
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,558
- I'm wet and I'm cold, Ryan.
- Okay, all right. I'll be right there.

72
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,632
- Just gotta towel off.
- Why do you need to towel off?

73
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,670
- You should probably go.
- What are they doing here?

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,512
They have some questions
about Johnny.

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,989
- What kind of questions?
- They're saying his death...

76
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,914
...might not have been an accident.
- No. I saw what happened. I was there.

77
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,277
I know. So do they.
Just go home. I got this.

78
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,396
- You sure?
- Go.

79
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,396
Yeah. Okay. All right.

80
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,235
I was thinking of having a party.
Something small.

81
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,278
- Maybe you, me, Seth, Ryan...
- That's not a party.

82
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,714
That's a double date.

83
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,711
A double date?
Coop, that's a great idea.

84
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,599
- Why don't we do it this weekend?
- Can we just play it by ear?

85
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,435
Why? So you can come up with some
last-minute excuse to get out of it?

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,239
Hey, it wasn't me who didn't show
last night. That was Ryan.

87
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,437
That's true. Did you guys
come up with some sort of system?

88
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,149
Look, I'll call him later. We'll figure out
a time to sit down and talk. Okay?

89
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,517
I love our pep talks. So affirming.
Wish I could have them with my dad.

90
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,638
- What's wrong with your dad?
- He's been working hellacious hours...

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,279
...ever since Stepmonster left.

92
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,158
He was asleep when I left
this morning.

93
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,151
- Maybe he's just busy.
- That's the point.

94
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,835
He's been burying himself in his work
to avoid staring into the emotional void.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,798
- I'm sure he'll snap out of it.
- Yeah, so will you and Ryan.

96
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,237
What did I tell you? I'll be outside.

97
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,232
Hello?

98
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,914
Yeah, this is.

99
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,472
No, Aunt Gwen,
you just stay up there with my mom.

100
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,552
I don't know, but I'll figure it out.

101
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,835
I love what you've done there. Probably
get a cable show to pay for that.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,230
HGTV's <i>Extremely Sad</i>
<i>Home Makeovers.</i>

103
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,630
No one's taking your house.
I promise.

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,553
- Okay. I love you. Bye.
- Hey.

105
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,280
I just thought I'd stop by,
see how everything's going.

106
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,590
The bank's gonna foreclose
on my aunt's mortgage.

107
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,115
And until the cops figure out
how Johnny died...

108
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,589
...there's no insurance money
from his accident.

109
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,513
So now the insurance
company's frozen the claim.

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,989
- He fell off a cliff.
- Do they think Ryan pushed him?

111
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,798
Guess they've recovered
new evidence.

112
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,349
- What evidence?
- I don't know. They wouldn't say.

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,110
Don't worry,
it's not you they're interested in.

114
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,998
They asked questions
about Marissa.

115
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,833
- And?
- And I said they should talk to her.

116
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,752
As you can tell, we are over
our advertising budget for the month.

117
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,911
Maybe we can put something on
OCNewMatch. com.

118
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,152
We could call our Newport publisher,
see if he could put NewMatch...

119
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,356
...in one of his high-end
lifestyle magazines.

120
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,590
You want some more coffee?

121
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,069
Julie, are you even listening to me?

122
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,676
Yes, of course I'm listening. You've been
talking ever since I got here.

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,755
What's going on?
You've been zombie-like all week.

124
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,231
Another late one with Doc Roberts.

125
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,231
In the back of his Maserati, no less.

126
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,595
I didn't know Maseratis
had back seats.

127
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,634
Maybe you two should stop
sneaking around and go public.

128
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,439
I don't disagree,
and neither does my chiropractor.

129
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,909
But, you know, with the death
of Marissa's friend...

130
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,640
...and Summer being left
motherless for the second time...

131
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,394
...we just don't wanna make
any unnecessary waves.

132
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,239
- Hello?
- Good morning, gorgeous.

133
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,391
- How'd you sleep?
- All by my Ionesome.

134
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,073
We've gotta to do something
about that.

135
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,032
Just found a note from Summer.
I think she's getting suspicious.

136
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,031
<i>I hate keeping secrets from the kids.</i>

137
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,430
Yes, well, maybe we should
discuss that.

138
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,670
- Covertly, of course.
<i>- How about tomorrow night?</i>

139
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,239
I know the perfect hideaway.

140
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,595
Well, I like the sound of that.

141
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,671
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

142
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,635
Oh, Kiks, I'm so tired.
I could really use a quick catnap.

143
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,631
Wake me in 20.

144
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,311
Well, I pulled the permits.
Unfortunately, I think I left them at...

145
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,233
Scratch that. I'll fax them from here.

146
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,675
You need to start tying
a string around your finger.

147
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,114
Do I?

148
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,078
Yesterday it was your wallet,
Monday it was your BlackBerry.

149
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,356
Well, I find you very distracting
in the morning.

150
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,592
And in the afternoon, late at night.

151
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,591
Does that mean
you're coming over tonight?

152
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,070
Matt, we are way out of time
with the hospital. You've gotta talk to...

153
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,074
- Maya. What a nice surprise.
- Morning, Sandy. You're looking well.

154
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,356
You too. I'm sorry to interrupt.

155
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,590
- Buzz me when you're free.
- Oh, he's free now.

156
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,069
Nobody respects company time
like a company girl.

157
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,390
- Thank you for...
- Yeah, I'll have my assistant...

158
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,596
...pick up some string
for those fingers.

159
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,558
- Say hello to Kirsten for me.
- You bet.

160
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,119
Already the early office drop-in.
You two are hitting it off.

161
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,669
- Yeah. She is really great.
- I'm glad to hear it.

162
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,957
If we don't get that proposal
to Dr. Griffin and the board by Monday...

163
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,997
...we're dead in the water.

164
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,434
Yeah, I know.

165
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,511
But the way things are
between Maya and I...

166
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,319
...I just can't ask her
to get us a meeting with her dad.

167
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,357
I don't do this right,
it could backfire.

168
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,273
You need to come through.
The clock is ticking.

169
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,359
Yeah, can you just tell him
that his daughter called again?

170
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,478
Thanks. Oy.

171
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,950
- As in "vey"?
- Attagirl.

172
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,678
Apparently my dad's
in "surgery" all day.

173
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,991
How many calf implants does it take
to fill a hole in the human heart?

174
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,435
- Hi, friends.
- Hey.

175
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,079
So, what are we talking about?

176
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,152
Summer's worried her dad's burying
his pain and Ioneliness in work.

177
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,351
- That's so sad.
- Yeah.

178
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,158
What's the plan?

179
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,350
- You guys don't have a plan?
- Do you?

180
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,959
Off the top of my head?

181
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,476
Get him into therapy to explore the root
of why he can't express himself...

182
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,914
...in a lasting partnership.

183
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,392
Or, find him a hot date,
take his mind off being utterly alone.

184
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,355
Does he still have the things
on his thing?

185
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,875
- A little penicillin cleared that right up.
- Great.

186
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,917
It looks fantastic.

187
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,637
Good. That's good.

188
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,156
You know, I would offer up my mom,
but she's not a big second-chancer.

189
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,118
What about getting Seth's mom
to take your dad as a client?

190
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,916
- That's not a bad idea.
- But the last person...

191
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,878
...that should be choosing my dad's
next great love is my dad.

192
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,314
But me, on the other hand...

193
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,358
...I can make a list of all the stuff
he should be looking for...

194
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,875
...and pick the girl myself.
- That's good.

195
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,156
I'll start brainstorming ideas
for fun things...

196
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,470
...for old people to do on a first date.

197
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,994
I've been trying to find you.

198
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,151
Police talk to you?

199
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,551
Yeah, they call you too? They must
wanna talk to everyone who was there.

200
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,757
No. Actually, Sadie said
they only asked her about you.

201
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,319
Me?

202
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,516
Yeah. You want me to go with you?

203
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,954
No. No, it's okay.

204
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,156
Whatever it is, I don't wanna
drag you into it.

205
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,833
- Look, I'm...
- So how's it...?

206
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,876
Look, I know I haven't
been around much lately.

207
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,270
It's okay. You're helping Gwen.
That's important.

208
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,829
Yeah, actually I need to go
over there after school...

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,797
...but maybe we could
get together later?

210
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,234
- Talk.
- Yeah, of course.

211
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,153
I'll call you. Tell Sadie I say hi.

212
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,713
You know, you might wanna see Sandy
about the police.

213
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,399
I'm sure it's nothing. Thanks.

214
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,112
Hey.

215
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,034
So I figured we'd start
by patching up the wall.

216
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,589
Which is really more fun
than it sounds.

217
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,398
No, it's not.

218
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,028
No, it's not.
You look like you're on a mission.

219
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,474
That's because I am.

220
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,790
- Everything okay?
- It will be.

221
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,520
Once I get done smacking
that stupid bastard around.

222
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,716
- Oh, who's getting smacked around?
- My uncle.

223
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,599
- Johnny's dad?
- lf you wanna call him that.

224
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,558
The patching will have to wait
until after I get back from Brea.

225
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,994
Yeah. Sure. You want a ride?

226
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,469
- I've got a car.
- You're gonna need some company.

227
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,314
I kind of already have some.

228
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,358
- Hey, what's up. You ready to roll?
- What is this guy doing here?

229
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,157
That's funny because I was about
to ask her the same thing about you.

230
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,437
- You've always been kind of slow.
- But I'm quick at kicking your ass.

231
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,953
Running away is more
how I remember it.

232
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,394
Really? Well...

233
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,757
...I'd love to jump back in the ring.
- Too much testosterone.

234
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,354
Volchok's dad used to be
buddies with Jack Harper.

235
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,318
- He knows where we can find him.
- He can give us the address.

236
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,553
Well, I'm kind of looking forward
to a road trip.

237
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,950
- You know, catching up?
- We'll send you a postcard.

238
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,599
Ryan, don't.

239
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,831
Why don't you just
write down the address?

240
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,791
Whatever. Any chance to avoid
Johnny's dad sounds good to me.

241
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,950
- I hate that guy.
- Thanks. I'll send him your best.

242
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,398
So if you're gonna be with her, does that
mean your girlfriend's all alone?

243
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,350
What goes around comes around.

244
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,871
Wanna tell me the deal
with you and Volchok?

245
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,678
I was visiting Johnny one summer.

246
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,559
And I was younger. Stupid.
It didn't work out.

247
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,994
Hard to believe.

248
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,991
You wanna take the 5
to the 57?

249
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,434
It's faster.

250
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,149
Right, because you know so much
about driving inland.

251
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,908
When was the last time
your parents' $80,000 SUV...

252
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,672
...was east of South Coast Plaza?

253
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,354
The Cohens are my guardians,
not my parents.

254
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,078
Grew up in Chino. Dad's in prison.

255
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,391
My mom couldn't make it work.

256
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,718
I just knew there was something
about you that didn't quite fit in.

257
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,398
In a good way.

258
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,077
I wonder if your dad
knows my Uncle Jack.

259
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,832
- Why would he?
- From prison.

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,274
He's been in a couple times.

261
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,396
I'd put him back if I could.
He owes my aunt years of child support.

262
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,959
He's her last hope.

263
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,076
Now she needs that money.

264
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,720
- So you think you can turn him?
- lf I don't try, who will?

265
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,039
What would you feel about dinner?

266
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,431
Sure, whatever you feel like.

267
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,068
Tomorrow night.
Me, you, Kirsten and Maya.

268
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,798
Yeah, that sounds good.

269
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,317
Have you been locked in your office
all day planning our social lives?

270
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,277
Let me ask Maya about the proposal.

271
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,194
- Sandy, I said I'd do it.
- No, it's better this way.

272
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,272
I'll bring it up. It'll be easier.

273
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,479
Marissa. Come on in.

274
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,870
I went by the house.
Kirsten told me you were here.

275
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,315
Oh, the door's always open, honey.
You remember Matt.

276
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,593
I think I need some legal advice.

277
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,990
The cops wanna talk to me
about Johnny.

278
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,071
They don't seem to think
it was an accident.

279
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,231
Did they suspect
Ryan's to blame for this?

280
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,674
No, I actually think...

281
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,558
...they're trying to blame me.
- You?

282
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,188
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm supposed to be at the station...

283
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,679
...giving them a statement.

284
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,513
I'll call and get that rescheduled.
We'll do it at the house.

285
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,319
If you don't mind,
I'd kind of like to keep Ryan out of this.

286
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,432
Of course.

287
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,716
- Feel free to use my place.
- Thanks, Matt.

288
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,155
But before that,
we'll go over what you're gonna say.

289
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,437
And you're gonna have to tell me
everything you know about Johnny...

290
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,238
...and you and that night.

291
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,034
Hey, Summer. I didn't know
you were joining us tonight.

292
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,713
Seth just went to pick up dinner.

293
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,314
Actually, I came to see you guys.

294
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,357
Oh, is everything okay?

295
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,112
Well, no, not really.

296
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,592
It's my dad. He needs, like, serious
and immediate help with his love life.

297
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,076
Really? What makes you say that?

298
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,992
I've never seen him so miserable.

299
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,516
He's barely ever at home.
He's either at work, which is so lame...

300
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,193
...or at the gym,
which is weird.

301
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,952
He's already dropped like 20 pounds.

302
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,750
Well, maybe he's getting into shape
in case he meets that special someone.

303
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,514
- Or maybe he's already met her.
- Oh, please don't say that.

304
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,796
My dad has disastrous taste in women.

305
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,236
If I don't step in, he'll wind up
with the first money-grubbing slutbag...

306
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,914
...that gets into the back seat
of his Maserati.

307
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,877
Julie, would you like to take this?

308
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,755
Actually, all I need is,
like, a list of candidates...

309
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,956
...because I did all the work myself.

310
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,034
They're all blond.

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,434
Sharon Stone in <i>Basic Instinct?</i>

312
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,919
It's the look my dad goes for.

313
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,551
And this is a list of non-negotiable
qualifications that she must possess.

314
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,473
"Mental stability.

315
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,552
Crossword enthusiast. Love horses."

316
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,838
"Must have own money.
Plastic-surgery free. Fluent in Italian."

317
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,911
This doesn't leave
much wiggle room, Summer.

318
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,436
It's just that my dad didn't have much
in common with his first two wives...

319
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,876
...and they left,
so it's just not fair to him or to me.

320
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,353
- Okay, well, we'll see what we can do.
- Really?

321
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,398
Thank you guys so much.
This means so much to me.

322
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,632
I'm gonna go see if my dad's
actually coming home tonight.

323
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,279
Bye.

324
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,236
- What are you gonna do, Julie?
- I don't know.

325
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,311
Is it possible I'm not enough
woman for him?

326
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,277
Do I really need to be all these things?

327
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,590
Julie, you're never gonna be
any of these things.

328
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,632
Okay, blond, maybe.

329
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,951
Fluent in Italian? Not so much.

330
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,872
You have to tell Summer the truth.

331
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,511
The guy really keeps up
on his yard work.

332
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,752
Yeah, Uncle Jack
is a really good neighbor.

333
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,238
Hi, we're looking for Jack Harper.

334
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,913
But you're not him.

335
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,433
He in some kind of trouble?

336
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,511
No. No trouble.

337
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,954
No. Good news, actually.

338
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,315
Too bad. I fricking hate that guy.

339
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,040
He owes someone money
and we're trying to collect.

340
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,600
He moved to Indio. That's all I know.

341
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,318
A phone number? Forwarding address?

342
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,277
No one here was
looking to keep in touch.

343
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,271
Okay. Thank you for your help.

344
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,069
You find Jack Harper,
you won't be thanking me.

345
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,470
So we're going to Indio.

346
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,796
Ryan, Indio's like two hours
into the desert.

347
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,235
We won't even be able
to start looking until morning.

348
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,674
Yeah, so we spend the night.

349
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,273
I think you might be missed.

350
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,873
I will make some calls.

351
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,069
- You don't have to do this.
- I want to.

352
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,233
Good evening.

353
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,752
Julie?

354
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,319
<i>Buena sera,</i> doctor.

355
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,510
What's a 13-letter word for secretive?

356
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,510
Surreptitious.

357
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,354
I don't think you can smoke here.

358
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,474
Julie, what is all this?

359
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,517
Oh, do you like it?

360
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,637
Because tonight is all about you.

361
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,839
I didn't know you do crosswords.

362
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,998
No, Mom, they're out of bibimbap.

363
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,991
Yes, all gone.

364
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,798
How about bulgogi?

365
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,234
Two orders?

366
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,270
Mom, next time
let me call in the order.

367
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,112
I know, that's why they call it
"Korean barbecue."

368
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,710
Okay. Goodbye.

369
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,957
So, what'll it be?

370
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,156
Blond, Italian, philanthropist?

371
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,673
I can be all of them.

372
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,276
Tell me, in your wildest dreams, what
would you do with a willing woman?

373
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,351
Okay.

374
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,470
<i>So did you guys make plans</i>
<i>to talk or what?</i>

375
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,712
Yeah. We agreed we'd talk,
we just didn't pick a time or a place.

376
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,711
Coop, usually a time and place...

377
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,758
...are crucial aspects to any plan.
- I know.

378
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,911
You and Ryan
have been getting along okay.

379
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,877
That's because
we haven't been talking.

380
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,519
Just call him.

381
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,789
- Do it.
- Fine. Bye.

382
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,591
- You play poker?
- What's the pot?

383
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,393
Well, I got like 20 bucks on me.

384
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,231
That's not gonna do it.

385
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,712
Then what?

386
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,434
You ever play strip poker?

387
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,431
Yes, I have played strip poker.

388
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,192
I'm wearing more clothes
than you are, though.

389
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,157
Yes, but I think
I'm a way better player.

390
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,393
You think so?

391
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,071
- Yeah. Just deal.
- Okay.

392
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,914
Loser sleeps on the floor.

393
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,911
Which basically means
you're on the floor.

394
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,479
Sure, sure.

395
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,278
Your bookie?

396
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,432
No, just Seth.

397
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,272
I'll call him in the morning.

398
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,518
<i>Hey, it's Ryan. Leave a message.</i>

399
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,075
- Room service.
- What's on the menu?

400
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,550
Black coffee and jelly doughnuts,
courtesy of the Circle K.

401
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,234
- Poolside service.
- I gotta remember this place.

402
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,871
So I was flipping through
the yellow pages and I found this.

403
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,474
- Think that's him?
- When we were kids, he was Big H...

404
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,756
...and Johnny was Little H,
so it's gotta be.

405
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,356
All right. I'm gonna shower,
wake myself up.

406
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,476
I didn't actually sleep so well
last night.

407
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,279
If you wanna sleep in the bed,
don't bluff with a pair.

408
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,756
Did you call Seth back?

409
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,149
- Dude, where are you?
- Indio. How much trouble am I in?

410
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,595
Mom and Dad think
you're helping inner-city kids...

411
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,318
...paint a overpass mural.

412
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,994
I'm rolling around in your bed
so it looks slept in.

413
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,038
- You'd do that anyway.
- So? How about a little gratitude?

414
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,589
You're right, I owe you,
but it's for a good cause.

415
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,830
You wanna clue me in on
what that cause is?

416
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,719
Less you know, the better.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

417
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,599
Except the bed thing.
That's just creepy.

418
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,189
- Seth, what are you doing?
- Ryan's painting a mural.

419
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,590
- What are you doing?
- How did you get in?

420
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,671
Never mind all that,
this is an emergency.

421
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,957
Summer's gonna majorly wig when
she finds out who her dad is dating.

422
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,270
Yeah, well, whoever it is,
staying out of it.

423
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,113
Julie Cooper. I caught them
having an illicit liaison...

424
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,635
...and the way they were talking
was perverted.

425
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,474
Wait, perverted how?

426
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,912
- Just what are we gonna tell Summer?
- What's who gonna tell Summer?

427
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,073
- Do I need to call a locksmith?
- What are you doing here, T-bag?

428
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,960
You know what, she's your girlfriend,
you should tell her.

429
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,111
Oh, please, not you two again?

430
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,431
Oh, no. No, no, no,
I'm totally over that weirdness. No.

431
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,556
Your dad and Julie Cooper
are doing it.

432
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,836
It's a shock. I wouldn't have
believed it myself...

433
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,436
...if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
It was all very mid '90s, overwrought...

434
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,718
...thriller, a sort of a Verhoeven shape.
- It's like a Sharon Stone movie.

435
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,950
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, but hold on.

436
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,998
This kind of broad reveal
requires independent confirmation.

437
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,355
Fine. You can see for yourself.

438
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,114
I happen to know
where their next tryst is going to be.

439
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,840
Keep your eye on the ball and...

440
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,352
...swing through it.

441
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,954
Okay?

442
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,190
Right? Your turn, come on.

443
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,753
Neil, I am not very athletic.

444
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,836
Spread your feet a little bit. Okay.
Let the grip rest gently in your hand.

445
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,515
You keep your eye on the ball, and you're
gonna swing through the ball. Okay?

446
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,955
- Raise the club gently...
- Now, if I break a nail...

447
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,839
...your next fantasy better involve
a French manicure.

448
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,592
Are we gonna do this now?

449
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,398
- Look at the ball.
- Okay. Okay. Yes.

450
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,516
There's no way.
This is my dad's sacred place.

451
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,159
He would not bring a woman here.

452
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,869
Maybe he doesn't think of Julie
as an actual woman, just a golf buddy.

453
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,314
Who he makes out with.

454
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,711
I cannot believe this.

455
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,798
- Let's go.
- Okay.

456
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,752
Let's go!

457
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,877
- That's so horrible.
- I think they're cute.

458
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,434
Jack Harper in?

459
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,113
He's out on a job.

460
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,317
- lf you need a bond, I can take care of it.
- No, we don't need a bond.

461
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,754
We're looking for him.

462
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,358
When do you expect him back?

463
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,752
- Who wants to know?
- Well, his dead son, for starters.

464
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,672
- Get out of here.
- We don't mind waiting.

465
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,513
I got authority to protect
this property with lethal force.

466
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,398
You know what that means?

467
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,028
- Means we'll be out in the car.
- Yeah.

468
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,869
<i>Hey, Marissa! Come up here!</i>
<i>You gotta see this view!</i>

469
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,951
<i>Was your friend Johnny a big drinker?</i>

470
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,792
- No.
- But he was drinking that night.

471
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,155
- Any idea why?
- You're asking her to speculate.

472
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,390
<i>Did anything happen</i>
<i>to Johnny that day?</i>

473
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,870
<i>Anything that might've made him</i>
<i>want to drink? A fight with a friend...</i>

474
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,553
<i>As bad as I wanna be with you.</i>

475
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,030
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>And I think you love me too.</i>

476
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,151
- Yes or no.
- Excuse me, detective...

477
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,629
...we need a minute alone.
- " What we're doing here...

478
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,078
<i>... isn 't only unfair to you, it's unfair to..."</i>
<i>This next part's burned here.</i>

479
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,310
Ryan. To Ryan.

480
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,311
<i>- I'm with you.</i>
<i>- But that's not the whole story, is it?</i>

481
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,119
<i>Recovered from a fire pit</i>
<i>on the beach.</i>

482
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,999
"I'm not in love with you,
and I never will be."

483
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,390
May I see that?

484
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,319
Come on, come up!

485
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,516
<i>Seems like Johnny</i>
<i>took the news pretty hard.</i>

486
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,911
<i>I can 't imagine that it made</i>
<i>your boyfriend very happy either.</i>

487
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,470
Ryan didn't even know this existed.

488
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,073
He has nothing to do with this.

489
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,515
- Let him ask his question.
- No. I wanna tell him.

490
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,399
Ryan didn't push him.

491
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,120
<i>And Johnny didn 't commit suicide.</i>

492
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,669
<i>If you really wanna know</i>
<i>what happened, he slipped.</i>

493
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,956
<i>Johnny!</i>

494
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,474
No, thanks.

495
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,199
You know, Johnny and I
used to be friends.

496
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,319
Yeah, he and Chili
used to follow me and the guys around...

497
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,119
...trying to get us to teach them
how to surf.

498
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,114
Yeah, well, what happened?

499
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,318
He got better than me.

500
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,879
And I didn't like that.

501
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,271
Your secret's safe with me.

502
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,271
- I should go.
- Look...

503
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,672
...if you ever wanna kick it or hang out
or something, I'm around.

504
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,831
- I'm not interested.
- You sure about that?

505
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,394
I can keep a secret too.

506
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,074
How did it go?

507
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,356
Well, there were a few surprises.

508
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,637
There doesn't seem to be evidence
pointing to suicide or foul play...

509
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,429
...so if that's the case,
they'll have to rule it an accident.

510
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,158
I'm glad.

511
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,278
Honey, you look exhausted.

512
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,476
Well, thank you.
You look beautiful, as always.

513
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,557
I was up most of the night
finishing this hospital proposal.

514
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,632
Maybe we should reschedule
with Matt and Maya for next weekend.

515
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,837
Oh, I wish we could,
but it would defeat the whole purpose.

516
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,389
- I thought the purpose was dinner.
- Well, dinner...

517
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,438
...and Maya's our chance at
a second hearing at the hospital.

518
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,558
The way they've been getting along,
I think he really likes her.

519
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,676
I thought you abandoned
this idea weeks ago.

520
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,674
Why would we abandon it?
She's not naive. She might wanna help.

521
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,355
She might wanna rethink the relationship
if it doesn't go well. I know I would.

522
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,351
Oh, honey, we're all adults here.

523
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,318
And this project has the potential
to do an awful lot of good.

524
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,517
Stakeouts are so much cooler
in movies.

525
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,558
That's because they cut to the part
where the guy shows up.

526
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,552
That's him. Come on.

527
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,712
Jack Harper?

528
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,030
- Who's asking?
- Friend of your son's.

529
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,880
- I don't have a son.
- I know, Uncle Jack.

530
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,837
That's why we're here.

531
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,554
Sadie?

532
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,472
Aunt Gwen says thanks for the card.

533
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,837
- I didn't send her a card.
- You know what else you didn't send?

534
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,036
Child support for
like the last three years.

535
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,948
See, I needed that money
to start my business.

536
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,038
Really? So is this truck
here a part of your business?

537
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,792
Yeah, matter of fact it is.

538
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,837
Oh, it's nice.

539
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,037
You must be doing well, so you won't
mind paying her what you owe her.

540
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,509
I don't owe that bitch anything.

541
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,794
Sadie.

542
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,471
Hey, you're joking, right?

543
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,835
- Come here! Give me that!
- Get off her!

544
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,877
Get off of her!

545
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,554
Get off of me!

546
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,592
- Let go of me! Let go!
- You know, this ain't high school, kid.

547
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,955
Stop! Stop it! You let go of me!

548
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,390
Ryan!

549
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,557
Get off me. Get off. Get off me!

550
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,235
Ryan! Let go. Ryan!

551
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,437
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's not that bad.

552
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,318
Except when you do that.

553
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,995
No, I'm sorry
that I dragged you into this.

554
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,436
Yeah. Well, if I remember,
you kind of begged me not to come.

555
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,679
I just wish we got the money.

556
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,876
What do you think Johnny's mom's
gonna do now?

557
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,952
I don't know.
Jack was kind of her last chance.

558
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,834
I bet it's kind of hard for you to imagine
Gwen married to a guy like that.

559
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,071
Easier than you think.

560
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,152
Turns out Johnny and I
kind of had a lot in common.

561
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,954
You okay?

562
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,238
I will be.

563
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,556
First time I laid eyes on Matt
was at a tailgate party.

564
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,994
He was doing a keg stand.

565
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,913
I thought it was when
you rushed my house as a little sister.

566
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,389
No. That's the first time you saw me.

567
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,312
I was stalking you for months.

568
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,710
I used to walk behind Kirsten
on her way home.

569
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,032
She lived on the opposite side of
campus, but I lived to watch her walk.

570
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,553
And I called campus security.

571
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,632
Yeah, it was worth every minute
I was detained in questioning.

572
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,394
Now, here we are.
I'm running Kirsten's father's company.

573
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,678
Matt here has been working like a dog
on a proposal for your dad's hospital.

574
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,876
Yeah. I wish that had worked out.

575
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,594
We don't give up that easily.

576
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,320
We were hoping you could help us
get one more shot.

577
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,392
We've listened to what he had to say
and we reworked the proposal.

578
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,030
You're a passionate man, Sandy,
I'll give you that.

579
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,436
Why don't I take a look at it.
If I like what I see, I'll pass it along.

580
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,956
- We'll set up a meeting for next week.
- Well, we can't wait that long.

581
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,156
The board is moving forward
on Monday.

582
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,071
- I see.
- Maya, it's not a big deal.

583
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,549
- Don't worry about it.
- It really is that big a deal.

584
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,508
You're our only chance. Sorry in advance
if this is too much pressure on you...

585
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,557
...but this hospital could help
a lot of people.

586
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,429
That's the only reason we're asking.
But we are asking. We need your help.

587
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,672
Sandy, we're eating.
Can we at least wait until after dinner?

588
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,434
Matt, do you want me to show
the proposal to my father too?

589
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,033
Yeah, I would.

590
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,832
Then I'd be happy to, Sandy.
Will you excuse me?

591
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,712
She said she'd be happy to.

592
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,919
Wait, but...

593
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,710
- Wait, Seth.
- What?

594
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,030
What if my dad actually falls for her?

595
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,192
Would that be the worst?
You and Marissa are already like sisters.

596
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,918
Why not make it official?

597
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,152
No, but it's not about Marissa.
It's about what's right for my dad.

598
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,276
And it's definitely not Julie Cooper.

599
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,556
Okay, I mean, no offense,
but she's Julie Cooper.

600
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,994
So what? I kind of like her.

601
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,392
I don't care that she married my grandpa
for money or had sex with Luke.

602
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,879
I think she's got moxie.

603
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,439
Summer? You home?

604
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,158
Gross, I'm studying. Get off me.

605
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,551
- Hey, sir. How's it going?
- Hello, Seth.

606
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,072
Dad. How was your day?

607
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,436
One of the best on record, actually.

608
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,273
Oh, really? Any particular reason?

609
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,557
Well, I think for the first time
in a long time, I might be happy.

610
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,598
Sweetheart, do you have plans
tomorrow? I'd like to talk to you...

611
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,399
...about something.
- No, I'm free.

612
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,471
Good. Then it's a date.

613
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,679
Hey, Dad, Dad...

614
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,197
Nothing. It can wait.

615
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,113
Okay.

616
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,433
Right now?

617
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,957
- I'm proud of you.
- Well, you heard the man. He's happy.

618
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,994
- Oh, no.
- I've got so many hormones.

619
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,037
Oh, get off...

620
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,352
- You must be dumber than you look.
- I just wanna talk.

621
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,829
- I got nothing to say to you.
- Good, you can listen.

622
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,877
Oh, man.

623
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,314
My father did a lot of bad things. Drank,
beat on my mom, my brother and me.

624
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,678
- That's a real sad story, kid.
- But the worst thing he ever did...

625
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,991
...was go away.
Leave my mom with nothing.

626
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,351
No money, we had no shot.

627
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,954
Any chance we had at a better life...

628
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,513
...it pretty much disappeared.

629
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,353
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Make things right with Johnny.

630
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,156
It's a little late for that now.

631
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,117
I mean, it's not like Johnny
would ever even know.

632
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,157
Maybe not...

633
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,394
...but you will.

634
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,836
Get him out of here.

635
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,758
I don't ever wanna see you again.

636
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,719
- What is this?
- It's a start.

637
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,876
All right, talk to you soon.

638
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,113
That was Matt.

639
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,078
Maya loved the proposal,
said she's gonna give it to her father.

640
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,912
Congratulations.

641
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,718
And then she broke up with him.

642
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,593
She's moving back to New York.

643
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,116
They've known each other for years.
They could've had a future together.

644
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,510
Aren't you taking this match-making
too seriously?

645
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,113
She's moving because she wants to.

646
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,998
You've done a complete 180.

647
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,594
A few weeks ago,
you were uncomfortable about this.

648
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,397
I'm still uncomfortable with this.
I'd rather be defending criminals.

649
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,996
But this is what I do right now,
so I might as well try to succeed at it.

650
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,631
So this is just another day
at the office.

651
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,510
I wouldn't put it that way.

652
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,591
Remember when I said
that I wasn't worried...

653
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,274
...about Sandy Cohen
knowing where the line is?

654
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,871
I'm officially worried.

655
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,756
What are you gonna say
about your face?

656
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,956
Sandy and Kirsten are used to it.

657
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,638
And Marissa?

658
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,429
You know,
when you mentioned this trip...

659
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,270
...I really wanted to come with you.

660
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,789
I didn't even care
what you were doing...

661
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,908
...I needed to get out of town.

662
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,551
Feel something different.

663
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,951
Yeah, this was definitely different.

664
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,597
Now that you're back?

665
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,591
Marissa and I need to talk.

666
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,989
- Hey.
- Hey. How was your weekend?

667
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,071
I've had better.

668
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,399
<i>Everything okay with the police?</i>

669
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,834
Sandy seems to think so.

670
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,953
I called you yesterday.

671
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,159
I know.

672
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,991
- This is hard.
- You don't have to say it.

673
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,835
No, I do. It's not because of Johnny
or Trey or anything else.

674
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,672
- No, I know.
- It's just...

675
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,910
Not working.

676
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,510
Hard to believe after everything
we've been through...

677
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,671
...we've got nothing left to say.

678
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,074
We never were that good
with words anyway.

679
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,431
- I guess, well, I'll see you at school.
- Yeah.

680
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,158
See you.

681
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,554
Hi.

682
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,877
So I was unpacking the car,
and I was just thinking...

683
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,152
Any chance you're up for a rematch?

684
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,838
- Deal.
- Okay.

685
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,433
Okay.

686
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,113
Thanks.

687
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,831
