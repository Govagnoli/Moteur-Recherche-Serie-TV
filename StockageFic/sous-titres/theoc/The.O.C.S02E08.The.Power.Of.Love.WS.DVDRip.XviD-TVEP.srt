1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,149
Previously on The O. C.:

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,550
I don 't want this to be
like kissing your sister.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,188
-Kirsten doesn't know, right?
-She thinks we' re friends.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,079
I know you' re not on the market for any
new relatives, how about a friend?

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,430
I did a musical or two myself in college.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,636
Stop him before he starts
singing "Greased Lightnin'. "

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,677
-Are you drunk?
-She was like this when I picked her up.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,798
-You don't have to defend yourself to her.
-But you do, young lady.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,679
-I need to go see a girl.
-The girl who thinks you're too nice?

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,229
-You stole a car?
-Yep. I do it for kicks.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,038
-Are you trying to impress me?
-What?

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,475
You're a good guy.
That's why I like you.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,109
Cohen residence.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,669
Ryan. Hey, good.
I was hoping you'd answer.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,559
-lf you' re alone, cough twice.
-I'm alone.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,870
-Not as stealth, but it works.
-Where are you?

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,951
Remember when I said
I was going to bed?

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,553
-Didn't happen?
-No, it did.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,314
Just not in my bed.
But I did bring my favorite pillow.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,552
You know, the really fluffy one?

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,714
You don't wanna stick around
for a little home schooling?

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,871
-Maybe I do.
-Seth, your parents are awake.

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,157
-That's why I need you to cover me.
-Let me think about that.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,989
-No.
-Ryan.

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,673
Think of my parents for a second.

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,274
They don't wanna know
I spent all night with a lady.

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,193
It's only gonna hurt them.
You know how fragile they are.

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,429
Okay? Thank you.

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,109
-Hello.
-Well, top of the morning to you too.

30
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,831
Happy anniversary.

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,272
Yeah.

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,038
Happy anniversary to you as well.

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,593
-I love you.
-I love you too.

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,791
I love you more now
than I did 1 9 years ago.

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,670
You mean you love me more now than
you did the year after we got married?

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,476
No. Come on, honey. Come on.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,951
No, you know what I'm saying.

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,839
That newlywed year,
that doesn't count. That's a given.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,036
You don't know
how long we've been married.

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,671
No, no. I was kidding you.
I know it's our 20th.

41
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,114
How could I forget?
Who forgets their 20th anniversary?

42
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,595
Apparently, you.

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,628
No, not me.

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,389
If I had thought this was
our 1 9th anniversary...

45
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,794
...I would not have planned a celebration
only worthy of a 20th.

46
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,993
-You planned something?
-Yeah.

47
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,918
It's gonna be awesome.

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,032
I gotta go.

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,595
Hey, need a ride to school,
like, this second?

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,797
-No, thanks. Taking my bike. See you.
-Do not leave me. Not now.

51
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,599
Where the hell is Seth?
I need reinforcements.

52
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,309
-Seth left early for school.
-He did? He never leaves early for school.

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,596
Yeah, he had a report to finish, I think.

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,958
-A report. About what?
-The history of agriculture in California.

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,829
-That's specific.
-Yep.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,877
-Happy anniversary.
-Hey, kid.

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,837
I was a public defender
for many years.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,150
I've been lied to by the best.

59
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,278
He snuck out to see his girlfriend,
didn't he?

60
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,998
No, he didn't.

61
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,395
The history of agriculture
in California?

62
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,279
The key to lying is to be vague.
Have I taught you nothing?

63
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,668
Look, I'm not a good liar.

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,628
In hiding your relationship with Lindsay,
you seem to not have such a problem.

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,028
We're both in trouble now.

66
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,317
Yeah. I feel bad about it,
but you kind of deserve it after that.

67
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,199
Okay. You know what?
Find someone else to cover for you.

68
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,033
Cover for me?
Let me tell you something.

69
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,873
If we were buddy cops,
and I like to think that we are...

70
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,632
...I'd be riddled with bullets now.

71
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,350
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

72
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,149
-You read the new Whedon X-Men?
-I did. I'll tell you my problems with it.

73
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,114
Too early for comic book talk.
Are you getting a coffee?

74
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,350
Yeah. I'm getting two.

75
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,351
Thank you, sweetie.

76
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,589
Isn't it interesting how Summer is
drawn to the lovers of comic books?

77
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,557
Yes, Cohen, Zach does
read comic books.

78
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,438
But Zach also plays water polo...

79
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,955
...and looks like the guy
in the Abercrombie ad.

80
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,476
You read comic books and you wear
the same clothes that you slept in.

81
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,671
Excuse me.
I did not sleep in these clothes.

82
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,150
Okay, so putting on the same
skeezy shirt from yesterday is a choice.

83
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,673
No, it was just all I had.

84
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,592
Did you shack at your girlfriend's...

85
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,433
...and do the walk of shame
to school this morning?

86
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,314
You shacked at Alex's?
You guys are shacking?

87
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,837
-The washing machine broke.
-No offense, but you're a bad liar.

88
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,794
It's cool, you guys.
I don't care or anything.

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,916
No, hey. I know.

90
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,192
Here you go.

91
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,955
You know, I can't drink coffee this early.
It just, like, makes me nauseous.

92
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,519
Sorry.

93
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,078
We shoot this way, we get the house.

94
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,834
If we shoot the reverse,
we get the pool and ocean so....

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,152
Square footage or spectacular views?
Cal?

96
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,312
This photo shoot is important.
You could at least feign interest.

97
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,516
Which is exactly what I'm doing.

98
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,594
-I need money.
-Well, good morning to you too.

99
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,194
Riviera Magazine wants to do
a big photo spread on us.

100
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,148
It's a great opportunity to demonstrate
our family's strength and resilience.

101
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,435
It's wonderful exposure.

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,397
Any chance to expose yourself, huh?

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,949
Promise you'll be here,
wear something Marc Jacobs...

104
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,476
-...and won't be off with your boyfriend.
-So I can pretend we're happy?

105
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,394
-Then I can't give you any money.
-For the love of God.

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,113
Thank you.

107
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,556
-Great. Way to undercut my power.
-I happen to agree with her.

108
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,350
We are far from the perfect family, and
I see no point in lying about it publicly.

109
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,752
Thing is, even if I wanted
to lie about it, I can't. I can't lie.

110
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,990
What do you mean?
You have a moral objection?

111
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,754
No. I mean, I can't do it.
I suck at it.

112
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,629
Like the whole time you tried to pretend
like you didn't really like me?

113
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,189
-Yeah, I didn't buy that for a second.
-Yeah. Thanks.

114
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,555
It's a matter of time
before Kirsten catches on.

115
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,109
She's already pretty mad
at Seth and Sandy.

116
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,794
Well, we'll tell her.

117
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,236
Could we wait a little bit?

118
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,914
Kirsten and I had plans
to go to the swap meet...

119
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,992
...then maybe check out,
you know, Shakespeare by the Sea.

120
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,353
The point is, we're still
getting to know each other.

121
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,034
I know. I just don't want
to have to lie about us.

122
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,318
I don't want you to have to either.
Believe me.

123
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,719
I could still come over tonight
and say we're going to study.

124
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,029
-And really study.
-Okay, yeah. Sounds good.

125
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,999
We'll tell them soon. I promise.

126
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,035
Thank you.
That sounds wonderful.

127
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,635
No. We'll see you then.

128
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,631
All right, it was gonna be a surprise...

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,475
...but seeing how this is
our 20th anniversary, I gotta tell you.

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,434
This weekend, I am taking you,
my beautiful bride of 20 years...

131
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,273
...to the fabulous
Montage Hotel and Resort...

132
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,795
...in breathtaking Laguna Beach.

133
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,514
The Montage gave you a reservation
at the last minute?

134
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,076
Last minute? What, the phone call?
No. That was me reconfirming.

135
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,835
Making sure they didn't
give away our suite...

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,911
...that I booked
so many weeks in advance.

137
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,991
Whenever you made the reservation...

138
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,071
...we shouldn't leave Seth alone
right now.

139
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,073
Seth isn't gonna be a problem
after I'm done disciplining him.

140
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,034
Fear of God, honey. You'll see.

141
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,432
Start packing your bags.

142
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,079
Seth Ezekiel!

143
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,231
Kitchen! Now!

144
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,597
And bring Mr. History of Agriculture
with you.

145
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,396
So, what do you have
to say for yourself?

146
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,955
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,509
And also, it was an accident.
It was not intentional.

148
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,989
We were watching TV
and we fell asleep...

149
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,991
...Iike Mom does
when we put on a movie.

150
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,430
I do not.
I'm just resting my eyes.

151
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,070
You're both grounded. No going out.
No phones. No TV. No video games.

152
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,071
Don't be a smartass.

153
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,478
Do you know what this weekend is?

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,429
Sure, it's your 20th anniversary.

155
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,988
That's right, it is.

156
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,395
And I have been looking forward
to this weekend for quite a while.

157
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,196
Look, we want to go away
for the weekend.

158
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,035
And if we can't trust you, you'll have
to stay with your grandfather...

159
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,873
...which means spending the weekend
with Julie Cooper.

160
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,068
-No more lying.
-Trust us.

161
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,708
Good. Now, go do your homework.

162
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,957
Nothing like a little Julie Cooper...

163
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,873
...to strike terror in the hearts
of children everywhere.

164
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,109
Very impressive.

165
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,555
So shall I schedule a couple's massage?

166
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,794
Do you know what the gender
for maison is?

167
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,997
-What?
-Maison? Our French homework?

168
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,309
Right. French.

169
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,995
Half of Orange County speaks Spanish,
we're learning how to order baguettes.

170
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,839
-Okay, someone's in a mood.
-No, I'm not.

171
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,396
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
I was supposed to have sex first.

172
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,910
-What are you talking about?
-Cohen spent the night at his girlfriend's.

173
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,992
-They're obviously doing it.
-That's got nothing to do with you.

174
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,948
But I thought I'd have sex first
and he'd catch syphilis in a public toilet.

175
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,351
You can't rush it.
You have to wait till you're ready.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,638
You know what, Coop?
You are right.

177
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,677
You wanna know what I just realized?

178
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,149
That Zach and I are ready.
Man, are we ready.

179
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,557
-Maybe we should take a break.
-What's French for "let's have sex"?

180
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,795
Something or other.

181
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,633
I mean, why don't they ever teach us
anything we can use?

182
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,718
-So this is you grounded.
-I'm surprised they even let you in.

183
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,394
Well, I promised them
we were here to study.

184
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,359
-Which we're here to do.
-Right, right. Study. Got it.

185
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,919
Yep. Study.

186
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,476
So look, not that we were wrong
to punish them, but, you know...

187
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,234
...maybe we're handling this
in the wrong way.

188
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,831
Post-grounding guilt?

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,197
You're such a convincing hardass.
But deep down you're such a softy.

190
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,193
If all we do is send them to their rooms
to do homework...

191
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,715
-...what are they gonna learn?
-Their homework.

192
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,997
Well, if, as parents, we're supposed
to be setting a good example...

193
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,628
...how can we if they're not
in the same room with us?

194
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,952
-You want to cancel this weekend?
-We could log some parent-child time.

195
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,031
-Watching TV?
-Why not?

196
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,077
--with my guest, Mike Yagar, from....

197
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,357
It's Bill O' Reilly.
That'll be punishment enough.

198
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,748
I' m gonna get Seth.

199
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,036
--always complaining.
May I remind you....

200
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,749
All right. I know I sent you off
to start serving time....

201
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,998
You've gotta be kidding me.

202
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,793
I' m starting to get the hang
of this physics thing.

203
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,918
Objects in motion stay in motion.
Y eah.

204
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,798
Oh, my God.

205
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,111
We can't leave the boys alone.
We have to cancel.

206
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,679
We deserve this weekend.

207
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,319
After the lecture I gave Seth...

208
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,790
...he won't open another window again,
much less climb out of one.

209
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,952
Seth? I'm more preoccupied
with Ryan and my sister.

210
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,795
Well, I understand, but we cannot
fight a war on multiple fronts.

211
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,428
Have we learned nothing from the Nazis?

212
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,199
-Good morning.
-Morning.

213
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,351
-Who wants blueberry pancakes?
-Banana?

214
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,715
Or, if you're feeling sinful,
chocolate chip.

215
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,440
-Not gonna happen. Nice try.
-Too little, too late. No.

216
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,395
-I wanted to tell you about Lindsay.
-You were too busy studying. I saw.

217
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,788
Ouch. Tag out.

218
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,155
Okay, Dad, first of all,
I'm really sorry...

219
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,356
...and I know you're
not gonna believe this--

220
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,193
You were doing chin-ups
on the windowsill, right?

221
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,634
He's good. Tag in.

222
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,473
You trusted us. We lied to you.
There's no excuse.

223
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,872
Whatever punishment you decide on,
we're fine with.

224
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,429
You have no idea
how badly you screwed up.

225
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,434
No more apologies. No more pancakes.
You come straight home after school.

226
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,514
Yeah, but about the pancakes.
We still have a batch going.

227
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,872
-We can't leave them alone.
-So we get punished too?

228
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,679
Give me the day to deal with this.
Put bars on the window.

229
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,310
-I'll find out what's really going on.
-I found out enough last night.

230
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,711
Honey, we are gonna celebrate
our anniversary.

231
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,599
And the kids are not getting in the way.

232
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,954
-Marissa, honey, wait, please.
-I'm late for school.

233
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,509
Just wanted to remind you
about the photo shoot.

234
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,433
-Great. Still not coming.
-Marissa, honey....

235
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,431
Look, I know things haven't been
very easy around here...

236
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,114
...everything with Caleb,
and your father leaving.

237
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,113
But this is the only family we have.
I really want it to work.

238
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,555
And not just for the photo shoot.

239
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,154
Maybe we should take that trip
to Puerto Vallarta.

240
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,754
-You're bribing me?
-Does that mean you'll be there?

241
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,237
You know what, sure.
I'll even bring DJ.

242
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,233
Marissa, he's not even
our yard guy anymore.

243
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,119
-This is a portrait of our lives.
-DJ is a part of my life.

244
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,635
I'll see if he's free,
and we'll get back to you.

245
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,592
I am so sorry I ran away.

246
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,479
I should've stayed and apologized.

247
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,074
Be happy you took off.
Besides, it's my fault anyway.

248
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,515
I kind of knew we weren't gonna study.

249
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,399
Yeah, well, we both knew
we weren't going to study.

250
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,358
You, at least, had honorable intentions.

251
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,229
-Towards Kirsten, not me.
-Right.

252
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,630
Well, at least she knows, right?

253
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,598
Probably just needs a little time
to get used to it.

254
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,755
How much time are we talking about?

255
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,157
I'll talk to her.
I need to talk to her.

256
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,108
-I mean, after all, we're sisters.
-Yeah. That's kind of the problem.

257
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,953
Hey, look, the manager's not here now,
but he has all the permits, so....

258
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,599
I'm not the cops.

259
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,512
Much worse.

260
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,791
I'm Seth's dad.

261
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,279
That is worse.

262
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,956
I came to apologize for keeping Seth
from sneaking out to see you last night.

263
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,680
Terrible thing,
leaving you hanging like that.

264
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,311
You want me to stop seeing him,
don't you?

265
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,833
Yeah.

266
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,718
But seeing how he's a teenage boy...

267
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,599
...and you've got tattoos
and run a rock 'n' roll club...

268
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,479
-...I'm not expecting any miracles.
-What's this, a warning?

269
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,792
You're a little edgy around figures
of authority, aren't you?

270
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,190
Hey, there's no bar nuts.

271
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,634
What kind of joint is this?

272
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,518
I'll get right on it.

273
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,033
You're a bartender.

274
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,715
You listen to people's problems.
Hear mine.

275
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,712
This is my 20th anniversary.

276
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,633
Or it's supposed to be.
It's not going so well.

277
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,998
Now my wife is convinced
she can't leave Seth alone.

278
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,469
-You need me to babysit?
-Cute.

279
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,277
You think I'm corrupting him.

280
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,715
I think you're a smart girl.

281
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,472
And I think he'll listen to you...

282
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,437
...more than to his parents
right now.

283
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,913
No dad has ever asked me
to straighten out his son before.

284
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,832
I don't like going behind his back...

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,150
...but I sometimes
in order to be a good dad...

286
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,117
...you gotta be a bad guy.

287
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,393
Don't have much experience
with good dads.

288
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,710
Hey, listen.
You stop in at the house anytime.

289
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,111
Kirsten and I will be very happy
to ground you too.

290
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,994
Hi.

291
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,232
-Hello.
-Hey.

292
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,119
So I have been thinking.

293
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,191
Maybe we could do something tonight...

294
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,955
...just you and l, alone.

295
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,839
I've gotta pick up my sister
from the airport tonight.

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,958
-Why? Is she handicapped or something?
-No. She's just....

297
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,953
She's been out of the country.
I haven't seen her for a year.

298
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,394
Got it.

299
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,350
Well, anyways, we've been dating
for a few months now...

300
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,476
...and I really like you.

301
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,990
-Cool. I like you too.
-Cool.

302
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,311
Well, I was thinking maybe
we could take this to the next step.

303
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,273
You're totally right.
I've been thinking about it a while.

304
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,590
-I just didn't want to rush.
-Let's rush.

305
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,637
Okay, then. This weekend?

306
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,756
This weekend is perfect.

307
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,592
Good. I'll let my parents know.

308
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,671
You really keep
your parents informed, huh?

309
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,196
If they're going to be meeting my
girlfriend, they should probably know.

310
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,837
And this works perfectly
with Abigail being back in town.

311
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,230
So, like, lunch tomorrow?

312
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,758
Great. This is gonna be great.

313
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,912
That's nice.

314
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,034
Hello.

315
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,318
I'm here for my after-school tutorial
in the art of getting it on.

316
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,596
Is this the advanced class?

317
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,919
I don't feel good.

318
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,998
All right.

319
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,477
Well, maybe my magic hands
can be of service.

320
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,548
-What are we doing?
-I call this "prepping the oven. "

321
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,837
No, what are we doing
in the larger sense?

322
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,391
Did something happen?

323
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,792
Your parents are worried about you.

324
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,798
My parents? How would you
even know about...?

325
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,713
Did my dad come by the club?

326
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,713
Your dad stopped by the club.

327
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,954
That's embarrassing.

328
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,835
I've never listened to my own parents.
I feel compelled to listen to yours.

329
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,673
Sandy Cohen has that effect on people.

330
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,552
-So you're gonna need some space.
-I'm gonna need some space.

331
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,553
Yep. And probably a little time.

332
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,915
Definitely some time.

333
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,717
-I'm sorry.
-Cool.

334
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,553
But tell your parents happy anniversary.

335
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,355
The car's got a full tank of gas,
and tomorrow we can head right down.

336
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,159
-You can't be serious.
-The boys will be fine at Caleb's.

337
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,719
I talked to Seth's girlfriend.

338
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,950
She's a character,
but seems like a good kid.

339
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,997
Is that why Seth isn't home yet?

340
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,197
I'm not letting the boys stay with Julie,
but they can't be alone.

341
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,278
Honey, they're teenagers,
they like girls.

342
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,192
One of which happens to be my sister.

343
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,756
-So what? We're gonna forbid him?
-Not you. You wouldn't forbid anything.

344
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,832
You're too busy being their friend.
I have to enforce the rules.

345
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,719
I've never done more grounding
than in the last 24 hours.

346
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,599
-Who let Seth run away?
-We're talking about this now?

347
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,035
-Who told him he could stay?
-Good thing I did.

348
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,316
If you dragged him home,
we could've lost him.

349
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,277
He thinks he can do
whatever he wants...

350
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,670
...and you'll keep me
from coming down on him.

351
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,713
You think somebody can stop you
from coming down on somebody?

352
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,948
Right. And I should find it adorable
that you forgot our anniversary.

353
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,752
Could we please talk about this later?

354
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,514
We have all weekend.
I canceled the reservations.

355
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,830
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.

356
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,072
Let's do this thing.

357
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,028
So, what's going on with you, huh?

358
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,318
Where'd this Bizarro Seth come from?

359
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,311
Nice comic book reference.

360
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,518
Please. So....

361
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,400
You spent the night at this girl's house.

362
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,232
Are you--? Are you having sex?

363
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,237
Don't worry about that
ever happening...

364
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,119
...now that you showed up at the club
and worked your magic.

365
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,108
I'm sorry, but you left me no choice.

366
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,593
-What did we do? Are you angry at us?
-No.

367
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,759
Then it's about the girl?

368
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,717
You know, whenever I'm around her...

369
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,839
...I feel like I constantly have to prove
to her that I deserve to be around her.

370
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,310
Even if it's at the expense
of your parents' relationship?

371
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,957
Hey. Come on in here, join the party.

372
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,992
So the last time
I checked in with you...

373
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,674
...you and Lindsay were headed
into the friend zone.

374
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,319
We were.

375
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,513
-You lied to us.
-I know and I'm sorry.

376
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,872
You know what? I'm afraid it's a little
late for apologies from any of us.

377
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,109
My wedding anniversary weekend
is officially ruined.

378
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,037
How can we help?

379
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,715
-Hey.
-Hey.

380
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,668
I called your house,
and Sandy said you might be here.

381
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,068
-I had some work to finish.
-Right. Right.

382
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,717
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,668
Ryan and I started seeing each other
before I found out about everything...

384
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,152
...and then it all happened so fast,
and it was a lot.

385
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,352
I never wanted to upset you.

386
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,192
I know.

387
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,839
And I probably overreacted.

388
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,673
No, it was embarrassing.

389
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,192
Lindsay...

390
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,438
...maybe you and I need
to take some time.

391
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,555
Accepting Ryan into my home as my son
was a huge deal for me...

392
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,069
...and taking you in as my sister,
which I am thrilled about...

393
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,754
...it's just complicated.

394
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,037
So you don't want me seeing Ryan?

395
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,474
I would never say that.

396
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,154
While you're seeing him,
we should take a step back.

397
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,117
A step back?

398
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,673
So does that mean
we're, like, cousins now?

399
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,751
Maybe we should be friends.

400
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,673
Friends.

401
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,719
Great.

402
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,913
Bye.

403
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,070
I'm not nervous,
so you're not nervous, right?

404
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,117
I'm so not nervous. Dads love me.

405
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,599
Oh, my dad couldn't make it.

406
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,911
He got held up in D.C.
on some assault weapons ban.

407
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,109
Hey, Mom. Abbie.

408
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,872
-How are you?
-Good.

409
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,268
This is Summer.

410
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,795
Pleasure to meet you.
Zach's told us about you.

411
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,110
-All lies, I'm sure.
-Hi.

412
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,918
-All I was trying to say, Mother--
-Abbie, this isn't the time.

413
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,277
-Summer wouldn't be interested.
-No. Summer's interested.

414
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,829
Please, whatever you were
chatting about, continue.

415
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,276
I was saying what's happening
in Kashmir shows us how countries can--

416
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,113
I know!
Pashminas this season were so cute.

417
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,515
I don't go anywhere
without my cashmere purse.

418
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,033
Summer, they're....

419
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,159
No, "Kashmir," as in the disputed region
between lndia and Pakistan.

420
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,035
They've fought three wars over it.

421
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,916
Yes. Yes, totally. Kashmir.
Yeah, I agree.

422
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,117
-Agree with what?
-What?

423
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,475
What she means, dear,
is what do you agree with?

424
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,393
Do you think the lndians cede Kashmir
to the Pakistanis...

425
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,279
...or should it remain
an independent state?

426
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,429
Yeah, tough call.

427
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,319
Two sides to every story.

428
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,590
You know, you are just so tan.

429
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,273
Zach tells me you studied abroad.

430
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,238
In St. Bart's, perhaps?
The Four Seasons there is amazing.

431
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,632
I was building an irrigation system
in a village in southern lndia.

432
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,393
Maybe we should order.

433
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,754
Lovely.

434
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,189
This is your concept of time and space?

435
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,828
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm here on official business.

436
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,956
And what business would that be?

437
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,953
-I would like my job back.
-No.

438
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,597
Listen, the folks,
they're a little bit mad at me.

439
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,149
Needless to say,
my allowance has been impacted.

440
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,833
I don't want to tighten my belt.

441
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,912
Don't wanna give up the vacation homes,
the Porsche, the grotto.

442
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,674
You're really tugging
at my heartstrings here.

443
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,390
-I get why you're upset.
-No, I think you don't.

444
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,075
-My dad broke up with you for me?
-Okay, now I know you don't.

445
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,309
-You don't realize how lucky you are.
-That my dad showed up, humiliated me?

446
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,472
That he showed up, that he cares,
that there's something wrong...

447
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,076
...and his first reaction isn't just
to throw you out of the house.

448
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,149
It still pays minimum wage.

449
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,510
You know where the bathrooms are.

450
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,556
Are there any other perks?

451
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,630
What's the point, Seth?

452
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,760
It's not like they're ever gonna
approve of me.

453
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,677
Well, maybe there's a way
we can show them you're not so bad.

454
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,073
Smile.

455
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,398
What is taking so long?
He's not painting our portrait.

456
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,158
My face will freeze in this position
unless you push the button.

457
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,198
Cal, this photograph will be seen
by everyone in Newport Beach.

458
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,477
-You don't want frown lines.
-Okay, if you can all smile.

459
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,868
I am smiling, damn it.

460
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,158
Wait a second.

461
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,439
-Hey.
-I'm sorry I'm late.

462
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,669
Oh, my God.

463
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,389
He's come to mow the lawn?
Can't he reschedule?

464
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,278
-I'll handle this.
-Handle what?

465
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,318
Tell him to come back tomorrow.
And check for poison oak!

466
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,233
-What is he doing here?
-You said she was cool with this.

467
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,549
You must be joking.

468
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,315
Either DJ's in the photo, or I'm out.
It's up to you.

469
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,875
I'll save you the hard choice.
I'm leaving.

470
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,679
-Works for me.
-Thanks a lot.

471
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,478
You can forget your photo shoot.
DJ, wait!

472
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,677
No, I'll go. If having him here
means we get our picture taken...

473
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,308
-...I'll bring him back.
-Like he'll listen to you.

474
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,550
Considering I'm not the one
who lied to him...

475
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,234
...I think I have a better shot than you.

476
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,359
DJ, wait up.

477
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,518
What, you need
some hedges trimmed?

478
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,711
Don't be so self-deprecating.

479
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,269
Thank you for not causing
more of a scene back there.

480
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,716
Save the act, Mrs. Cooper.
I know you hate me being with Marissa.

481
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,236
It's Mrs. Cooper-Nichol,
and you're damn right I do.

482
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,188
The "Nichol" allows me to write you a
check with a few zeroes on the end of it.

483
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,588
What are you talking about?

484
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,955
Five grand never to see
my daughter again.

485
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,672
How do you spell your last name?
Never mind. You can fill that part out.

486
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,671
You're unbelievable.

487
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,196
I'm doing you a favor, honey.

488
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,199
You and I both know Marissa's using you
to get back at me.

489
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,998
What do you think today
was about?

490
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,789
Only seems fair you should get
something out of this relationship too.

491
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,715
-Hey.
-Hey.

492
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,552
What's going on?

493
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,031
-Okay, you tell me your news.
-Y eah?

494
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,394
Because then I have some.

495
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,391
-Yeah? You wanna go first?
-No.

496
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,394
You picked this very important meeting
at the pier, so you get the honors.

497
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,357
All right.

498
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,359
It's just...

499
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,432
...us.

500
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,559
This.

501
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,238
It's causing problems
for Kirsten and Sandy, and....

502
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,350
And I just can't do that to them.
I owe them too much, you know.

503
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,076
I just think we should
just take some time...

504
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,555
...space, for a while.

505
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,551
Be friends.

506
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,472
Great.

507
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,955
Two hours ago, I had a sister
and a boyfriend...

508
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,429
...and now all I have are friends.

509
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,068
Wait. What?

510
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,674
Before I came here, I talked to Kirsten,
and she asked me without asking me...

511
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,992
...to choose between a sister
and a boyfriend.

512
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,635
And, genius that I am...

513
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,153
...I chose you.

514
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,070
Had I known that you had
this whole time-space plan...

515
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,878
...I might've chosen differently.

516
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,793
-I didn't know. I'm sorry.
-Yeah, you're sorry.

517
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,193
Cool, because that really fixes
absolutely nothing.

518
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,032
I gotta go.

519
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,755
There she is.

520
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,117
All day, I've been looking
for this beautiful woman.

521
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,158
-Happy anniversary.
-Happy anniversary.

522
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,437
-Come on. Let's go. Let's get ready.
-Get ready for what?

523
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,433
It's our 20th anniversary,
and I'm taking you to The Arches.

524
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,716
-You got to be kidding.
-I know you're worried.

525
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,677
Never fear.
I've hired some babysitters.

526
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,714
Fellas! Joe! Tim!

527
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,229
Two of Orange's finest.

528
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,197
Friends since I worked
the PD's office.

529
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,920
Evening, Mrs. Cohen.
Your boys will be safe with us.

530
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,310
Happy anniversary.

531
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,118
The rib-eye is excellent.

532
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,952
-How's your turbot?
-Fine.

533
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,714
Just fine? Too fishy?

534
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,748
-Send it back if you want. Send it back.
-Sandy.

535
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,438
All right. I'm sorry. All I wanted
was to give you a special evening.

536
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,115
And some turbot that wasn't too fishy.

537
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,793
I know.

538
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,797
I'm sorry I brought up Portland
last night.

539
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,154
That wasn't your fault.

540
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,393
It's just Seth is growing up
so fast...

541
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,630
...and I don't want to lose him.

542
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,512
Let's stop apologizing, okay.
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

543
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,439
Look on the bright side.

544
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,398
We got all this out of our system
before Valentine's Day.

545
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,358
-Oh, no.
-Oh, God.

546
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,671
Don't know how they did it, Sandy.

547
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,070
We went outside for a second,
they were gone.

548
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,229
Check.

549
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,592
The farmer's union has not yet
responded to Chirac 's remarks...

550
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,877
...but a spokesperson said he expects
a statement later this week.

551
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,112
I cannot believe what Chirac
said to the farmer's union.

552
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,077
You go, Jacques.

553
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,309
" The Economist"? " The Nation"?
" The New Republic"?

554
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,358
-Okay, what are you doing?
-l' m informing myself, Coop.

555
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,159
It's impossible.
There is so much news.

556
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,834
You know, the worst part is,
it is constantly changing.

557
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,754
If everything could just stop for, like,
one day, maybe I could catch up.

558
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,878
Just call him back. He's left you
four messages since lunch.

559
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,679
If Zach wants to dump me,
he can do it in person.

560
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,876
At least Zach's calling you.

561
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,793
I haven't heard from DJ
since the photo-shoot incident.

562
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,669
-Since your mother spoke to him?
-Exactly, and who knows what she said.

563
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,559
I left him a message to meet us.
I'm really getting worried.

564
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,678
Well, I'm past the point of worrying.
I'm resigned to my fate.

565
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,114
It can't have been that bad.

566
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,635
Remember how lunch went with
my dad and Cohen?

567
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,712
Compared to my performance today,
Cohen was like Kofi Annan.

568
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,110
-Who's Kofi Annan?
-Some guy Zach's mom knows.

569
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,635
I think he works for United Airlines.

570
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,031
Can't believe you talked me
into leaving.

571
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,760
Excuse me for wanting to celebrate
my 20th anniversary.

572
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,798
-How do you know where they are?
-A hunch. Let's pick it up.

573
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,912
You got it, Sandy.

574
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,958
Thanks, Tim.

575
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,237
Everything they said to us, feeling sorry,
wanting to reform, all lies.

576
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,753
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

577
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,639
So now you admit
that you were Mr. Nice Guy.

578
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,280
Don't make this about me.
We show a united front.

579
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,714
We show no mercy.

580
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,917
If he wants bad, I can be bad.

581
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,832
But first....

582
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,029
Surprise!

583
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,277
-You planned all this?
-Well, I prefer the term "orchestrated. "

584
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,355
So we're here tonight to celebrate the
marriage of Sandy and Kirsten Cohen.

585
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,274
And we all owe them
so much, I think...

586
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,318
...because if they never married,
they wouldn't have had me...

587
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,755
...and think of what you
would be missing out on.

588
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,114
-Now--
-That's touching.

589
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,479
So we'd like to take a moment
and say thanks for everything.

590
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,155
And apologize for everything,
because here's the thing:

591
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,596
The fact that your marriage
can survive the two of us...

592
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,034
...is truly inspiring.

593
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,031
It gets me here.

594
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,351
-T o Sandy and Kirsten.
-Hear! Hear!

595
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,194
So now for the evening's
main attraction.

596
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,557
I don't know how many of you people
know this, but back in the day...

597
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,871
...Sandy Cohen could cut
a pretty sweet tune.

598
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,429
In fact, he actually was
Danny Zuko...

599
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,636
...in the UC Berkeley production
of Grease.

600
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,711
You're not going up there.

601
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,594
Baby, I'm gone.

602
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,150
So now, appearing live at the Bait Shop,
one night only....

603
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,629
Sandy Cohen and the News.

604
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,675
Well, first all, before we start,
I want to thank my kids, Seth and Ryan.

605
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,475
And a new friend of the family, without
whom none of this would be possible...

606
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,756
...I want to thank Alex.

607
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,157
Well, I guess we ought to start, fellas.

608
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,273
I'd like to dedicate this song
to the love of my life...

609
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,830
...and I hope maybe in another 20 years
she might forgive me for this.

610
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,149
There you are.

611
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,359
I'm reading about these attacks
on the Hungarian minority in Serbia.

612
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,038
I think I know what's going on here.

613
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,710
What? That you are
breaking up with me...

614
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,189
...because you and your family
think I'm an idiot.

615
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,391
Summer, there's lots of ways
to be smart.

616
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,311
It's not just about knowing
Kuala Lumpur's the capital of lndonesia.

617
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,950
And I like you because you're different
from my family.

618
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,795
Then you must like me a whole lot.

619
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,074
Yeah. I do.

620
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,111
Just so you know,
Jakarta's the capitol of lndonesia.

621
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,470
Marissa, look, I know why you're down,
but the truth is, you are better off.

622
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,710
What are you talking about?
You don't know.

623
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,759
I know that I offered him $5000,
as a test, to stay away...

624
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,394
...and he took it.

625
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,472
I just think you should know
what he's really like, honey.

626
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,636
-I'm really sorry that I freaked out.
-We should have told you.

627
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,869
It's a difficult situation.
I barely understand it myself.

628
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,430
Look, she's great, and I like her...

629
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,831
...but more than anything,
you two should be friends.

630
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,070
We will.

631
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,278
But right now I think
you two should go and dance.

632
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,556
I wasn't gonna come,
but Seth called me and....

633
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,551
I'm glad you did.

634
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,598
I'm sorry about before.
I'm over the time-space plan.

635
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,877
That's a bad, bad plan.

636
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,474
What about...?

637
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,272
She....

638
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,799
She wanted me to ask you...

639
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,268
...if you wanted to dance with me.

640
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,514
-He sounds good.
-You know you've created a monster.

641
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,036
Yeah, I do. So there's somebody
I want you to meet.

642
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,153
-Hi. I'm Kirsten.
-Alex.

643
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,755
-Thank you so much for the party.
-No problem.

644
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,718
-This is the least I could do.
-That's true.

645
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,434
-Lovely tattoo.
-Thank you.

646
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,515
Your husband rocks, by the way.
I mean, wow.

647
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,194
Yeah, please don't tell him that.

648
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,991
-Hey.
-Hey.

649
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,189
Where have you been?

650
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,157
-I've been calling you all day.
-I know.

651
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,589
I've been thinking...

652
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,753
...and I can't do this anymore.
I'm sorry.

653
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,918
So you took the money.

654
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,229
No.

655
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,193
But that doesn't change anything.

656
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,079
I know you're upset,
but, please, don't let my mom be the--

657
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,073
This isn't about your mom.
You can't blame her for everything.

658
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,310
But it's her fault.
If she wasn't against us--

659
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,836
Then you probably wouldn't have
dated me in the first place.

660
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,911
I'm not saying you didn't like me,
just not as much as you hate her.

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,189
-I'm sorry.
-Why?

662
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,597
We had fun.

663
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,036
She left it blank.

664
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,912
So why don't you go
on a shopping spree on her?

665
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,198
-You take care, okay?
-Yeah, you too.
