1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,679
Nice job on the grill, Seth.
Those swordfish look perfect.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,509
Wow, the student becomes the master.
There's a new king of the BBQ.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,119
I cede you my oven mitts.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,312
I thought I was destined to live
in your shadow. See, buddy?

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,637
- No need to become a fisherman.
- Yeah. That was a bad idea.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,519
- We all have our moments.
- You mean like lying to Summer...

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,478
...and breaking up with her?
- I think that was a great idea.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,710
What was your other option?
Telling the truth?

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,154
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,231
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,519
I don't know if you saw,
but your graduation tickets came.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,272
Aisle seats, nice.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,596
You'd think after sending two kids
to Harbor...

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,398
...they could cough up more tickets.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,073
He's just worried about the Nana.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,198
- She's an excellent clapper.
- She can do the two-finger whistle.

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,396
And she's never taken a picture
out of focus.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,233
- She was born for graduations.
- Let her take my tickets.

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,595
You know, I mean, Seth's got you guys
covered. Hate to see mine go to waste.

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,473
Why don't you invite family?

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,398
Your mom would love it.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,359
I'm gonna go wash up.

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,351
Sink's right here. Oh.

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,028
I don't think it's a good idea.
I tried this already.

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,589
She signed up for AA,
she's starting her life again.

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,952
After writing bad checks
and getting arrested and disappearing.

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,317
- She doesn't have the greatest record.
- Think I'm gonna wash up too.

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,113
- It's important to him.
- I don't wanna see him get hurt again.

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,555
- It's his decision.
- Well, he's still a kid.

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,951
Right. Because when we get older,
we make much better decisions.

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,994
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to upset...

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,072
It's fine. It's something
I've been thinking about.

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,278
Haven't seen her in so long...

34
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,989
...if I don't invite her to graduation,
will I ever see her again?

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,754
I know the last time she was here
it was difficult.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,993
- When Sandy saw her, how was she?
- Honestly, not good.

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,512
But she's trying.

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,836
Maybe seeing you again will be
just the thing.

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,393
For both of you.

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,711
- What if she's worse?
- There's only one way to find out.

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,229
And if you want me to fly
to Albuquerque with you...

42
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,630
If I do this, I need to do it alone.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,952
But you're right.
You're right, she's my mom.

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,113
I owe her a chance.

45
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,632
How bad can it be, right?

46
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,714
Right.

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,079
What are you doing in here?

48
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,875
I just got back from my little trip
down Mexico way.

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,237
I bribed your maid with local speak.

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,152
Really? Mima's from the Philippines.

51
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,438
Must have said something right.

52
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,556
- Hope you weren't Ionely without me.
- I survived.

53
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,510
Okay. We can't do this. Okay?

54
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,353
What're you talking about? I go away
and you get over me?

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,910
- No, it's not that, it's just...
- Her mother might find out.

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,551
I told Neil this house had rats.

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,509
How you doing?
It's nice to meet you.

58
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,233
Keep that grimy paw away from me.

59
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,756
Unless you wanna see what 10 years
of Cardio Barre can do to your face.

60
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,116
I was just leaving anyways.
Yeah, I think your daughter's over me.

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,713
I guess I was just a phase.

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,431
- Spare me the lecture.
- No lecture. I get it. He's cool.

63
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,999
He's got great abs...

64
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,515
...and personifies everything
that's bad for you.

65
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,631
So you wanna sleep with him instead?

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,915
Choices you make
are going to affect your future.

67
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,674
He's not that bad.
Look, you were wrong about Ryan...

68
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,673
...maybe you're wrong now.
- We're not gonna test that theory.

69
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,671
Because I'm not gonna allow it.

70
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,079
I went completely overboard...

71
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,879
...and made you a gigantic sandwich
for the flight.

72
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,439
Thanks. Looking forward to it.

73
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,272
I booked you a car to go anywhere.

74
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,034
- I can take a cab.
- Just humor me. I worry enough.

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,990
All right.
Actually, I'm a little worried too.

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,998
- I didn't get a lot of sleep.
- Do you have a game plan?

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,799
Yeah. I guess.

78
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,590
She mentioned some diner
she's working at.

79
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,478
I figure I show up...

80
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,235
...and say hi,
and wait for the fireworks.

81
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,954
Whatever happens, you have
at least one proud mother...

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,873
...watching you when you graduate.
- Yeah, thanks.

83
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,875
Hey, Sum.
If it makes you feel any better...

84
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,429
...I saw Seth and he looks
as miserable as you do.

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,149
The thing that would make me better
would be seeing that assless wuss...

86
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,993
...skinned, flayed, and served
as assless wuss tartar.

87
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,633
- That's very descriptive, Summer.
- Look, "T-to-the-T"...

88
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,836
...I know you're up on life,
down with God...

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,117
...and you have a very positive,
optimistic view on the world.

90
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,471
- But I ain't having it.
- I'm not trying to offer you anything...

91
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,471
...other than my friendship.

92
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,155
But, you know, if you wanna be alone
that's okay with me.

93
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,238
How could he lead me on and agree...

94
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,470
...that we should plan
our futures together...

95
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,200
...and then decide,
"You know what? Maybe we shouldn't.

96
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,672
We're not destined for each other."
I should just go ship off to Rhode Island?

97
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,956
I'm going to be deserted on an island.

98
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,829
Technically, Rhode Island is only
bordered on three sides by water, so...

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,195
- It was an awful thing to do.
- And to think...

100
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,669
...just two years ago
he stood up on that cart...

101
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,150
...and declared his love for me.
- Oh, that was so sweet.

102
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,071
You didn't see me, but I was there.

103
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,629
And I remember,
that geek was in love with you.

104
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,798
And I have only gotten hotter since then.
Something is up.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,151
A guy like Cohen is incapable
of walking away from a girl like me.

106
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,630
Unless he is hiding something.
And no one hides anything from me.

107
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,956
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

108
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,475
Thank you so much for our pep talk.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,912
- Another Starr and Ginger.
- Why don't you get it in a to-go cup.

110
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,310
What's the matter?
You're not happy to see me?

111
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,556
You don't know when to quit, do you?

112
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,159
What's this?

113
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,118
A projection of what my future earnings
would've been.

114
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,675
Plus pain and suffering.
Which were considerable.

115
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,030
- You want me to pay you?
- Actually, Griffin.

116
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,277
He's the one I've got evidence on.

117
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,553
Otherwise I think the DA would be very
interested in the documents I've got.

118
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,549
You're talking blackmail,
it's not even noon yet.

119
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,872
Tell your boy Griffin to pay up in cash
tomorrow. Or I start spreading the news.

120
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,999
Put it on his tab.

121
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,236
You're getting yourself in
pretty deep here.

122
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,992
No deeper than you.

123
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,273
Yeah?

124
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,634
- Did you forget your watch again?
- No, I came to see you.

125
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,230
Look, I get it.
Your mom doesn't like me.

126
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,472
I'm a bad influence, blah, blah.
See you around.

127
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,911
Actually, I was thinking
maybe you'd wanna hang out.

128
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,597
- And what about school?
- It's second semester, senior year.

129
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,118
Unless you don't want to.

130
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,710
Well, if you're gonna stay, then stay.

131
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,874
Wherever you want. Place is all yours.

132
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,671
I'm looking for someone.
Dawn Atwood?

133
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,950
Her shift doesn't start
for a couple hours.

134
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,714
- Who should I say is looking for her?
- A friend.

135
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,633
- I'm staying at La Crescenta.
- Nice hotel.

136
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,189
Dawn doesn't have friends
that stay at nice hotels.

137
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,472
I got a good rate.

138
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,077
She does, however, have a son.
Lives with some pretty wealthy people.

139
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,437
Supposed to be cute.

140
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,759
- Ryan.
- Chloe.

141
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,514
Your mom is gonna lose it
when she finds out you're here.

142
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,193
I hope not.

143
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,590
Couple hours, you said?
Great. I'll be back.

144
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,159
I'll be here.

145
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,394
Okay.

146
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,357
All right.
Let's review factoring a polynomial.

147
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,839
This is good stuff, you guys.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,560
All right, what we have
is an expression...

149
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,635
...in which constants and variables
are combined using only addition...

150
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,190
...subtraction and multiplication.

151
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,236
Seth, you are so funny. I'm sorry,
that was just such a knee-slapper.

152
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,032
Is there a problem, Miss Roberts?

153
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,358
No, no. Well, not unless you're insulted
by Seth's impersonation of you...

154
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,235
...behind your back involving penguin
walking, buckteeth, and cross-eyes.

155
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,032
You do an impression of me?

156
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,630
No, no, I don't do any impressions.

157
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,758
I don't use props.
I don't like jokes in general.

158
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,559
Why don't you work on some
one-liners in Dr. Kim's office.

159
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,951
And why don't you join him since
you're such a receptive audience.

160
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,549
Should be a hilarious
weekend detention.

161
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,517
What is your deal, woman?
I've never been thrown out of a class.

162
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,477
Sorry to tarnish your perfect record...

163
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,710
...but how else
was I going to talk to you?

164
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,314
The breakup is off.
I broke up with you...

165
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,789
...and it's in my power
to un-break us up.

166
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,951
- You can do that?
- Technically, I just did.

167
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,714
Unless you can explain
what your deal is...

168
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,678
...and why you don't want
to be together, we're back on.

169
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,512
Technically, officially, completely.

170
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,398
- Okay, now...
- Wait. Here we are.

171
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,120
Dr. Kim's office. You know what?
I'll go first.

172
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,831
You just plead temporary insanity.
It's good to have you back, babe.

173
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,871
Are you not coming in?

174
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,357
- Don't think so.
- Wanna go somewhere...

175
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,278
...and talk or something?

176
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,439
Sounds good.

177
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,551
Hold that position.

178
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,153
It's probably my supply drop.

179
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,355
- I'm having some people over tomorrow.
- Marissa!

180
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,551
- Oh, my God, it's my mom.
- I'll handle it.

181
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,478
Good, because I'm gonna hide.

182
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,234
Where is my daughter?
Is she in here?

183
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,232
Hey, I thought you were my dealer.
Kind of disappointed.

184
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,675
Don't get smart.
You don't have the equipment.

185
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,671
Her school called.
She didn't show up.

186
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,594
- She already got into college.
- Listen up, Tommy Lee.

187
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,752
You're the latest in a series
of experiments my daughter makes...

188
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,512
...when acting out. So enjoy it.

189
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,513
Because right here, right now,
is as good as it gets for you.

190
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,639
Soon Marissa's gonna wake up and
realize she is so much better than you.

191
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,597
You think she's gonna come
back to you?

192
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,868
Marissa knows that I will be there
for her...

193
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,914
...whenever she decides to come home,
because I am her family.

194
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,476
Not some punk with a smirk, three
brain cells and a good coke connection.

195
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,198
You tell her that.

196
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,839
That's my mom.

197
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,271
I'm gonna get some beer.

198
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,113
- Best not to tell my mom about the beer.
- Also won't tell the guys you're not 21.

199
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,589
Good idea. Cheers.

200
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,999
- You traveled pretty far to avoid her.
- Yeah, well, I'm working up to it.

201
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,233
My mom and I haven't had
the easiest relationship.

202
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,709
Knowing Dawn a little, I figured.

203
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,349
But if it makes you feel better,
she's doing well.

204
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,199
Yeah, I saw that. She seemed happy.

205
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,555
There was a guy that made me
nervous, but...

206
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,751
Oh, that's just Ron.
Her new boyfriend.

207
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,590
- That's what I was afraid of.
- He looks hardcore.

208
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,719
And, yeah, he does own a rather
large snake. But he's got a good heart.

209
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,918
Yeah. They all do at first.

210
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,717
I love this song. Do you wanna?

211
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,999
Come on.

212
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,675
I don't really dance so much. I...

213
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,314
- This is not what I expected.
- Yeah? Well, maybe it's what you need.

214
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,758
Boy, you've got a way with people.

215
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,115
Urban Planning Committee
has signed off.

216
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,515
What can I say? I'm very charming.

217
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,193
Close the door.

218
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,876
Your message was cryptic.
Do we have a problem?

219
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,396
Matt's not giving up. Since you had
nothing to do with the ass-kicking...

220
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,994
...that shouldn't get your blood up.
- What's he want?

221
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,674
Money. In exchange
for the incriminating files...

222
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,633
...which you claim couldn't be
incriminating. You know what?

223
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,518
I'm gonna let the cops deal with it.

224
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,275
And destroy all your hopes and dreams?
Watch all of this disappear?

225
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,790
We have done such good work so far.
I'll deal with Ramsey.

226
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,030
Explain to him the importance
of the hospital.

227
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,794
No. I'm making Matt my problem.

228
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,031
Well, then, good luck.

229
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,238
For both of you.

230
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,993
- Not gonna say anything to your mom.
- Yeah, good plan.

231
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,275
Oh, so that's why you came
looking for her.

232
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,908
- Invite her to graduation?
- Yeah, something like that.

233
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,953
Oh, your mom and Ron should blend
right in at your school.

234
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,476
You've gotta send me a photo.

235
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,232
Thanks for the company.

236
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,958
- Hello?
- Hey, man.

237
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,628
- How's Albuquerque?
- I just hooked up with a waitress.

238
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,073
That would never happen to me,
you stallion.

239
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,474
Doesn't know I'm here.

240
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,790
I'm thinking about taking
an early flight back.

241
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,714
You can't just fly to New Mexico
and not say hi.

242
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,196
You wanna meet her trucker
boyfriend and his python at graduation?

243
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,079
So don't invite anyone.
Just do a quick pop in, say hello.

244
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,754
<i>- What can happen?</i>
- Not a question I want answered.

245
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,832
Just be a man.
Someone around here ought to.

246
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,312
You still lying to everyone?

247
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,396
I'm trying to speak as little as possible.

248
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,155
Less I say, the fewer lies I have to track,
but Summer wants answers.

249
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,477
<i>If I tell her the truth, she'll throw away</i>
<i>her future over me.</i>

250
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,518
Yeah, well, sounds like we both have
women to face.

251
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,756
Each who suffers blackouts
of their own kind.

252
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,957
- Well, good luck.
- You too.

253
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,158
My baby.

254
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,240
Oh, hi.

255
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,717
Hi.

256
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,509
What are we doing tonight? Since we're
dating again we should go on a date.

257
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,475
Except since you un-broke up with me,
you sort of put the ball back in my court.

258
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,037
And now I break up with you.

259
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,354
Which means only I have the power
to un-break us up.

260
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,910
- You're breaking up with me?
- Yes. I'm sorry, I really am...

261
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,310
...but I feel it's for the best.
- What? l...

262
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,596
I un-broke up with you
so I could find out...

263
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,273
...why you broke up with me.

264
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,759
I guess you'll never know.

265
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,316
- You look so good, sweetie.
- So do you, Mom.

266
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,030
When Chloe told me,
I couldn't believe it.

267
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,031
- She told you?
- And my answer's yes.

268
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,277
A hundred percent. I wouldn't miss
your graduation for anything.

269
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,798
She told you about
the graduation too?

270
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,473
She just called.

271
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,357
Let's go, Dawn. Food's getting cold.

272
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,715
Yeah. I hear you, Nick.

273
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,472
Hey, Nick. That's my baby.

274
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,675
This is my meatloaf. Get it out there.

275
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,479
You know what? You're busy.
Let's talk tomorrow.

276
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,756
- All right? Okay.
- You bet.

277
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,949
- It's so good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

278
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,591
Thanks for asking me, Ry.

279
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,834
Light it up, light it up.

280
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,998
You still sleeping?

281
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,752
- Party's starting early.
- You need to call your mom?

282
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,277
So the princess fell off her throne
and landed on Volchok's mattress.

283
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,072
Heather. It's good to see you too.

284
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,310
Who said it was good to see you?

285
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,358
You know, the dress you wore to PJ's
going-away party was pretty cute.

286
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,596
Kind of plain, don't you think?

287
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,513
You should see how the women dress
in Newport.

288
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,477
Like in the magazines.

289
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,676
You should treat yourself.

290
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,716
Chloe, you got a customer.
Dawn, your boy's here.

291
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,073
- Morning, hon.
- Morning.

292
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,276
I'll get some coffee.

293
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,034
Chloe's been trying
to talk me into a new dress.

294
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,237
- You don't have to buy anything.
- No, I want it to be perfect.

295
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,351
And I was thinking,
after the ceremony...

296
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,476
...I'd like to take everyone to dinner.

297
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,269
I mean, nothing fancy
if I'm footing the bill, but...

298
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,070
Hang on.

299
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,478
Hey, baby. Staying out of trouble?

300
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,275
I was sorry you had to go
on the road last night.

301
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,034
I really want Ryan to meet you.

302
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,994
Yeah. No, I checked on the flights
to Orange County and...

303
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,628
Hang on a sec.
It's okay if I bring a friend, right?

304
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,197
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.
- Let me get my calendar.

305
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,998
- She on cloud nine or what?
- She's very excited.

306
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,192
Sorry I ruined your surprise.

307
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,557
I mentioned I ran into you
and it just kind of slipped out.

308
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,557
You were gonna invite her, right?

309
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,553
- Yeah, totally.
- Okay.

310
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,716
No way. No scheming,
no plan B's, no wacky high jinks.

311
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,077
Cohen broke up with me. Only he
has the power to un-break us up.

312
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,629
There's no way I'm gonna go
groveling back to him...

313
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,712
...like some pathetic,
brokenhearted little bitch.

314
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,075
- Do you still love him?
- Yeah.

315
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,516
- There's something wrong with me.
- Did he say that he doesn't love you?

316
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,228
Now that you mention it, no.
He did not.

317
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,036
You see? He's acting out of fear.
He's trapped in an anxiety spiral.

318
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,954
And in the rock-paper-scissors
of romance, love trumps fear.

319
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,917
Actually, loves trumps everything.

320
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,712
So let's just say for conversation's sake
I was open to a little scheming.

321
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,519
Well, I have an idea.

322
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,472
You didn't get into Brown too,
did you?

323
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,229
- Hey, Taylor. What's up?
- I wanted to let you know...

324
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,789
...that detention today
is in the student lounge.

325
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,356
And you're telling me this because...?

326
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,313
Because it's my job
as a Harbor Student Proctor.

327
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,431
<i>I'm supervising detention this week.</i>

328
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,795
How is that better than
having actual detention?

329
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,110
Seth, student lounge.

330
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,794
And don't be late or I will have to
give you a tardy.

331
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,431
Hey, honey.

332
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,511
You left early without saying goodbye.

333
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,359
- I didn't want to wake you.
- Last night, when you came in?

334
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,076
It was late.

335
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,839
I need you home tonight, Sandy.
We have to talk.

336
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,999
<i>I just feel like</i>
<i>we're so disconnected right now.</i>

337
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,114
<i>You're right.</i>

338
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,996
Well, I think I can be home by 7.

339
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,672
Thanks. I'll see you then.

340
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,839
I'll see you.

341
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,471
You buying again?

342
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,756
You should stop celebrating
and start packing.

343
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,549
I spoke to Griffin.
He's not interested in your deal.

344
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,393
- That's not what he said.
- You called him?

345
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,353
He called me, actually.
Said that you two talked.

346
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,835
He understands what he has to do,
and he's willing.

347
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,031
He's willing to
go round two on your skull.

348
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,390
He's meeting me tonight
with the money.

349
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,314
If I give him what he wants, this time
next week I'll be on a beach in Cabo...

350
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,476
...getting some well-earned R and R.

351
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,551
I'm gonna start
my own business in Chicago.

352
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,676
He can't be trusted, Matt.

353
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,354
If anybody should know that,
you should.

354
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,469
- I hold all the cards here.
- You willing to bet on that?

355
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,954
Yeah. Take it off.

356
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,159
Yeah, Heather, come on, baby.

357
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,709
Hey. She's having fun.

358
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,552
More than you.

359
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,711
Yeah, well, I'm not wasted.

360
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,554
- That's not bad.
- Yeah.

361
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,278
Yeah, Heather, you need another beer.

362
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,749
Hey, let me get you a refill, baby.

363
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,911
Hey, Heather. Drink it, baby.

364
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,314
Drink it up.

365
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,317
There you go, come on.
Little bit more.

366
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,198
Oh, yeah, I like that.

367
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,999
Hey.

368
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,599
Got ten bucks?

369
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,395
- What are you doing?
- I know you're afraid, Cohen.

370
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,628
Yeah, that you're gonna fall.
Don't go up there.

371
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,154
Your breakup...

372
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,353
...was missing a key ingredient.
The only ingredient, really.

373
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,360
- Which is?
- That you don't love me anymore.

374
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,350
- Summer...
- Look, I love you this much.

375
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,036
And I wanna be with you now and next
year and whatever comes after that.

376
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,873
So I'm asking, in the presence
of this coffee cart...

377
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,794
...and the sacred moment
that it represents...

378
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,953
...if you can honestly tell me that
you don't love me anymore?

379
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,474
- Summer, I...
- Just say it.

380
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,996
Cohen, if you don't love me,
I promise I will go to Brown by myself...

381
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,311
...and I will be cold and miserable
and alone.

382
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,480
And I will never bother you again.

383
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,910
I don't love you anymore.

384
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,556
Oh, my God.

385
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,073
- Summer...
- Just get away from me.

386
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,396
Okay? Just get out of here, Cohen!

387
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,238
- I'm so sorry...
- I gotta go to detention.

388
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,310
- Where are we going?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

389
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,035
Hey, Heather?

390
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,391
Hey, I'm glad I found you guys.

391
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,388
I left my jacket in the van.
Volchok said you have the keys?

392
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,428
- But it's not that cold.
- True, but it's my favorite jacket, so...

393
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,033
Hey! Get off of me. Heather!

394
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,037
- Shut up, bitch!
- Heather!

395
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,794
Dude, wait your turn!

396
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,672
- Get off of her!
- What the hell?

397
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,711
Get off of her! Oh, God.

398
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,070
- Get out!
- Hey, come on, dude.

399
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,231
It's cool.
We were just having a little fun.

400
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,197
Yeah? One sec.

401
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,789
Hey, Mom, I was gonna go
look for you at the diner.

402
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,555
She wouldn't have been there. The girls
have been on a serious shopping spree.

403
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,032
Okay, I know this isn't like
what Kirsten wears.

404
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,589
It's kind of low-cut, a little sparkly.

405
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,115
- It's a special occasion.
- You gotta see it on her.

406
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,838
- Go put it on.
- Oh, okay.

407
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,116
You know what?
I don't have the time right now.

408
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,595
Yeah, yeah, I got an earlier flight.

409
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,830
And Mom...

410
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,993
...I was talking to Seth,
and graduation's just a ceremony.

411
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,160
I mean, everybody in those
funny hats...

412
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,272
...bunch of boring speeches...
- It wouldn't be boring to me.

413
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,074
Well, we were thinking about
just blowing it off...

414
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,198
...getting out of town that weekend.
- Out of town?

415
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,151
Yeah, but I mean, you could come in
later in the summer and visit me...

416
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,515
...or I could come up here.

417
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,193
But no graduation.

418
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,313
No, no, I guess not.

419
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,632
You don't have to lie to me, Ryan.

420
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,638
Don't have to worry about me
embarrassing you at graduation.

421
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,308
- Mom...
- I may not have been the best mother...

422
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,552
...but I have never been
ashamed of my family.

423
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,798
You don't know her the way I do.

424
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,275
- I never said I did.
- Been the same my whole life.

425
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,318
She gets clean for a little while,
promises she's changed.

426
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,514
Then she meets some lowlife,
he moves in with her, she bottoms out.

427
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,997
How many of these lowlifes
does she meet in rehab?

428
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,512
Hasn't had a drink in 12 years.

429
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,911
Pays for their apartment,
even fixed up one of his old cars for her.

430
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,390
- Yeah, well, I didn't know that.
- Didn't want to.

431
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,716
Maybe you already
made up your mind about him.

432
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,876
And about your mom too.

433
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,676
- I gotta get to the airport. Car's waiting.
- I'll drive you.

434
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,629
After the trouble I caused,
it's the least I can do.

435
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,069
And there's a stop
I wanna make on the way.

436
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,314
<i>Hi, this is Sandy Cohen.</i>
<i>I can 't get to the phone right now...</i>

437
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,679
- I see you brought your nurse.
- And your money.

438
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,236
Files are in the back seat of my car.
The door's unlocked.

439
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,073
- Not gonna send your guy to get them?
- Well, he's not here for the files, Matt.

440
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,435
Just as well, since there are no files.

441
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,115
The only evidence Matt has
is of his own bad judgment.

442
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,276
You expect me to believe
this is a bluff?

443
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,152
Oh, go check the car yourself.

444
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,239
After we spoke,
I had your hard drive searched...

445
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,192
...checked your e-mail.
You never had evidence.

446
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,870
Whatever you think Griffin was up to
is based purely on gossip and hearsay.

447
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,913
Yeah, well, I figure if he was guilty,
he'd pay up...

448
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,354
...just to be safe.

449
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,955
- Wasting my time, Ramsey.
- Yeah.

450
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,550
Think about all the sick people
you could be healing.

451
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,397
- What's this?
- It's your severance.

452
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,075
Might not buy that beach in Cabo,
but it'll get you on your feet in Chicago.

453
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,840
- I can't take this, not after...
- I put you on this path.

454
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,958
Take it and go.

455
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,073
Sandy.

456
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,037
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

457
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,032
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

458
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,552
Where have you been? It's late.

459
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,349
<i>Full Metal Yakuza</i>
and <i>99 Cycling Swords.</i>

460
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,152
- Those are movies?
- A few hours...

461
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,312
...of bloodshed and violence
might help kill the pain.

462
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,071
- You wanna talk?
- I was gonna ask you if you'd seen Ryan.

463
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,669
- Not yet.
- Okay.

464
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,871
- Everything okay?
- Everything's okay.

465
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,959
- Okay. Good night.
- Night.

466
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,959
Before you leave, I just want you
to know something.

467
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,951
You're her whole life, Ryan.

468
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,629
Kirsten sent that stuff.
She's a real nice lady.

469
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,551
Oh, don't worry, my eyes are red
from crying, not from drinking.

470
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,637
I'll be out there.

471
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,631
I'm sorry.

472
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,512
You know, when Sandy came to
invite me to your birthday party...

473
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,069
...I really wanted to go.
- But you didn't.

474
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,752
I wasn't ready.

475
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,596
I guess I know the feeling.

476
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,035
But I've been showing up at my
meetings and showing up for work...

477
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,631
...and finally picked a decent guy.

478
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,593
You probably don't understand how
hard it is to hold it together every day.

479
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,318
I don't know about that.

480
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,315
I live in Newport,
but I'm still your kid, after all.

481
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,475
- So I'm still your mom.
- Yeah.

482
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,033
If there's a little bit of me in you,
then I can't be all bad, right?

483
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,437
- Promise me you'll remember that.
- I promise.

484
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,553
- So I'm sorry if...
- It's okay.

485
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,109
Your little family intervention
seems to have worked.

486
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,551
Then I'm not sorry.

487
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,917
For anything that may have happened.

488
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,193
Me either.

489
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,633
Well, my ride's here, flight to catch.

490
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,870
Well, if everything works out
at graduation...

491
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,510
...maybe we'll see some more of you.
- All right. Yeah. Sounds good.

492
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,158
Okay.

493
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,391
Mom?

494
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,279
Marissa, honey.

495
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,912
You want me to whip up
another round of Frappuccinos?

496
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,508
They say chocolate and sugar
send endorphins to your brain.

497
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,954
Come on, tell me you feel better.

498
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,550
He doesn't love me.

499
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,758
Welcome back, buddy.
How was your mom?

500
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,037
Coming to graduation.

501
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,910
You really waiting here
to ask about my mom?

502
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,838
I made the worst mistake of my life.

503
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,309
Now I need to get Summer back
and get into Brown.

504
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,397
- Great. How?
- That's where you come in.

505
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,034
- We need a plan?
- It's gonna be a long night, Ryan.

506
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,152
Lot of whining, lot of pining...

507
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,038
...some brainstorming.
You don't mind?

508
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,514
It's good to be home.

509
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,750
All right. How are we gonna
get Summer back?

510
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,110
Plan A: I fake my own death.

511
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,118
You never wanna underestimate
the power of the sympathy vote.

512
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,793
- Is there a Plan B?
- Yeah, yeah.

513
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,514
I could hack in through
the Brown firewall...

514
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,912
...into the Admissions Office mainframe
and reverse my acceptance.

515
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,116
That's actually a good idea.
You know how?

516
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,510
I had an uncle who went to De Vry.

517
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,711
