1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,268
Previously on The O. C.:

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,271
Caleb is gonna be indicted.
I don't know when.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,913
Oh, my God, the yard guy?

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,354
-Yeah, I know.
-Marissa!

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,637
Was I supposed to wait for you?
You weren't coming back.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,869
I wanted the truth.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,268
-Who's your favorite writer?
-Bendis.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,311
-Well, hot damn, welcome to the club.
-Thanks.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,351
-Dude, I love that guy.
-You're not the only one.

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,431
You had me three months ago,
and you left.

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,154
-I wanna make it up to you.
-lt has nothing to do with me.

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,118
It is about you,
and it is always about you.

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,713
Put your hands behind your head.

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,190
Don't say anything. I'll follow you
to the station. I'm his lawyer.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,839
Do you think I did the right thing
cutting my hair?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,355
I don't believe this.
Your grandfather's in big trouble.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,750
Yeah, I know.
Up the creek and then no paddle.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,957
Damn Oregonian barbers, man,
making my head too small for my body.

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,078
-How do you work with this mirror?
-Grandpa. Front page. Jail.

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,714
I know. I got cut out of that photo
because of my hair.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,479
Sorry to see you're so upset.

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,879
-I'll survive. It'll grow out.
-I'm talking about Caleb.

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,232
Looks like some of us
were way off base.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,515
Accusing you
of making everything about you.

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,991
-My God, she is right.
-I'm just kidding.

26
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,072
No, dude, here I am going on and on
about my haircut.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,958
My grandfather's in the cooler.

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,237
I'm like a monster. I'm all I think about,
and not in a good way.

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,715
-There's a good way?
-Talk to me about anything...

30
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,269
-...other than me. Go. Give me anything.
-Here it is.

31
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,311
First day of AP physics.
Kind of nervous.

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,278
Could you quit fretting over
your nerd gear for five seconds?

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,557
We have a real crisis on our hands
unless Summer's wrong...

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,359
...and I'm not completely insufferable.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,310
-Why didn't you just tell me?
-lt was kind of hard getting a word in.

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,516
-You're a good talker, but--
-Summer's right.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,433
Dude, I have to change.
I have to be, like, a better person.

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,431
-Better how?
-Less selfish.

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,358
More selfless. Less take, more give.

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,839
Less pitching, more catching.

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,393
Look, don't change for me.

42
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,477
-I'm not changing for you.
-For Summer?

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,272
No, no.

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,158
I think, for the greater good of man.

45
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,635
No hidden agenda here,
like getting Summer back?

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,796
Dude, I don't even want
Summer back...

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,033
...unless that is what she wants.
In which case, that's not about me.

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,318
That's about me supporting her,
and her wanting of--

49
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,596
Whatever she--
That's what she wants, okay.

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,994
Admit you want her back.

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,078
No. No, I don't.
It's the new me, Ryan. It is.

52
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,276
Wrap your head
around the new Seth Cohen.

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,715
You're talking about yourself
in the third person.

54
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,313
How is Seth's hair right now?

55
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,956
You can thank me later.

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,680
Thank you? For letting me
sleep the night in jail.

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,549
It was the most vile,
most inhuman night of my life.

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,915
Coming from the guy
who married Julie Cooper...

59
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,308
...that's saying something.

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,035
So aside from coming up with
your hilarious one-liners...

61
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,428
...what's our next move?

62
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,591
My next move
is to meet with the partners...

63
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,718
...make sure they agree
to my taking you on as a client.

64
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,668
-Why wouldn't they?
-Well, you're not exactly the ideal client.

65
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,796
What? Rich, powerful....

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,592
Guilty.

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,829
You missed the turn.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,117
I'm not taking you to the office.
Kirsten's meeting us at the house.

69
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,555
-I have a business to run.
-Who are you kidding?

70
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,518
We both know, with the exception
of the underhanded stuff...

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,511
...Kirsten does everything anyway.

72
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,989
Step down. Put Kirsten in charge.

73
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,156
That's your next move.

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,639
Excuse me.

75
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,112
I'm new. Is it all right to park here?

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,915
Sure. If you're not embarrassed.

77
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,913
Ryan, what would you like?

78
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,878
-You buying?
-No, but I'm letting you order first.

79
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,752
I may be selfless, but I'm stingy.

80
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,718
In that case, let's see.
Can I have a...?

81
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,757
What have you got?

82
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,238
Large coffee.

83
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,117
I just didn't wanna keep him waiting.
That'd be selfish.

84
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,912
Iced coffee for me, please. Thanks.

85
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,958
What?

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,354
There's a new club
that the Walkmen are playing at.

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,278
-You know who loves the Walkmen?
-You.

88
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,158
Yeah, and?

89
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,471
-Summer.
-Summer, who's going out with Zach?

90
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,875
Yeah. So maybe I'll buy
her and Zach tickets.

91
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,399
-Why?
-Out of friendship...

92
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,869
-...and selflessness.
-And to get her back.

93
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,435
-I can't hear you.
-Seth, your coffee.

94
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,074
Thanks a lot. I'll get you next time.

95
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,317
God, I am so sorry.

96
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,153
-That was refreshing.
-Here, let me....

97
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,713
I am so sorry.

98
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,196
-You okay?
-Yeah, I have to get a rhinoplasty...

99
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,920
...but now I'll look
just like all the other girls here.

100
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,115
It's okay, really.

101
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,596
You can leave my tampons
where they are. Thanks.

102
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,519
Is there anything I can do?

103
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,353
I guess you could dislocate my shoulder
or shave off my eyebrows.

104
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,671
Is this how you treat your new students,
or is today my lucky day?

105
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,877
-Can I buy you a coffee?
-No, no, no. Please, please, don't.

106
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,830
I've had plenty, thanks,
and I'm guessing you have too. So....

107
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,796
I'm just gonna wring out my shirt
and stuff toilet paper up my nose...

108
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,349
...and I'm sure
I'll have no trouble fitting in now.

109
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,476
So thanks.

110
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,357
We have to think
about the future here.

111
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,318
The only way a company
is gonna survive a crisis like this...

112
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,993
...is for the CEO to step down.

113
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,155
Face it, Caleb.
It's time to get your Martha Stewart on.

114
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,311
There's more police, more reporters...

115
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,597
...or angry stockholders.

116
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,519
Julie.

117
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,238
Caleb.

118
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,799
As soon as I saw the paper...

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,470
...I walked right out of my seaweed
wrap, and I came right here.

120
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,989
-That's heartwarming.
-A weekend at the Montage...

121
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,913
...was exactly what I needed
to remind me what's important.

122
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,431
I know I haven't been there for you...

123
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,319
...but you haven't been exactly
honest with me.

124
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,352
We're gonna....

125
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,870
It's just getting good.

126
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,153
All right.

127
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,158
Honey...

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,355
...when Jimmy went down,
our marriage fell apart.

129
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,109
I do not want that to happen to us.

130
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,993
We're partners,
which means we share everything...

131
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,628
...so put me to work.
What can I do?

132
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,392
Talk to the press, make some calls?

133
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,999
Kirsten's taking care of that.

134
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,913
She can't do everything.
Surely there's something I can do.

135
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,348
There is one thing, but--

136
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,312
-Name it.
-Food.

137
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,110
Since I'm working from home,
we need water...

138
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,034
...some coffee, some of those
pumpkin muffins I like so much.

139
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,474
Thanks, Juju.

140
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,117
Kirsten, Sandy, back to business.

141
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,071
Is it just me or is Zach perfect?

142
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,076
He's good-looking, but not into himself...

143
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,918
...smart, but not a show-off...

144
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,718
...athletic, but sensitive...

145
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,798
...a politician's son.
Hey, he's like Newport's Price William.

146
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,315
Yeah, the kind of guy parents love.

147
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,116
Hey, did I tell you how stoked my dad is
that I'm dating a congressman's son?

148
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,111
He is dying to go
have lunch with Zach.

149
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,077
-So are you gonna do it?
-No way.

150
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,629
Do you remember what a disaster
that was with Cohen?

151
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,438
Yeah, but Zach's not Seth.

152
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,989
-Believe me, I know.
-So then what's the problem?

153
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,236
You afraid
he might actually like Zach...

154
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,630
...that you two
will live happily ever after...

155
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,196
-...with nothing standing in your way?
-No, l-- No.

156
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,038
So then you're not over Seth.

157
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,198
I am. I've divested myself
of all Seth's material possessions.

158
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,669
I'm vibrating at
an extremely Cohen-less frequency.

159
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,711
Okay. So then
you don't really like Zach.

160
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,194
No. I mean, yes.

161
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,713
I don't-- Shut up.

162
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,313
Hey, Summer. Marissa.

163
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,752
Hey, come sit down.

164
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,191
Marissa, I was sorry to read
about your stepdad in the paper today.

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,319
You read the paper?

166
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,040
Just the L.A. Times,
The New York Times...

167
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,839
... The Orange County Register
and The Wall Street Journal.

168
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,350
This relationship
is probably over now, right?

169
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,870
-I'll just go.
-No, no, no. Stay.

170
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,077
Actually, we were just talking, and....

171
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,550
What are you doing this weekend?

172
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,918
-You gotta be kidding me.
-I know.

173
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,680
I know. I'm sorry,
but it's the only seat left.

174
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,314
Don't worry.
I promise I'll keep my hands to myself.

175
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,755
Well, it's your elbow
I'm worried about.

176
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,113
Dude.

177
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,554
Why do you hate me so much?

178
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,034
-I don't.
-What did I do?

179
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,509
-lt was an accident.
-lt was, like, four accidents.

180
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,233
Six, if you count each tampon.

181
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,829
-I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.
-Nothing.

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,956
We don't need to speak
to each other again.

183
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,752
That's too bad. I was enjoying it.

184
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,433
-I wasn't.
-I was being sarcastic.

185
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,914
I wasn't.

186
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,439
Morning, guys...

187
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,239
...your favorite physics teacher here,
Ari Greenburg...

188
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,158
...with new lab partner assignments.

189
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,710
We've got Adriana Albergetti
with Philip Raskin.

190
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,873
Ryan Atwood with Lindsay Gardner.

191
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,669
Jennifer Anderson with Jamie Barber.

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,992
-Ryan Atwood?
-Lindsay Gardner.

193
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,432
Bait Shop.
Could be our very own CBGBs.

194
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,874
-What?
-Come on.

195
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,112
The only music in Chino is
the sounds of gunshots and helicopters?

196
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,517
Let's get the tickets.

197
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,673
Hello?

198
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,111
Hello.

199
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,633
Okay.

200
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,788
Hi. Excuse me.

201
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,712
We're here about tickets.

202
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,199
She's got headphones on.

203
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,113
Yeah, I can see that. Thanks.

204
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,748
Excuse me, ma'am?

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,709
-Touch me again, I'll hurt you.
-Okay, fine. What do you call this?

206
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,879
-Thanks.
-What do you want?

207
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,355
-Tickets for Friday's show.
-Sold out, sorry.

208
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,349
That's the last one.

209
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,835
-All set, Alex.
-Awesome. Thank you so much.

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,434
Here are your tickets,
and I threw in a couple extras.

211
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,715
Cool, thanks.

212
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,036
-Why does he get tickets?
-He works here.

213
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,159
-lf I work here, could I get tickets?
-You don't work here.

214
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,789
What's that?

215
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,470
-You.... You wouldn't want that job.
-No, sure I would. Sign me up.

216
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,477
-Seth--
-You don't wanna know the pay...

217
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,551
-...hours, job description?
-No, I'm good.

218
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,398
Minimum wage. Long.

219
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,797
Taking tickets, cleaning toilets
and the preparation of fried foods.

220
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,349
I'll be sure and wash my hands
between the last two.

221
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,996
I have to ask Nat, the owner,
but he's never here, so--

222
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,878
-Perfect.
-Okay. I'm Alex.

223
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,268
You can start right now.

224
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,512
If I don't fire you by the end of tonight,
then come back tomorrow.

225
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,794
I have a mop, Ryan.

226
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,479
You got a mop, bro. So.

227
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,438
-You're doing all this for Summer?
-Yeah, for her friendship.

228
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,200
-You really are changing.
-I am. Changing urinal cakes.

229
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,954
That's how committed Seth Cohen is
to the new Seth Cohen.

230
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,958
Okay. Now you're talking about yourself
in the fourth person.

231
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,554
It's a whole new dimension
of selflessness, Ryan.

232
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,473
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to the urinals.

233
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,910
I don't know where they are.

234
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,915
Check out the new Ryan Atwood
studying at the breakfast table.

235
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,072
-How are classes going?
-T ough. Physics.

236
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,032
Physics is tough.

237
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,909
It's not the work, it's the students.
A student, to be exact.

238
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,118
God, my back.

239
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,198
Personal growth is so painful.

240
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,436
My son doing manual labor.

241
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,909
I never thought I'd live to see the day.

242
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,678
Hey, Mom.
Check out this ironic twist of events.

243
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,071
Ryan is now a science nerd.
I'm working a blue-collar job.

244
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,231
That's nice, honey.

245
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,273
Mom?

246
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,591
Seth, don't worry. Your grandfather's
situation is very serious...

247
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,035
-...but your father and I are handling it.
-Right.

248
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,111
To tell you the truth, I haven't even...

249
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,353
...slept well the past couple nights, so
concerned have I been for his well-being.

250
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,591
-But everything's gonna be okay?
-Right.

251
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,560
-Right?
-Right.

252
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,873
If Grandpa did have to go to some
white-collar prison with tennis and TiVo--

253
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,519
Don't worry.
It won't affect you.

254
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,312
-He wouldn't lose the company?
-No.

255
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,754
-Or the house?
-Son.

256
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,517
That's crazy talk.

257
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,152
Everything's gonna be fine.
I don't want you to worry, sweetie.

258
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,548
I'm not.

259
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,314
Because it's not gonna be like it was
with your father.

260
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,869
I'm going to hold this family together.

261
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,393
Fine.

262
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,113
Marissa, listen to me.

263
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,949
I know that there's a lot of uncertainty
in our lives right now.

264
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,874
But I want you to believe me when I say
that Caleb is not going to jail.

265
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,358
Oh, well, that's a shame.
Because if Caleb did go to jail...

266
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,751
...then you'd be on the street,
and I could go back to living with Dad.

267
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,276
So should we maybe
exchange numbers or something?

268
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,839
For what?

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,672
To work on our lab report.

270
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,916
No. I already turned it in.

271
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,755
I put both our names on it.
You'll get an A.

272
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,272
-Funny. I thought we were supposed to--
-Yeah, I know, but here's the thing.

273
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,228
The only reason I transferred to Harbor
was so I could load up on AP courses...

274
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,198
...get into Y ale early and never
have to see a cheerleader...

275
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,476
...or water-polo player ever again.

276
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,999
No offense.

277
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,794
Okay, I think you got
the wrong idea about me.

278
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,757
You think I'm stupid.

279
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,595
God doesn't give with both hands.

280
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,075
So take the A.

281
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,390
Enjoy it. It's my treat.

282
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,109
Where are you going?

283
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,679
-Mr. Greenburg?
-Yes?

284
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,475
That lab report Lindsay handed in,
I'm not quite finished with it yet.

285
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,756
Well, it looks perfect to me.

286
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,911
Nice work.
You guys make a great team.

287
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,509
I didn't contribute
a whole lot to that report and...

288
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,472
...by a whole lot, I mean anything.

289
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,954
Is this true?

290
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,953
Lindsay?

291
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,359
Look, guys.

292
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,078
Good science requires teamwork.

293
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,151
Part of the assignment
is working together.

294
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,271
-Maybe if we had different partners.
-No.

295
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,756
I'm keeping you together and
giving you an additional assignment...

296
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,911
...which you'll do together.

297
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,117
Or fail. Together.

298
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,554
Oh, yeah. You're not stupid at all.

299
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,749
A little help here?
I think I'm gonna have a hernia.

300
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,638
I had a hernia when I was little.

301
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,268
-I had to have an operation.
-Seth! Can you...?

302
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,793
Sorry, sorry.

303
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,234
Okay.

304
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,558
My legs just went numb.

305
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,233
My legs went numb,
but we're cool.

306
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,960
-That's normal, right?
-You are so out of your element.

307
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,872
-No, I'm not.
-What are you doing here?

308
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,640
-I need tickets.
-What are you, like, a huge fan?

309
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,031
Yeah. Of a prickly brunette
named after my least-favorite season.

310
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,834
-This is for a girl?
-T o be clear, I'm actually...

311
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,275
...getting the tickets
for her and her boyf--

312
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,232
Her boy--

313
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,158
Her friend that's a boy.

314
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,756
I'm showing her that I'm capable of
thinking of somebody other than myself.

315
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,959
-That's sweet. It's pathetic, but sweet.
-That's my niche. Pathetic and sweet.

316
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,598
What? No. Mom.

317
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,638
I don't know, maybe.

318
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,314
Okay. I love you too.
And say hi to Daddy.

319
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,510
-What?
-How old are you?

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,228
-Seventeen.
-What?

321
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,635
-Really? You don't go to school?
-I used to.

322
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,279
I got kicked out...

323
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,557
...of Corona, Mater Dei
and even Newport Union.

324
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,638
After that, my parents had enough.

325
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,912
Said go away, get a job, move out,
which I did.

326
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,868
I got my own studio and I work here,
and I've never been happier.

327
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,116
Yeah. This is you happy?

328
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,832
-Look, you barely earned these, but....
-Hey.

329
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,479
Right on. Thanks.

330
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,313
All right.
Summer's gonna be very stoked.

331
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,548
On the band.

332
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,429
I think the best thing for our
friendship is, like, a good live band.

333
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,110
Yeah. As a girl,
I feel I should probably warn you...

334
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,840
...that this whole little game
you're planning....

335
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,396
She's gonna see right through it.

336
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,154
Mr. Brubaker,
I assure you that my father is innocent.

337
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,868
I--

338
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,628
No, he's not in the office, but--

339
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,234
I'll have him call you.

340
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,034
I am so happy to see you.

341
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,509
Guess who no longer works for
Partridge, Savage and Kahn.

342
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,432
-You quit?
-Or got fired.

343
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,318
Quit/got fired.

344
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,153
A lot of things were said.

345
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,352
-None of them good.
-What happened?

346
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,879
Your father.

347
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,919
They said as long as I was representing
him, I wasn't working for them.

348
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,676
I love April. I do.
She's, like, the most awesome girl ever.

349
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,996
- You know, Mrs. Robard--
-Call me Sara.

350
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,674
It's Thursday night.
No knocking until 9 p. m.

351
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,274
-Sara. You 're a woman.
-I'm April's mother.

352
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,714
Cohen.

353
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,159
How did you get in here?

354
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,079
Your stepmom,
who's in unusually good spirits.

355
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,999
-It's the Klonopin.
-That explained that eye twitch.

356
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,834
-I won't stay long--
-You can't stay. The Valley's on...

357
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,389
-...so you should....
-No. I have something for you.

358
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,994
Unless it's a plutonium car
to take me to last year...

359
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,593
...so I can never date you, no.

360
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,472
It's tickets to
the Walkmen tomorrow.

361
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,114
-I'm not going to a concert with you.
-I'm not going.

362
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,872
Well, I am. Actually, I'm going.

363
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,679
But I'm not gonna go with you.
These are for you and Zach.

364
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,398
-Me and Zach?
-Yeah.

365
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,833
-ls this a trick?
-Nope.

366
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,390
Just, you know, wanted to do something
nice for someone else for a change.

367
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,677
So hopefully, I don't know,
we can all hang out. We can be friends.

368
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,468
Friends?

369
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,833
If you want.

370
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,198
Anyways, enjoy the show.

371
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,236
You want this closed or...?

372
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,710
-Yeah.
-I think I'm pregnant...

373
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,118
... with his baby.

374
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,559
Thanks for letting me stay over.

375
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,111
And thanks for breakfast. You finally
learned how to make French toast.

376
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,912
Anytime. Happy to have the company.

377
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,957
-I know what you mean.
-Yeah?

378
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,190
What do you know about being lonely?

379
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,952
Well, let's see.

380
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,073
My stepfather blackmailed me
into living with my mom.

381
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,800
My mom shipped my little sister
off to boarding school.

382
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,030
My boyfriend
spent the summer with a girl...

383
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,316
...who may have been pregnant
with his child...

384
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,869
...and now he still won't talk to me,
thanks to DJ.

385
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,109
Who's DJ?

386
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,113
Doesn't even matter,
since he's not talking to me either.

387
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,876
Mariss? Honey?

388
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,155
-You ready to go?
-I'm gonna go get my stuff.

389
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,117
Back to the gulag.

390
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,153
She knows I heard that.

391
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,912
It's a little game we play.

392
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,870
-So how's Caleb?
-Fantastic. Never better.

393
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,197
Facing prison.
We could lose everything.

394
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,590
You gonna divorce him
and take his kids?

395
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,313
No.

396
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,430
You'd think he'd be
just a little bit grateful...

397
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,637
...show some appreciation
for my personal growth.

398
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,832
He only listens to Kirsten and Sandy.

399
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,515
Well, the woman I married
wouldn't stand for that.

400
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,797
Nobody puts Julie Cooper in the corner.

401
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,393
I don't know
how this is happening again.

402
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,669
Maybe because
you keep marrying for money.

403
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,348
I did not marry for money.

404
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,119
I didn't marry you for money.

405
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,193
No, you married me
because you were pregnant.

406
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,118
You married me
because I was pregnant.

407
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,318
I married you because I loved you.

408
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,759
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye, sweetheart.

409
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,911
-Love you.
-I love you too.

410
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,915
Back to the gulag.

411
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,276
Okay. E equals
one-half MV squared.

412
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,238
So if gravity is the constant,
and we plug in these velocities....

413
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,550
Ryan. What are you doing?

414
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,195
I'm trying to do the assignment.

415
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,635
-Except you've already finished it.
-I'm sorry.

416
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,995
But if you flunk out,
you can spend your life...

417
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,390
...floating in your parents'
infinity pool, okay?

418
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,357
I'm here on
academic scholarship, so....

419
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,954
What makes you think
my parents have an infinity pool?

420
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,750
I mean, they do,
but they're not my parents.

421
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,475
I transferred in from Chino.
I was just like you.

422
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,355
Really? You were assaulted
by the captain of the water-polo team?

423
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,513
Okay, first of all, I've never even seen
a water-polo game.

424
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,035
Match. Whatever. Second of all, yeah.
Yeah, I was.

425
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,677
Then I got to know the guy,
and he turned out to be a good friend.

426
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,669
Well, I'm not here to make friends.

427
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,274
Yeah, well, mission accomplished.

428
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,352
-Look, clearly this isn't working.
-Clearly.

429
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,272
So let's just....

430
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,596
You do the first half, then
I'll go over it before I put it with mine.

431
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,677
-And I'll go over yours.
-Fine.

432
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,991
I guess we'll get together
this weekend and go over it together.

433
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,557
Sounds like a perfect way
to spend the weekend. See you.

434
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,234
The Bait Shop.

435
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,913
Where is that exactly?

436
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,639
I don't know.

437
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,556
So where'd you get these from, then?

438
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,837
You know. Cohen.

439
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,839
He gave them to you?

440
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,672
To us.

441
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,272
Why'd he do that?

442
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,030
Well, he said he wants to be friends,
that he's trying to change...

443
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,072
...to be less Cohen-y
and more like, well, a person.

444
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,750
You think he might be
trying to win you back?

445
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,234
No!

446
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,598
-I mean, no.
-Okay.

447
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,072
Let's just say, hypothetically,
Seth really is changing.

448
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,038
Would that mean you'd want
to get back together with him?

449
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,914
Well, hypothetically....

450
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,068
You know what?
Don't answer.

451
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,992
-Just go to the concert alone.
-Zach--

452
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,879
See Seth. No bickering.
No bantering. Just talk.

453
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,795
As much as I like you, Summer,
you need to figure this out with him.

454
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,596
I need you to figure this out.

455
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,278
Holy mack.

456
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,715
You are, like, such an adult.

457
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,712
I mean, you're not insecure.

458
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,791
You're not jealous.

459
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,679
Are you a robot?

460
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,388
We had a great time over break, right?

461
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,752
But if that's all it was supposed to be,
and we've taken this as far as possible...

462
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,151
...just let me know. Okay?

463
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,674
Okay.

464
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,469
Do you think champagne
is really necessary?

465
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,990
Absolutely. We need to toast to
quitting/getting fired. T o independence.

466
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,071
-You mean unemployment.
-Dad.

467
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,834
Think how much time Sandy'll have
to spend on your case.

468
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,998
Padding around the house
in his black socks and robe. I can't wait.

469
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,919
-Cal, don't you have a toast to make?
-No.

470
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,150
It's all right.

471
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,595
Too much champagne, I get giggly.

472
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,190
-When have you ever been giggly?
-Dad? What is it?

473
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,995
Julie and I have been talking,
and I've come to a decision.

474
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,395
Tomorrow morning, I'm calling a press
conference to announce that I'll be...

475
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,597
...stepping down from the Newport
Group and appointing a new CEO.

476
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,038
I'm glad you listened to reason.

477
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,559
Dad, wow.

478
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,315
As of tomorrow morning, Julie will be
the new chief executive officer...

479
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,357
...of the Newport Group.

480
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,557
Who needs more champagne?

481
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,833
Thanks.

482
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,511
-Hey. Thanks.
-Yep.

483
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,033
Any Summer sightings?

484
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,914
No, not yet.

485
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,799
What if she doesn't show?

486
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,279
What if, after all this...

487
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,432
...she never knows the blood and sweat
and other people's pee...

488
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,115
...that went into getting her tickets
because Zach took her to see lncubus?

489
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,639
You'd be happy for her...

490
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,916
-...because you're her friend, right?
-Totally.

491
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,671
Hey, you came.

492
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,593
Where's Zach?

493
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,434
He couldn't make it.

494
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,270
That's real-- That's too bad.

495
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,910
Let me show you
to your very VlP seating.

496
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,872
It's this way.

497
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,434
Hey.

498
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,199
Hey.

499
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,191
I wasn't planning
on coming here tonight.

500
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,268
I'm here for Team Summer.

501
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,919
I'm here for Team Seth.

502
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,873
So, what do you think?

503
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,031
Seth and Summer, star-crossed lovers?

504
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,356
Or better off just friends?

505
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,028
Destined to be together?

506
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,630
Or just too dysfunctional together
to make it work.

507
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,632
I guess only time will tell.

508
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,990
Yep, I guess.

509
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,478
You wanna go in? Watch the band?

510
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,711
The last time we went to a concert,
it didn't turn out too well.

511
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,395
Things are different now.

512
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,112
Well, then, come on.

513
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,073
You like this band?

514
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,468
I like Journey.

515
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,719
Julie's waiting in the car.
You are I are gonna talk later, yes?

516
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,110
-I'm not sure I wanna talk to you.
-Sandy.

517
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,311
Kirsten is the one good thing
in your life.

518
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,038
How could you do this to her?

519
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,599
After all she's done for you.

520
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,273
I have to think of my marriage.

521
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,234
What does Julie know about being the
CEO of a multimillion-dollar company?

522
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,630
It's a figurehead position.
You said so yourself.

523
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,712
-Kirsten will continue to run the show.
-And work for Julie?

524
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,598
Why the hell
would she wanna do that?

525
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,711
What do you suggest I do?

526
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,875
I suggest you find a way
to make it up to Kirsten. Now.

527
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,630
Unless you want Julie
to be your lawyer too.

528
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,997
Can you see okay?

529
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,758
Yeah, I can see fine.

530
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,071
There's no obstructed views, right?

531
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,793
-Right.
-Okay.

532
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,435
I know sometimes you can't see so well
because the tall people are standing--

533
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,831
Y eah, right, you know, but now
I'm just having a hard time hearing.

534
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,197
-But thanks for getting me a seat.
-No problem.

535
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,355
Look, Cohen,
I think we need to really talk.

536
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,199
There you are. Some guy
just puked all over an amplifier--

537
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,634
I'm on it.

538
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,949
Why was that tattooed girl
telling you about vomit?

539
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,435
She's my boss.
I actually work here now.

540
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,596
-What?
-Yeah.

541
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,916
It was the only way
I could get those tickets.

542
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,908
But why?

543
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,237
Well, I needed the tickets
to show you that I could be selfless...

544
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,431
...and to get you
to stop hating me...

545
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,349
...and I needed you to stop hating me
so that we could be friends.

546
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,513
Cohen, that was really sweet.

547
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,711
Pathetic and sweet?

548
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,552
No, just sweet.

549
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,871
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, God.

550
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,150
Come on, I'm--
Summer, wait a second.

551
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,997
You are unbelievable.

552
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,159
Not in a good way, right?

553
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,515
-I thought you just wanted to be friends.
-I do.

554
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,232
-Well, then, what was that kiss?
-I didn't mean for it to happen.

555
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,478
Really? So this whole night
wasn't just a plan to get me back?

556
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,511
No, absolutely not.

557
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,599
Unless maybe it's what you want.

558
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,199
-Cohen.
-What? Come on.

559
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,870
I believed you, that you were changing
and just wanted to be friends.

560
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,354
I do. That's--

561
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,593
Maybe I just--
I can't be just friends with you.

562
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,158
Well, then, I guess maybe
this is it for us.

563
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,195
I'm so tired right now.
I didn't even sleep at all.

564
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,630
Oh, dude. The only thing
holding my head up is my lungs.

565
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,955
I'm sorry, man.

566
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,233
I handled that Summer situation
so wrong. I just....

567
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,678
-I should've never returned her calls.
-She never called you.

568
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,030
-I should've dated other girls.
-What girls?

569
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,237
Maybe if I played her hot and cold
and messed with her mind...

570
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,550
...then it potentially could've worked.

571
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,109
Look, man, I'm sorry. Really, I am.

572
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,909
And I would love to rehash the evening,
second by second, one more time...

573
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,991
...but I'm late.

574
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,879
-Late for what?
-I'm meeting my lab partner.

575
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,156
-I got this physics assignment.
-On a Saturday?

576
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,590
The geek routine
was really amusing at first...

577
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,398
...but I think you're going too far.

578
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,795
-This chick's going down.
-I need to talk about me...

579
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,154
...for several more hours.

580
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,238
-I thought you didn't do that anymore.
-That was the new Seth.

581
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,197
I'm back, Cohen classic.
Red, white and me.

582
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,231
Hang in there. I won't be gone long.

583
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,677
Did the light of dawn
make any of this a little easier to take?

584
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,554
Harder, actually.

585
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,953
So, what are you gonna do?

586
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,232
I'll tell you this:
I'm not going back to the office.

587
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,517
I may tolerate Julie
as my stepmother...

588
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,831
...but I will not suffer the indignity
of her being my boss.

589
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,315
Which means as of Monday,
we're both unemployed.

590
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,999
-There's a concept.
-Come on.

591
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,350
You and me, bathrobes,
some black socks.

592
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,073
The thought of that is so....

593
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,514
-Liberating.
-Scary.

594
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,109
Forget the black socks.
Barefoot, baby, barefoot.

595
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,673
I can't be unemployed.

596
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,230
I can't even take a vacation for more
than a week without freaking out.

597
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,314
A vacation with you is no vacation,
with the itineraries and sightseeing.

598
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,069
I can't have worked this hard
and not have something to show for it.

599
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,473
I don't know.

600
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,793
Can't quit.

601
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,958
Can't go back there.

602
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,077
I don't know either.

603
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,470
But what I do know is...

604
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,952
...I'm not the one
you should be telling this to.

605
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,839
-Hey.
-Hey.

606
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,228
Seth.

607
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,158
-You're in my room.
-Yeah.

608
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,073
How'd you get in here?

609
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,677
Took a left at the grotto,
then I hopped the funicular...

610
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,479
...to the dumbwaiter.
This is a nice place.

611
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,511
So, what are you doing in here?

612
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,669
Well, when I have a problem, Marissa,
I like to talk about it incessantly.

613
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,708
Yeah, no. That's it.

614
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,111
I just think I burned out anyone else
who will listen, so....

615
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,998
Is now a bad time?

616
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,838
I'm game.

617
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,152
So...

618
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,677
...I think I really messed things up
with Summer last night.

619
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,353
Hurt her pretty bad.

620
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,149
-Yeah, you did.
-You're not gonna sugarcoat this one?

621
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,072
Not for you.

622
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,232
Look, if you really
wanna be her friend...

623
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,920
...then maybe you should
think about just apologizing.

624
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,833
-You know, say you were sorry.
-Y eah, no, I know.

625
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,038
Sounds so simple when you say it.

626
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,836
I think that's a good place to start.

627
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,878
Okay, do you happen to know
where Summer is right now?

628
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,678
I just have this thing to tell her.

629
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,792
-She's at the club with her dad.
-Oh, yeah, the father.

630
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,473
Cool. I'm just gonna, you know--

631
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,110
Whoa, Seth. You know what? Don't go
there now. Just give her some space.

632
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,790
-Yeah, space. Totally. I know.
-Hey, do you know where Ryan is?

633
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,315
Because we had fun last night,
and I just thought--

634
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,988
Ryan's actually at school,
doing his physics homework.

635
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,195
School?

636
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,153
Y eah, I don't know. He's kind of
a dork now. Thanks.

637
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,592
She's agreed to supervised visitation.

638
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,233
Twenty minutes, max.

639
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,392
She's my daughter, Sandy.
I don't need to be supervised.

640
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,039
I'm supervising her.

641
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,156
I'm afraid she might kill you.

642
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,392
I'm sorry...

643
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,799
...about yesterday.

644
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,639
So that's it? No second thoughts?

645
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,111
-You're not gonna change your mind?
-It's what I have to do, Kiki...

646
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,714
...for Julie, to save our marriage.

647
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,194
Who's gonna save the company?

648
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,588
You.

649
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,239
That's why I'm appointing you
Newport Group's chief financial officer.

650
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,110
Because we all know whoever controls
the money controls the company.

651
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,713
Really? Does Julie know that?

652
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,478
She'll find out.

653
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,909
-I don't know.
-Come on, Kiki.

654
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,470
The company needs you.
The family needs you.

655
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,954
I need you.

656
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,871
Julie will get bored
after a day anyway...

657
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,033
...want to go to Cardio Barre,
Fashion lsland....

658
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,837
Do I get a raise?

659
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,873
So...

660
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,111
...I appreciate
what you're trying to do--

661
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,669
Lindsay. Lindsay, I'm reading here.

662
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,315
Take your time.

663
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,715
I just wanted to let you know
that you didn't do a bad job.

664
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,630
Your work isn't terrible either.

665
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,396
A little rushed, maybe.

666
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,152
So I've been thinking.

667
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,072
I owe you an apology.

668
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,996
Well, several, actually.

669
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,317
You have to actually say the words.

670
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,556
That's kind of how it works.

671
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,119
I would like to extend to you...

672
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,313
...a formal acknowledgement that l...

673
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,670
...may have unintentionally....

674
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,878
-I'm sorry.
-Me too. I'm sorry.

675
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,717
I'm sorry about the coffee
and the black eye and the tampons.

676
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,317
You can see why I thought
you were intellectually challenged, right?

677
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,956
I'm just....
I'm really glad that you're not.

678
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,676
Your penmanship, however--

679
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,233
Hey, what's wrong with it?

680
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,868
Nothing, just....

681
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,235
Next time don't hold the pen
between your toes.

682
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,437
Well, next time
don't spell "canceling" with two L's.

683
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,471
Yeah, that's wrong.
You wanna fix it?

684
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,320
I was using the Canadian spelling.

685
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,357
You're using
the Canadian spelling, eh?

686
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,396
Hi. I'm looking for Roberts,
table for two.

687
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,673
-We've got Roberts for three.
-Okay.

688
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,553
Thank you.

689
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,873
Hey.

690
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,313
Hey.

691
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,115
If someone would've told me
last year...

692
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,678
...that you and I'd be
the two loneliest people in Newport...

693
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,717
...I wouldn't have believed them.

694
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,599
Well...

695
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,511
...at least not the "you" part.
