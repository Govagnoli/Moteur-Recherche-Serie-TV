00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,229
<i>Previously on</i> The O. C:

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,551
My mom and I are getting kicked out.
I had to move into Summer's.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,910
This woman is the princess
of Orange County.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,672
I will find a way to use her.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,472
Welcome to Newport Union.
I'm Casey.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,392
- Nice to meet you, I'm...
- Johnny.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,595
Everyone calls me Chili.

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,876
That's gonna be a problem,
because I love you.

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,719
Marissa.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,190
- What's wrong? What did you do to her?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,794
- This is my...
- Boyfriend, I'm guessing. Hey.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,513
She's Taylor Townsend.
She's like the Karl Rove of our school.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,079
- Taylor Townsend.
- Taylor Townsend.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,912
Taylor Townsend.

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,438
- Don't touch her!
- Ryan!

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,875
Either of you ever set foot
near this school again...

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,109
...I call the police.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,350
- Where's all the cereal?
- Oh, I guess we're out.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,915
- There's no bagels?
- I thought we'd try something new.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,710
Mom, listen to me. I understand that
this whole cooking-with-Kirsten thing...

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,472
...is helping you keep focused...

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,235
...but you cannot preempt
a man's regularly scheduled breakfast.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,036
- It is a sacred routine.
- Sit.

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,037
You are having...

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,998
...eggs Benedict Gruyère
<i>avec pâtes du fruit.</i>

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,996
Something smells...

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,469
...fancy.

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,757
- Have a seat, there's plenty.
- No thanks. I'll just grab a bagel to go.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,638
Good luck with that.

30
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,714
Hello?

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,997
Oh, Dr. Kim, thanks so much
for getting back to me.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,351
Dr. Kim as in Principal Dr. Kim?

33
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,308
Oh, she's probably confirming our
reservation for the college fair tonight.

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,472
You know, you're gonna be exposed
to a lot of new things in college.

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,074
Yeah, horny coeds and alcohol poisoning.

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,437
I just don't think they're gonna have
French fusion on the menu.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,277
- They don't want me there, do they?
- No, Harbor's only hosting.

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,637
And it's a public event.
There is no reason why you can't attend.

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,189
So you boys meet us here,
we'll head over together.

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,588
Sounds good to me.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,630
- Hey, man, give me a ride to school.
- We'll hit the drive-through on the way.

42
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,549
- What's going on?
- Harbor's dean of discipline...

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,314
...is making it his personal crusade
to ruin Ryan's future.

44
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,232
He's attached a note to his transcript...

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,358
...detailing his pathologically
violent behavior.

46
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,434
Ryan certainly needs to work on his
self-control, but he's not pathological.

47
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,431
Considering everything
he's been through?

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,272
No one'll get a chance to consider it.

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,477
A letter like that is a red flag to colleges.

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,232
And unless it's rescinded...

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,358
...no way a reputable school
is gonna wanna touch a kid like Ryan.

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,109
What color do I want?

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,873
Come on.

54
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,270
Just go that...

55
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,799
Okay, you're, like, twice my height.

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,316
We can probably figure this out.
Why don't you just...

57
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,550
Like that. Right.

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,709
- Solved.
- I'm sorry.

59
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,677
You must be sick of me
being in your way.

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,829
Oh, are you kidding?

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,150
I date Cohen, okay?
My patience is infinite.

62
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,880
Having you in my space
makes me miss you less at school.

63
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,678
Well, I miss you guys too.

64
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,474
You know, we should all
do something tonight.

65
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,279
You know, I told Cohen
I'd go with him to that...

66
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,396
What is it called?
That college circus thing?

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,279
- Why don't you come with us?
- To Harbor? I think I'll pass.

68
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,396
It's not like you're on
the most wanted list.

69
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,074
- Have you checked the dean's office?
- Very funny.

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,120
Look, I'm not really thinking
big picture right now anyway.

71
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,669
I mean, college isn't even on my radar.

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,354
You're a senior in high school.
How could it not be?

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,069
Let's see, maybe because I'm homeless,
going to public school and totally broke.

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,949
And yet things could be worse.

75
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,873
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

76
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,508
Just checking on you.
How's everything going at Summer's?

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,194
Fine, but I'm kind of worried
I'm wearing out my welcome.

78
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,713
<i>Then I have some good news.</i>

79
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,077
Kirsten's turned me on to a promising
lead on some beachside property.

80
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,636
<i>So if you could just hang on</i>
<i>a little bit longer.</i>

81
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,837
- Sure, I guess.
- Great.

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,517
- Is everything okay, Mom?
- Oh, I'm fine, honey.

83
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,591
Okay, I mean, I've been better...

84
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,833
...but I have a plan,
and you have nothing to worry about.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,833
<i>We'll have lunch at the club</i>
<i>this week, okay? I'll call you.</i>

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,036
Okay, bye.

87
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,755
Hey, don't stress out, okay?

88
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,717
You can stay here as long as you want.

89
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,513
Thanks.

90
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,073
Excuse us, ma'am.

91
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,752
No problem.

92
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,675
Hey.

93
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,359
Look at her. All coy and texty.

94
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,873
I bet it's the dean, all like:

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,635
"Come over to my creepy apartment.
I'll give you a lesson in discipline."

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,109
Be afraid, Cohen.
Be very, very afraid.

97
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,078
If she isn't stopped, who knows
how far she'll take her agenda.

98
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,558
Well, she hijacked Social Chair. It's
not like world domination is inevitable.

99
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,438
Yeah, well, school domination is.

100
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,637
She's got Dean Hess in her back pocket,
front, who knows where else.

101
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,518
Look, I know <i>Us Weekly</i> is your bible...

102
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,638
...and believe me, I love a good scandal
as much as the next guy...

103
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,758
...but nothing is going on between
the dean and Taylor Townsend.

104
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,717
I saw what I saw, okay?

105
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,189
In a dark hallway,
in the middle of a rage blackout.

106
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,157
Isn't it possible you saw
what you wanted?

107
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,949
What...? No, no one chooses to witness
something that repellent.

108
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,433
I'd like to give her a side kick.

109
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,190
- Where are you going?
- Recon.

110
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,313
You sure this is a good idea?

111
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,391
Of course. I want you here.

112
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,754
Does anyone else?

113
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,956
Well, there's only one way to find out.

114
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,519
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

115
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,398
Hey.

116
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,433
- Is this Ryan?
- Yep.

117
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,068
Yeah, I see why
you didn't break up with him.

118
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,232
Chiseled jaw, deep, soulful eyes.
He's pretty.

119
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,630
You get struck by lightning,
I'll take care of your woman.

120
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,273
- I'm worried.
- You should be.

121
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,192
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

122
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,998
Sorry about the other day.
I lost my cool.

123
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,589
You see your girl talking to some guy
you don't know...

124
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,398
...it could happen to anyone.

125
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,716
- So you guys wanna sit with us?
- Sure. Thanks.

126
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,279
Cool.

127
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,193
So you blowing off school today?

128
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,557
No, actually, I'm doing
a homeschool thing for a while.

129
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,597
I thought that was for, like, Christians.

130
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,955
And for people who punch
the dean at their school.

131
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,439
- You did that?
- Yeah.

132
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,239
I wish I could homeschool.
I can't wait to get out of here.

133
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,231
Though Newport
beats the hell out of Brea.

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,470
You're from Brea?
Where'd you go to school?

135
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,631
- Arovista.
- Chino Hills.

136
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,631
Come on, Marissa.
Let's get frozen yogurt.

137
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,916
- Okay. Ryan, you want anything?
- I'm good.

138
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,231
- Dennis, you like frozen yogurt.
- Okay, yeah, I love frozen yogurt.

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,470
- Come on, you can hold our tray for us.
- Okay.

140
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,916
Trust me, the faster they become
friends, the better off you are.

141
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,992
We used to kick your ass
at football.

142
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,196
- I know, I used to play safety.
- Quarterback.

143
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,679
Really? What year?

144
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,636
Okay, at first I thought it was cute...

145
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,872
...you following me,
obsessing over me...

146
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,157
...but the <i>Single White Female</i> thing
is so mid-90s.

147
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,756
- And it never ends well for the ugly one.
- Could you be more full of yourself?

148
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,354
I have better things to do
than follow your ass around.

149
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,115
Okay, I know it must be hard going from
prom queen to the invisible woman...

150
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,236
...but what are you trying to prove?

151
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,630
That you're not just pathetic,
you're also crazy?

152
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,030
Oh, you want crazy?
Oh, I will show you crazy.

153
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,075
Okay, you might wanna rethink
threatening me.

154
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,390
If you haven't noticed,
I'm close with Dean Hess.

155
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,993
Oh, no, I've noticed.

156
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,434
Well, you know, Dean Hess,
he isn't exactly discreet.

157
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,671
- Okay, what does that mean?
- Never mind.

158
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,877
I've been trying to erase this image
from my brain, like, all day.

159
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,508
Unfortunately, I think it's gonna take
serious therapy.

160
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,389
- What image?
- Nothing. l...

161
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,630
Dean Hess could get in,
like, a lot of trouble.

162
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,360
I think it's, like,
sexual harassment or something.

163
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,598
What is?

164
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,478
Kissing.

165
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,829
Ms. Applebaum, yeah.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,992
The volleyball coach with the toned arms
and the legs for miles.

167
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,833
I saw them behind the gym bleachers
this morning.

168
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,869
- Okay, you're totally lying.
- I wish.

169
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,874
The look on Ms. Applebaum's face is,
like, permanently burned into my retinas.

170
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,952
God. Pure carnal satisfaction.

171
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,473
Yeah.

172
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,280
Sorry. I guess I gotta go.

173
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,590
You have a super day.

174
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,834
I was going this way.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,436
- So, what do you think?
- Aren't condos for old people?

176
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,711
These units were conceived
for professionals.

177
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,553
- Single, divorced executive types.
- How much are we talking?

178
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,154
Since I know the developer,
10 percent gets you in...

179
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,198
...the rest you can finance.
- Ten percent?

180
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,794
Julie, it's a really good investment.

181
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,712
If you need help with
the down payment...

182
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,314
I'm not destitute, Kirsten,
I'm discerning.

183
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,750
So should I make a call,
set up a walk-through?

184
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,275
Why not?

185
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,037
Wonder who that is.

186
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,634
- Hi.
- Hi.

187
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,950
I thought you might
wanna join me for a bite.

188
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,111
Oh, it's good of you to stop by.

189
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,636
- Sorry, I didn't realize you had company.
- No. Charlotte, this is Julie.

190
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,360
- Julie, this is Charlotte.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

191
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,509
We met at Suriak.

192
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,557
- Oh, are you a doctor?
- Patient.

193
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,029
I have an appointment
I have to be getting to...

194
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,430
...so call me when you hear
from your friend.

195
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,639
On my cell.
My hotel is terrible about messages.

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,156
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

197
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,229
Okay, clearly I have got to learn
how to call ahead.

198
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,550
I'm sorry. I hope I didn't
scare your friend away.

199
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,280
Oh, it would take a lot more
than that to scare Julie.

200
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,919
She was married to my dad.

201
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,435
That would explain
the size of the rock on her finger.

202
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,431
Well, he didn't leave her much else.

203
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,513
<i>"Newport Point Condominiums."</i>

204
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,989
It's not the Taj Mahal,
but it'll be a good place...

205
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,628
...for her and her daughter.
Can I get you some salad?

206
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,835
We have plenty left.

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,468
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'm starving. Thanks.

208
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,829
So your dad left her with nothing?

209
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,077
She must be feeling
really vulnerable now.

210
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,151
I'm glad you came by.

211
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,716
Come on, Coop. Ryan's going.

212
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,917
Yeah, and I'm sure he'll have
a great time with you and Seth.

213
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,872
Look, it's not because it's Harbor.
And it's not because it's college.

214
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,600
- I just have a lot of homework.
- Yeah, sure, homework.

215
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,478
What, you want me to focus
on my future?

216
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,996
Well, guess what? Tomorrow I have
a trig exam that I'm totally gonna fail.

217
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,990
Okay. Sure.
I'll just tell everyone you said hi.

218
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,833
- Okay.
- Okay. Enjoy.

219
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,197
- I'll be fine.
- Later.

220
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,909
Ivy League. Big Ten. Pac-10.

221
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,197
College fairs are like shopping.
It's all about brand recognition.

222
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,875
You know Princeton was originally called
the College of New Jersey?

223
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,951
How hard would it be
to get into that school?

224
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,553
Well, why don't you ask them?

225
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,870
Why not, indeed?

226
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,595
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, fine.

227
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,478
Just a little weird being back here.

228
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,391
I feel like a fugitive.

229
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,516
You have as much right to be here
as anyone.

230
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,394
- So where do you wanna start?
- I really don't know.

231
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,829
I hear Berkeley's an excellent choice.

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,752
Very pretty girls too.

233
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,036
Oh, and there's the UC sign.

234
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,270
- Sounds good?
- Sure.

235
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,396
So all these schools
are in the Northeast.

236
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,516
- Yeah, so?
- So?

237
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,750
Just a little something
I like to call winter.

238
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,595
God, your bony ass can't even take it
when Newport drops to 70.

239
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,469
- Oh, my God, wait.
- What?

240
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,355
Busted.

241
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,510
Now do you believe me?
That is a couple fight.

242
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,753
Or Dean Hess told Taylor her chances
are better at Cornell than Dartmouth.

243
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,558
You still don't believe me?

244
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,073
No, I'm just saying, look...

245
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,471
...an on-campus argument in front of
the students, faculty and parents...

246
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,153
...is not proof of a relationship.

247
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,029
- Okay, I'm gonna go get you proof.
- What?

248
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,750
- What are you interested in studying?
- I'm not totally sure.

249
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,152
Ryan's strong in math and physics.

250
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,788
And he's shown a real aptitude
for building and drafting.

251
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,793
- Architecture? Got a great program.
- Maybe, yeah.

252
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,757
- It's good to see you.
- Great.

253
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,954
I'll be right back.

254
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,719
That looks good.

255
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,918
What is Atwood doing here?
He's not to set foot on this campus.

256
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,638
I cleared it with Principal Kim.

257
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,792
You can keep him from enrolling here,
but not from a public event.

258
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,229
I'm calling security.

259
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,279
Unless you have a court-ordered injunction
against my son, keep your hands off him.

260
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,557
Fine, he can stay.
But it's a waste of time.

261
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,790
None of these schools
will even admit him.

262
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,837
Because of the letter
you attached to his file.

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,230
Maybe he'll think
about assaulting his next victim.

264
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,311
He made a mistake,
and he should pay for it.

265
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,914
But should the price really be his future?

266
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,508
You're killing his one shot.

267
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,993
No.

268
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,354
He did that all by himself.

269
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,553
Morning, buddy.
Got up early, put on a pot of regular.

270
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,909
Ryan?

271
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,558
Ryan?

272
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,754
Oh, no.

273
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,672
Oh, man.

274
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,833
Ryan, you're here.

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,558
Where else would I be?

276
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,598
Well, after last night, I thought
you might have gone Greyhound...

277
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,469
...but clearly my concern
was unfounded because you're fine.

278
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,438
Sure. I mean, no one in my family
even got through high school.

279
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,797
Two years ago the thought of college
never even crossed my mind.

280
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,190
- It was never where I was headed.
- Yeah, okay.

281
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,033
Where are you headed right now?
A field trip with your tutor?

282
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,475
I canceled. If anyone asks,
I'm at the library.

283
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,755
Good. That's a good idea.

284
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,388
You take a day, clear your head
with independent study.

285
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,710
My head is clear.
The tutor's not coming back.

286
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,519
- I'm done with school.
- You're dropping out?

287
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,038
- And then what?
- I don't know yet. Okay.

288
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,714
Well, that's a smart move.
Have you told my parents?

289
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,836
Have you told Mariss...?
That's fine.

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,434
High school's... It's overrated.
I'm sure you'll do fine.

291
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,638
Ryan, you can't just drop out of school.
It's only gonna make things worse.

292
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,953
I gotta get to class, okay?

293
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,350
Please, let's just talk after. Bye.

294
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,590
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, great.

295
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,751
- My boyfriend's quitting school.
- Why?

296
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,673
He doesn't think he can
get into college, so he's giving up.

297
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,752
Seems like a smart kid,
I'm sure he'll be all right.

298
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,592
This time, I'm not so sure.

299
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,877
- His family is kind of screwed up.
- Whose isn't?

300
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,713
Okay, true,
but Ryan's is really screwed up.

301
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,189
He's got a chance to be different,
if he'd take it.

302
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,033
- Have you told him that?
- I don't think he'll listen to me.

303
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,668
In fact, I don't know who he'll listen to.

304
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,556
What is that thing?

305
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,076
- Miss Morgan?
- No.

306
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,037
Julie Cooper-Nichol.

307
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,873
Oh, right. Kirsten Cohen's referral.

308
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,190
The door was open,
so I thought I'd take a peek.

309
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,636
Gave me a chance to really visualize
myself in the place.

310
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,156
- I'll take it.
- Beg your pardon?

311
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,995
I brought the down payment with me.
I'm assuming cash is okay.

312
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,673
- Miss Cooper...
- Cooper-Nichol.

313
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,071
I think we have a misunderstanding.
You see, when we spoke this morning...

314
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,358
...I was under the impression
that this unit wasn't right for you.

315
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,795
- I beg your pardon?
- This is a four-bedroom.

316
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,157
The one that we talked about
is a two-bedroom in the garden.

317
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,389
Garden?

318
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,516
Realtor speak for "basement," right?

319
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,513
- Hello.
- You must be Miss Morgan.

320
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,159
- Yes. Hi.
- Hi.

321
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,878
Julie, right?

322
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,553
Hi. What are you doing here?

323
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,428
I might ask the same thing.

324
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,388
I'm doing business in the area, and I
heard this condo might be a perfect pad.

325
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,916
- But looks like you beat me to it.
- Actually, your timing is perfect.

326
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,469
Sorry, I'm looking for something
with a better view.

327
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,234
Charlotte, the place is all yours.

328
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,832
Well, follow me, Miss Morgan.
We'll start with the master.

329
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,673
Hey, where you been?
I've been looking for you all day.

330
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,955
I've been avoiding you.

331
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,997
Just because I don't buy into
your whole...

332
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,469
...Taylor and the dean
forbidden-Iove delusion?

333
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,433
Can we table that. We have
a bigger problem to worry about.

334
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,160
Ryan quitting school?
I know, Marissa told me.

335
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,357
- We should do something.
- Why do you think I'm writing this letter?

336
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,112
A petition? That's a good idea.

337
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,511
No, it's not a petition, dumb-ass.
I'm begging for Taylor's forgiveness.

338
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,150
You had me, and then you...
I think you lost me.

339
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,472
Okay, if Taylor thinks that Dean Hess
is sorry, maybe they'll get back together.

340
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,677
And then we can expose them
and use that to get Ryan back in school.

341
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,359
No, no, l... I understand.

342
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,751
Can...? Can I call you right back?

343
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,399
Thanks.

344
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,990
- What's going on?
- That was Ryan's tutor.

345
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,397
- Calling for her final paycheck.
- What?

346
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,154
Ryan told her that he would
no longer be needing her...

347
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,231
...since he won't be
finishing high school.

348
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,268
- Where's Ryan now?
- Seth said he was at the library.

349
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,590
One kid dropping out of school,
the other lying.

350
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,910
And I thought today
was gonna be boring.

351
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,078
Hey, man.

352
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,033
- Hey, Johnny.
- Marissa said they had the best burgers.

353
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,590
- Figured I should check it out for myself.
- They are. Come on in.

354
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,113
So she told you what's going on.

355
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,194
Might have mentioned it.

356
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,675
Well, no offense,
but you barely know me.

357
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,110
Which is why I'm not here
to talk you into anything.

358
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,793
I mean, I'm not going to college.

359
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,834
Figured I'd do all right
in a few surf competitions...

360
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,629
...maybe hook up with some sponsors,
turn that into a career, you know?

361
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,870
It's a simple plan, but...

362
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,234
Better than what I got.

363
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,633
Thought I'd get a job,
figure things out after I make money.

364
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,954
- What kind of job?
- Did construction last summer.

365
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,588
Hours were long, but I liked the work.

366
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,995
My uncle has this
commercial fishing operation.

367
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,636
He's always looking for new guys.

368
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,916
I mean, it's brutal,
but you can't beat the pay.

369
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,277
- Think he'd give me a shot?
- lf you want, I'll take you down there.

370
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,754
He could be off
joining the Foreign Legion...

371
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,797
...joining a cult.

372
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,152
Ryan could be...

373
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,470
He could be taking place
in a mass marriage...

374
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,200
...drinking Kool-Aid
from brand-new sneakers.

375
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,957
- So many sick things.
- I'm gonna try his cell again.

376
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,033
- Hey.
- Ryan.

377
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,519
Dude, where were you?

378
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,035
- We were about to sound an AMBER Alert.
- I'm sorry.

379
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,952
I know you've had a rough 24 hours...

380
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,953
...and I am a firm believer
that every man deserves his space.

381
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,236
- You can't go off like that.
- Won't happen again.

382
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,198
Lucky for you I was able to do
damage control with your tutor.

383
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,794
She's agreed to come to make up
for what you missed.

384
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,758
Oh, I appreciate that, but...

385
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,912
What's this?

386
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,953
It's a guardian release form.

387
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,633
I got a job.

388
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,554
On a boat.

389
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,199
You mean a cruise ship?
You don't really seem like the type.

390
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,994
This is a joke, right?

391
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,679
These boats go out for weeks at a time.

392
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,595
- You're not of age.
- That's why I need your signature.

393
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,354
You wanna throw away your future
to work on a fishing boat?

394
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,353
My future's already trashed.
I tried it your way. It didn't work.

395
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,272
- You have to keep trying.
- No, I don't.

396
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,557
I have been trying...

397
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,758
...and I appreciate everything
you've done for me, I really do...

398
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,639
...but I need to make my own decisions.

399
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,073
And I'm asking you to let me go.

400
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,229
- Sandy.
- Dad.

401
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,951
Come up here and help George
on the deck.

402
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,951
Check the icemaker.
Put the Freon in there.

403
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,953
We lose any in the next haul,
it's coming out of your paychecks.

404
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,031
- Mr. Harper?
- Yeah.

405
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,395
Ryan Atwood, from yesterday.

406
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,352
- Yeah, Johnny's friend, right?
- Yeah.

407
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,714
Hold this.

408
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,440
Look, kid, we don't need
part-timers right now.

409
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,750
Check back next summer.
Give me a kneel, somebody.

410
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,754
About that, I got the... I got
the signature. I can... I can do full-time.

411
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,469
You know,
this isn't putting bait on hooks.

412
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,629
It's hard work.

413
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,234
You mess up out there,
you don't get fired, you get hurt.

414
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,437
I worked construction, I can handle it.
I'd appreciate the chance.

415
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,511
Yeah, that's because
you don't know better.

416
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,238
All right, we got a spot open on
the <i>Gale.</i> We're prepping her now.

417
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,039
- Great, how long's she gonna be out?
- Depends on the action.

418
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,397
My guess, about three weeks.
She shoves off tomorrow at sunset.

419
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,232
- You got a problem with that?
- No, sir.

420
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,674
- Just got some loose ends to tie up.
- Yeah, don't we all.

421
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,592
All right, don't be late.

422
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,034
Hey.

423
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,668
Oh, hey. How was surfing?

424
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,116
Pretty calm.
Had time to do some soul-searching.

425
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,829
- You gonna talk to him?
- I'm sticking with our plan.

426
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,992
Your plan. Sandy, he's leaving
on a boat tomorrow.

427
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,199
- This is the wrong time to be stubborn.
- Honey, I'm stubborn all the time.

428
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,430
We can't force Ryan
to make the right choice.

429
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,955
But we can stop him
from making a horrible mistake.

430
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,111
From permanently knocking
his life off course.

431
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,794
Yeah, it's a course we set for him.

432
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,155
Would you let Seth do this?

433
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,600
- We kind of did.
- No. No, that was different.

434
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,958
It was summer, he didn't miss school and
it was Seth, we knew he'd come back.

435
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,997
You know, in Ryan's position,
at his age...

436
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,037
...I can't say I wouldn't do
the same thing.

437
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,189
I left home at 17.

438
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,157
To start your life,
not throw it away.

439
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,517
Ryan doesn't want this.
He'll come around.

440
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,352
But we gotta let him
get there on his own.

441
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,192
And what if he doesn't?

442
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,073
- Hey.
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

443
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,310
Have you seen Ryan?
He hasn't returned my calls.

444
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,472
- Oh, he should be home soon.
- This thing has really gotten to him.

445
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,598
I think the best thing we can do
is support him, no matter what.

446
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,512
You wanna throw him
a going-away dinner?

447
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,594
- Well, that's not a bad idea.
- Wait, where's he going?

448
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,870
"You are like a warm breeze
blowing down Van Nuys Boulevard.

449
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,793
From Encino to Reseda,
there is nothing as beautiful as you.

450
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,871
Your eyes are as blue
as a smogless day..."

451
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,996
- What the hell is that?
- Well, I lifted it...

452
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,878
...from the season finale
of <i>The Valley.</i>

453
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,315
When Manuel was busting
a move on April and she found out...

454
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,835
...Jake was sleeping with her mom.
- Riveting stuff.

455
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,632
Yeah. Will you proof it for me?

456
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,633
We have to act fast. Ryan's
a yellow slicker and a beard away...

457
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,677
...from becoming
the Gorton's fisherman.

458
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,957
- Not getting the reference.
- He got a job on a boat, leaves tomorrow.

459
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,317
Wait, what? Wait, are you serious?
Your dad's just, like, letting him go?

460
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,675
Pulling the old Sandy Cohen
Jedi mind-meld on him.

461
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,513
- Trying to break his will by agreeing.
- Like he did with you?

462
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,989
Which you fell for because
you're spineless and weak.

463
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,639
Yes, exactly, but this is Ryan.

464
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,270
So if Taylor's gonna fall for your plan,
we need a language she'll understand.

465
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,715
Are you trying to say
that you believe me?

466
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,310
No, not exactly. There's no other
options. Do you have her phone number?

467
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,040
We're not gonna call her.
She's not a moron, she's evil.

468
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,634
We're not gonna call her,
we're going to text her.

469
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,439
- What is that?
- Or, should I say, Dean Hess is.

470
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,556
- You got the bedazzled one? Pink too?
- Yeah.

471
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,393
We can't text her an apology.
We're texting her an apology?

472
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,149
An invitation.
I got a room at the Mermaid Motel.

473
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,834
The place where Ryan may have
conceived Theresa's baby...

474
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,991
...and where Marissa's mom
and Luke got it on?

475
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,832
Newport's very own den of sin.

476
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,998
- But I like it.
- We can even...

477
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,957
I mean, if we have some free time...

478
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,789
Whatever.

479
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,430
Hope you don't mind.
I'm early for your party.

480
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,589
My what?

481
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,354
Well, Sandy and Kirsten wanna
have a send-off party for you.

482
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,556
Since, apparently, you're leaving.

483
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,676
- I was gonna tell you.
- It slipped your mind?

484
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,398
No.

485
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,235
I was waiting for the right time...

486
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,713
...since I thought
you might not understand.

487
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,194
Understand what?

488
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,113
- That you're becoming a fisherman?
- It's not about the job.

489
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,795
- I need to make a change.
- A change.

490
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,149
No, not from us.

491
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,153
Right. You taking off for weeks at a time
won't change us at all.

492
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,232
It's not forever, it's...

493
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,152
- It's just until...
- Until when?

494
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,512
The dean lets you back into Harbor?
Because that may never happen.

495
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,553
- I need you to understand.
- Consider it understood.

496
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,316
- You sure about this Julie Cooper?
- Definitely.

497
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,153
She's got all the right connections
and nothing left to lose.

498
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,753
I hope so. You better be right.

499
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,876
I know what I'm doing, babe.

500
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,632
Damn it.

501
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,590
- Hi.
- What the hell are you doing here?

502
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,320
I hope you don't mind.
I got your address from the realtor.

503
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,879
Are you stalking me?

504
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,156
No, but I can see
why you would think that.

505
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,198
- Can I come in?
- You really don't want to. And no.

506
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,471
Okay, well, l...
I have some good news.

507
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,870
- I got the condo.
- Oh, well, I'm happy for you.

508
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,832
- Adios.
- I put it in your name.

509
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,110
- Say what now?
- I bought it for you.

510
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,114
You bought me a condo?

511
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,233
Kirsten filled me in on your situation.

512
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,916
- It moved me.
- It moved me too.

513
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,718
Right into this fleabag hellhole.

514
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,274
Nonetheless, a long time ago I learned
there is no such thing as a free lunch.

515
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,750
- Or condo.
- Julie, I don't want anything from you.

516
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,799
I swear. Except the use
of the spare room when I'm in town...

517
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,951
...which should only be
a couple weeks a year.

518
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,951
Other than that, it's all yours.

519
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,949
You're serious?

520
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,549
I know what it's like
to fall on hard times.

521
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,792
No one else has to know about our
arrangement. This can just be our secret.

522
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,879
You realize, Ryan,
of all our harebrained schemes...

523
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,077
...of which there are many,
quitting school for a life at sea...

524
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,468
...that may be number one.

525
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,393
I can't say the idea has gotten
an enthusiastic response.

526
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,710
Except from your dad,
who's throwing me a dinner.

527
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,757
- He's calling your bluff.
- I'm not bluffing.

528
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,229
- Didn't say it was working.
- I think he's hoping to...

529
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,597
...give me enough rope to hang myself.
- You've fashioned said rope...

530
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,389
...into a perfect little sailor's knot.
- Well, it's the best option I got.

531
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,194
If Harbor let you back in,
would that change your mind?

532
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,237
- Never gonna happen.
- Never say never.

533
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,073
- I may have a plan in motion.
- I feel a lot better.

534
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,356
Let's just get this over with.

535
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,272
Let's just get this over with.

536
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,159
We got all dressed up,
and you decided to come to this thing.

537
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,311
- You might as well make the best of it.
- How?

538
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,516
I don't know,
but at the same time tomorrow...

539
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,912
...Atwood is gonna be netting sea bass
with rank fishermen in wool sweaters.

540
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,833
Yeah, well, this could be
the last time I see him for a while.

541
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,355
Where he doesn't smell
like pickled herring.

542
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,594
All right. I'll try.

543
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,550
Honey, this homemade pad thai,
it's delicious.

544
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,756
Keep this up,
we'll save a bundle on takeout.

545
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,911
Oh, thank you. I hope everybody likes it.

546
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,752
I used tofu instead of shrimp.

547
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,992
It's fine by me. I think I've kind of
gone off of seafood for a while.

548
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,357
I for one, I love the tofu.

549
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,909
Tofuna. Tofurky.

550
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,548
To-bagel with cream to-cheese.

551
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,270
- Too much.
- It was a valiant effort.

552
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,551
So tell us about the captain.

553
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,028
Well, he's pretty much
what you'd expect.

554
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,636
Oh, what's that? Eye patch, peg leg?
Parrot on his shoulder?

555
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,110
I love parrots. I think they're cute.

556
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,953
You know, "Polly want a cracker?"

557
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,269
Yeah. Sorry.

558
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,753
Actually, the captain's Johnny's uncle.
That's how I met him.

559
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,911
Johnny got you the job?

560
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,835
Unbelievable.

561
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,635
You know what? I think I'm just ruining
everyone's dinner, so I'm gonna go.

562
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,392
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no. Sit down.

563
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,993
You're not ruining anything.

564
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,118
Well, maybe a little.
But it's completely understandable.

565
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,875
Well, I'm glad something around here is.
Summer, can I have the keys?

566
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,750
- Thanks for dinner, Sandy. Kirsten.
- Excuse me.

567
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,115
Summer, your purse is buzzing.

568
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,352
Taylor took the bait.

569
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,590
Marissa. Hey, wait,
can we talk about this?

570
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,479
What's there to talk about?
You've already made your decision.

571
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,153
- I don't wanna leave like this.
- Then don't leave.

572
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,239
All right. Well, then I guess
we don't have a choice.

573
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,279
- Need any help?
- I'm good, thanks.

574
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,510
At this point I'm pretty good
at packing light.

575
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,319
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

576
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,232
You've beaten
the Sandy Cohen mind-meld.

577
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,833
I was hoping if we gave you space...

578
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,275
...you'd realize this isn't the answer
to your problem.

579
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,351
Maybe my problem
doesn't have an answer.

580
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,273
Sure it does. If you keep
out of trouble until you graduate...

581
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,112
...you'll land at a community college.

582
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,510
Yeah, post a couple of semesters
of good work...

583
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,352
...you transfer to a four-year school.

584
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,590
If you come from my family,
it's not so easy.

585
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,793
We're your family now.

586
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,276
I may not be an Atwood anymore,
but I'm not a Cohen either.

587
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,513
I don't know what I am.

588
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,311
So you're gonna figure it out lost at sea?

589
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,994
Lost at sea, lost on land.
What's the difference, right?

590
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,078
Well, kid, we can't force you to stay.

591
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,952
But this is your home now.

592
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,394
And the door is always open.

593
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,110
Thank you. I'm gonna head out.

594
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,077
See you in a couple weeks.

595
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,035
Marissa, what's going on?

596
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,350
Hey, I wanted to talk about
that job you got Ryan.

597
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,715
- I'm glad I could help.
- How, by ruining his life?

598
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,108
I'm gonna go out
into the ocean far away.

599
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,069
I'm a little confused.

600
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,793
I mean, Ryan needed a job, I got him
one. I thought I was helping him out.

601
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,354
I know. I shouldn't be blaming you.

602
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,080
It was his decision,
it's just now he's leaving.

603
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,112
I take it it wasn't a happy sendoff.

604
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,708
We got in a fight.

605
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,280
Well, at least you got to be
honest with him.

606
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,193
Tell him how you felt.

607
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,793
Actually, I didn't.

608
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,514
- And I don't even know where he is.
- I do.

609
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,117
Home sweet home.

610
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,117
Wow, gift horse, mouth,
far be it for me to do any looking.

611
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,793
I don't know what to say.
Thank you?

612
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,679
Don't say anything. It makes me
feel great to be able to help.

613
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,319
Though the place needs furniture.

614
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,755
I can cover that.
I have a little money stashed away.

615
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,593
I bet pawning that ring
brought in a small fortune.

616
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,873
- How about a little champagne?
- Aren't you just out of rehab?

617
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,072
All right, for you. I'll have water.

618
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,676
I will open this, I'll meet you out there.
If you can find some glasses.

619
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,512
My pleasure.

620
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,829
She's in.

621
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,199
- Any extra ones?
- All right.

622
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,913
I will. We will.

623
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,911
- All right.
- All right, have a great trip.

624
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,832
- How you doing?
- Get all this below deck.

625
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,479
All right. Let's go.

626
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,234
- Is everything onboard?
- No.

627
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,232
Ryan?

628
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,471
Marissa, what are you doing here?

629
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,677
I couldn't let you leave
without telling you how I really felt.

630
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,029
Okay.

631
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,668
You see, I couldn't figure out why
I was so mad at you...

632
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,798
...and then I realized it's because
you're doing what my dad did.

633
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,549
He left and ran away on a boat,
and now you are too...

634
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,678
...so I guess that makes you
just as much of a coward as he is.

635
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,478
And you know what, running away
never really helped him at all.

636
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,117
What if this is the bed
that Julie and Luke had sex in?

637
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,919
- A boy can dream.
- Will you quit peeping out the window?

638
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,469
You don't peep out of windows.
You peep into them.

639
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,319
You'd know.

640
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,956
Taylor. She's coming.

641
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,428
Hey, skank.

642
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,717
You were expecting someone taller,
blonder, with a pageboy haircut?

643
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,791
Welcome to the Terrordome, Townsend.

644
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,758
- You're busted.
- For what, exactly?

645
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,113
A little extracurricular activity
with Dean Hess.

646
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,510
Yeah, I saw you two
making out at the dance.

647
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,395
So what if we did?

648
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,797
She'd make a hell of a poker player.

649
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,633
- Unless you want this little thingamajig...
- Indiscretion.

650
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,358
...to go public...
- What up?

651
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,273
...we have a few demands, don't we?
- Yeah.

652
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,159
Starting with lifting the ban
of Ryan Atwood from Harbor.

653
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,039
You can go ahead
and tell anyone you want.

654
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,394
No one's gonna believe you.

655
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,308
She's like a block of ice.

656
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,109
You willing to bet your squeaky
little reputation on that, Taylor Trash?

657
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,151
Because I've got a huge mouth
and an even bigger Buddy List.

658
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,876
See this right here? Sidekick.

659
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,712
Walkie-talkie of the 21 st century.

660
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,030
- Who should we radio first?
- How about my dad?

661
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,555
Yeah, ten-four, good buddy.
So, what's it gonna be?

662
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,951
You can either tell Seth's dad
the perverted truth and save your ass...

663
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,031
...or you can roll the dice.

664
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,589
Over and out.

665
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,630
- Sandy, come on in.
- Thanks for meeting me on a Sunday.

666
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,351
I take it from the surreptitious nature
of your phone call...

667
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,351
...you have something serious
to discuss.

668
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,954
Surreptitious. Good word.
No wonder they made you dean.

669
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,668
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

670
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,389
Do you classify a surreptitious
student-teacher relationship as serious?

671
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,033
If you're here to make an accusation,
Sandy, then please feel free.

672
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,872
It's just the two of us, we can talk.

673
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,314
Man-to-man.

674
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,235
Why talk when a picture's worth
a thousand words.

675
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,231
Or a hefty lawsuit.

676
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,233
Sorry, I'm not following.

677
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,996
Technology's a bitch, dean.

678
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,832
I have a hard time keeping up with it.

679
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,309
This little puppy's a phone,
it surfs the web...

680
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,916
...and, unfortunately for you,
it transmits photos.

681
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,677
Hard to send a picture of something
that never happened.

682
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,515
So you're saying you didn't get too close
to a coed at the school dance?

683
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,952
And these photos I have are fakes?

684
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,150
She's an aggressive girl.
She had a schoolgirl crush...

685
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,312
...and at the dance,
she forced herself on me.

686
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,198
And it was just a kiss.

687
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,635
I don't think the board
will see this as just a kiss.

688
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,916
Plus, it's not what the girl is saying.

689
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,233
- You talked to her?
- Yep.

690
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,914
She told me everything.
She doesn't want this to get out.

691
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,436
And I assume you don't either, because
this could be a real career killer...

692
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,318
...and you seem to be an ambitious guy.

693
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,110
- What do you want, Sandy?
- You kicked Ryan out of this school.

694
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,829
I want you to let him back in
with a clean slate.

695
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,280
I suggest you get yourself
one of these...

696
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,989
...get on craigslist and find yourself
another position on the East Coast.

697
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,388
Sound good to you?

698
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,152
I didn't know her.

699
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,718
- Mocha?
- Yeah, thanks.

700
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,314
- Skimmed? Regular?
- Regular.

701
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,516
I got into my car when
the cell phone went...

702
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,993
- Coop, are you okay?
- Ryan left.

703
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,793
- He's gone?
- Wait, what?

704
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,509
We just pulled off a life-changing scam.
Are you telling me we're too late?

705
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,396
- What are you talking about?
- Well, it doesn't matter now.

706
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,911
Well, this sucks.

707
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,279
Hey, it's the return of
the not-so-ancient mariner.

708
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,519
Ryan.

709
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,398
Look...

710
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,709
...I don't know what my future is...

711
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,633
...but I know it's with you.

712
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,714
Here.

713
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,436
Not on some boat
in the middle of the ocean.

714
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,274
I love that.

715
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,678
Hey, I got good news for you.

716
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,990
Well, I have good news,
and I have some bad news.

717
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,152
- Yeah, what's the good news?
- Good news is, you're back at Harbor.

718
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,240
- Really?
- My dad bluffed the dean and he caved.

719
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,473
- And the bad news?
- Well, you're back at Harbor, so...

720
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,677
And...?

721
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,790
Oh, you know what,
don't worry about it.

722
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,269
My getting kicked out
was backed up by the community.

723
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,839
With you, it was just the dean.

724
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,719
Besides, public school isn't that bad.
This is good news.

725
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,233
- I think so.
- Yeah, she's right.

726
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,073
You know, we gotta take our victories
as they come.

727
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,189
I have to say, Ryan Atwood, fisherman,
I think that's a good cheer for you.

728
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,033
- Yeah, you like that?
- I came up with some other jobs for you.

729
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,509
But I should warn you,
they're pretty wacky.

730
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,999
- Okay. All right.
- Okay?

731
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,752
Ryan Atwood, bullfighter.

732
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,639
Big hat, like, tight pants
and a little red coat.

733
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,916
- But I don't speak Spanish.
- Neither do bulls.

734
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,230
- Ryan Atwood, bounty hunter.
- Yeah.

735
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,756
Then you could have, like, a crossbow
and steel-toed boots. You like those.

736
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,797
What do you think of
Ryan Atwood, coward?

737
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,757
- That may have been harsh.
- You think so?

738
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,151
- It got your attention.
- Ryan Atwood, fluffer.

739
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,833
- Fluffer?
- Fluff what?

740
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,468
- Let's not ask that.
- I'm gonna explain it later.

741
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,911
