1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,196
-Previously on The O. C. :
-You married me...

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,198
... because I was pregnant.
I married you because I loved you.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,595
I've worked with him side-by-side
all this time.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,190
How could I have not known he was
bribing this woman from city council?

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,868
I spoke with Renee Wheeler.
I know about the affair.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,517
Sixteen years is a long time to be paying
palimony. Unless there was a child.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,474
I'm talking too much. I get nervous,
start talking, and nothing shuts me up.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,949
If you came to the judge
with documentation...

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,515
-...the DA would drop the charges.
-Mom.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,954
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,196
What is the point of living in Southern
California if it's gonna be this cold?

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,238
Fifty degrees in December, Cal.
That ain't cold.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,868
Well, my blood
must have gotten thinner.

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,156
Or you got ice in your veins.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,029
This time next year...

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,552
...I could be spending the holidays
behind bars.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,631
Now, that gives me a chill.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,155
Don't know how you feel about it.

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,393
Warm and fuzzy. How do you think
it makes me feel, Sandy?

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,473
What the hell else can I do?

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,234
You can come forward.
Trial's right around the corner.

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,951
Renee's gonna plead the Fifth,
and when she does, you're sunk.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,918
Unless you tell the truth.

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,800
I can't. You know I can't.

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,269
-What about the child?
-Which child?

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,271
Lindsay?

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,113
How do you know her name?

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,759
Yeah.

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,559
-What happens to her?
-Spare me.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,349
You're not trying to protect Lindsay.
You're trying to protect yourself...

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,349
...because you know once you come
clean, you'll get what's coming to you.

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,397
But facing Kirsten and Julie
has got to be better than going to jail.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,156
Kirsten, maybe.

34
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,197
Not Julie.

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,796
Well, then this is it.

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,190
I'm done, and so are you.

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,316
Happy holidays.

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,438
Mother? Did you not clean out
last year's menorah?

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,636
This shammash
is looking a little bit waxy.

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,071
-Seth, sorry. I'll get right on that.
-A little help here, please?

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,515
Thanks, Mom.
We can't afford to cut any corners.

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,077
If my sense of the cultural Zeitgeist
is accurate, and I do believe it is...

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,716
...this year, Chrismukkah sweeps
the nation, okay, people?

44
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,474
Ryan, it's so nice to have someone
to help around the house.

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,475
You're right, it is, which is why I've
created a Chrismukkah work wheel...

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,359
...so that everybody understands
his or her holiday duties.

47
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,796
-You're kidding.
-Does it look like it?

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,355
-Let me guess your job.
-I'm supervising, smartass.

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,109
-Well, that's big of you.
-I'm also overseeing merchandising.

50
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,554
T -shirts, mugs, and...

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,996
...I'm penning a Chrismukkah hymn
set to Death Cab's "A Lack of Color. "

52
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,668
-All the makings of a classic.
-ls Death Cab a band?

53
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,350
Around we go on the wheel, and, Mom,
you're in charge of interior decor.

54
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,632
That's gonna mean trimmings,
ornaments, frosting of the windows.

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,791
Don't know, don't care.
Just make it classy.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,515
I'll do my best. I've invited the Nichols,
or the Cooper-Nichols.

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,915
-Whatever they're called.
-They are gentiles.

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,439
A whole slew of them at that.

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,757
Let's put our heads together,
do some serious Jew-cruitment. Ryan?

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,632
Think you can rope in some Hebrews?

61
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,957
-Blond hair, blue eyes. I'm a natural.
-Fair point, Aryan friend.

62
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,669
Okay, where are we gonna find
some Jews in Orange County?

63
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,237
Father! I have just discovered
the ideal job for you this Chrismukkah.

64
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,955
Chrismukkah. Leave me out of it.

65
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,676
-Oy, humbug.
-Oy, humbug.

66
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,233
Your dad seemed pretty upset.

67
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,231
You know my dad and the holidays.

68
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,709
He likes a slow build.
Doesn't wanna peak too soon.

69
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,269
It's a long holiday.
You gotta pace yourself.

70
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,035
Hey. It's a marathon of presents,
not a race.

71
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,590
To get through this holiday season,
you must set a pace.

72
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,433
Those are good lyrics for the song.
Do you have a pen?

73
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,837
-You're not really writing a song?
-For Chrismukkah to go global...

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,912
...we need an anthem.
I'm thinking little JoJo can record it.

75
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,475
While spreading Chrismukkah,
you inviting Alex?

76
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,318
I did. She's away with her folks.

77
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,550
Probably at some Club Med tattoo parlor.

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,392
What about you? Is Lindsay around?

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,556
-Y eah. I think she is.
-Gonna invite her?

80
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,115
I can't. I mean, it's kind of a big step.

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,436
And with Marissa there,
it'd be weird for her.

82
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,989
Marissa won't be there.
My mom drew a seating chart.

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,509
-She said she'll be with her dad.
-Really?

84
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,718
We just got things to a good place,
got a little mystery back.

85
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,189
Inviting her for the holidays
might be rushing it.

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,989
Then don't do it, man. Do not do it.
Last thing you wanna do is rush things.

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,630
-What are you doing? We'll be late.
-Sorry.

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,353
Sure we're not rushing things?

89
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,230
Well, you know, we were married
for 1 7 years, so....

90
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,719
It's just been....

91
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,757
It's been so long since we've done this.

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,832
Well, it's like--
It's like riding a bike.

93
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,315
An incredibly toned...

94
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,359
...and, you know,
evenly tanned and limber bike.

95
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,834
You know, with a really sharp mind
and incredible sense of....

96
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,198
Of interior design.

97
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,033
Oh, God, slow down. I'm sorry.

98
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,476
It's just-- Does this count as--?
As adultery?

99
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,871
You know, cheating on your husband
with your ex-husband?

100
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,679
Technically, I think....

101
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,035
It does, yeah.

102
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,034
Okay, sorry.

103
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,679
Let's just-- Okay.

104
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,796
-What?
-Caleb and I aren't getting along.

105
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,916
He hasn't touched me in months.

106
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,911
He's probably going to jail.

107
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,470
Well, I think it's wonderful
how maturely you're handling it all.

108
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,517
I don't hear you complaining.

109
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,796
Well, do you wanna stop?

110
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,277
No.

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,231
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

112
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,391
I don't have much
of a lunch break, so....

113
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,873
-Why meet here?
-I've run out of places to go.

114
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,919
I've had so many secret meetings lately,
I feel like I'm in an Oliver Stone movie.

115
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,593
Look, I know you feel that if you
come forward you'll lose your daughter.

116
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,079
You may lose her either way.

117
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,511
The DA's sure Caleb was bribing
someone in the councilman's office.

118
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,994
Bribing you.

119
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,515
Unless somebody testifies differently...

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,956
...they have enough evidence
to send you to jail.

121
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,199
How do I tell my daughter
that I've been lying to her her whole life?

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,591
Inventing a father she never had.
Keeping her from meeting her family.

123
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,438
Maybe it's time she met him.

124
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,318
Maybe it's time to stop lying.

125
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,318
Caleb won't come forward.
I can't.

126
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,429
You're our last hope.

127
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,155
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,590
-Hey.
-Hey.

129
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,269
-You gonna study all Christmas break?
-I hope so.

130
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,398
Keep me distracted from remembering
it's actually Christmas.

131
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,913
Not a fan of the holidays?

132
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,833
-Who is?
-Well, Seth, actually.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,719
He's even invented his own
super-holiday. Chrismukkah.

134
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,198
-Chrismukkah?
-Yeah.

135
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,710
Well, that's cute.

136
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,030
I guess. It's....

137
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,512
It's eight days of gifts, followed
by one day of many, many gifts.

138
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,319
We eat Chinese food
and watch Christmas movies.

139
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,391
Though, last year,
we watched Over the Top.

140
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,991
-Well, a classic any time of year.
-That's what I'm saying.

141
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,592
Me and my mom,
we stopped even buying a tree.

142
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,799
It always just looked so sad
with just two gifts under it.

143
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,832
When I was little...

144
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,995
...all my friends were waiting
for something from Santa...

145
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,392
...and I was just hoping...

146
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,276
...for something...

147
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,518
...anything, from my dad.

148
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,479
-Still waiting?
-Not anymore.

149
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,794
Every kid grows up,
stops believing in Santa.

150
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,360
I stopped believing in my dad...

151
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,478
...and there's no pine needles
to clean up.

152
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,477
So....

153
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,430
Disappointed by your family
over the holidays. I've been there.

154
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
So do what I did.

155
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,229
Find another family to spend them with.

156
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,677
Come over.

157
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,432
Come over for Chrismukkah?

158
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,990
It'd be better if you were Jewish.

159
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,873
There's a ratio issue, but it'll be fun.

160
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,672
-Seth will keep you very distracted.
-Can we watch Over the Top?

161
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,196
I could watch that movie
1 00 times and never get sick of it.

162
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,477
Where's Zach?
I'm not used to seeing you without him.

163
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,148
He left early for Christmas in Cabo
with his fam.

164
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,356
He's been gone a day,
and I miss him already.

165
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,838
DJ's in Sacramento
with his family for two weeks.

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,274
I miss him too.

167
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,790
Well, this should be a fun break.
Me, you, Caleb and my step-monster.

168
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,234
Should be one for the ages.

169
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,799
We could spike the eggnog.

170
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,998
-Coop.
-Kidding. Kind of.

171
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,470
Actually, not really.

172
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,637
This sucks.
Last year the holidays were so much fun.

173
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,230
Yeah. I got rejected by Cohen
in a Wonder Woman costume...

174
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,992
...and you got caught shoplifting.

175
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,839
-Yeah. It was memorable, though.
-I guess it was.

176
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,635
Hey, can I get a large coffee, please?
Thanks.

177
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,319
Hey, guys.
Merry Chrismukkah.

178
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,034
-Don't remind us.
-Forgot about your little holiday.

179
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,711
Okay. My color-coded holiday
alert system is detecting you two.

180
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,472
You're taupe. Come on.

181
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,598
That's a very dangerously low level
of holiday cheer.

182
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,756
I don't know what you're talking about.

183
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,599
I am looking forward to dinner
with my stepmom...

184
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,110
-...face down in her Christmas ham.
-I can't wait to be on Dad's boat...

185
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,669
...and hear him talk
about how much he misses Hailey.

186
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,798
Wait a second, guys.
Summer. Marissa.

187
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,311
On behalf of Jesus
and Judah Maccabee and the Cohens...

188
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,631
...I'd like to cordially invite you both,
and your dad, Marissa...

189
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,268
...but not yours,
because he scares and hates me...

190
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,593
...to come celebrate a little holiday
I like to call Chrismukkah.

191
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,788
It's also sort of my way of apologizing
for the whole SnO.C. debacle.

192
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,798
-Sure, why not?
-Okay, whatever.

193
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,197
Hey. Somebody just went
from taupe to putty.

194
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,149
Kirsten, are you ready
for the investors meeting?

195
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,757
Thanks. I was, and I attended
the meeting two hours ago.

196
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,718
What? Two hours?

197
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,511
My new assistant is constantly putting
the wrong numbers into my BlackBerry.

198
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,238
I tried to reach you all morning.

199
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,868
Well, my battery must have died.

200
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,198
Or not.

201
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,715
That's so funny.
That's Jimmy's favorite song.

202
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,672
Is it? I forgot.

203
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,279
That's why you got it.

204
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,954
I got "Hungry Like the Wolf. "
He got "The Hustle. "

205
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,549
-I was there when you picked them out.
-lt is Jimmy.

206
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,474
Nothing gets by you, Kirsten.
You've got a memory like an elephant.

207
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,075
-You gonna answer it?
-No. It's just Jimmy.

208
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,078
-Thought you were getting along.
-Why do you say that?

209
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,511
Last week when you said you and Jimmy
were getting along really well.

210
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,599
-You okay? You seem frazzled.
-Yeah, well, you know....

211
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,593
I didn't get a chance to blow my hair out
this morning, so....

212
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,518
I said frazzled.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,230
Not frizzy.

214
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,759
-Hey, is dinner ready yet?
-No. Your dad's at the grill.

215
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,509
I'm famished.
All this planning for the big day.

216
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,954
Taking it out of you, huh?

217
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,715
Hey. Ye of little faith.
Trust those of mixed faith.

218
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,030
Okay, this year,
it's gonna be off the charts.

219
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,760
-It's gonna be Cochise.
-What's Cochise?

220
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,708
Highest level of holiday cheer
on my color-coded holiday alert system.

221
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,110
-Cochise is a color?
-It's in the beige family.

222
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,033
-Couldn't go with blue?
-Listen, it's gonna be awesome.

223
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,316
Especially now Marissa
and Summer are coming--

224
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,391
Whoa, I thought
Marissa was with her dad.

225
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,238
She was,
but she was bummed about it.

226
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,992
Since you're not inviting Lindsay--

227
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,156
Except I did invite Lindsay.

228
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,995
-That's awkward.
-Seth. What am I gonna do?

229
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,469
They can't hang out together.
It's too weird.

230
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,079
-I agree.
-Not helping.

231
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,078
Oh, God, what if it's starting?

232
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,157
-What if what?
-Chrismukkah backlash.

233
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,038
Is it getting too big and commercial?

234
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,754
-Guess I'm done studying.
-I knew this would happen.

235
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,151
It starts out
as this really cool cult holiday...

236
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,038
...flying beneath the cultural radar.

237
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,397
Then, all of a sudden, it crosses over,
and there's too much pressure.

238
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,471
Can it really be the next Thanksgiving?

239
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,710
-Can it top Halloween?
-This is off topic.

240
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,229
The government will ask me
to create new holidays.

241
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,039
Like East-over or Kwanzaa-shanah?
Can't let it happen.

242
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,351
-Hey, guys.
-Can't talk now. We have an emergency.

243
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,876
-What's going on?
-Ryan invited Lindsay over tomorrow...

244
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,271
...setting off a wildfire that threatens
man, woman and Chrismukkah.

245
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,671
-You invited Lindsay?
-ls that okay?

246
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,752
-Oh, sure, you ask him.
-I don't think it's such a good idea.

247
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,593
It isn't?

248
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,677
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to impose.

249
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,354
Well, no, it's not that.

250
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,318
We have a pretty liberal
open-door policy. It's....

251
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,635
How serious is it between you guys?

252
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,354
I don't know. You know,
there's still mystery.

253
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,191
Well, maybe not mystery, but suspense.

254
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,709
-You really like her?
-He wants to see her naked.

255
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,598
-I hate it when you do this.
-Sorry.

256
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,155
Yeah. Yeah. I'm starting to.
I mean, should I not?

257
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,195
Her mom's involved
with Caleb's case. It's....

258
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,796
The timing, it's probably not great,
given everything.

259
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,234
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

260
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,954
Okay.

261
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,429
Except what does Lindsay
have to do with Caleb's case?

262
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,835
What is she, like, Caleb's hit man?
Drug dealer?

263
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,877
Illegitimate love child?

264
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,036
This stays between us.

265
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,198
At least until we make it
through these holidays. Come on.

266
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,032
Dinner's served.

267
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,232
Hey, you going somewhere?

268
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,437
Lindsay's. I've got to uninvite her,
like your dad said.

269
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,160
-You are?
-She can't be here if Caleb's gonna be.

270
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,029
No, hey, man. If we thought her and
Marissa together would be awkward....

271
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,191
And I need you to do something for me.

272
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,351
Yeah, sure. Dude, name it, anything.

273
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,516
I need you to uninvite Summer.

274
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,716
I can't do that. It's rude.

275
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,831
I gotta tell Lindsay we're not doing it.

276
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,560
She then finds out that
Marissa and Summer came over.

277
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,358
I see your point.

278
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,952
Well, while you're out-- I mean,
you'll have your speech anyway...

279
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,111
...maybe you could stop by
Summer's for me.

280
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,436
-Dude, please.
-She's not gonna take it well.

281
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,670
Neither is Lindsay.

282
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,838
-Hi.
-Hi.

283
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,512
-Happy Chrismukkah.
-Can we talk?

284
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,229
Yeah, yeah. Wait. But first I have to
show you what I made for tonight.

285
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,471
-Hey. Merry Chrismukkah, Cohen.
-Yes, it is.

286
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,353
-Tonight's gonna be so much fun.
-Yeah, it'll be great.

287
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,397
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

288
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,949
But first, can you help me
pick out a Christmas tree?

289
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,951
I'm feeling all festive today.

290
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,278
Festive, huh?

291
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,034
I know what I said about the holidays...

292
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,954
...but then I started thinking about
hanging out with you and the Cohens.

293
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,072
And I got inspired,
and I stayed up all night.

294
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,800
And you're gonna think
I'm a really big dork, but....

295
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,076
Okay.

296
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,591
Here.

297
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,313
-It's a yarmul-Claus.
-A yarmul-Claus.

298
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,392
Wow. That's wow.

299
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,878
Yeah. I made a whole bunch. It was fun,
and I never have fun this time of year.

300
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,792
And maybe it was the new holiday...

301
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,230
...or the idea of spending time
with a family...

302
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,436
...who actually enjoys the holiday, but....

303
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,034
Oh, my God.

304
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,039
Wow, listen to me.

305
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,274
What did you wanna talk about?

306
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,836
Could you bring eggnog tonight?

307
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,797
Yeah, I'd love to.

308
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,756
Fresh, minty aroma.
Symmetrical, conical shape.

309
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,194
Great, let's go.

310
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,590
A bit too bushy. Moving on.

311
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,350
Good needle retention. Nice scent.

312
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,630
Feels a bit dry.
I don't think it's gonna last.

313
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,313
Summer, neither am l, okay?

314
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,755
All these trees look the same.

315
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,997
When it comes to Haggadahs,
dreidels and guilt, you the man.

316
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,913
When it's Christmas trees,
bit out of your wheelhouse.

317
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,473
We've been here for hours.

318
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,514
You are right. If I don't pull the trigger
soon, we're gonna be late to your house.

319
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,677
Hey, about that....

320
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,071
You know, I just think it's really cool
that you invited me tonight.

321
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,350
After everything
we've been through...

322
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,193
...you were able
to put aside our differences.

323
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,558
I just think you're really changing
and that maybe we're actually friends.

324
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,799
Great.

325
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,679
Mistletoe.

326
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,869
Is there something
you wanted to talk to me about?

327
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,598
How do you feel about making latkes?

328
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,279
I'd love to!

329
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,870
And could you
just carry this tree to my car?

330
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,153
Okay.

331
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,875
-Hey, buddy.
-Hello, friend.

332
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,040
-How'd it go with Summer?
-How'd it go with Lindsay?

333
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,192
-She take it better than expected?
-Well....

334
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,839
-I couldn't do it.
-What, you wussed out?

335
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,634
-She's miserable during the holidays.
-Dude.

336
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,829
-She made a yarmul-Claus.
-A yarmul-what?

337
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,197
Holy Moses, it's beautiful.

338
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,356
At least Marissa and Summer
aren't coming.

339
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,278
Yeah, about that.

340
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,799
Hey, guys.

341
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,434
Yarmul-Claus?

342
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,039
Yarmul-what?

343
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,792
It's so cute.

344
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,392
Well, if it isn't the Grinch...

345
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,028
-...and Lady Grinch.
-I brought fruitcake.

346
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,118
You shouldn't have.
May I take your coats?

347
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,833
-Can we talk?
-That's up to you.

348
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,551
Julie, sorry, I couldn't resist.
This orange chicken is--

349
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,029
God, I have missed you all day.

350
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,438
Still chewing.

351
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,954
I know. I feel the same way.

352
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,475
What are we doing?
I can't stop thinking about you.

353
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,914
I know. You know what?

354
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,833
-Meet me in the bathroom--
-ls there any room in the fridge?

355
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,312
Keep your fingers out of the food
till we eat, Jimmy. God, no manners.

356
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,074
Sorry. I couldn't resist. I'm...

357
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,869
...gonna go wash up.

358
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,673
Yeah.

359
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,274
Thanks for the ride, Mom.

360
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,078
You sure you wanna do this?
I mean, we hate the holidays.

361
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,634
That's our pact.

362
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,755
Maybe it's time to get over that.
Get over Dad.

363
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,070
-It's Chrismukkah.
-Yeah, so you keep on saying.

364
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,073
We can go see a movie.
Double feature.

365
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,990
Have fun.

366
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,879
-Hello.
-Hi.

367
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,156
-You're Seth and Ryan's friend?
-Yeah.

368
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,754
Me and Ryan are more like
lab partners, really.

369
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,359
Well, come on in.

370
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,510
-Jeez, Summer, come on.
-I'm trying.

371
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,591
You've got to get
more aggressive, Summer.

372
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,034
Kick him.

373
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,474
Yeah.

374
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,956
You know, you can sit a little bit closer.
I don't bite.

375
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,238
Happy Chrismukkah!

376
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,871
-Hey!
-Hi.

377
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,713
Hey.

378
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,839
PlayStation?

379
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,550
I love the holidays. Just...

380
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,640
...bringing everyone together.

381
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,590
So I've been thinking
about everything...

382
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,316
...about the whole family,
about the holidays.

383
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,630
Where are we going with this, Cal?

384
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,991
I need to tell the truth.

385
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,676
I need to tell Kirsten.

386
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,668
-You've got a hell of a sense of timing.
-No, there's no good time.

387
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,353
That's true.

388
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,352
So, what are you gonna say?

389
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,353
I was hoping that you could help me
with that part.

390
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,078
Oh, hi, Renee.
Are you looking for Lindsay?

391
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,679
Actually, I was wondering....

392
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,917
Can I talk to you?

393
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,878
Can I get you a drink?
A glass of wine, maybe?

394
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,314
No, thank you.

395
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,675
I know this is a terrible time
for me to show up.

396
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,593
Not at all. Is everything okay?

397
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,078
I'm gonna have a glass of wine.

398
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,394
-You have a beautiful house.
-Thank you.

399
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,154
And what I wanna say to you,
it should be Caleb who's saying it.

400
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,430
-Well, he's here.
-He is?

401
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,712
-Would you like me to go get him?
-No.

402
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,830
I should be-- This-- This--

403
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,752
-This isn't the right time.
-Renee?

404
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,793
Caleb.

405
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,353
What are you doing here?

406
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,674
What you're about to do.

407
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,189
-Dibs on dumplings.
-You have dibs on everything.

408
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,873
When do we watch Over the Top?

409
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,719
-Maybe you should speak first.
-Mom.

410
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,709
-Lindsay.
-Lindsay.

411
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,797
Have we met?

412
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,149
Lindsay, sweetie, could you just...?

413
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,715
-Just give us a moment.
-Why? What's going on?

414
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,512
That's what I'd like to know.

415
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,559
I'm going. This isn't right.

416
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,797
No one's going anywhere until someone
tells me what's going on.

417
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,793
Hey, what's going on?

418
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,115
Good thing the kitchen's roomy.

419
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,792
Cal, why don't you take it from here.

420
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,234
-I can't believe you just showed up.
-Did you think...

421
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,119
-...we could get away with it forever?
-Get away with what?

422
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,916
Dad, start speaking.

423
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,914
-Does everyone have to be here for this?
-Be here for what, Cal?

424
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,274
I'm sorry it had to happen
like this, Lindsay.

425
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,399
Kirsten...

426
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,676
...I had hoped that I could protect
you both from this forever, but...

427
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,955
...circumstances being what they are...

428
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,715
...where your mother and l
face going to prison...

429
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,918
...well, there really is no choice.

430
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,716
Sixteen years ago...

431
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,833
...I made....

432
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,958
I made an error in judgment.

433
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,077
One that almost ruined my marriage.

434
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,117
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

435
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,157
No way.

436
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,397
I'm so sorry, sweetie.
I should have told you.

437
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,471
You're my father.

438
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,317
Lindsay, wait.

439
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,313
I don't know what to say.

440
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,756
Get out of my house.

441
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,479
Do you think I should go talk--?

442
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,515
I think you should be
ashamed of yourself.

443
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,151
I'll handle your mom.

444
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,759
Hi.

445
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,596
I should talk to Lindsay.

446
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,517
I'm gonna go check on my mom.
You guys just hang out.

447
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,712
Suddenly, my family,
not so dysfunctional.

448
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,117
-You do know this is my family too.
-Right. Sorry.

449
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,352
I forget sometimes. It's....
It's confusing.

450
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,317
You knew about this and never told me?

451
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,950
-I couldn't. You know that.
-Attorney-client privilege, Sandy.

452
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,032
He cheated on my mom.
I have a sister I've never known.

453
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,679
I know, and we'll figure it out.

454
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,831
-What's there to figure out?
-Please listen.

455
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,594
I never wanna see you again,
you son of a bitch!

456
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,190
How could you do that to me?
T o Mom?

457
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,351
-Please. I can't explain--
-Just get out!

458
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,033
Kiki, honey. Please.

459
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,479
-Kirsten.
-Now is not the time, Cal. Please.

460
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,349
-Let me try to talk to her.
-Grandpa, I think you should leave.

461
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,229
I'll be better off going to prison.

462
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,349
-ls she here?
-This isn't a good time, Ryan.

463
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,751
I know. I just....
I wanna talk to her.

464
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,478
-Make sure she's okay.
-She's not.

465
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,116
Can I even talk to her for a second?

466
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,313
It's okay, Mom.
I can speak for myself.

467
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,159
Hey.

468
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,517
So sorry.

469
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,199
I know you want to be alone
right now, but...

470
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,911
...I want you to know I'm here.

471
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,239
Okay?

472
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,957
I think it's best
if we don't see each other anymore.

473
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,233
I just....

474
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,960
I don't want to be anywhere near
your family.

475
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,153
Ever.

476
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,677
But thanks for coming by.

477
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,277
Happy holidays, huh?

478
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,797
This year's getting even weirder
than last year.

479
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,473
I know.

480
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,551
My ex-boyfriend is dating
my stepsister?

481
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,153
I think.

482
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,636
We have new boyfriends.

483
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,031
And our ex-boyfriends have
new girlfriends.

484
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,191
Is that what they are?

485
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,198
Their girlfriends?

486
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,713
I think.

487
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,674
And now my stepdad
could be going to jail.

488
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,677
Is there something in the water?

489
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,311
-How'd it go?
-Hey. Is there anything we can do?

490
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,154
I think we have to cancel Chrismukkah.

491
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,351
-Hey.
-Hey. How's Lindsay?

492
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,318
Not so good.
How'd everything go with your mom?

493
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,950
We're at charcoal on my color-coded
holiday alert system.

494
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,954
-Your poor mom.
-Your poor mom.

495
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,509
Yeah, of all the people
to feel sorry for here...

496
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,070
-...she's not really high on my list.
-So then Chrismukkah...?

497
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,959
Canceled. The way nature,
and apparently we, intended it.

498
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,037
That is so sad.

499
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,475
Chrismukkah is supposed
to bring people together.

500
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,438
It's the time of year
that you look forward to most, Cohen.

501
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,036
Yeah, well, you know, my mom throwing
vases at my grandfather's head...

502
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,078
...kind of trumps it,
even if it has twice the resistance...

503
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,037
...of your average holiday.

504
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,438
-You want a ride home, man?
-Yeah. Actually, I do.

505
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,036
Unless Summer needs help with
the "ginormous" tree strapped to her car.

506
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,039
So that's it?
You guys are just gonna give up?

507
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,352
Give up on Chrismukkah when
everyone we know needs it the most.

508
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,511
Okay. Thank you, Tiny Tim.

509
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,192
Well, what do you wanna do, Sum?

510
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,238
-We can't go back to the Cohens'.
-Lindsay won't talk to me.

511
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,153
-And I can no longer walk.
-Well, you guys can all give up.

512
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,959
But I still believe
in a Chrismukkah miracle.

513
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,677
And I have a plan.

514
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,430
I've been looking for you
all over the house.

515
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,115
I wanted to see if Marissa was back yet.
She's not.

516
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,837
You can bet she'll make this
about her...

517
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,390
...and that we will suffer the
consequences for a very long time.

518
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,431
I know. It's tough on everyone.

519
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,068
Which is why I tried to keep it a secret.

520
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,390
You and your secrets, Cal.

521
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,949
You need a walk-in closet
for all of your skeletons.

522
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,958
I promise you...

523
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,635
-...this is the end.
-Yeah?

524
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,190
You don't have an evil twin?
You're not really an alien?

525
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,109
But now that the truth is out there,
the case will go away.

526
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,793
I'll be free.

527
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,432
I just can't believe
you cheated on your wife.

528
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,636
It was hell. And it never
happened again. Never will.

529
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,834
I have everything I need
from this marriage.

530
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,231
-I hope you feel the same.
-Don't put this back on me, Cal.

531
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,799
I wasn't.

532
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,712
I was merely saying....

533
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,475
I don't know what I'm saying anymore.

534
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,995
I'm tired of lying. I want
this whole thing to be over, and l....

535
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,433
-I need you to forgive me.
-I'm gonna go try and find Marissa.

536
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,160
-Does that mean you forgive me?
-I don't know.

537
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,510
-Hi.
-Hey.

538
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,716
-You went and saw Lindsay?
-Tried.

539
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,634
Poor girl.

540
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,719
-How goes it here?
-Fantastic. Kirsten's locked herself...

541
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,634
...in her closet. Other than requesting
a PowerBar be slid under the door...

542
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,153
...she isn't speaking to me.

543
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,118
But on the plus side,
there's plenty of moo shu available.

544
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,670
I'm sorry. I just--
I want you to know that I'm sorry.

545
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,831
-I didn't uninvite--
-Kid...

546
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,877
...this is so far from being your fault.

547
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,670
-Well, you don't think it's yours.
-No. But no good deed goes unpunished.

548
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,435
Which explains why my wife is holed up
next to a shoe rack.

549
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,476
-Hey, you mind if I talk to her?
-It's your life.

550
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,992
Go away.

551
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,953
It's Ryan.

552
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,838
I don't really feel like talking
to anyone right now.

553
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,399
All right.

554
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,917
I know. I....

555
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,994
I was hoping we could talk
about Lindsay.

556
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,957
Is she okay?

557
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,119
No.

558
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,836
Well, not right now, but...

559
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,797
...I guess it depends.

560
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,591
Depends on what?

561
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,752
On whether or not
she figures out she's...

562
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,830
...part of a family that's pretty good
at letting in new members.

563
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,278
-Good line.
-Thanks.

564
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,638
Just don't tell Sandy
that I came out for you, okay?

565
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,470
Yeah, because he wouldn't
wanna hear that.

566
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,436
You wanna meet your sister?

567
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,109
I don't know if I'm ready
to start referring to her as that.

568
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,829
But Lindsay seems like a really great girl.

569
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,194
She is.

570
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,956
Coop, I cannot believe your dad
lives on a boat. That is so Miami Vice.

571
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,270
-You've seen Miami Vice?
-Repeats.

572
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,113
My stepmom, she finds
the pastel colors soothing.

573
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,191
She's on some interesting drugs
these days.

574
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,476
Which I will be keeping away from you.

575
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,192
Dad.

576
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,078
Dad.

577
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,433
-Hi, girls.
-Hey.

578
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,280
-How are you?
-We're okay. We're just in a rush...

579
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,796
...and we were wondering, do you have
a generator and an extension cord?

580
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,872
-I don't really like the sound of that.
-It's really important.

581
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,996
A Chrismukkah miracle
hangs in the balance.

582
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,878
We'll explain later.

583
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,510
Well, luckily, living on a boat
requires one to have such stuff.

584
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,398
It's right around the corner.

585
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,593
Got it.

586
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,519
Now, have you spoken to your mom?

587
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,752
-She's worried sick about you.
-Really? That's too bad.

588
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,351
You've been talking to her a lot lately.

589
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,273
You're not, like,
becoming friends or anything?

590
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,715
Why? Would that...?
Would that be so terrible?

591
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,678
-Yeah, for you.
-All right. Got it, Coop. Let's go.

592
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,034
-Love you, Dad.
-Thanks, Mr. Coop.

593
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,313
They're gone.

594
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,239
-I don't suppose you heard any of that.
-Please.

595
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,795
It's almost a compliment from her.

596
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,957
What are we doing, Julie?

597
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,077
Are we...?
Are we making a huge mistake?

598
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,119
Yeah.

599
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,272
But I wanna be with you.

600
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,271
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

601
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,274
Your mom said I could maybe find you
here. She also said you're not...

602
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,556
-...in the mood to see any friends.
-I'm not.

603
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,554
Okay. I get that,
but here's the thing, Lindsay.

604
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,519
-You and l, we're kin.
-No.

605
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,318
-No, we're not.
-Yeah.

606
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,472
Yeah, we are. Congratulations.
You're a Cohen.

607
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,198
Welcome to a life of insecurity
and paralyzing self-doubt.

608
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,432
It's a little soon to joke.

609
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,309
Not for us Cohens. It's what we do.
Laugh through our tears.

610
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,393
Make jokes inappropriately soon
after a traumatic event.

611
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,678
Sometimes, we'll just make the joke
during the traumatic event.

612
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,432
Yeah, traumatic...

613
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,115
...Seth, doesn't even begin
to describe this.

614
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,033
Look.

615
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,988
I get that what happened
seems really overwhelming.

616
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,479
-Do you?
-Yeah, I do.

617
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,108
But I think you and I have a lot
to be grateful for.

618
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,471
Most of all, that we didn't start dating.

619
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,388
Yeah, because that
would've been gross...

620
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,314
-...on several levels.
-Hey. There you go.

621
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,869
That's what I'm talking about.
You are a Cohen, okay?

622
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,749
And I like that. You know what
that means? You get one of these.

623
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,393
Enjoy.

624
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,512
It says Laura.

625
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,877
It's the only one they had at the store.
I'll fix it later.

626
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,513
So when did you come up
with this holiday, exactly?

627
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,150
No, I didn't, actually. Jesus and Moses,
they put it together over lunch.

628
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,595
A few years back now, I think it was.

629
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,232
What does Moses have to do
with Hanukkah?

630
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,197
Wait, no. I think you're missing
the point of the holiday completely.

631
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,430
Which is...?

632
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,519
Hi.

633
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,712
I'm Kirsten.

634
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,714
Hi.

635
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,399
Welcome.

636
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,874
-This is really weird.
-It's our family.

637
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,357
Thank you for doing this.

638
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,274
Thanks for coming forward.
You did the right thing.

639
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,839
Yeah?

640
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,034
And maybe someday
Lindsay will forgive me.

641
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,229
So, Summer Roberts,
you saved Chrismukkah.

642
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,040
-I kind of did, didn't l?
-I hope I can repay you.

643
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,317
Well, you can start by carrying my tree
to my car later.

644
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,319
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

645
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,913
Eggnog? Latkes?

646
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,390
None for Summer.
It gives her gas.

647
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,913
They figured you hadn't had
a Christmas tree for a while.

648
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,435
-I don't even know what to say.
-You don't have to say anything.

649
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,472
Hey. I've got latkes.

650
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,391
That sounds kind of disgusting.

651
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,915
Yeah, I know. Can we order pizza?

652
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,719
All right. Who's ready to hear
the Chrismukkah hymn?

653
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,111
It's penned to Death Cab's
"A Lack of Color. "

654
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,516
What? No one knows
what that song is, Cohen.

655
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,956
Seth carrying a tune. Now, that
would be a Chrismukkah miracle.

656
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,758
Fine. I'll do it in my own tune.

657
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,316
-Come on, sing, sing, sing.
-All right, all right.

658
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,238
Yeah!

659
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,514
Yeah!
