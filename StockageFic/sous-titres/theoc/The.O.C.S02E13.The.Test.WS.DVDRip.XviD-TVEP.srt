1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,354
Previously on The O. C.:

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,272
I' m a huge fan
of spontaneous first dates.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,555
I am too.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,632
It's nice to see you two have
grown so close since I've been gone.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,074
Make yourself at home.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,071
Hey, Max?

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,028
This is about our marriage.
You and I come first.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,838
She's innocent. And she's my client.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,560
Anything I would tell you about her
could make you an accessory.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,233
You two will be in here together.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,312
And I will be just on the other side
of this soundproof wall.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,833
I blew the comic book...

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,878
...and I just completely humiliated
myself in front of Summer.

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,877
Officials noted if parties
are not back to the bargaining table--

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,156
Oh, dude, please turn that off.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,675
-Seth.
-l' m sleeping.

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,229
T ell me that you weren't
watching movies all night.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,311
I wasn't, man.
Just Darkman and Hellboy...

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,072
...and the first two Matrixes.

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,958
Matrices.

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,110
What's the plural of Matrix?

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,953
Here.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,113
It's coffee.

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,955
You need to get in the shower.
We've got school.

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,599
-I took a shower yesterday.
-No.

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,796
I took a shower the day
before yesterday.

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,518
-l' m making you a bagel.
-No.

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,954
You need to eat.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,917
My body will tell me
when it needs food.

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,389
Just like it's telling you
when it needs a shower?

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,553
-Do you not see what's going on here?
-You've been wallowing since San Diego.

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,432
-Enough's enough.
-I'm not wallowing.

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,591
I'm agonizing.
The two are vastly different.

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,512
-Really?
-Yeah. See, wallowing...

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,956
...that's like lounging around,
eating ice cream, watching VH1.

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,078
But agonizing,
it's more like MTV2, okay.

37
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,276
It's no frills. It requires discipline.

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,476
Days of no sleep, no food.

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,073
-No showering.
-Sitting there...

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,276
...thinking and wondering,
hour after hour...

41
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,112
-...if Zach and Summer...
-Don't.

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,475
...had sex in the hotel room
right next to mine.

43
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,914
And you did. Amazing.

44
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,436
They spent the night in the room right
beside mine. How can I not wonder?

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,797
You can obsess about it for the rest
of your life. You'll never know.

46
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,951
No, you're right.
Of course, you're right.

47
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,680
I have to let it go because
there's no way I will know.

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,353
-Unless I ask Summer.
-What?

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,069
Yeah. It came to me during Hellboy.
It's the uncertainty that's killing me.

50
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,674
It won't be uncertainty killing
you if you ask Summer.

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,273
No, Seth! You can't ask her.

52
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,113
It's weird, it's creepy,
and it's none of your business.

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,713
You're right.

54
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,316
I don't know what I was thinking.
It's just lack of sleep or something.

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,596
I'll ask Zach.

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,395
-Have you seen Seth?
-Oh, I've smelled him.

57
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,073
Smells like teen spirit to me.

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,071
Well, I tried talking to him.

59
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,150
But he just shared this long-winded
review about some movie called Hellboy.

60
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,117
Well, that sounds like lady drama.

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,396
There seems to be a lot
of that going around.

62
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,754
Still not ready to forgive and forget.

63
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,473
Well....

64
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,311
I better go and pay
my respects to Max.

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,156
You want some company?

66
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,992
Some more company?

67
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,630
I.... I don't think
that would be such a good idea.

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,075
Max was important to you.
So he's important to me.

69
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,038
-I'd be happy to go to his service.
-There's not a service.

70
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,271
-What?
-Well, Rebecca could never go.

71
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,351
The feds would be waiting for her.

72
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,358
It's just gonna be the two of us.

73
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,238
-The two of you?
-Look, l....

74
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,833
I know....

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,479
I know it sounds a little weird.

76
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,838
Beyond weird, Sandy.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,753
Please just hang
in there a little longer.

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,271
Please.

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,310
Give my condolences to Rebecca.

80
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,596
I'm gonna see why
my dad keeps calling.

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,274
Maybe I can help him
with his lady drama.

82
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,312
Don't tell me to calm down.
You're the one rushing into this.

83
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,277
For God's sake, Cal, you almost died.

84
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,271
You need to be seeing a therapist.

85
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,317
-Thank you, Julie. That is quite enough.
-Kirsten.

86
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,038
-Lindsay.
-Hey.

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,589
Caleb called me last night
and asked me to come over.

88
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,398
Do you know what this is about?

89
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,551
-No.
-I am your wife, remember?

90
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,871
-Maybe we should go into my office--
-Lindsay. Kirsten. Please.

91
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,435
-Thank you for coming.
-Maybe we should come back.

92
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,750
That's not necessary.
Julie and I are finished.

93
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,753
I asked you to come here
because I want to tell you--

94
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,911
As long as Lindsay agrees to it.

95
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,351
--I would like to formally adopt her.

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,350
-Oh, my God.
-Dad, that's....

97
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,794
I'm speechless.

98
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,951
Well, you may ask, why now?

99
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,792
-lsn't it kind of sudden?
-Yeah.

100
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,951
Well, actually, it's quite the opposite.

101
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,635
After my heart attack, I realized that
something could happen at any time.

102
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,711
This way, Lindsay will be a legal heir.

103
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,348
-I'll know she'll be taken care of.
-I told you...

104
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,671
...you have nothing to worry about.
I will take care of her.

105
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,076
-I saw that, Kirsten.
-This is about more...

106
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,196
...than financial security.

107
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,750
All through my illness, you stood by me.
Now it's my turn.

108
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,071
I would be proud to tell the world
that I'm your father.

109
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,629
-I don't know what to say.
-It's a big step.

110
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,509
Should you decide you want to take it,
a party would certainly be in order.

111
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,636
Don't you, Juju?

112
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,439
If you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

113
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,712
Welcome to the family, Lindsay.

114
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,359
Hey, man.

115
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,272
-Hey.
-Hey.

116
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,791
-Seth, how you doing?
-Good.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,718
Good. Fantastic.

118
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,714
So listen, I know we haven't
had a chance to talk since San Diego.

119
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,553
I figured I would take
this opportunity to clear the air.

120
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,472
You know, don't worry about it.

121
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,995
You, me, Summer, working
on a comic book together.

122
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,357
-It's probably not the best idea.
-Absolutely. I couldn't agree more.

123
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,715
And this way, you know,
we can still be friends.

124
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,313
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

125
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,710
So you guys have...

126
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,031
-...a good time the rest of the weekend?
-Yeah, we had a great time.

127
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,952
Great. Great. Glad to hear it.

128
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,032
So, what,
I'm guessing a couple good meals...

129
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,993
...a trip to Sea World,
maybe a trip to the zoo.

130
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,434
-A little sex.
-What?

131
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,511
-What? Is that a yes?
-Seth.

132
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,472
You don't even have to vocalize it.

133
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,870
-Just blink once if you did.
-What are you doing?

134
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,758
Nothing.
I'm just making conversation.

135
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,799
I thought you were trying to figure out
if Summer and I had sex in San Diego.

136
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,396
What? I would never do that.
That's creepy and boundary-crossing.

137
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,959
And I would never do that.

138
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,553
Good.

139
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,077
-Come on.
-I gotta go to class.

140
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,310
-Zach, Zach, Zach. Just wait--
-Seth.

141
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,072
Go home and get some rest.

142
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,559
Seriously.

143
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,714
It meant a lot to him
that you were trying to help me.

144
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,634
But, now that he's gone,
you don't need to try.

145
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,518
I am gonna help you
with your case.

146
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,036
T omorrow I'm meeting with a guy
at the FBl. Things are finally happening.

147
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,237
But we've got to let go of the past.

148
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,677
Focus on your future.

149
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,191
What happened the other night...

150
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,519
...it can't happen again.

151
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,756
I know. I understand.

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
He always wanted to be
scattered over the ocean.

153
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,959
Well....

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,230
Newport Beach is
honored to have him.

155
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,679
Goodbye, Dad.

156
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,635
You are not going to believe this.

157
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,756
My dad wants to adopt me.

158
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,194
-What?
-Yeah.

159
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,112
He told Kirsten and me this morning.

160
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,350
-lsn't that great?
-Yes.

161
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,192
It's great.

162
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,030
-You don't think so.
-No. That's a little fast.

163
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,273
Well, I know. He totally admitted that
we still have a lot of work to do, but....

164
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,118
He was so sweet about
wanting to provide for me...

165
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,078
...and have everyone
know he was my dad.

166
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,996
-And it was amazing.
-Sounds it. Was Julie there?

167
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,390
Yeah, you should have seen
the look she gave me.

168
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,876
-Like I was a scheming fortune hunter.
-That's what she understands.

169
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,395
Why should I care?
It's not like she's adopting me.

170
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,630
You don't want Julie Cooper
as an enemy.

171
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,519
And I say that having had Julie Cooper
as an enemy.

172
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,472
-So you don't think I should do it.
-No, I didn't say that.

173
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,031
Ryan, I've been dreaming
of this my whole life.

174
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,272
That l'd-- I'd find my dad...

175
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,318
...and he'd really want to be my dad.

176
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,351
I mean, that's what matters, right?

177
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,193
Yeah.

178
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,079
Thank you.

179
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,798
That means a lot.

180
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,709
-Mrs. Cohen?
-Yes. Can I help you?

181
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,395
We're Agents Stonerock and Tudor
from the FBl. Do you have a minute?

182
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,516
You're not supposed
to sneak up on people.

183
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,990
-Oh, yeah? Why is that?
-Because they might be angry.

184
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,230
So my friends are coming
down this weekend.

185
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,391
And I was gonna have a little party.

186
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,357
Wow, how very Newport of you.

187
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,877
No, I was thinking that maybe
you would want to invite Summer.

188
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,391
Sure. Okay.

189
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,036
Oh, no.
You haven't told her about us, have you?

190
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,191
-I was going to.
-It's--

191
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,352
I assumed because she's
your best friend. But it's no big deal.

192
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,476
You've got to wait till you're ready.

193
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,711
I'm ready, okay?

194
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,474
Like you said, she's my best friend.

195
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,278
I tell her everything.

196
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,795
Just make sure your party
doesn't suck, okay?

197
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,712
Do we have guests?

198
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,755
Special Agent Jill Stonerock.

199
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,195
-The FBl was here.
-lt wouldn't be the Cohen house...

200
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,079
...if there wasn't a visit from
someone in law enforcement.

201
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,673
What'd you tell them?

202
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,831
So now you're cross-examining me?

203
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,548
I told them Professor Bloom
came here two weeks ago...

204
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,075
-...and asked you to clear Rebecca.
-That's it?

205
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,152
You mean, did I tell them
where Rebecca is staying?

206
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,753
No, I did not.

207
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,078
I'm protected. I'm her lawyer.

208
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,312
But if you withhold information,
you could be prosecuted.

209
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,472
Are you worried I'd withhold
information or tell them too much?

210
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,359
It's not a choice between
protecting you and Rebecca.

211
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,112
Oh, I think it is.

212
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,715
And I think you've made
that choice, Sandy.

213
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,433
-What is it? I have a lot of work to do.
-We need to talk.

214
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,593
If you mean about my adopting Lindsay,
I think you made your position very clear.

215
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,069
I seem to be the only one
trying to protect you.

216
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,959
After my heart attack,
it was Lindsay at my bedside.

217
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,839
-You were at a spa in Nice.
-You can hold that against me...

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,231
...for the rest of our lives.
I am not going to let you rush into this.

219
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,995
For starters, and this may be painful,
you need to redo the paternity test.

220
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,720
-Medical advancements--
-There was no paternity test.

221
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,992
-What?
-There was no need.

222
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,993
Do I need to tell you how
transparent your motives are?

223
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,391
After all the money you've paid out
over these years with no proof?

224
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,233
I just thought you were a better
businessman than that.

225
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,833
Renee is an honest woman.

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,231
The kind of honest woman who
has an affair with a married man?

227
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,119
Look.

228
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,999
Lindsay probably is your daughter.

229
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,675
Don't you think you have a responsibility
to this family you're sure about...

230
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,671
...before diving into this?

231
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,198
I'll think about it.

232
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,272
That's all I wanted.

233
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,198
Hey, so you never told me
how San Diego was.

234
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,553
Two nights in a hotel?

235
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,395
Well, let's just say,
little Zach is full of surprises.

236
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,912
Well, I see.

237
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,029
I feel bad that I left you
alone on Valentine's.

238
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,633
What kind of friend am l?

239
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,668
Oh, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

240
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,314
-Actually, I wasn't alone.
-What?

241
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,119
Have you been holding out on me?
Who were you with?

242
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,671
No, no. I was....

243
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,115
I was with my mom, that's all.

244
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,958
So listen.

245
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,676
What are you doing tomorrow night?

246
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,114
Nothing, why?

247
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,874
Well, there's this thing.
A party thing.

248
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,398
Well, there's always a party thing.
Who's throwing it?

249
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,358
Caleb.

250
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,997
Party at Caleb's.
That sounds awesome.

251
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,436
Yes! Maybe a little shuffleboard?
A little bingo?

252
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,956
-I thought you'd help keep me company.
-Sure. No problem.

253
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,754
Oh, sorry. It's Zach.

254
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,793
Yeah, the Crab Shack sounds perfect.

255
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,030
My stomach is about to eat itself.

256
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,395
No, I haven't seen Cohen. Why?

257
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,599
Well, he always smells kind of weird.
What do you--?

258
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,228
What? He asked you what?

259
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,193
My God-- Yeah, okay. Bye.

260
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,714
Lunch is gonna have to wait. I have
to go kick Cohen's pervy little ass.

261
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,239
Hey, Ross.

262
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,913
It's good to see you.

263
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,389
-Thanks for making the trek from L.A.
-No problem.

264
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,312
Any excuse to get out of the office.

265
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,988
-How's Kirsten?
-She's fine.

266
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,958
Despite the chat she had last night
with your colleagues.

267
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,315
You think I sent them? Come on.

268
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,471
You asked me to inquire
about Rebecca Bloom.

269
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,359
-People got curious.
-Well, fair enough.

270
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,679
-So, what'd you find out?
-Even if she turns herself in...

271
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,513
...cooperates, she's still
gonna do serious time.

272
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,831
-Even if we can prove she wasn't there?
-A man died, Sandy.

273
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,991
And it was her key
that let them in the lab.

274
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,470
What'd you expect? A judge
is gonna let her walk? No chance.

275
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,917
Can we talk as friends for a second?

276
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,354
I thought we were.

277
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,358
I did my homework.

278
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,592
-You were involved with Rebecca Bloom.
-I was.

279
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,557
-Over 20 years ago.
-That's right.

280
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,952
A woman who's been on the run
for 20 years meets this knight...

281
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,317
...who wants to help her. You have
any idea what you're getting into?

282
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,993
Of course I do.

283
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,469
Her father was a dear friend of mine.

284
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,200
-I owe him.
-What about what you owe your family?

285
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,638
Your wife? If you think
you know this woman, you don't.

286
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,510
-She could bring you down.
-Well, thanks for your help.

287
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,277
And keep your people
away from my wife.

288
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,000
Hi. Renee, right? Lindsay's mom?

289
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,031
I'm Julie Cooper-Nichol.
Caleb's wife.

290
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,316
-How can I help you?
-Actually, I thought I could help you.

291
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,631
It's this adoption business.
I wanted to give you a heads-up.

292
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,631
It looks like Caleb is going to ask...

293
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,155
-...for a DNA test after all.
-What?

294
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,595
No one is suggesting
that Caleb isn't the father.

295
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,478
You would have said something, right?

296
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,835
All these years you've
been taking his money.

297
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,912
God, otherwise, that would be
like fraud, wouldn't it?

298
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,958
-What exactly are you implying?
-Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

299
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,917
Just, well, if you do have
any doubts...

300
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,389
...about how the test
might affect Lindsay...

301
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,320
...maybe this adoption
isn't such a great idea.

302
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,233
I'm sure you could come up
with a way to talk her out of it.

303
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,470
Thank you for your advice.
If you don't mind--

304
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,437
Mom, who's there?

305
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,673
-Julie.
-Lindsay.

306
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,559
I came by to remind your mom
about the party tomorrow night.

307
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,199
I hope she can make it.

308
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,995
-I'll try.
-You do that.

309
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,031
Well, anyway, I should run.
You two take care.

310
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,271
What a cute little house.

311
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,555
We should put garlic up
in case she comes back.

312
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,199
Definitely.

313
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,352
Yeah?

314
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,596
You asked my boyfriend
if we had sex?

315
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,796
-What is wrong with you?
-I'm sorry!

316
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,996
That is creepy!
You know how creepy that is?

317
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,277
-Enough with the pillow.
-Seriously, what is wrong with you?

318
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,271
What's wrong with me?
Summer, look at me.

319
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,472
Since I got back from San Diego...

320
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,790
...I've eaten raisins
and a pack of CornNuts.

321
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,270
I haven't showered. I've slept like
four hours in the last five nights.

322
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,919
-Cohen.
-What?

323
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,275
Look, Zach is my boyfriend.
You're not.

324
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,510
That part of my life
does not belong to you.

325
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,069
Yeah, I know that. Okay? I know.

326
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,596
And it's weird, and it's creepy,
I know. And, you know, I'm sorry.

327
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,599
I am very sorry.

328
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,349
Well, good. You should be.

329
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,518
You're ripping up your drawings?

330
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,113
Yeah, why not?

331
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,429
I'm only saying this for the people
that have to live with you.

332
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,154
Take a shower, Cohen.

333
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,152
Zach and I didn't have sex.

334
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,353
Hi. I had a feeling I'd see you again.

335
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,397
You wanna come in?

336
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,869
-I'm really sorry about your father.
-Thank you.

337
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,871
Sandy didn't tell me
you were coming by.

338
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,994
Are you in love with my husband?

339
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,073
Wow, direct.

340
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,435
I'm guessing Sandy
doesn't know you're here.

341
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,397
I'm sorry, I just--

342
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,073
Yes, I am.

343
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,513
I always have been.

344
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,037
Wow, direct.

345
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,871
If you came by to find out if
anything's happened between us...

346
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,069
...the answer's no.

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,912
I'm really sorry for everything
that you've had to go through.

348
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,835
But while you've been running...

349
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,912
...we've been building a family, a life.

350
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,996
And he's putting all that
in danger for you.

351
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,036
So you've just got to ask yourself...

352
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,509
...how much are you willing
to let him sacrifice?

353
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,191
-Ms. Wheeler.
-Ryan, hi.

354
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,112
Is Kirsten or Sandy here?

355
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,996
No. But if you want to wait....

356
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,236
Actually, I was hoping to talk to you.

357
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,633
I need you to help me talk
Lindsay out of the adoption.

358
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,954
-What?
-She won't listen to me.

359
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,590
She thinks I'm jealous.
Then we got into this fight.

360
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,228
I mean, we never fight.
Just, if you'd talk to her....

361
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,838
-Well, why would she listen to me?
-Because she trusts you.

362
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,759
And you know Caleb.

363
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,717
You know what he's like.

364
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,310
I don't know.
I know what you mean about Caleb.

365
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,438
But he has seemed different
since his heart attack.

366
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,996
And Lindsay wants this so badly.

367
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,673
What is it?

368
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,751
If she goes through with it...

369
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,716
...Caleb's gonna ask for a DNA test.

370
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,355
-Does Lindsay know?
-Not yet.

371
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,034
I love my daughter, Ryan.
And l....

372
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,560
I don't regret anything I've done,
but....

373
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,998
She can't take that test.

374
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,353
Is...?

375
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,116
-ls Caleb--?
-He--

376
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,799
I really don't know.

377
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,233
Sandy. Thanks for coming in.

378
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,075
Well, I don't know, Cal. Meeting
at an empty office on a Sunday.

379
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,154
It looks suspicious.

380
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,595
What I have to talk to you
about is very private.

381
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,591
Well, who wants to arrest you now?

382
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,951
What, the DEA? Immigration?

383
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,918
The Park Service?
You've been poaching elk at Yosemite?

384
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,390
What can you tell me
about getting a DNA test?

385
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,839
No.

386
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,038
The adoption party's in eight hours.

387
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,589
The papers won't come
through for a couple of weeks.

388
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,796
-That's enough time.
-You didn't do a test...

389
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,473
-...when Renee got pregnant?
-No.

390
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,949
It was an affair.
I was trying to save my marriage.

391
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,588
The last thing I wanted was
a record of my infidelity.

392
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,716
For 1 7 years you've been paying the bills.

393
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,952
The day you're announcing it,
you want proof. How do you think...

394
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,590
-...Lindsay's gonna take this?
-I think she'd want to know the truth.

395
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,877
Oh, cut it out. She thinks
she's getting a father. Not a blood test.

396
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,234
You brought me here
for my legal opinion. Here it is.

397
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,072
Ask for the test.

398
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,151
Now, you're a wealthy man
with a family.

399
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,311
It'd be irresponsible to do otherwise.

400
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,351
But as a father...

401
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,870
...I say, ask yourself if you love the girl.

402
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,838
If you do, nothing else matters.

403
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,632
-Hello.
-You weren't expecting me until later....

404
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,114
-What's going on?
-Party got started a little early.

405
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,033
I thought they weren't coming
till tonight. But, everyone...

406
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,236
-...this is Marissa.
-Hi.

407
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,793
-How are you?
-Hi.

408
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,830
-Come in. Let me get you a drink.
-Oh, no.

409
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,513
You know, I actually can't stay.

410
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,430
What are you talking about?

411
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,631
Well, I just came by to say hi.

412
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,199
I'll call you later.

413
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,032
It was nice meeting you.

414
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,794
Bye.

415
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,394
Marissa! What are you doing?

416
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,393
-Stay.
-No, no, I can't. I'm gonna be late.

417
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,472
You're gonna come back, right?
I want you to meet my friends.

418
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,790
And that in there didn't really count.

419
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,077
Well, I'll try. But Caleb's
having this party at our house--

420
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,232
-Wait. You're ditching me for Caleb?
-Well, not just Caleb.

421
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,075
-My mom will be there too.
-Wow. Now it's Caleb and your mom?

422
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,229
Listen, Marissa,
I understand if you're freaked out.

423
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,958
That's okay. You have to tell me.

424
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,429
But this hanging with your parents,
that's not you.

425
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,673
I'll just be there a little while, okay?
I'll just go, score some points.

426
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,752
That way they can't bitch
when I come and see you. Right?

427
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,037
Have fun at your party.

428
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,758
Tell Caleb and Julie I said hi.

429
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,714
Zach, hey. Over here.

430
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,515
-Hey, thanks for coming.
-No problem.

431
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,791
I meant to wait, but I'm starving.

432
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,748
-Yeah, you look like you're feeling better.
-Yeah, well, I am. I am.

433
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,634
I just wanted to apologize
about the other day, okay?

434
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,837
-I feel like I was out of line.
-No, it's okay. I don't blame you.

435
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,389
Look, Summer and I didn't
have sex in San Diego--

436
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,834
Zach.

437
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,958
-I don't think we should talk about this.
-I know. It's just....

438
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,509
After you asked me,
I started thinking about it.

439
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,355
And it's, like,
there we were, you know.

440
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,590
Two of us in a hotel room
on Valentine's Day.

441
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,832
It seemed like the perfect moment.
So why did I hold back?

442
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,955
I mean, I know why I held back.

443
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,076
It's this "no sex before marriage"
thing...

444
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,789
...which, not that I'm a crazy,
religious guy or anything like that.

445
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,430
It was always something
I sort of believed in.

446
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,830
But I thought you and the tutor....

447
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,589
No, no. I didn't say
we had sex, man.

448
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,557
I was 1 4, she was 30.

449
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,599
But, look, Seth.
What you made me realize is...

450
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,671
...I wasn't waiting for marriage.

451
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,796
I was just waiting
for the perfect moment.

452
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,076
A harmony of girl and place.

453
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,629
Oh, yeah, oh, harmony.
That's fine.

454
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,191
I mean, I liked the hotel room
in San Diego, but a villa in Tuscany....

455
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,715
I mean, that's pretty perfect.

456
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,394
That's awesome.
So, what you're saying is then...

457
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:30,556
...that when you two go to ltaly,
you'll achieve this harmony.

458
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,754
I just want to be straightforward
with you, Seth, okay?

459
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,911
So you can plan
your freak-out accordingly.

460
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,630
If you want to punch me in the face
right now, I'd be okay with that.

461
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,672
Enjoy.

462
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,478
I'm gonna go home, watch some VH1.

463
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,471
I think Best Week Ever is on.

464
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,758
Hi.

465
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,232
-Thanks for meeting me.
-Yeah.

466
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,311
I was happy
to get out of the house.

467
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,550
My mom and I got in this huge fight.

468
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,234
So I figured I'd get ready
for the party at my dad's.

469
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,719
What's up?

470
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,797
I wanted to talk to you
for a minute before everything.

471
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,869
Are you sure this adoption's
the best idea?

472
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,754
-What?
-Right now.

473
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,150
I mean, I know Caleb
seems like he's changed.

474
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,878
And I know I've said this before.

475
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,315
But it just seems like it's a little fast.

476
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,950
This is great.

477
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,999
First my mom and now you.

478
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,835
What is everyone's problem?
He's my dad. He wants to adopt me.

479
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,911
-lf you gave it a little more time.
-Why?

480
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,117
So, what, we can go bowling?

481
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,034
Attend a father-daughter picnic.
I mean, I've been waiting for 1 7 years.

482
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,758
I get it. It's just....

483
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,918
You think it's fast.

484
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,038
That I don't know Caleb.

485
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,430
That Julie's evil. I've heard it all.

486
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,397
What else is there?

487
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,399
What don't I know, Ryan?

488
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,111
-Lindsay.
-You know...

489
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,959
...tonight's probably one of the most
important nights of my life.

490
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,193
And I only want people
there who support me.

491
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,598
So maybe I'll see you.

492
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,277
So, guys, what's the big mystery?

493
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,317
Why are we all gathered here?

494
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,392
Well, if I told you, it would
no longer be a mystery, would it?

495
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,834
Excuse me.

496
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,031
You should get another glass
of champagne.

497
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,715
Because this is one surprise you won't
find already posted on the lnternet.

498
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,158
Is it weird that nobody
knows why they're here?

499
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,311
Yeah, well, that's my dad.

500
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,436
He loves the surprise announcement.

501
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,872
Well, I haven't seen your mom yet.

502
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,712
Oh, yeah.

503
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,154
She's not coming.

504
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,038
Oh, no.
Is she okay with everything?

505
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,633
Kirsten, is Sandy here yet?

506
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,633
No, not yet. He's coming
with the boys. Why?

507
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,712
I have something I want
to discuss with him.

508
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,470
-Business.
-Oh, it's a really nice party.

509
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,790
Yeah, thanks. Enjoy yourselves.

510
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,794
Well, it looks like everyone's
a little nervous.

511
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,438
Hey, Rebecca.
I brought you some Chinese.

512
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,633
Seriously, what was I thinking?

513
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,755
Summer was in the hotel room, saying,
"l can't. I'm still in love with Seth. "

514
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,559
-Well, weren't you?
-That was a rhetorical question.

515
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,513
-Thanks.
-Come to the party. Get your mind off it.

516
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,399
My mind off Summer and Zach
going to Tuscany to have sex...

517
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,472
-...and fall more in love than they are?
-Why don't I stay here?

518
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,790
-We can hang out.
-You can't skip the party.

519
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,560
-Lindsay doesn't want me there.
-Of course, she does.

520
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,029
Besides, you know what?
I'm fine now. I really am.

521
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,590
I finally realized that it's over between
me and Summer. I'm just venting.

522
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,990
You think you should
be venting this to Summer?

523
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,479
Hell, no.

524
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,437
Last time I tried to talk to her...

525
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,830
...she nearly decapitated me
with my pillow.

526
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,912
-I'm just saying, if you want closure.
-No. Closure's overrated.

527
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,674
I'm more of a fan
of open-ended unrequited love.

528
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,478
Okay, fine. I'll go talk to her.

529
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,596
But if I don't come back alive...

530
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,239
...my blood is on your hands.

531
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,435
My blood, your hands.

532
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,353
-I'm gonna go now.
-lt'll never wash off.

533
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,552
Your hands.

534
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,118
Come in!

535
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,918
Well, there you are.

536
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,709
What's up with inviting someone
to a party and then hiding in your room?

537
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,598
Sorry. I just couldn't face it.

538
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,110
-Where's Zach?
-I don't know. Confession?

539
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,198
What's wrong?

540
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,432
Remember how I said that in
San Diego Zach was full of surprises?

541
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,519
Surprise. Zach doesn't believe
in sex before marriage.

542
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,193
-What?
-Yeah.

543
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,079
But now, apparently,
he's changed his mind.

544
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,435
Guess who's going
to romantic Tuscany next week?

545
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,113
Well, that's okay, isn't it?

546
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,430
-You said you wanted to.
-Well, I did.

547
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,479
It's just that
when we were about to....

548
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,759
There was this voice in my head.

549
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,828
-Seth?
-And I couldn't get rid of him.

550
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,675
And then Zach said he couldn't have
sex, and I didn't want to explain it.

551
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,229
So I made him believe
that I still wanted to.

552
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,879
-But now--
-Well, hey, look.

553
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,952
Tell him you've changed your mind.
Zach will understand.

554
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,554
I know.

555
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,233
I should just trust him.

556
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,356
I mean, he at least
deserves that, right?

557
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,713
Right?

558
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,228
-I've been dating Alex.
-What?

559
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,635
I mean, Alex and l, we've been dating.

560
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,356
-What?!
-Just for a couple of weeks.

561
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,514
Alex?

562
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,272
Seth's Alex?

563
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,112
-Girl Alex?
-Yeah.

564
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,679
Well, who knows?

565
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,671
Just you.

566
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,391
So you and Alex.

567
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,079
So are you...?

568
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,516
-Are you like a...?
-No, no. I don't know. I was just....

569
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,193
I really like her.

570
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,873
Well, she is pretty hot.

571
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,759
Hey, look, you don't have
to say anything. I just....

572
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,076
I really needed to tell you.

573
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,633
We're still friends, right?

574
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,074
Of course we are.

575
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,039
Come here.

576
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,033
This isn't turning you on, right?

577
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,156
Ms. Wheeler?
What are you doing here?

578
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,197
I have to tell her.

579
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,679
All right, all right. I'll go get her.

580
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,637
Bring her out.
It'll be less public.

581
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,633
Ryan. Hey, you came.

582
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,754
Of course I did.

583
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,038
Everyone's out by the pool.

584
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,236
Oh, great. Wait. Can you...?

585
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,196
Can you come out front
with me for a second?

586
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,271
-What?
-It's your mom.

587
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,477
She's here. She wants to talk to you.

588
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,237
So, what, are you and my mom
working as a team now?

589
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,799
She's upset, all right?

590
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,554
Okay. Well, since you're
just here delivering messages...

591
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,915
...you can let her know
that in a few minutes...

592
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,310
...my dad's announcing
he's adopting me.

593
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,358
And I'd really like it if she was there.

594
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,034
But, if she's not, I have
one parent who supports me.

595
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,078
Okay, you can't--
You can't let him adopt you.

596
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,832
What are you talking about?

597
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,039
He might not be your dad.

598
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,110
-What?
-Your mom told me yesterday.

599
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,714
I just didn't know
how to say anything.

600
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,117
-No, that's not true. No.
-I'm sorry.

601
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,713
-Lindsay--
-Stop it.

602
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,954
Why are you doing this?

603
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,518
Hello, folks. Hey.
Will you excuse us for a second?

604
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,238
Excuse me.

605
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,555
-ls everything okay?
-Well, you tell me.

606
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,314
Rebecca is gone.
What did you say to her?

607
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,754
-What?
-You went to see her.

608
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,071
-What did you say to her?
-Sandy, this isn't the time or the place.

609
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,750
"Sandy, I talked to Kirsten.

610
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,559
I can't allow you
to put your family at risk. "

611
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,399
-You have no idea what you've done.
-Don't put this on me.

612
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,949
You could have gotten
her another lawyer.

613
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,473
But you couldn't let go.

614
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,232
I was trying to clear her name.

615
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,838
Tell me what you said.

616
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,355
I asked her if she
was in love with you.

617
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,158
And she said she was.

618
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,675
And you knew it.
You knew it the whole time.

619
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,796
I can't help how she feels.

620
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,714
-It's not how I feel.
-Sandy, you're asking me to believe you.

621
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,711
Trust you.

622
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,119
So do you trust me?

623
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,599
At the moment...

624
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,079
...I'm not so sure.

625
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,670
Then we have much bigger problems.

626
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,636
-Yes?
-Hi.

627
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,633
Sorry, I was looking for you.

628
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,672
Would you sit down?

629
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,358
I just thought maybe we could make
the announcement now, you know?

630
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,432
Just-- Just get it over with.

631
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,919
I mean, that's....

632
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,550
-That's all right, isn't it?
-Lindsay, sit. Please.

633
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,393
Or....

634
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,032
We can wait a little.
So that's....

635
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,154
That's fine too.

636
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,990
I know how much that you've
been looking forward to this day.

637
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,798
But I've been thinking.

638
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,840
I believe that it would be
best for everyone...

639
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,798
...if we postponed this adoption.

640
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,313
What?

641
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,750
Why? I mean...

642
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,150
-...what did I do?
-Nothing.

643
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,880
But you have to understand,
for a man in my position...

644
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,431
...why I would require
that we do a few tests...

645
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,878
...for safety.

646
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,997
You don't think I'm your daughter.

647
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,594
-Have you talked to my mom?
-I need you to stay calm.

648
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,832
She doesn't know you like I do.
She'll say anything...

649
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,151
-...to keep this from happening.
-You are misreading my intentions.

650
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,311
It doesn't mean
I don't want to adopt you.

651
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,717
It's just that l....

652
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,872
I believe in taking every precaution.

653
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,110
And I insist that we do.

654
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,557
For everyone's sake.

655
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,672
I don't need to take a test.

656
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,351
Because I know that my real dad
would not treat me this way.

657
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,159
Lindsay.

658
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,678
Oh, honey.

659
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,198
You stay here.

660
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,713
I'll cover for you, okay?

661
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,313
Lindsay!

662
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,959
Lindsay!

663
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,554
Linds--

664
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,997
Excuse me, may I have
your attention, please. Thank you.

665
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,357
I know you're all wondering why
we've asked you here this evening.

666
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,671
Well, it is my pleasure to announce
that the Newport Group...

667
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,239
...under my leadership...

668
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,439
...is about to launch its
very own lifestyle magazine.

669
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,832
Newport Living will profile hot Orange
County trends, events and fashion...

670
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,472
...as determined by me
and my staff of, well, me.

671
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,478
Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.

672
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,719
Hi.

673
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,478
Where is everyone?

674
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,915
Oh, it turns out I wasn't
in the mood for a party.

675
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,877
So the girls went out.

676
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,231
-How was Caleb's?
-Pretty much awful.

677
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,992
-Listen, I got freaked out.
-I know.

678
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,469
It's just, I tried to tell Summer,
and I couldn't.

679
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,957
Yeah. And then I came here
thinking we'd talk about it.

680
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,111
And you got even more freaked out.

681
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,748
I just figured, if I can't
even tell my best friend...

682
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,158
...maybe I'm not ready for this.

683
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,916
So you're here to break up with me?

684
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,718
Then I told her.

685
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,668
Wait, you told Summer about us?

686
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,712
-So where did your friends go?
-Seriously?

687
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,269
Well, you still want me
to meet them, don't you?

688
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,913
Relationships are like geese.

689
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,310
-They fly north in the winter.
-So true.

690
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,993
What are you talking about?

691
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,713
-You 're not going anywhere.
-What?

692
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,474
I was talking metaphorically.
It's unnatural to expect--

693
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,472
Cohen.

694
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,758
What are you doing here?

695
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,229
-I thought I told you to shower.
-I just came by...

696
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,231
...so you can get one long, final look...

697
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,039
...since you will never,
ever see me like this again.

698
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,997
-Gee, promise?
-Yeah, I do.

699
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,072
I was under the illusion that
there may still be something here.

700
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,392
But I know now that it was Zach who
didn't want to have sex in San Diego.

701
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,755
So I was suffering for nothing.

702
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,679
Have a great time in ltaly. Have all
the fun you want. I'm cool with it.

703
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,114
I'm over you.

704
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,513
Well, good.

705
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,116
Good, because, well, I think
that's where we both need to be.

706
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,840
I do too, which is, you know,
why I came down here.

707
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,309
I just wanted to lay it all out.

708
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,152
Well, I'm glad you did...

709
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,834
...because now I can leave
knowing that you're okay.

710
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,718
Yeah, I'm fine.

711
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,959
So we're parting amicably,
which is good. It's nice.

712
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,955
-See you, Cohen.
-Yeah, all right.

713
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,958
See you, Summer.

714
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,998
Send me a postcard.

715
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,879
Okay.

716
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,993
-Hi.
-Hi.

717
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,874
Is your mother home?

718
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,473
No.

719
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,510
-What are you watching?
-Hellboy.

720
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,389
-What's it about?
-See, Hellboy was adopted...

721
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,630
...by this scientist
and raised to be a hero--

722
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,837
But it turns out his destiny
is to open the gates of hell, so....

723
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,993
So he tries to do good, but he usually
ends up destroying everything.

724
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,639
Well, that's my kind of hero.

725
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,633
So....

726
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,872
How was your night?

727
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,951
Sucked. Summer hates me.

728
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,992
And yours?

729
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,196
Lindsay hates me.

730
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,679
Well, how about some Chinese?

731
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,476
-Take the edge off.
-I can't. It's....

732
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,034
Yeah.

733
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,872
Me neither.
