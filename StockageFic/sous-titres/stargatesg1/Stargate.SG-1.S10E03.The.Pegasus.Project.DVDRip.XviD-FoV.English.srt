1
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,512
VALA: Funny, he doesn't look excited.

2
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,947
Trust me. Like a kid
who was up all night on Christmas Eve.

3
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:22,181
I thought we imposed a moratorium on
cultural references I wouldn't understand.

4
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,279
So excited, he was up all night.

5
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,589
It's only because he was worried sick
about the success of the mission.

6
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:33,462
Get up, sunshine.
Time to see what old Santa brung you.

7
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,931
Morning.

8
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,229
- What?
- We just came out of hyperspace.

9
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,773
I'm guessing you don't want
to miss the landing.

10
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,103
What? What time is it?

11

<i>EMERSON ON RADIO: This is the Captain.</i>

14
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:56,082
Okay. He's a little excited.

<i>MAN ON RADIO:</i> Odyssey, <i>this is Flight.</i>

16
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,963
Understood, Flight. We have the beacon.

17
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,197
CARTER: Hey, you're just in time.

18
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,136
Are you kidding?
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

19
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,968
The number of times I tried to get here?

20
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,475
Only two of those times were my fault.

21
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,921
It is beautiful.

22

28
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,540
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

29
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,944
I guess I just wish my first trip to Atlantis

30
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,109
wasn't under such
desperate circumstances.

31
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,846
MITCHELL: It's just
another mission, Jackson.

32
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,855
One upon which the fate
of the entire galaxy hangs in the balance.

33
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,255
And he goes on those all the time.

34
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,883
CARTER: Vala's not wrong.

35
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,986
If we don't succeed, and the Ori manage to
get more ships through that supergate...

36
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:14,225
Well, like the lady said,
let's all just take a moment.

37
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,733
Okay, moment's over.
Let's go save the galaxy.

38
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,026
CARTER: The Ori supergate has been
inactive since they sent their first wave,

39
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,150
but it's been reported

40
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,627
that the Priors are promising
reinforcements for their armies,

41
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,096
which are on their way
and should be here soon.

42
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,099
Now, we can only assume that
that means more ships,

43
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,601
and these four are already more
than we can handle.

44
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,264
- We have to act now.
- Well, why don't you try dialing out?

45
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,102
I mean, if it's powered by a black hole,

46
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,642
you should be able to keep the thing up
and running almost indefinitely.

47
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,872
I'm sure they thought of that
before they came all this way, Rodney.

48
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,473
CARTER: It was what we were attempting
to do when the Ori fleet first came through.

49
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,781
Now, the Asgard have since tried again,
but for some reason they can't dial out.

50
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,050
- But you might be able to dial in?
- Well, that's the problem.

51
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:21,183
It was designed to dial in
from another galaxy.

52
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,091
Like one of the stargates in the Pegasus?

53
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,495
No, no, no.
The diameter of a stargate is not arbitrary.

54
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,624
There is a specific correlation
between the energy required

55
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,568
- to create a stable wormhole...
- And the size of the gate. I know that.

56
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,866
And it's exponentially proportional to size,

57
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:37,340
which means the energy required
to create a connection with a supergate

58
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,843
would far exceed that of an ordinary gate.

59
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,915
It'd be like putting together
a Saint Bernard and a Chihuahua.

60
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,179
And the problem with that would be...

61
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,186
Well, obviously it's a question of...

62
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:55,091
Oh, I see. You're mocking me, aren't you?

63
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,527
What? No. I'm not from Earth.

64
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,496
I honestly didn't get the reference.

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,727
Oh. Oh, well, they're both dogs...

66
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,166
McKay.

67
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,262
Colonel Carter, please continue.

68
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,967
If he speaks again, I'll shoot him.

69
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,100
But to answer your question,

70
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,007
we are introducing another stargate
into the equation.

71
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,205
Teal'c should have it in position right now.

72
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,512
If we can make a connection between that
gate and one from the Pegasus Galaxy...

73
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,210
You're going to try and make a jump.
Don't shoot me.

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,550
You know I can't help myself.

75
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,316
Jump? Can you do that?

76
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,451
One of Colonel Carter's more brilliant
planet-saving ideas from a few years back.

77
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,927
Stargate Command inadvertently dialed
the gate address of a planet

78
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,498
that was on a collision course
with a black hole.

79
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,624
P3W-451, if memory serves.

80
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,632
The only way to disconnect before
Cheyenne Mountain got swallowed up

81
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,673
was to set off a shaped charge
right at the event horizon.

82
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,572
Now, that energy spike
forced our outgoing wormhole

83
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,373
to jump to another stargate
that was relatively close by.

84
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,347
MITCHELL: And if we can do it again, we
can tie up the Ori supergate indefinitely.

85
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,418
Even if you were able to establish
an initial connection...

86
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,577
- We need a nuke. We know.
- And a dialing crystal capable of...

87
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,676
Already have one.

88
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,983
And if you want to keep the connection
open for more than 38 minutes,

89
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,321
you'll need to find a black hole
in the Pegasus Galaxy.

90
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,418
This is not our first barbecue, Dr. McKay.

91
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,430
I am just saying, the yield calculations
can be extremely tricky,

92
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,296
if not borderline impossible.

93
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,596
You may need me.

94
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:11,926
(CHUCKLES)

95
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,471
Colonel Carter said as much.

96
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,597
(EX CLAIMS)

97
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,504
We weren't going to tell him that.

98
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,639
John, do you think you could spare
Rodney from your team?

99
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,979
Hell, you can keep him.

100
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,246
Nice.

101
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,819
I got to tell you, Sheppard,
it's a nice place you got here.

102
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,021
Thanks. We just painted.

103
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:43,600
Well, good luck. And listen,
if McKay gives you a hard time, just...

104
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,931
Shoot him.

105
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,131
- Also, he's mortally allergic to citrus.
- Really?

106
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,039
I keep one with me at all times.

107
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,975
Just a comfort to know

108
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,646
it's there.

109
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,806
- That's good intel. Thanks.
- Yeah.

110
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,012
(STAMMERS) That's a good one.
We're actually... We're quite close.

111
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,349
Have you packed your bags?

112
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,457
Oh, right, right.

113
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,688
All right, be good.

114
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,629
Yeah, good luck.
I wish I was going with you.

115
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,927
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

116
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,003
This place is Daniel Disneyland. Wow.

117
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,071
- Just find the weapon.
- No pressure.

118
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,804
Yes, your desire to access
the Atlantis database

119
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,403
has seemed quite urgent, Dr. Jackson.

120
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,506
- Shall we?
- Where's Vala?

121
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,321
Oh, this way.

122
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,136
Well, Daniel, no wonder
you've been obsessing about coming here.

123
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:57,972
This place must be
full of so many wonderful souvenirs.

124
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,771
How much of the city
have you been able to explore?

125
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,713
Just over half now,
but we have the city schematics,

126
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,808
so we have a fairly good idea
of what's where.

127
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,386
Still, there are entire sections of the city,
and whole systems,

128
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,220
we don't even pretend to understand.

129
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:17,092
- Yeah, you could spend a lifetime trying.
- I hope to.

130
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,993
I ran that search you asked for.

131
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,465
I entered every pronunciation of
Castiana and Sahal I could come up with.

132
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,297
And nothing.

133
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,837
You didn't actually expect either
of those names to be in there, did you?

134
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,272
- No.
- Did you get the spelling right?

135
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,139
Well, that's the problem
with Ancient languages.

136
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,078
The pronunciation can change
within a handful of generations,

137
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,842
let alone thousands of years.

138
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,816
The etymology of an individual word
can be lost entirely.

139
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,819
Still, we know there's something
in the Atlantis library.

140
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,855
Hey, do we have to go in there
straightaway?

141
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,220
Can we do some sightseeing first?

142
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,849
Maybe later.

143
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,497
<i>EMERSON ON RADIO: This is the Captain.</i>
<i>Stand by for liftoff.</i>

144
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,940
You can check
my preliminary yield calculations.

145
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:09,140
- They're on that station over there.
- I'm sure they're fine.

146
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,273
It's the reason you're here, McKay.

147
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,718
Right, but first I just wanted to thank you
for being there for me recently,

148
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,051
in a time of great personal need.

149
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:23,060
Well, actually, you weren't there,
I was alone in the dark,

150
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,359
but, you know,
it sure seemed like you were.

151
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,866
- Are you telling me one of your fantasies?
- No, it was a hallucination.

152
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,335
Look, I had a concussion, I was trapped
in the back of a sinking Jumper,

153
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,497
and my mind conjured you up
as a means of survival.

154
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,074
It's just what you would do
in my situation.

155
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,040
Saved my life.

156
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,702
Okay, well, that's

157
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,105
- sort of nice.
- Yes, it was.

158
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,811
- Was I naked?
- Partially.

159
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,183
Check my calculations, McKay.

160
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,596
We use this room sparingly now.

161
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,190
It's a bit of a power hog,

162
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,929
and we can access the database
from workstations throughout the city

163
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,698
when we need to.

164
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,706
But for the first-time user,

165
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,941
this is the place.

166
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,502
<i>Hello.</i>

167
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,083
It's as simple as asking questions
to the holographic interface.

168
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,208
For example...

169
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,252
<i>MAN ON RADIO: Dr. Weir</i>
<i>to Stargate Operations.</i>

170
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,412
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,187
I'll be right there.

172
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,822
The interface can walk you
through your search until I get back.

173
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,588
Oh, I should probably warn you.
If she seems a little bit patronizing,

174
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:33,563
the program was designed to teach
very young children the Lantian systems.

175
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,099
Thank you.

176
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,197
<i>Hello.</i>

177
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,105
Hello, we're looking for a couple of planets
in the Milky Way.

178
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,802
- Vala.
- What?

179
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,572
What can it hurt to ask?

180
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,375
<i>You may enter your query verbally</i>

181
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,973
<i>or by entering it manually</i>
<i>on the console before you.</i>

182
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,110
I'll speak, if that's all right.

183
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,314
<i>Of course, but note for future sessions,</i>

184
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:01,416
<i>manual input is required</i>
<i>for most system interaction.</i>

185
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,018
I think I had her in grade five.

186
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:21,739
Maintain orbit at minimum safe distance
and keep sublight engines on standby.

187
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,977
Is that thing cool or what?

188
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,622
The black hole.

189
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,714
What you're looking at
is called the accretion disk.

190
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:37,694
It's matter trapped in the gravity well.
You can't actually see the black hole itself.

191
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,495
Which is cool.

192
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,636
We're in optimal range
for releasing the gate.

193
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,439
We can commit to the next phase.

194
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,707
This is Emerson to Flight Operations.

195
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,482
Release the gate.

196
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,141
Well, it's going to be a few minutes

197
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,506
before the gate's in position
and ready to dial out,

198
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,239
and I missed lunch,
so I'm going to fix myself a sandwich.

199
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,872
Anyone want anything? Anyone?

200
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,809
No? No? Fine.

201
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:48,427
Okay, that's Earth, and that is Taonas.

202
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,526
<i>Praclarush Taonas was one of</i>
<i>the earliest Lantian cities.</i>

203
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,366
<i>It was abandoned</i>
<i>when the inhabitants learned</i>

204
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,803
<i>their sun was nearing the end of its life.</i>

205
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,896
Yes, thank you, I know. I've been there.

206
00:12:56,008 --> 00:13:00,911
Okay, show me the order in which
the earliest Ancient cities were founded.

207
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:01,980
VALA: How is that useful?

208
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,844
You gonna join up all the dots
and draw a pretty picture?

209
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,916
JACKSON: I'm just getting my bearings.

210
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,815
You're gonna have to get used to the fact
this is probably going to take a while.

211
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,047
The way you approach things,
it could take the rest of our lives.

212
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,147
I'm sorry, but we're not going
to find the location of this thing

213
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,352
- by looking under "W" for weapon.
- "P" for planet, then?

214
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,258
I'm just saying, ask the question.

215
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,092
Dr. Weir already tried it.
It'd be a complete waste of time.

216
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,996
It would take all of 11 seconds.

217
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,468
Hello, we're looking for the names of two
planets known on Earth in ancient times

218
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,701
in the dialect of Old English
as Castiana and Sahal. Satisfied?

219
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,607
<i>Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor.</i>

220
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,576
Now I'm satisfied.

221
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,883
(SIGHS)

222
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,357
See, Daniel?

223
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,592
Doesn't hurt to ask.

224
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,712
Gate telemetry checks out.

225
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,941
Stabilizing thrusters are online
and power is well into the green.

226
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,074
We're good to go.

227
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,119
- Where's McKay?
- I'm here.

228
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,349
One of your crew wouldn't let me finish
my sandwich in the corridor.

229
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,948
Oh, the nerve of that crewman, huh?

230
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,560
We're about to try a connection.

231
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,493
Go ahead. That's the easy part.

232
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,728
Thank you. I've already sent
the remote dial command.

233
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,700
It's just going to take a while
because of time dilation.

234
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:32,771
Right.

235
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,141
- Wormhole is established.
- Of course it is.

236
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,916
Teal'c, I have a collect call
from the Pegasus Galaxy.

237
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,112
Will you accept the charges?

238
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,848
<i>TEAL 'C: I will indeed, Colonel Mitchell.</i>

239
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,859
Hey! How are things back home
in the Milky Way?

240
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,263
Secondary gate is in position.

241
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:05,326
There has been no sign of Ori activity
since my arrival at the supergate,

242
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,565
which was, in fact, several hours ago.

243
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,877
<i>MITCHELL: Well, we're about to get</i>
<i>the party started, so just hang loose.</i>

244
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,244
<i>TEAL 'C: I am hanging loosely,</i>
<i>Colonel Mitchell.</i>

245
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,344
Is it just me,
or does his voice sound deeper?

246
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,050
It's the time-dilation effect
of the black hole. Can't be helped.

247
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,459
Right.

248
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,893
So. Who wants to set off
a big old firecracker?

249
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,900
A 26-megaton, directed-energy firecracker,
you mean.

250
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,731
Not until we decrease the yield
by at least 5%.

251
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:39,895
CARTER: I knew
you were going to say that.

252
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,668
Oh, forgive me for not wanting to vaporize
the stargate on our first attempt.

253
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,438
We're on a clock, McKay.
We have to take the risk.

254
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,571
You know, I find your recklessness so...

255
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,177
Teal'c, it's Sam.

256
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,313
We're about to launch the first warhead
to the preprogrammed coordinates.

257
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,416
Are you at a safe distance
from both gates?

258
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,526
<i>TEAL 'C: I am.</i>

259
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,398
<i>EMERSON ON PA: Attention, all hands.</i>
<i>Stand by. Launching first warhead.</i>

260
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,369
Beaming device in three, two, one, mark.

261
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,245
Teal'c, what's the good news?

262
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,055
The delay is annoying.

263
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,523
Black hole time dilation, can't be helped.

264
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:39,495
<i>The news is not good, Colonel Mitchell.</i>
<i>The first attempt was unsuccessful.</i>

265
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,995
Okay. Let's try again.

266
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,507
- VALA: Daniel.
- Hmm.

267
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,441
We got what we came for.

268
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:52,968
I know.

269
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,636
Shouldn't we be out there
telling someone?

270
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,941
Not yet.

271
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,914
Okay, well, she told us
the name of the planets.

272
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,645
They were right up there,
glowing in the ceiling.

273
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,085
Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor.

274
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,019
She even gave us the addresses,

275
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,025
which means we could be out there
somewhere, overlooking Atlantis,

276
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,823
toasting with exotic beverages.

277
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,330
- There's something else going on.
- What?

278
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,525
Well,

279
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,727
it shouldn't have worked.

280
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,336
I mean, I didn't expect it to
when I asked Elizabeth to try,

281
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,342
but I thought
there'd at least be some remnant,

282
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,278
some vague similarity
between the words Castiana and Sahal

283
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,316
and their Ancient language counterparts.

284
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,945
- She wouldn't lie.
- I don't know.

285
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,545
But explain this to me.

286
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,951
How can this database
translate, in real time,

287
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,826
a language spoken 8,000 years
after the Ancients abandoned Atlantis?

288
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,128
That's a tough one.

289
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:58,734
Is there an archival visual record of
the Lantian citizens who fled to Earth?

290
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,572
<i>There is.</i>

291
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,579
Display them for me.

292
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,439
One at a time.

293
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,358
No, no, no, no,
those yield calculations are perfectly fine.

294
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,656
- They are?
- Lf your goal is to blow up the stargate.

295
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,197
Anything less and it won't add
enough energy to the matter stream

296
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,357
to make a jump to the stargate.

297
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,900
And anything more
and the stargate will be destroyed.

298
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,936
Look, you want to run high voltage,
but you've only got an extension cord.

299
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,164
It's impossible, and I told you so

300
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,638
- before we left Atlantis.
- No, you said it was borderline impossible.

301
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,003
Yes, well, we've crossed the border!

302
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,270
But, hey, you know, don't let me stop you.

303
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,242
Go calibrate your warhead.
Beam your bomb.

304
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,541
You know, Sam, this is not
the Rodney McKay I heard stories about.

305
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,876
- I know.
- What stories? What have you heard?

306
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:38,950
Well, for starters,

307
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,643
that you didn't know the meaning
of the word "impossible."

308
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:41,741
Well, I certainly know the meaning...

309
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,379
And that under threat of impending death,
you could work absolute miracles.

310
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,457
I suppose Sheppard told you that?

311
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,854
- Yes, he did.
- Yes, well, it's all true,

312
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,449
but I'm not under
the threat of impending death,

313
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,152
and I don't have...

314
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:53,856
Not yet.

315
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,433
Keep it up.

316
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:01,267
Well, I'll see
what I can come up with, then.

317
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,441
You know, Cam, he's not wrong.

318
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,946
As much as it pains me to say it,

319
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,107
the data from our first attempt
supports his argument.

320
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:15,209
Well, like my grandma used to say,
if at first you don't succeed...

321
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,221
Try a larger thermonuclear reaction?

322
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,416
Her words exactly.

323
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,395
Well, exciting as it is to view
the Atlantis family album...

324
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,735
I'm looking for someone in particular.

325
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,574
I don't know
of any 10,000-year-old Ancients.

326
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,885
I take that back. We know him.

327
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,720
<i>Moros was</i>
<i>the last High Councilor of Atlantis.</i>

328
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,384
Moros?

329
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,089
Well, apart from the funny hat,
he's the spitting image of Merlin, isn't he?

330
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,324
See, in Arthur's time, it was Myrdin.

331
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,263
You see how a word can change
over the centuries.

332
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,528
I know where you're going.

333
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,935
You think that Merlin, or Myrdin,
or whatever his name was,

334
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,701
came back to Atlantis at some stage

335
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:13,710
and hid these names here
as clues for us to find.

336
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:14,938
- No.
- No.

337
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,777
<i>The first human to set foot within the city</i>
<i>after it was abandoned</i>

338
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,751
<i>was Dr. Elizabeth Weir,</i>
<i>leader of the current Atlantis expedition.</i>

339
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,286
Are you sure of that?

340
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,152
<i>Evidence of his presence</i>
<i>would have been recorded.</i>

341
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,690
Well, darling, I guess that's it.

342
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,629
We'll have to leave here with exactly
that which we came here for.

343
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,222
No, I already knew
Merlin was in the archive.

344
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,234
I was looking for someone else.

345
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,826
Who?

346
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,165
You chose your words very carefully

347
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,866
when you said
"the first human to set foot in the city."

348
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,239
What about Ascended being?

349
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,217
You're not really a hologram, are you?

350
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,988
<i>You have your answer, Daniel Jackson.</i>
<i>I suggest you act on it.</i>

351
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:11,660
I have it.

352
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,330
It might require a little improvisation,
but I think, between the two of us,

353
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,838
- we should be able to...
- What have you got?

354
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:20,139
Our energy output problem isn't
one of degree, it is one of duration.

355
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,372
We need to calibrate an explosion
with a low enough yield

356
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,813
that the gate can survive,
but maintain sufficiently high energy

357
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,282
for there to be a cumulative effect
on the matter stream.

358
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,355
- You see, when I first realized...
- We use two bombs.

359
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,446
McKAY: Yes, I was coming to that part.

360
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,424
We set the second device to detonate
within a few seconds of the first.

361
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,824
- I'm sure you've...
- Made the calculations.

362
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,327
Yes, they're right here.

363
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:45,126
- Nice job, McKay.
- Yes, well, it usually helps to threaten me.

364
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,963
We only have four devices left.

365
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,042
And we need two,
so let me just do the math...

366
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,634
All right, so we only have
two more shots at this.

367
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,009
I'm also concerned
that two successive blasts

368
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,082
might overwhelm the stabilizer rockets,

369
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,584
drive the gate closer to the event horizon
of the black hole.

370
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,747
I'm not crazy about bringing
the <i>Odyssey</i> in that much closer.

371
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,056
I think it's worth the risk.

372
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,998
Do it up.

373
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:27,945
What is it, Radek?

374
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,343
Elizabeth, we've detected
a Wraith hive ship

375
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,813
with our long-range sensors.

376
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,713
Is it headed this way?

377
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,752
Toward the <i>Odyssey.</i>

378
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,117
- We should alert them. Open a channel.
- We can't.

379
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,315
The black hole is blocking
their subspace communications.

380
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,483
Well, <i>Odyssey's</i> sensors
will also be affected.

381
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,151
Most likely,
along with several other systems.

382
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,195
There's a possibility they won't see
the Wraith approaching them

383
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,323
- until it's too late.
- That is my concern, yes.

384
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,728
Dial Earth.

385
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,865
It's quite possible the Wraith were drawn
to the nuclear blast.

386
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,251
Stargate Command, this is Weir.

387
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:15,850
Doctor! We weren't expecting to hear
from you until 1930 hours tomorrow.

388
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,896
<i>WEIR ON RADIO: We've detected</i>
<i>a Wraith ship on our long-range sensors</i>

389
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:22,228
<i>headed towards</i> Odyssey, <i>but they're</i>
<i>in close proximity to a black hole,</i>

390
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,894
<i>- which has hampered communications.</i>
- How can we help?

391
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,294
If you can get our message to Teal'c,

392
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,341
he should be able to alert <i>Odyssey</i>
through the connected stargates.

393
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:34,538
<i>We'll have to send a team with a subspace</i>
<i>transmitter closer to Teal'c's position.</i>

394
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:37,342
Do what you have to do, Sergeant,
but they need to be warned.

395
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,816
- Yes, ma'am.
<i>- I'm forwarding you our message now.</i>

396
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,753
There's still time to get it to them,
but you're going to have to hurry.

397
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,187
Weir out.

398
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,889
I'm going to check in on Dr. Jackson
and let him know what's happening here.

399
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:52,986
Right.

400
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,202
I know you're still here.
There's no point in hiding.

401
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,704
I don't think she's coming back, Daniel,
especially if you shout at her.

402
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,469
Oh, yes, she is. She's come this far.
She's going to finish what she started.

403
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,238
You're not fooling anybody anymore!

404
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,180
Dr. Jackson.

405
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,374
Oh, hi.

406
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:12,884
Hi.

407
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,185
Who are you talking to?

408
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,414
Well, I don't know
what she's calling herself these days,

409
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,012
but at one point in history, her name was

410
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,614
Morgan Le Fay!

411
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,992
- Morgan Le Fay was here?
- Posing as a hologram, yes.

412
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:29,394
- May I?
- Oh. Yes.

413
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,740
<i>- Hello.</i>
- That's her.

414
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,713
<i>You may enter your query verbally, or by...</i>

415
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,648
You know, drop the schoolteacher act.

416
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,312
This is a computer-generated image
of a Lantian woman

417
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,821
who lived 10,000 years ago.

418
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,824
I'm pretty familiar with the program.
It hasn't changed.

419
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,660
Question.
Whose image is your avatar based on

420
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,355
and what's the purpose of your program?

421
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,956
<i>I was created by Ganos Lal, in her image,</i>

422
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,367
<i>for the purpose of</i>
<i>assisting younger minds.</i>

423
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,371
And what makes you think otherwise?

424
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,964
For starters, she told us exactly
what we needed to know.

425
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,407
She did?

426
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,638
Does this interface have the capability
of playing back events

427
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,714
- from earlier in the session?
- Yes.

428
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,807
Can you play back the last sentence
she said to me before she disappeared?

429
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:32,492
<i>You have your answer, Daniel Jackson.</i>
<i>I suggest you act on it.</i>

430
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,828
See? See?
Her demeanor completely changed.

431
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,870
She looked directly at Daniel.
It was really creepy.

432
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,541
Well, I did warn you
that she could be patronizing.

433
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,270
You said this device uses up
a lot of power.

434
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,245
Is there any way of determining
exactly how much power we've used?

435
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,144
Yes. Control Room, this is Weir.

436
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,616
I need you to access the power usage logs
for the holo room.

439
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:06,430
None?

440
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,054
Are you sure?

441
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,300
Well, the lights are on. Other than that...

442
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,392
Hey.

443
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:13,528
(SNAPS FINGERS)

444
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,002
Got you.

445
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,412
I think I owe you an apology, Dr. Jackson.

446
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:20,639
I think I owe you an apology, Dr. Jackson.

447
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,415
<i>There's no need, Dr. Weir.</i>
<i>I'm the one who should apologize.</i>

448
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,387
<i>(ON RADIO) Teal'c, it's Mitchell.</i>
<i>We're going again.</i>

449
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,259
<i>Looks like this is one of those days</i>
<i>when one nuke is not enough,</i>

450
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,425
<i>so we're going to fire off two</i>
<i>in rapid succession.</i>

451
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,093
Understood, Colonel Mitchell.

452
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,671
Maintain a good, safe distance, Teal'c.

453
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,002
There's a possibility
we could vaporize the gates on both ends,

454
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,075
if we get this wrong.

455
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,168
It's like five percent, maybe seven.
He'll be fine.

456
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,770
That's a comfort, Rodney. Thank you.

457
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,973
Coordinates are set.

458

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,154
four, three, two, one,

00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,658
mark.

461
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,942
The second attempt
was also unsuccessful.

462
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,876
However, energy did pass
between the stargate and the supergate.

463
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,048
Close but not enough.

464
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,383
<i>TEAL 'C: Indeed.</i>
McKAY: We still have two more bombs.

465
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,149
I say we increase the yield to maximum
and try it again.

466
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,918
You were the one who said a maximum
yield blast would vaporize both gates.

467
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,223
We've only got one more shot at this.
What difference does it make?

468
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,422
The man has a point, Sam.

469
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,991
Each attempt is forcing the gate closer
to the event horizon of the black hole.

470
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,330
To keep safe beaming distance,

471
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,962
I'm going to have to bring
the <i>Odyssey</i> in even closer.

472
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,472
And the closer you get to the black hole,

473
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,474
the more systems are affected
by its effects.

474
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,136
Sublight engines
and beaming technology are fine,

475
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:05,512
but communications and sensors
are all out of whack already.

476
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:09,109
- We're flying blind?
- Not quite, but close.

<i>Odyssey,</i> this is Teal'c.

479
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,497
My sensors indicate that an Ori vessel
is approaching these coordinates.

480
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,466
At their current speed,
they will arrive within minutes.

481
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,797
Is that enough time to try again?

482
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:29,567
Not a chance. It takes time to set
and calibrate warheads and detonators.

483
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:30,868
He needs to get out of there.

484
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,170
- Can't do that.
- Well, why not? He's a sitting duck.

485
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,542
What Colonel Mitchell is saying
is we can't allow the Ori

486
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,615
to discover the secondary gate.

487
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,651
If they do,
we'll never get another shot at this.

488
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,922
- You're an ascended Ancient.
<i>- I am.</i>

489
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,521
Specifically, Morgan Le Fay.

490
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,624
I thought I recognized her from
descriptions in the archive on Vagonbrei.

491
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,703
That's...

492
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,134
That's great.

493
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,502
So, enough of the tiny tidbits
of information.

494
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,076
Not that we're ungrateful,

495
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,042
but if you know
what it is we're looking for,

496
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:12,242
and as an Ascended being,
I have to assume you do...

497
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:17,350
<i>As Dr. Jackson knows,</i>
<i>it is against our highest law to interfere.</i>

498
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,288
But interfering a little bit is fine, is it?

499
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,224
It might be a good idea to be
a bit less confrontational.

500
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,695
But she's here chatting with us.
That's interference, isn't it?

501
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:27,992
If you really are Morgan Le Fay,

502
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,294
how do I know
your intention is to help us?

503
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,703
According to legend,
you were Merlin's greatest rival.

504
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,171
Merlin is both Moros and Myrdin.

505
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,971
<i>For a time in your history,</i>
<i>yes, I was his rival.</i>

506
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,775
<i>But we're talking about</i>
<i>many thousands of years, Dr. Jackson.</i>

507
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,783
<i>As you know, things change.</i>

508
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:52,319
<i>When we first abandoned Atlantis</i>
<i>all those millennia ago,</i>

509
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:56,655
<i>the Earth was so harsh,</i>
<i>its people so primitive by comparison,</i>

510
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,197
<i>there was no hope of living among them</i>
<i>as Lantians or rebuilding our society,</i>

511
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,257
<i>so instead we spread out to many lands,</i>

512
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:08,931
<i>some of us planting a few small seeds of</i>
<i>civilization among the first tribes of man,</i>

513
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,066
<i>others making their way to the stargate</i>
<i>at your southern pole,</i>

514
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:16,671
<i>still others choosing to live the remainder</i>
<i>of our lives in seclusion and meditation.</i>

515
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,341
<i>Merlin and I both chose the latter path.</i>

516
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,041
And so you ascended.

517
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,746
<i>It was only some thousands of years later,</i>

518
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,086
<i>upon seeing the threat</i>
<i>the Ori could one day become,</i>

519
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:31,458
<i>that Merlin retook his human form in order</i>
<i>to create the weapon that you seek.</i>

520
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,031
<i>He did everything within his power</i>
<i>to keep his work secret,</i>

521
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,498
<i>but we feared his intentions.</i>

522
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,729
<i>I was sent to observe,</i>
<i>and, if necessary, to stop him.</i>

523
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,271
Wait right there. Just a minute.

524
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,398
If he was human again,

525
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,773
then you were interfering.
You broke your own law.

526
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,143
<i>Merlin retained all of the knowledge</i>
<i>he had gained when he ascended,</i>

527
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,876
<i>as well as many powers.</i>

528
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,815
<i>Knowledge and powers he used</i>
<i>to create a weapon</i>

529
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,911
<i>capable of wiping Ascended beings</i>
<i>from existence.</i>

530
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,751
So you're saying he cheated.

531
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,321
<i>In a manner of speaking.</i>

532
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,926
<i>For that brief time in your history,</i>

533
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,328
<i>he was the most powerful being</i>
<i>on your planet.</i>

534
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:12,301
<i>He created a small enclave of noblemen,</i>
<i>with whom he entrusted his secret.</i>

535
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,836
Arthur and Camelot.

536
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,098
<i>Yes.</i>

537
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,232
So you're telling us that after doing
everything in your power

538
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,867
to oppose Merlin,

539
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,102
all of a sudden you agree with him?

540
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:27,048
Because if you don't,
then you're deliberately misleading us.

541
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,982
Teal'c, has the Ori ship detected
your presence?

542
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,756
I cannot be certain.

543
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,620
We have to risk it.

544
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:43,962
<i>CARTER: Teal'c, I need you to get the ship</i>
<i>into position alongside the gate.</i>

545
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:48,198
<i>From there, you should be able to extend</i>
<i>the cloak around the active stargate.</i>

546
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:02,084
You realize the Ori ship could be there
to rendezvous with a new fleet of ships...

547
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,212
Dr. McKay, why don't you go
calibrate your bombs?

548
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,224
That way, you're ready
when the time arrives.

549
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,890
Teal'c, the cloaking field
may be attenuated

550
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,523
because you've expanded it.

551
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:20,195
Shut down all non-mission-critical
systems and maintain radio silence.

552
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,780
Hopefully they're there
just to check things out

553
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,381
and they'll be gone soon.

554
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,311
<i>I have no reason to deceive you.</i>

555
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,914
No. Of course not.

556
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:45,655
So, what were you doing when
you were pretending to be a hologram?

557
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,960
<i>The learning program I created</i>
<i>many years before I left Atlantis</i>

558
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,002
<i>presented itself as a means of helping you.</i>

559
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:55,766
If you'd fallen for it, you'd have
your answers and be on your way,

560
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,738
thinking you came up with it yourself.

561
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,707
<i>That was my intention.</i>

562
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,679
I believe you.

563
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:06,350
I do.

564
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:10,350
I mean, I understand the fine line
you have to walk,

565
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,515
and I realize the risk you're taking
just showing yourself.

566
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,027
But I'm sorry, I want more.

567
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,789
And you can pass that on
to your friends as well.

568
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,124
Yeah, I know you're listening.

569
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,664
Because I am getting sick

570
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,496
of hidden clues and cryptic messages.

571
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,070
And Merlin was right
that the Ori are a threat,

572
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,200
but not only to us lowers,

573
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,436
not only to the billions of human lives
throughout this galaxy,

574
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,206
but to your own existence,

575
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,941
because when this war is over

576
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,716
and every soul that's left alive
is praying to the Ori,

577
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,913
feeding their need to be worshipped,

578
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,514
well, you know
who they're going to come for next.

579
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,956
I won't pretend to know
what that war will look like,

580
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,360
or on what battlefield it will take place,

581
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,932
but then I won't be alive to see it.

582
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,627
<i>If we interfere,</i>
<i>we are no better than the Ori.</i>

583
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:05,175
I understand that is at the very core
of what you are, of what you believe,

584
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,744
but I'm talking about survival here.

585
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,409
If you really are trying to help,
then help yourself.

586
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,106
<i>(ON RADIO) This is SG-11 Comm Officer</i>

587
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:35,333
<i>(ON RADIO) This is SG-11 Comm Officer</i>

588
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,500
<i>relaying an urgent message</i>
<i>via subspace relay from the Gamma Site.</i>

589
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,077

594
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,892
<i>"Good luck."</i>

595
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,662
Our last two bombs are ready to go.

596
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,668
That's great. Pick a spot and relax.

597
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,068
Colonel, sublight engines are
under a huge strain

598
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,231
maintaining position this long.

599
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,176
<i>You speak from the heart, Dr. Jackson.</i>

600
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:25,585
<i>That is what I remember most</i>
<i>from your brief time among us.</i>

601
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,816
<i>No, you wouldn't recall.</i>

602
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:30,121
<i>Those memories were stripped from you</i>
<i>when you were sent back.</i>

603
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,526
That's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

604
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:36,898
Of doing the right thing
and being punished for it.

605
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,232
<i>I've already gone too far.</i>

606
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:43,535
But you can't be the only one to realize
the Ori have changed things.

607
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:48,237
There must be others among you that see
that the time to join this fight is now.

608
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,181
<i>Odyssey,</i> this is Teal'c.

609
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,953
Teal'c, what's the word?

610
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,500
<i>TEAL 'C: A Wraith vessel is approaching</i>
<i>your position.</i>

611
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,069
Oh, Wraith. That's not good.

612
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,732
I'm sorry. How the hell do you know that?

613
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,475
<i>Atlantis has detected their approach.</i>

614
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,006
I am relaying their message
via Stargate Command.

615
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,518
There's no sign of a Wraith ship
on the sensors.

616
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,923
We can't trust sensors
this close to the black hole.

617
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,256
Shields to maximum.

618
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,830
Shields are only operating
at 20% efficiency.

619
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,196
It's the black hole.
We need to get further away.

620
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,593
Move us out.

621
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,212
Well, there's something out there,
all right. We just can't see it.

622
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,840
EMERSON: Damage report.
WOMAN: Hyperdrive is down.

623
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,747
- Can we return fire?
- Trying, sir,

624
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,185
but the Wraith ship is farther out
from the black hole than we are.

625
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,779
Emergency thrust, sublight engines.

626
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,518
Let's put some distance between us
and that thing.

627
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,722
No. You know what?
We need to do the opposite.

628
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:12,796
- What?
- What?

629
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,264
Against a gravity well this strong,
they've literally got the higher ground.

630
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,631
But if we can get them to follow us
closer to the black hole...

631
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,294
Then their systems will be affected
the same way as ours,

632
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,666
including their jamming technology.

633
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,502
Which means we should be able to beam
the warheads directly aboard their ship.

634
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,543
In that close, we won't have
the engine power to maneuver.

635
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,477
So we slingshot, and use the gravity well
to accelerate back out.

636
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,569
(EXPLOSION)

637
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,080
Take us in. Full power.

638
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:44,259
I know what we're asking you to do.

639
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:49,455
You're afraid the others will step in and
stop you from helping us, but maybe...

640
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,165
Maybe they just need someone
to cross that imaginary line

641
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,466
instead of just walking it.

642
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:59,339
There must be others among you
just waiting to follow your example.

643
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,640
<i>Not enough.</i>

644
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:05,341
But you have been allowed to go this far.

645
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:10,380
<i>Trust that you have your answers.</i>

646
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:14,117
At least tell us
which one of the planets to go to.

647
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,624
Please.

648
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,098
<i>Merlin's weapon is not...</i>

649
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,906
What happened?

650
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,172
Just what she knew would happen.
They stopped her.

651
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,778
We won't see her again.

652
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,142
Are they going to punish her?

653
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,954
I don't know.

654
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,259
I think I understand
why you came back, Daniel.

655
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,157
I wouldn't have liked
their company, either.

656
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,807
Shields are barely holding.

657
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,467
- See it?
- Not yet, sir.

658
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,636
- Maintain course.
- Teal'c, it's Sam.

659
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:09,713
We're about to try something

660
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,476
that will probably vaporize the stargate
at both ends.

661
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,942
<i>CARTER: You've got exactly 20 seconds</i>

662
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,612
<i>to get your hyperdrive online</i>
<i>and get out of there.</i>

663
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,192
There it is!

664
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,694
Wraith ship's in position.

665
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:12,469
Beaming warheads
in three, two, one, mark.

666
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,477
The Wraith ship has been destroyed.

667
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,239
EMERSON: Reduce sublight engines
to one-third.

668
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:50,745
Let's get hyperdrive back online.

669
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,372
CARTER: There's something else.

670
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,678
I don't know how it survived
the detonation, but...

671
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,118
- The stargate. It's still intact.
- And it's still active.

672
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,156
Odyssey, <i>this is Teal'c.</i>

673
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,256
Teal'c, I thought we told you
to get the hell out of there.

674
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:09,591
If I had done so, I would be unable to
inform you that the jump was successful.

675
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,634
The supergate is now active.

676
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:14,868
Are you serious?

677
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,530
<i>There is more, Colonel Mitchell.</i>

678
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,098
I was able to keep the stargate concealed
until the last moment,

679
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,374
and lure the Ori vessel
into the unstable vortex of the supergate

680
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,108
when the jump occurred.

681
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,875
You mean we just blew up an Ori ship?

682
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,681
By destroying a Wraith ship!

683
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,550
Indeed we did.

684
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,355
Today we have achieved a great victory.

685
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,238
She did what she believed
was right, Daniel.

686
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,832
How badly can she be punished for that?

687
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,010
I don't know.

688
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,580
Maybe she'll just get a slap on the wrist,

689
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,978
or be forced to write,

690
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,783
"I will not interfere in the affairs
of humans again"

691
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,786
ten thousand times.

692
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,792
Yeah, I doubt that.

693
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,626
She said you had your answer.

694
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,968
We found out the two addresses
we came here for.

695
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:21,902
Can you at least smile about that?

696
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:25,642
I suppose.

697
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,942
But we did find out something else, too.

698
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,070
What?

699
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,341
They're not going to help us.

700
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,518
We're in this alone.
