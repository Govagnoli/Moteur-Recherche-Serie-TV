1
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:29,266
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was trying to park.

2
00:00:29,348 --> 00:00:32,021
- Did you ever hear of signalling?
- I did signal.

3
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:35,817
If you don't know how to drive,
maybe you should stay off the road!

4
00:00:35,908 --> 00:00:41,460
Well, maybe if you hadn't been tailgating
me, this wouldn't have happened.

5
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:44,381
Oh, no. You didn't just say that.

6
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,301
Look, man, I don't want any trouble.

7
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:50,265
Too late.

8
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:57,580
- This is unlawful behaviour.
- Who the hell are you?

9
00:00:57,668 --> 00:01:00,466
Procedure is to exchange
insurance information

10
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:02,937
and, if necessary, notify the police.

11
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:05,383
What?

12
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:11,068
This gentleman did indeed signal, which
indicates that it was you who was at fault.

13
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,424
Pal, you'd better learn
to mind your own damn business.

14
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:42,067
Whoa.

15
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:46,266
I believe it will now be necessary
to notify the police.

16
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:47,622
Yeah.

17
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,903
Thanks.

18
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,026
Sir, uh...

19
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:06,499
Colonel Kendrick from the Office of
Special Investigations is here to see you.

20
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:13,547
- Does he have an appointment?
- You wouldn't return my phone calls, sir.

21
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:17,223
I was busy. Didn't think it was important.
Take your pick.

22
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:20,300
You know as well as I do
there's been another incident.

23
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:25,703
Your request for Teal'c to live off base
was approved under certain provisions.

24
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:29,986
- These provisions have been violated.
- Oh, come on, Colonel.

25
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:33,105
If you had saved Earth
from annihilation a couple of times

26
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:36,305
and your government told you
you couldn't go out to play,

27
00:03:36,388 --> 00:03:40,745
wouldn't you consider it
more a guideline than a rule?

28
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:46,585
We all appreciate what Teal'c has done for
us on many occasions. But he's a liability.

29
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:50,502
Every day he roams around in public
jeopardises national security.

30
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:53,500
Don't be so dramatic, Dick.
It'll give you gas.

31
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:58,946
Either you take action to ensure
these provisions are met, or the OSI will.

32
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:00,825
Hey.

33
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,899
Watch it.

34
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:09,067
I'll look into it.

35
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,059
Yes, sir.

36
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:22,546
- Hey!
- Daniel Jackson.

37
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:25,062
Just came by
to see how you're settling in.

38
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:27,139
Please enter.

39
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:30,782
Wow.

40
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:33,780
I like what you're doing with the place.

41
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:36,940
Jaffa chic with an East African flair.

42
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:42,102
There are many programmes on television
which offer advice on home decoration.

43
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:46,022
I'm a little more into
the History Channel, myself.

44
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:50,067
- Can I offer you anything?
- No, I'm fine.

45
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,343
How's the fern doing?

46
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:02,979
I don't suppose you've tried talking to it.

47
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,138
I have not.

48
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:09,338
Perhaps you should tell me
why you are here.

49
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:13,618
A guy can't just come by
and visit his friend?

50
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:22,739
Yeah. Heard what happened the other day.
Three KO's first round.

51
00:05:22,828 --> 00:05:25,388
- O'Neill sent you to speak with me.
- No.

52
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:27,140
N...yeah.

53
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:31,141
I broke no law.
I intervened to prevent a criminal activity

54
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:35,187
- and was forced to defend myself.
- You see, that's kinda the point.

55
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:39,227
Look, there's no reason why you
shouldn't be allowed to live off base.

56
00:05:39,308 --> 00:05:41,822
But you're supposed to keep a low profile.

57
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,980
- That is not always easy.
- I'm not talking about the tattoo.

58
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:47,377
Although I see how
that could be a problem.

59
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:50,062
I often cover it to avoid stares in public.

60
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:53,140
I tell those who see it
it is a tribal mark from my homeland.

61
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,662
This is less about appearance
than behaviour.

62
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:59,377
Have I not conducted myself
as a typical member of this community?

63
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:02,983
No. No, actually. No, you haven't. Um...

64
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:07,584
There was the incident with the old man
and the teenagers in the park,

65
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,545
the guy with the pit bull...

66
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:14,622
In each case, I was only attempting
to render assistance where it was needed.

67
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,097
See, that's kinda the problem.

68
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:21,981
Normal humans are more careful
about getting involved in others' business.

69
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:25,060
I know that sounds bad,
but it's just the way it is.

70
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:29,983
And you can't afford
to be drawing attention to yourself.

71
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:34,181
I understand.

72
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:38,259
Excuse me.

73
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:45,018
- Hi.
- Krista.

74
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,459
Made you cookies.

75
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:50,339
Please come in.

76
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:55,864
I'm sorry.
I didn't realise you had company.

77
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,623
- Krista James, this is Daniel Jackson.
- Hi.

78
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:04,259
- Krista lives in the apartment next door.
- Wait a minute. Dr Jackson?

79
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:08,057
You're the archaeologist who hired Teal'c
to come over from Mozambique.

80
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:10,787
- That's right.
- Well, then I should thank you.

81
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:14,827
It's nice to have a man around
who cares about his neighbours.

82
00:07:14,908 --> 00:07:17,706
Actually, we were just talking about that.

83
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:20,298
In fact, that's why I'm here.

84
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:22,538
The cookies were a bribe.

85
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:25,620
My pipes are doing that thing again.

86
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:29,864
Normally, I would be happy
to provide assistance. However...

87
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:33,384
No, no, no. Don't let me interrupt.
I've gotta be going anyway.

88
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:36,266
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

89
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:40,705
Uh, Teal'c. That other thing
we were talking about. Um...

90
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:43,382
Every rule has its exceptions.

91
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:51,899
Thanks.

92
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:57,061
- So, how are things in the galaxy?
- You know I can't talk about work.

93
00:07:57,148 --> 00:08:01,619
Sorry. I'm still getting used to the fact
that my girlfriend's a superhero.

94
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:06,623
- A bit of an exaggeration.
- The superhero part or the girlfriend part?

95
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:11,736
You travel to other planets to do battle
with aliens bent on galactic domination.

96
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:15,138
Even if you don't wear
a tight spandex outfit.

97
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,698
Although that's an idea
you might wanna consider.

98
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:22,542
Look.

99
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:27,099
I know this is hard for you. Any other guy
would have just freaked out and run away.

100
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:30,385
You didn't run away when I stalked you.

101
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:34,460
I just want you to appreciate
the position I'm in here.

102
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:39,224
I do, believe me.
And I'm really glad you stuck around.

103
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:41,663
I'm glad to hear you say that.

104
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:46,621
Cos I put in for a transfer
to Colorado Springs PD.

105
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:53,342
Are you sure?

106
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:58,183
I've never been more sure of anything
in my entire life.

107
00:08:58,268 --> 00:09:01,658
That's why I got you this.

108
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:08,943
Oh, my God.

109
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,548
Sorry to keep asking you
to help with my plumbing,

110
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:21,416
but the super's never around
and my boyfriend's not very handy.

111
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:23,863
There is no need to apologise.

112
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:27,497
Anyhow, you'll forgive me
once you've tasted my lasagne.

113
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:29,579
I'm looking forward to it.

114
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:32,341
- Yo, T.
- Greetings, Eric.

115
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:36,137
I saw you take out those three gorillas
the other day. Nice work.

116
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:39,061
In retrospect,
it may have been unwise to intervene.

117
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:41,343
Are you kidding? They deserved it.

118
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:46,347
Hey! Hey, stop that guy!
He's got my purse. Hey!

119
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,737
- Do something.
- I must not intervene.

120
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:51,581
What? You're just gonna
let him get away?

121
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,621
Oh, man!

122
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,268
- What a shot!
- How did you do that?

123
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:12,908
You the man, T!

124
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,740
Thank you.

125
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:17,827
That was amazing.

126
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,547
That <i>was</i> amazing.

127
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:22,698
T, buddy, you are the man.

128
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,507
Gotta give the man his props.

129
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:39,099
Krista.

130
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:40,337
Krista.

131
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:43,101
Come on, Krista.

132
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:47,022
Listen. Listen. Listen.
Just let me in. Just let me in.

133
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:49,622
- Doug, I have to work tomorrow.
- So?

134
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:54,657
- So, you're drunk. Just go home, please.
- I ain't going nowhere.

135
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:57,308
- Doug...
- Is there a problem?

136
00:10:57,388 --> 00:11:00,141
Uh, this... this is a private conversation.

137
00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:04,824
If it were private, you would not conduct it
in the hallway, nor speak so loudly.

138
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:10,457
It's all right, Mrs Connors.
Just go back inside.

139
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:18,266
Do you require assistance?

140
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:20,464
No. I'm OK.

141
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:22,857
Who the hell is this guy?

142
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,418
His name is Teal'c. He's my neighbour.

143
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:28,658
Teal'c?

144
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:31,820
What kind of a crazy name is that?

145
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:36,618
- He just moved here from Mozambique.
- No doubt.

146
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,383
Krista has requested that you leave.
I suggest you comply.

147
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:43,699
You'd better check yourself
before you get hurt.

148
00:11:44,748 --> 00:11:50,345
I have checked. I suggest you leave,
before it is you that gets hurt.

149
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:53,738
Doug. Go sober up.

150
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:57,980
You know what?
I'm gonna call you tomorrow.

151
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:07,303
I'm sorry about that.

152
00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:09,379
I hate when he gets that way.

153
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:11,857
This is not the first time?

154
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:16,259
So you have stopped receiving him.

155
00:12:16,348 --> 00:12:18,942
Not exactly.

156
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:21,064
He's not always like that.

157
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:24,823
Since he lost his job,
he's just been... you know.

158
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:28,019
I do not.

159
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:33,379
- It's been hard on him.
- And has it not been hard on you?

160
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:36,541
I'm fine.

161
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:45,184
- I do not understand Krista's behaviour.
- Yeah. That's a common problem.

162
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:48,704
There's a significant gap between
the experiences of men and women.

163
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:52,463
Among the Masai, a newlywed man has to
wear his wife's clothing for a month

164
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:56,621
- as a way of gaining insight into her life.
- If only it were that simple.

165
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,778
While rituals and customs may vary,

166
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:02,304
almost all cultures put pressure
on adults to form bonding pairs.

167
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:04,697
In ancient Persia, if a girl died a virgin

168
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:07,621
they would marry her corpse off
before burial.

169
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:11,337
- That's horrible.
- The groom was usually quite well paid.

170
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:15,341
It's bad enough being on your own
without every TV show and magazine ad

171
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,738
- telling you how abnormal it is.
- I think that's what I said.

172
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:23,948
They make you afraid to be alone, but tell
you only to settle for the romantic ideal,

173
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:27,100
like that actually exists
anywhere in the real world.

174
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:29,827
Either way, you can't win.

175
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,105
How's things?

176
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,826
Good.

177
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:40,618
- We were talking about Teal'c's friend.
- I thought we were.

178
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,860
- How do Jaffa couples handle problems?
- A dispute between a man and a woman

179
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:47,701
that cannot be resolved
necessitates a pledge break.

180
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:51,019
It must be requested by one
and granted by the other.

181
00:13:51,108 --> 00:13:53,099
And if that doesn't work?

182
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:55,622
A weapon is required.

183
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:15,063
Sorry. I don't wanna interrupt you.
I just came out for a little air.

184
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:17,787
Are you all right?

185
00:14:17,868 --> 00:14:21,986
I had a fight with Doug. I told him it's over.
I don't wanna see him any more.

186
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:26,619
- Are you not happy with your decision?
- I guess it was the right thing to do.

187
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,620
But he's not a bad person.
He's just having a tough time.

188
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,938
You have no cause to feel guilty.

189
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:37,625
- What was that you were just doing?
- It is called Lok'nel.

190
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,825
An ancient form of martial-arts training.

191
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:43,706
You think you could teach me?

192
00:16:07,428 --> 00:16:10,067
- Oh, hi.
- You are late for your training session.

193
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:15,097
Yeah. I meant to tell you. I don't think I'm
gonna be able to train with you any more.

194
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:17,543
You have been making
tremendous progress.

195
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:20,859
Well, I just don't have time. You know?

196
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:25,021
- Has something transpired?
- No. Everything's fine.

197
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,099
Look. I've gotta go.

198
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:33,667
You are injured.

199
00:16:33,748 --> 00:16:37,024
- It's nothing. Please.
- Krista, who is it?

200
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,417
It's just my neighbour.

201
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:41,021
Oh, yeah?

202
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:44,862
- The plumber. Mm. I'll handle this.
- Doug, it's...

203
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:47,178
I said I'll handle it.

204
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:56,581
Don't think I don't know
what's been going on here.

205
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:59,228
- She told me everything.
- Did you injure her?

206
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:02,744
What goes on between me and Krista
ain't none of your business.

207
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:06,218
If you ever injure her again,

208
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:09,902
I will kill you where you stand.

209
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:31,297
Carter.

210
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:32,867
Sir.

211
00:17:32,948 --> 00:17:37,146
I never thought
I'd hear myself utter these words.

212
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:41,625
I need that report.

213
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,699
Right. Um...

214
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:46,860
l-l just need to finish typing up my notes.

215
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,176
Uh...

216
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,907
I'll have it for you first thing tomorrow.

217
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:53,263
It is tomorrow.

218
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:54,576
Oh.

219
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:58,977
I'm joking. I don't need the report.

220
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:02,583
- Then why...
- Because something's going on with you.

221
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:06,377
You haven't tried to confuse me
with any scientific babble recently,

222
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:08,902
and that's a red flag to me.

223
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:15,218
Pete gave me this.

224
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:28,180
People normally wear these
on their fingers.

225
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:31,146
I haven't said yes.

226
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:34,106
And yet you haven't said no.

227
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,140
I told him I needed to think about it.

228
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:41,059
And?

229
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:44,900
- That was two weeks ago.
- Ah.

230
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:50,543
All these years I've concentrated on work,
I assumed one day I'd...

231
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:53,096
Have a life?

232
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:54,587
Yeah.

233
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:56,666
Yeah.

234
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:59,706
And now it comes down to it, I don't know.

235
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:03,667
I mean, every time we go through
the gate, we risk not coming back.

236
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:08,219
- Is it fair to put somebody through that?
- Pete is a cop. I think he could handle it.

237
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:12,544
- What about kids?
- What about 'em?

238
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:15,540
Do I take maternity leave
and then come back?

239
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:19,940
Do I drop the baby off at daycare
on my way to some unexplored planet?

240
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:24,704
Carter, there are people on this base
who have families.

241
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:30,063
What about you?

242
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:33,901
If things had been different...

243
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:41,423
I wouldn't be here.

244
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:53,540
Krista.

245
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,905
- Hey. I was waiting for you.
- Has something happened?

246
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:01,786
No. I'm fine. It's just...

247
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:05,222
It's over with Doug.

248
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:07,697
For real this time.

249
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:10,985
I'm sorry about what happened before.

250
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:19,545
I need to get out of here.

251
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:22,301
I can't even think in this place.

252
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:28,217
Will you come with me?

253
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,986
- Perhaps tomorrow.
- No. Now. Tonight.

254
00:20:32,828 --> 00:20:35,900
We'll just get in the car and drive.

255
00:20:36,828 --> 00:20:39,706
We'll take the whole weekend.

256
00:20:40,668 --> 00:20:43,546
It doesn't even matter where we end up

257
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:47,062
as long as it's away from here.

258
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:53,503
Please.

259
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:03,222
Hey. What's going on?

260
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:07,904
General O'Neill just got off the phone
with Colonel Kendrick.

261
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:10,548
Krista's boyfriend was found dead
in her apartment.

262
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:13,745
- What? What happened?
- We don't have all the details yet.

263
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:18,219
Kendrick said preliminary evidence
indicates that Teal'c may be responsible.

264
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:20,060
- That's impossible.
- I said that.

265
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:25,302
Unfortunately, we can't ask him about it
because he's missing. So is Krista.

266
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:29,540
As of right now, Teal'c is wanted
for kidnapping and murder.

267
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:42,383
Thanks for getting me outta there.
I couldn't be in that place tonight.

268
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:46,097
- Where do you wish to go?
- Just keep driving.

269
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:51,946
What? What is it?

270
00:21:52,028 --> 00:21:56,226
I do not wish to alarm you,
but I believe that we are being followed.

271
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:59,106
- Who would be following us?
- Perhaps Doug.

272
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:00,906
No.

273
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:04,016
He doesn't know I'm gone yet.

274
00:22:05,948 --> 00:22:09,384
- Then they are most likely following me.
- You?

275
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:11,584
Why would anyone be following you?

276
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:14,057
It is difficult to explain.

277
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,937
- Can you lose them?
- I believe so.

278
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:28,537
However, it will require me to violate
speed limits and safe-driving regulations.

279
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:30,937
I'm OK with that.

280
00:22:31,748 --> 00:22:33,864
Hold on.

281
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:48,897
Don't tell me you learned how to do that
back in your village.

282
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:55,305
There are aspects of my life
which I am not at liberty to divulge.

283
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:58,221
What are you? A spy or something?

284
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:03,862
One thing's for sure. You're not
Dr Jackson's research assistant.

285
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:07,543
That much I figured
after about 30 seconds.

286
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:11,336
- Krista...
- It's OK.

287
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:16,386
For now, I'm just glad you're here.

288
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:40,706
Hey.

289
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:43,985
- Thanks for meeting me.
- No problem.

290
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:48,102
Pete, I'm sorry.

291
00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:50,702
I need a little more time.

292
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:53,985
Look, you know how I feel
about you. It's just...

293
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:56,628
There are some things I need to work out.

294
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,141
OK.

295
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,061
- Anyway, that's not what this is about.
- It's not?

296
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,343
No.

297
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:05,988
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't so important.

298
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:10,017
What's going on?

299
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:12,178
I need your help.

300
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:21,785
Krista?

301
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:27,665
Krista.

302
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,982
Freeze!

303
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:48,539
Turn around, interlace
your fingers behind your head.

304
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:59,787
- Well, where is he being held?
- He's in his old quarters.

305
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:03,304
- Is he at least under guard?
- He's not going anywhere.

306
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:05,583
He's a murder suspect.

307
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:12,584
- I talked to him. He said he didn't do it.
- That's good enough for you, is it?

308
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:18,106
- Pretty much.
- You're not in charge of this investigation.

309
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:22,147
He also said he felt like
he was being followed last night.

310
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:25,220
The OSI did not have Teal'c
under surveillance.

311
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:27,299
Yeah.

312
00:25:28,548 --> 00:25:30,857
How did you find him?

313
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:32,939
We received a tip.

314
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,980
That didn't strike you as... odd?

315
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:41,186
I told you something like this
might happen. You ignored my warnings.

316
00:25:41,268 --> 00:25:45,784
Not so much ignored
as completely disregarded.

317
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:51,579
With all due respect, I insist that Teal'c
be placed in confinement immediately,

318
00:25:51,668 --> 00:25:55,183
or I will recommend
that he be held elsewhere.

319
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:11,221
What the hell...?

320
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:19,782
Daniel Jackson.

321
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:23,781
<i>Did you get my message?</i>

322
00:26:23,868 --> 00:26:27,941
- Who is this?
- <i>The symbols. Do you recognise them?</i>

323
00:26:28,028 --> 00:26:30,258
Uh... I don't know who you think this is.

324
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:33,545
<i>We need them translated into Goa'uld.</i>

325
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,699
I have no idea what you mean.

326
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:41,497
<i>We know it's the language of</i>
<i>the Ancients, but the dialect is obscure.</i>

327
00:26:41,588 --> 00:26:44,500
<i>You're the one man on Earth</i>
<i>who can translate them.</i>

328
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:47,705
- <i>Teal'c is in trouble.</i>
- How do you know about that?

329
00:26:47,788 --> 00:26:50,621
<i>We can help him.</i>
<i>We've been watching him.</i>

330
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:54,667
- <i>In fact, we saw the whole thing.</i>
- You witnessed the murder?

331
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:56,898
<i>We've got it all on tape.</i>

332
00:26:56,988 --> 00:26:59,946
<i>Concrete evidence</i>
<i>that proves Teal'c's innocence.</i>

333
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:02,861
<i>And it's yours</i>
<i>in exchange for the translation.</i>

334
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:06,861
<i>Of course, if you tell anyone,</i>
<i>we'll know, and the deal's off.</i>

335
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,866
The investigator who checked
the position of the body

336
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:23,418
concluded that the victim was pinned
and choked against this wall,

337
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,897
and then fell to the floor.

338
00:27:25,988 --> 00:27:28,786
- So...
- So, I'm not so sure.

339
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:32,421
The proximity of the body
to the wall supports that.

340
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:35,739
- But the position suggests otherwise.
- What do you mean?

341
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:39,218
If he fell into a slump,
his legs and arms would be bent.

342
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:43,187
His legs are straight
and his arms are placed by his sides,

343
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:47,181
suggesting that the body was
dragged here and placed in this position.

344
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:51,307
- Why move the body?
- Well, dying against the wall suggests

345
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:54,585
the victim was attacked
by somebody bigger and stronger.

346
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:56,977
Like Teal'c. So it was a setup.

347
00:27:57,068 --> 00:27:58,501
It's possible.

348
00:27:58,588 --> 00:28:02,058
- You said Teal'c thought he was followed.
- That's right.

349
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,582
The Air Force denies
he was under surveillance?

350
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:06,659
Yeah.

351
00:28:07,508 --> 00:28:10,580
If I was staking out Teal'c's place,

352
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:12,738
that's where I would be.

353
00:28:21,988 --> 00:28:23,979
Hello?

354
00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:41,622
From this vantage point,
you can see into both apartments.

355
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:47,383
Three indentations.

356
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:49,140
A tripod.

357
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,981
I think they cleaned the place up
pretty good.

358
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:56,141
- I doubt we'll find anything.
- So it's a dead end?

359
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,424
Not necessarily.
Is there a pizza place nearby?

360
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:04,222
- Why?
- One thing about a stakeout.

361
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:06,697
You never eat healthy.

362
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,704
Dr Jackson.

363
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,699
Keep walking.

364
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:25,461
You came alone. I'm impressed.

365
00:29:25,548 --> 00:29:29,382
- I like a man who can follow instructions.
- Are you the one who called me?

366
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:32,699
It doesn't matter.
Have you completed the translation?

367
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:37,782
- That's why I'm here. I need more time.
- You're playing with your friend's life.

368
00:29:37,868 --> 00:29:40,666
I can't translate
without knowing the context.

369
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:45,264
- Where they were found. What they're for.
- Do you think I'm stupid?

370
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:47,339
I'm not lying.

371
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:54,218
I can see we're going to
have to do this the hard way.

372
00:29:54,308 --> 00:29:59,177
- What does that mean?
- Either you give us the translation now,

373
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:02,146
or I'll be forced
to take this to the next level.

374
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:04,867
So, beyond kidnapping and murder.

375
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:09,660
We didn't kill the boyfriend.
But we'll kill the girl if we have to.

376
00:30:09,748 --> 00:30:11,864
How do I know you even have her?

377
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:18,907
- Come with me and I'll show you.
- Yeah. You know what? I got a thing, so...

378
00:30:18,988 --> 00:30:23,539
I have three snipers targeting
your position at this very moment, Doctor.

379
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:25,619
You're bluffing.

380
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:35,104
Position one, take the coffee cup.

381
00:30:39,188 --> 00:30:45,024
So, are we gonna take your car, or mine,
or should I just follow you?

382
00:30:45,948 --> 00:30:49,020
We checked a couple of pizza joints
near your apartment

383
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:52,942
- for sudden repeat customers.
- An interesting investigative method.

384
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:56,737
Yeah. I thought it was crazy at first, too.
But we got a lead at one place.

385
00:30:56,828 --> 00:31:01,777
A Caucasian male who'd been in half
a dozen times during the last two weeks.

386
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:05,543
- Is that unusual?
- We thought it was worth checking out.

387
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:10,099
We got a licence plate from the security
camera and we're running it down.

388
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:14,379
O'Neill.

389
00:31:15,188 --> 00:31:18,100
Kendrick is finally convinced
something else is going on.

390
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:22,022
- What changed his mind?
- Daniel's missing.

391
00:31:32,228 --> 00:31:34,822
So, you guys are ex-NID.

392
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:40,621
You're calling yourselves
"the Trust" now, right?

393
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:46,338
We want the same thing you want,
Dr Jackson: to protect the planet.

394
00:31:46,428 --> 00:31:50,819
That's why you watched Teal'c. You think
he's a threat to planetary security.

395
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:55,106
Stargate Command may think it's OK to
let an alien roam the streets unsupervised.

396
00:31:55,188 --> 00:31:58,578
- We beg to differ.
- Never mind that he's saved the Earth.

397
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:01,057
He is an alien.

398
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:03,378
Their motives can never be trusted.

399
00:32:03,468 --> 00:32:07,507
Anyway, he is partly responsible
for the boyfriend's death.

400
00:32:07,588 --> 00:32:11,706
If he hadn't shown the girl how to crush
a windpipe, it wouldn't have happened.

401
00:32:11,788 --> 00:32:14,382
- So she killed him.
- It was self-defence.

402
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,220
He was getting out of hand.

403
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:19,425
And you planted evidence
to make it look like Teal'c did it.

404
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:22,500
We saw an opportunity and we took it.

405
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:53,777
- What the hell's going on here?
- The situation is under control.

406
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:56,382
You were supposed
to get the information and leave.

407
00:32:56,468 --> 00:32:59,301
- He wasn't going to cooperate.
- He's a member of SG-1.

408
00:32:59,388 --> 00:33:02,903
Have you any idea of the resources
they'll mobilise to get him back?

409
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:06,867
Once we get the translation,
it'll be too late.

410
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:10,059
Bring the girl.

411
00:33:23,308 --> 00:33:24,138
Carter.

412
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:27,265
Sam, I traced the car
from the pizza place. It's a rental.

413
00:33:27,348 --> 00:33:29,987
- The name on the agreement's fake.
- That's our man.

414
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:34,141
They knew what they were doing.
I've got a bank account and credit cards

415
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:37,664
all from a guy who died six months ago.

416
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:41,741
Let's focus on the car. Find out if
the rental company has satellite tracking.

417
00:33:41,828 --> 00:33:45,980
I'm on it. I'll call you
as soon as I have something.

418
00:33:48,388 --> 00:33:52,461
Uplink is established.
We're ready to transmit.

419
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:56,663
We need those symbols.

420
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:02,787
Daniel.

421
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:08,941
What's happening?
Who are these people?

422
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:12,179
- It's gonna be OK.
- The symbols.

423
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:14,623
Now, or we kill the girl.

424
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:17,866
She's got nothing to do with this.

425
00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:24,300
Look, Dr Jackson. If it had been up to me,
things never would have gone this far.

426
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:28,540
It was supposed to be
a simple surveillance operation.

427
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:30,823
Then this domestic dispute happened.

428
00:34:30,908 --> 00:34:34,059
Teal'c got involved. We knew
you wouldn't help us voluntarily.

429
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:39,461
- So you decided to try blackmail instead.
- Let's just say one thing led to another.

430
00:34:39,548 --> 00:34:43,336
But in any case,
it's too late for all that now.

431
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:46,306
So either you give us what we want...

432
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:51,106
or I will kill her.

433
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:14,624
Oh, and by the way, we'll know
immediately if the symbols are incorrect.

434
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:36,979
Scanning.

435
00:35:38,548 --> 00:35:40,982
Transmitting symbols.

436
00:35:45,628 --> 00:35:47,664
Translation confirmed.

437
00:35:48,468 --> 00:35:50,743
Good. Get up.

438
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,303
Over there. Face the wall.

439
00:36:09,308 --> 00:36:11,981
- I gave you what you wanted.
- Move.

440
00:36:17,788 --> 00:36:20,222
I said face the wall.

441
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:24,061
Look, you don't have to do this.

442
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,178
Daniel.

443
00:36:39,268 --> 00:36:41,179
It's gonna be OK.

444
00:36:57,188 --> 00:36:58,541
Team two ready.

445
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,946
Go.

446
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:23,217
He's unconscious. There's no one here.
We got all the exits covered.

447
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:28,462
- There's no way they could have got out.
- How is that possible?

448
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:39,059
Thank you.

449
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:49,947
So, it's normal for the bad guys
just to disappear into thin air, right?

450
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:53,862
Not really. Now I think about it,
it's not the first time it's happened.

451
00:37:53,948 --> 00:37:57,463
- Just another day at the office.
- Yes.

452
00:37:57,548 --> 00:38:01,860
- It figures you'd be used to it by now.
- No, I mean... Yes.

453
00:38:04,668 --> 00:38:06,738
"Yes" as in...?

454
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,022
Yes.

455
00:38:11,508 --> 00:38:13,544
- Are you messing with me?
- No.

456
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:15,266
Which means...

457
00:38:15,348 --> 00:38:16,747
Yes.

458
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:19,262
- You don't need more time?
- No.

459
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,903
Therefore...

460
00:38:21,988 --> 00:38:23,182
Yes.

461
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,222
Be careful with that. Its contents are...

462
00:38:51,108 --> 00:38:52,587
..fragile.

463
00:38:52,668 --> 00:38:56,058
- Sorry.
- There is no need for an apology.

464
00:38:56,988 --> 00:39:00,105
I am grateful for your assistance.

465
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:05,827
Hey.

466
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:11,988
So, you're really leaving.

467
00:39:13,508 --> 00:39:14,827
Indeed I am.

468
00:39:14,908 --> 00:39:18,583
You know, you don't have to do this.
The whole thing was my fault.

469
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:20,818
There is no need to blame yourself.

470
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:23,866
The men in the warehouse...
I didn't know who they were.

471
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:25,984
No one told me anything.

472
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:28,298
But I know they were using me
to get to you.

473
00:39:28,388 --> 00:39:31,266
If it had not been you,
it would have been someone else.

474
00:39:31,348 --> 00:39:35,421
They would not hesitate to exploit
any relationship to their advantage.

475
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:38,659
- What did they want?
- That I cannot say.

476
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:41,182
Right.

477
00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:43,498
So, where are you going to go?

478
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:46,464
Back to where I came from.

479
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:50,063
- What does that mean?
- It means I must say goodbye.

480
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:03,267
This is all that was left.

481
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:07,179
Thank you.

482
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:10,539
Check it out.

483
00:40:13,348 --> 00:40:15,782
I am honoured.

484
00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:18,938
Later, T.
