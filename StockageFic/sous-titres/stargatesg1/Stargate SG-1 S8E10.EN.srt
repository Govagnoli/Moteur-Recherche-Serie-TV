1
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:07,720
Previously on Stargate SG-1.:

2
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:10,603
These liquids mixed together
form a virulent poison.

3
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:13,995
- Am I supposed to hold my breath?
- It is only deadly to symbiotes.

4
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:17,839
There's enough in that vial to kill
every Tok'ra on this base twice over.

5
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:22,476
Anubis once probed Thor's mind, gaining
access to Asgard beaming technology.

6
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:25,602
Did you think they would
let you tell a secret like this?

7
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:28,199
- What?
- They call themselves "The Trust".

8
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:30,355
They've funded secret endeavours,

9
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:33,721
aimed at controlling alien technology
for their own purposes.

10
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:37,275
The symbols, Dr Jackson. We know
it's the language ofthe Ancients.

11
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:39,481
We need them translated into Goa'uld.

12
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:42,602
So either you give us what we want...

13
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:48,399
or I will kill her.

14
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:05,196
What's going on?

15
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:07,276
Not much.

16
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:16,360
I hate the graveyard shift.
Nothing exciting ever happens on it.

17
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:17,719
Hey.

18
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:22,754
Just cos it's 3am here doesn't mean
it's not daylight on other planets.

19
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:30,598
There could be a team
coming in hot any second now.

20
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:32,994
Yeah, that's true.

21
00:01:39,685 --> 00:01:41,562
- So, coffee?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:49,399
Let me ask you something. It's late
and there's not many people around.

23
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:54,559
Do you ever get the urge just to dial up
the gate and check out another planet?

24
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:57,637
- That'd be a "no".
- Me... me neither.

25
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,959
What the hell?

26
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:24,153
The gate's gone.

27
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:26,956
I can see that.

28
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:31,835
Are we gonna get in trouble for this?

29
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,962
What about your instruments?
Did you detect any gate activity?

30
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:48,434
- No, sir.
- Did anyone approach the gate?

31
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:50,117
- No.
- No.

32
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:53,197
No unusual activity of any kind?

33
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,323
OK.

34
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,276
Sir, are we going to be facing
disciplinary action for this?

35
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:05,802
No, Sergeant. I think it's safe to say
there was nothing you could have done.

36
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:08,479
Thank God. I mean, there wasn't.

37
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:12,001
- One minute we're getting coffee...
- Wait a minute!

38
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,997
You were getting coffee?

39
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,354
I'm joking. It's just a joke.
I'm sorry. OK, that's all.

40
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:26,074
Thank you, guys. Appreciate that. OK.

41
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:39,077
I'd hate to be the guy
that has to explain this to the president.

42
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:44,964
Sir, I've got the video surveillance footage.

43
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:53,757
The gate disappeared at 0307.

44
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:57,838
There were two airmen in the gate room
and two technicians in the control room.

45
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:03,682
But none of them saw or heard anything
out of the ordinary prior to the flash.

46
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:10,235
Is it me,
or does that look like an Asgard beam?

47
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:13,522
It does. Which makes no sense.
Why would they take our gate?

48
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,674
Yeah.

49
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:19,885
Usually they ask nicely before they ignore
us and do what they damn well please.

50
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:23,435
What about the Prometheus? Didn't
the Asgard install beam technology?

51
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:26,995
It's in the hangar.
We're still adjusting the new engines.

52
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:31,715
There is another possibility. We know
that Anubis possessed Asgard technology.

53
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:34,239
We also know
Baal took over much of his fleet.

54
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:38,762
- You think Baal stole our gate?
- To be honest, I don't know what to think.

55
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:42,724
- I need some answers.
- That's not going to be easy, sir.

56
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:46,115
Without a gate,
we have no access to offworld intel.

57
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:48,765
We have no way of knowing
what's going on out there.

58
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:51,803
You'll think of something.

59
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:55,878
In the meantime,
I have a phone call to make.

60
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:03,033
Is Teal'c still on P4S-161?

61
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,242
His meeting with the rebel
Jaffa leaders should be over now.

62
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:11,274
When he can't contact us, he'll follow
protocol and head to the Alpha site.

63
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:33,354
Colonel Pierce. What is the situation?

64
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:37,233
We've been out of contact for seven
hours now. We can establish a wormhole,

65
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:40,158
but all we get is a "Do not proceed"
response to our IDC.

66
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:43,396
As was the case when I attempted
to return from my mission.

67
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:49,082
The fact that they're not responding to
any of our radio calls has me concerned.

68
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:53,477
Right now we have no idea
what's happening at Stargate Command.

69
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:56,284
I will return to P4S-161.

70
00:06:56,365 --> 00:07:01,314
The rebel Jaffa will provide me with a
cargo ship which I will then take to Earth.

71
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:03,441
Teal'c.

72
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:07,200
We're not jumping to conclusions.
This may be just a malfunction.

73
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:10,914
But it's also possible
Earth has been compromised.

74
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:12,802
Indeed.

75
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,197
- Find anything?
- Yeah, as a matter of fact, I have.

76
00:07:23,285 --> 00:07:26,277
I've been going over
security tapes and sensor logs.

77
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:30,597
For two days before the gate disappeared,
we were getting this anomalous reading.

78
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:35,361
We assumed it was feedback from
a recent overhaul of the superconductors.

79
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:38,039
I don't think so. Look at this.

80
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:49,000
- What was that?
- I don't know.

81
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:55,081
But this is the exact moment that
the sensors began recording the anomaly.

82
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,163
I think we need to talk to this guy.

83
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:13,276
Dr Kevin Hartkans. He's been
with the programme seven months.

84
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:16,801
Clean record. Nothing out of the ordinary,
except he's missing.

85
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:21,003
Failed to report for duty this morning.
We checked his apartment - cleaned out.

86
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:23,360
This is starting to sound familiar.

87
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:26,323
- You think it's the Trust?
- They've been busy lately.

88
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:30,398
They had Teal'c under surveillance,
blackmailed you, tried to kill Alec Colson.

89
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:33,477
Obviously, the operation
is bigger than we thought.

90
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:36,443
As far as we know,
the NID has been clean for over a year,

91
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:39,756
but there are still dozens
of ex-agents unaccounted for.

92
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,837
They continue to receive financing
from unknown sources.

93
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:46,804
If they could take the gate from us,
they could empty the vault at Fort Knox.

94
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:50,844
Not necessarily. If they could take
the gate any time, they would have.

95
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:55,237
But that doesn't explain what Hartkans
was doing, or the anomalous signal.

96
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:58,556
- Got a theory?
- The Prometheus has beam technology,

97
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:02,684
but not Asgard sensors, which means
we can't pinpoint specific targets

98
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:06,963
unless they're tagged in advance. What if
whoever did this has the same problem?

99
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:09,400
You think the anomaly
was a locator beacon?

100
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:12,602
Yeah. Which Hartkans
placed directly on the gate.

101
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,994
There's no other way to pull this off.

102
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:19,044
So my stamp collection is safe.
How does that help us find the gate?

103
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,595
If they want to use the beam,
they'll have to keep using the beacons.

104
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:27,122
We could request NSA satellite time
to see if we could detect the signal.

105
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:29,002
Do it.

106
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:53,956
M'zel.

107
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:56,434
Teal'c.

108
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:58,481
What has happened here?

109
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,077
When I arrived, they were all dead.

110
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:05,282
All?

111
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,873
I will show you.

112
00:10:33,685 --> 00:10:38,520
We took out the guards, secured the area.
Intel puts the signal inside this complex.

113
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:42,996
All right. You three are with us. Keep your
men on the perimeter. No one in or out.

114
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:46,555
Teams two and three,
retain on perimeter.

115
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:13,082
Sam.

116
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:21,314
- Daniel, these are VX rockets.
- Yeah? What's this?

117
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:23,555
- Methylphosphonothioic acid.
- Which is?

118
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:26,603
- Nerve gas.
- OK, putting that back.

119
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:32,195
- There's enough here to kill thousands.
- Why would the ex-NID be stockpiling it?

120
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:34,196
I've no idea.

121
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:36,594
Gun!

122
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:53,399
Ah! We got a problem here.
What do we do?

123
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:55,874
It's too late.

124
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:04,114
- Nothing's happening.
- This doesn't make sense.

125
00:12:04,205 --> 00:12:08,517
The effects are almost instantaneous.
We should all be dead.

126
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,396
You see?

127
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:54,158
We managed to identify the liquid
we found in the warehouse.

128
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:56,600
It's symbiote poison.

129
00:12:56,685 --> 00:13:00,678
Specifically, the new formula
we were working on with the Tok'ra.

130
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:04,917
More stable than the original, easier to
produce, but just as deadly to the Goa'uld.

131
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:07,075
- And the Jaffa.
- Exactly.

132
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:10,680
Which is why we agreed not to use it,
except in defensive situations.

133
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:14,201
Sir, the people behind this have the gate.

134
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:18,563
And rockets capable of delivering the
poison in aerosol form over large areas.

135
00:13:18,645 --> 00:13:23,002
I think the Trust intends to launch
a full chemical attack against the Goa'uld,

136
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:27,601
without any regard for the millions of Jaffa
lives that could be lost in the process.

137
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:30,279
So they didn't get the memo.

138
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:36,478
The guy from the warehouse isn't talking,
but he was carrying this.

139
00:13:39,845 --> 00:13:43,315
It's an Area 51 identification badge.

140
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,560
Colonel Carter, Dr Jackson.
Sorry to keep you.

141
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:56,796
Dr Bricksdale.
I believe you've been briefed.

142
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:59,353
- Yes, I have.
- As a result of our investigation,

143
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:02,243
we believe your security
has been compromised.

144
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:05,397
With all respect,
we're not the ones who lost the Stargate.

145
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:08,921
But alien technology
has gone missing from Area 51 before.

146
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:12,714
Yes. However, our security measures
have been increased since then.

147
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:18,402
No one's allowed to bring anything in. No
computers, cellphones or street clothes.

148
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:22,364
All personnel are searched and scanned
every time they leave.

149
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,916
Look, whoever took the Stargate
has access to Asgard beam technology.

150
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:32,284
When Osiris came to Earth, she used that
technology, activated with a wrist device.

151
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:36,278
After she was captured, that wrist device
was brought here. You worked on it.

152
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:39,562
And it's been here ever since.

153
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:43,081
If you don't mind, we'd like to see it.

154
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:52,634
Dr Harris checked out
some of the dead Jaffa on P4S-161.

155
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,114
You were right.
It was Tok'ra symbiote poison.

156
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:58,515
I would not have believed it
had I not seen it with my own eyes.

157
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:02,962
I knew the Tok'ra lost patience with the
alliance, but I never thought they'd do this.

158
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:04,717
Teal'c.

159
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:09,324
I have received word
from our Jaffa brothers.

160
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:12,203
Three more Goa'uld planets
have been attacked.

161
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:14,879
Millions are dead.

162
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,635
You see? Right where we left it.

163
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:42,402
Sorry if I'm a little sceptical,
but we've been down this road before.

164
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:48,677
- It's real.
- Like I said.

165
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:53,756
We figured if Osiris's ship was still there,
we could use the device to get on board.

166
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:57,155
But it's not only keyed to the presence
of naqahdah in the blood,

167
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:59,440
but also specific Goa'uld DNA.

168
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,996
We tried to create an adaptor using
samples of both, but didn't get anywhere.

169
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:07,236
So the ship is probably still in orbit,
but cloaked.

170
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:10,715
In which case, we have no way to find it.

171
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:15,518
The Tok'ra will be made
to pay for this treachery.

172
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:19,518
Let's just calm down a second.
We need to figure out what's going on.

173
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:25,077
What more do you need to know? Jaffa
are being murdered, poisoned like vermin.

174
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:30,034
The Tok'ra have had this for a long time.
Why would they decide to use it now?

175
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,913
Perhaps the failure of the alliance
convinced them there is no other way.

176
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:36,235
There's something else going on.

177
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:41,763
It's not a coincidence that this happened
just after we lost contact with Earth.

178
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:49,875
That does seem unlikely.
We must speak to the Tok'ra directly.

179
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:53,116
That's not so easy.
Ever since they left the Alpha site,

180
00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:57,039
we haven't had much intelligence on
them. We've no idea where their base is.

181
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:02,324
We know the location of some operatives.
Our best chance for contact is P3S-114.

182
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:06,159
An operative, Zarin, is undercover,
commanding one of Baal's garrisons.

183
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:09,840
- I will come with you.
- Whoa, hold on a minute here.

184
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:12,644
You're talking about
Goa'uld occupied territory.

185
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:14,955
There's no Jaffa fifth column to help you.

186
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:19,675
Without sympathetic warriors in Zarin's
ranks, how do you plan to avoid capture?

187
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:22,233
- We do not.
- What?

188
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:25,761
Only by being captured
will we be brought before the commander.

189
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,474
- That's how you're gonna make contact?
- We must speak to the Tok'ra.

190
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,476
- There is no other way.
- It's too risky.

191
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:35,240
Walk in unannounced and Zarin
could sacrifice you to maintain her cover.

192
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:37,680
That is a great possibility.

193
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:46,515
You realise the second you walk
through that gate, you're on your own.

194
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,922
Understood.

195
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:20,434
- What's the emergency?
- I can't do it any more.

196
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:23,164
You've taken the money.
A little late for cold feet.

197
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:26,840
You don't understand. They came
to see me and asked about the device.

198
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:29,997
- Who?
- Two people from Stargate Command.

199
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:32,883
- And you arranged a meeting with me?
- What?

200
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:38,078
You were followed.

201
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:08,162
Hold your fire. We need him alive.

202
00:19:58,685 --> 00:20:00,676
- Brooks.
- Go ahead.

203
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:05,555
We've got a problem here. Take a locator
beacon and get to Hoskins' last position.

204
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:09,160
- What happened?
- We've got an uninvited guest.

205
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:26,601
Speak.

206
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:31,315
My lord Zarin, two enemy Jaffa
have been captured near the gate.

207
00:20:31,405 --> 00:20:34,317
One of them is the shol'va, Teal'c.

208
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:38,794
Are you certain?

209
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:44,876
I am. Lord Baal will be
most pleased, will he not?

210
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:49,561
Yes. Of course.

211
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:52,321
You have done well.

212
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:55,484
Now bring them to me.

213
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:57,795
Yes, my lord.

214
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:10,678
I'm going to ask you again.

215
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:12,835
Where is Colonel Carter?

216
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:14,916
I don't know.

217
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:36,955
- You're gonna need to start cooperating.
- I can't.

218
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:42,278
An officer of the US Air Force and member
of a top-secret organisation is missing,

219
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:44,595
and you're implicated.

220
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:48,360
I don't think you're gonna
just walk away from this.

221
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:51,562
- They'll kill me.
- We can protect you.

222
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:59,921
And we can also choose to ignore
your $2 million Cayman Island account.

223
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:06,244
You didn't think
we'd find out about that, huh?

224
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:14,238
So if I help you, I can keep the money?

225
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:17,317
We could come to an arrangement.

226
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:39,275
The prisoners, my lord.

227
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:42,320
Leave us.

228
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:44,760
My lord?

229
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:49,282
I intend to question them myself.
Leave us now!

230
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:02,038
Are you mad? What are you doing here?

231
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,685
- We must speak with you.
- Speak with me?

232
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:08,599
Do you not realise, by coming here
you have placed all our lives in danger?

233
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:12,200
- Are you not in control of this garrison?
- I am.

234
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:17,962
And as such, it is my responsibility to see
to it that you are tortured for information,

235
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:22,323
until such time that Baal arrives
to witness your execution.

236
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,195
So what's it gonna be?

237
00:23:37,805 --> 00:23:41,480
You said Colonel Carter was missing?

238
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:46,439
Well, she's probably on the ship.

239
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,755
Osiris's ship?

240
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:52,042
So you did manage to get on board.

241
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:56,877
About a year ago,
some men came to see me.

242
00:23:56,965 --> 00:24:00,514
They knew everything about my work.
The Stargate, Osiris.

243
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,314
They knew there was a possibility
a cloaked ship had been left in orbit

244
00:24:04,405 --> 00:24:06,999
and they wanted it badly.

245
00:24:07,085 --> 00:24:09,963
I told them that the key
was the wrist device,

246
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:13,196
but I couldn't get it out -
at least, not through the front door.

247
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,162
What do you mean?

248
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,999
One day I was in the lab
working on the adaptor.

249
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:21,724
Next thing I know,
I found myself on the ship.

250
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:25,434
I had remotely activated
the transport beam.

251
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:28,119
Which you failed to report.

252
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:34,844
It was killing me that I wasn't able
to tell anybody I'd figured it out.

253
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:37,234
I had to keep telling them
it wasn't working.

254
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:40,874
Anyway, after that,
I went back and forth half a dozen times.

255
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:44,594
But at the end of the day the device
was always back where it belonged.

256
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:47,483
And you beamed the others up
using locator beacons?

257
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:51,353
The beam was the only thing
that worked without the command codes.

258
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:54,642
And that's where you came in.

259
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:56,920
The translation.

260
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:00,799
Osiris worked for Anubis.

261
00:25:00,885 --> 00:25:05,322
And Anubis had all his command codes
translated into Ancient.

262
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:09,159
Once they had control of the ship,
thanks to you, they had no need for me.

263
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:13,761
They kept a permanent presence
up there 24-7, worked in shifts.

264
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,838
I went back to Area 51
and sabotaged the adaptor.

265
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:22,318
Project was shelved
and no one was the wiser.

266
00:25:22,405 --> 00:25:25,124
Can you get the wrist device
to work again?

267
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:27,275
Absolutely.

268
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:40,118
Launch window in three minutes.
Ready for upgrade.

269
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:44,278
Get down to the engine room.
Check the power relays.

270
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:47,242
Sir.

271
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,519
Colonel Carter, welcome aboard.

272
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:54,243
Where are we?

273
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:56,759
We're in a polar orbit around the moon.

274
00:25:56,845 --> 00:26:01,236
- Cloaked, of course.
- This is the ship Osiris left behind.

275
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:05,398
We have to thank you. If you hadn't caught
her, we'd never have had this opportunity.

276
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:09,797
- You know they're gonna come after you.
- Prometheus is undergoing a refit.

277
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:14,276
They have sub-light engines. Once they
realise you're in a ship, they'll launch.

278
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:17,038
Even with a cloak,
you give off an energy signature.

279
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,320
We're operating at minimal power.

280
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:23,080
Maybe after a year of intensive scans,
they might be able to find us.

281
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:27,841
- But this won't take that long.
- You're gonna attack the Goa'uld.

282
00:26:27,925 --> 00:26:30,041
We already have.

283
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:35,245
We're starting with Baal's territory, since
he's the most immediate threat right now.

284
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:39,364
- You realise you're killing innocent Jaffa?
- Spare me, Colonel.

285
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:42,994
The Jaffa are a race of warriors,
bred specifically to serve the Goa'uld

286
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:45,315
and enslave humans
throughout the galaxy.

287
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:50,195
They're brought up to believe the Goa'uld
are their gods. They don't have a choice.

288
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:54,881
So they're just following orders, right?
Where have I heard that argument before?

289
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:58,480
What about the rebel Jaffa?
They're growing in numbers every day.

290
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:02,956
We consider them... acceptable losses.

291
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:07,197
It's very simple, Colonel.
Earth faces an imminent threat,

292
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:10,755
and we have a weapon
that can eliminate that threat.

293
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:13,405
We intend to use it.

294
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:16,077
We're ready.

295
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:20,514
What's the next target?

296
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:24,839
P3S-114.

297
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:27,359
Dial it.

298
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,754
Yes, sir.

299
00:27:35,805 --> 00:27:38,842
You force me to choose
between abandoning my mission

300
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:41,155
and allowing you to die.

301
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:45,443
I would worry more about my own life
if I were you, Tok'ra.

302
00:27:45,525 --> 00:27:47,322
M'zel.

303
00:27:49,325 --> 00:27:51,919
I feel as you do, brother...

304
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:56,042
but this is not the way.

305
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:09,400
- Why are you here?
- We know about the attacks.

306
00:28:09,485 --> 00:28:13,763
- What attacks?
- The Tok'ra are using symbiote poison.

307
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:17,235
The Jaffa of three worlds
have been annihilated thus far.

308
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:20,601
- Impossible.
- We have seen it with our own eyes.

309
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:25,554
An entire Jaffa army lying dead
with no wounds, no signs of battle.

310
00:28:25,645 --> 00:28:29,240
- How do you explain this?
- I cannot.

311
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:33,284
But I can assure you
that the Tok'ra are not responsible.

312
00:28:33,365 --> 00:28:37,722
If these attacks had been planned,
I would have been informed.

313
00:28:45,805 --> 00:28:48,080
Initiating launch sequence.

314
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:53,285
- You can't do this. It's murder.
- That's where you're wrong. It's war.

315
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:56,835
Launching in three, two, one...

316
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:17,876
What was that?

317
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,524
My lord, we are under attack.

318
00:29:23,605 --> 00:29:26,165
- How?
- A weapon was fired through the gate.

319
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:28,713
It exploded over the city...

320
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:30,557
Lord Zarin.

321
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:34,443
Lord Zarin.

322
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:43,444
Brothers, you must leave immediately.

323
00:29:43,525 --> 00:29:45,675
Kree ta'lak!

324
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:51,601
- You are not going anywhere, shol'va.
- You do not understand.

325
00:29:57,605 --> 00:29:58,833
M'zel.

326
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:01,075
There may still be time.

327
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:11,480
I die free.

328
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,082
Indeed.

329
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:51,595
Sensor grid R-14 shows no anomalies, sir.

330
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:54,916
- Very well. Proceed to the next grid.
- Yes, sir.

331
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:57,724
She's out there somewhere.

332
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:11,160
Make it work.

333
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:16,797
Our next target is P5R-357.

334
00:31:16,885 --> 00:31:19,683
- Let's do it.
- I wouldn't bother.

335
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:25,674
Baal abandoned that planet six months
ago when the naqahdah mines went dry.

336
00:31:25,765 --> 00:31:27,483
She's lying.

337
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:33,435
Go ahead. Waste another rocket. That's
one less planet you'll be able to destroy.

338
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:38,598
She does have
more up-to-date intelligence.

339
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:42,282
She's bluffing.

340
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:47,393
You could make this a lot less painful
if you help us select optimum targets.

341
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:48,713
What?

342
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:53,595
You know as much about the current
positions of the System Lords as anyone.

343
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:57,439
- I don't know as much as you think.
- You know enough to get maximum effect

344
00:31:57,525 --> 00:32:00,198
with minimum collateral damage.

345
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:04,483
You're the one who wants
to save innocent lives.

346
00:32:04,565 --> 00:32:06,556
Nice try.

347
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:11,803
So, are we going for P5R-357 or not?

348
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:19,758
Go to the next one on the list.

349
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:40,480
All right.
Tell me again why I should agree to this.

350
00:32:40,565 --> 00:32:45,685
It's the only way onto the ship and I have
the best chance of deciphering the code.

351
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:48,598
And if there are ten armed goons
when you get there,

352
00:32:48,685 --> 00:32:51,404
you're the one that's gonna get...

353
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:55,838
Better ideas?

354
00:32:55,925 --> 00:33:01,921
Look, Daniel, just because I don't have
a better idea is no reason to do anything.

355
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:06,960
Look, once I shut down the cloak,
Prometheus can pinpoint the location.

356
00:33:07,045 --> 00:33:11,004
Then all I do is disable the hyperdrive
and wait. They'll never see it coming.

357
00:33:11,085 --> 00:33:15,397
Which is one of the advantages
of a totally insane idea.

358
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:18,204
Yeah, where did I learn that from?

359
00:33:20,405 --> 00:33:22,202
OK.

360
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:41,435
See you soon.

361
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:08,075
Come on.

362
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:12,962
Fine.

363
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:37,115
Sir, we have something. Definitely a ship.
Bearings, 157 by 229. 500,000km.

364
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:41,039
- Battle stations. Plot an intercept course.
- Yes, sir.

365
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:44,003
- General O'Neill, this is Prometheus.
- Go ahead.

366
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:48,158
Looks like Dr Jackson pulled it off. We
have them on screen and are moving in.

367
00:34:48,245 --> 00:34:49,473
Understood.

368
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:04,635
We've got a problem. I just monitored
a 60% drop in our power consumption.

369
00:35:04,725 --> 00:35:07,523
The cloak. Stay with her.

370
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:42,278
Get up to the bridge.
Get that cloak back online.

371
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:52,042
- We're in weapons range, sir.
- Have they noticed us yet?

372
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:55,720
I don't think so. They're at minimal power.
No evasive manoeuvres.

373
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:59,684
- What about the hyperdrive?
- Still no signal from Dr Jackson.

374
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:03,358
General, we have a problem.
Ship's cloak is down,

375
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:08,155
but Dr Jackson has yet to confirm
ifhe's disabled the hyperdrive or not.

376
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:10,236
Give him a little more time.

377
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:14,796
Right now they're sitting ducks. If they
spot us and run, we won't catch them.

378
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:20,005
We can't let them get away.
I recommend we open fire immediately.

379
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:25,084
General, please advise.

380
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:57,283
- Where the hell did he come from?
- He had the wrist device.

381
00:36:57,725 --> 00:37:01,559
- Any chance there's more of them?
- It only lets one person up at a time.

382
00:37:01,645 --> 00:37:04,159
- Hoskins, this is Brooks.
- Go ahead.

383
00:37:04,685 --> 00:37:09,076
The cloak's been disabled.
I don't know if I can get it back online.

384
00:37:09,165 --> 00:37:13,283
This position is compromised.
We need to get out of here now.

385
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,799
- What about them?
- We can't take them with us.

386
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:19,480
- I don't mind going for a little ride.
- Me neither.

387
00:37:21,645 --> 00:37:24,478
Sorry about this, Dr Jackson.

388
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:30,280
Incoming.

389
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:40,757
This is Teal'c of SG-1.

390
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:43,075
Please respond.

391
00:37:43,165 --> 00:37:45,474
This is Teal'c of SG-1.

392
00:37:46,325 --> 00:37:51,718
Repeat. This is Teal'c. Does anyone read?
Repeat. This is Teal'c.

393
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:55,844
Teal'c, this is Daniel.
We need your help. Come on through.

394
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:13,641
Somebody want to untie me?

395
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:18,037
Cargo hold,
what's happening down there?

396
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:23,757
Cargo hold, respond. Jennings, Hoskins,
where the hell are you?

397
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:48,196
What's happening?

398
00:38:55,325 --> 00:39:00,001
She's bringing the hyperdrive online.
Get to the gate.

399
00:39:07,365 --> 00:39:10,243
- They're trying to run, sir.
- Damn it.

400
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:14,113
General, they are powering up
their hyperdrive. We are out of options.

401
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:18,517
- Can you disable it without destroying it?
- I cannot give you any guarantees.

402
00:39:25,765 --> 00:39:28,359
Sir, we're picking up
a signal from the ship.

403
00:39:28,445 --> 00:39:31,164
- What is it?
- Locator beacon, sir. Same frequency.

404
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,759
Lock on the signal.
Activate transport beam.

405
00:39:33,845 --> 00:39:35,278
Beam activated.

406
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,321
- The ship's gone, sir.
- Cargo bay, report.

407
00:39:47,405 --> 00:39:51,762
This is cargo bay. We have the gate,
Teal'c, Colonel Carter and Dr Jackson.

408
00:39:51,845 --> 00:39:54,598
Teal'c? Acknowledged.

409
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:58,358
General O'Neill,
it looks like you were right.

410
00:39:58,445 --> 00:40:02,518
We have the gate and SG-1 aboard.
They are alive.

411
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:06,154
That's good news.

412
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,317
- Bring 'em home.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:33,638
Good news is the gate is fully operational
again. We can resume offworld missions.

414
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:37,638
And the bad news is the Trust
now has a fully functional Goa'uld Alkesh.

415
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:42,845
We've installed devices to prevent locator
beams from operating in the future.

416
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:46,042
- What of the Tok'ra poison?
- They left most of it behind,

417
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:50,516
but they still have enough to wipe out
at least half a dozen Goa'uld worlds.

418
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:54,803
In retrospect, maybe
you should've destroyed the ship.

419
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,682
Yeah.

420
00:40:57,685 --> 00:40:59,676
Tough choice.

421
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:24,203
