1
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:08,558
Previously on "Stargate SG1":

2
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:13,277
They are so cool.
Savour the moment, gentlemen.

3
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:16,636
They're in trouble.

4
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:20,083
- What would O'Neill do if he was here?
- You want me to shoot you?

5
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:26,646
- We're here to rescue you.
- We allowed ourselves to be captured...

6
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:27,876
on purpose.

7
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:32,483
This is great. Sneakin' around with you
in a Goa'uld pyramid on an alien planet.

8
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,876
The one thing missing
is some Jaffa chasing us.

9
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:40,402
Felger? Jay?

10
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:42,924
- What?
- Snap out of it.

11
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:45,919
- Sorry.
- Calibration scales for the power source?

12
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:49,397
Right there. Right... there.

13
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:03,396
What time is it?

14
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:06,559
It's two minutes past
the last time you asked me.

15
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:10,083
- She should be here any second.
- Relax, Jay.

16
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:14,080
Relax? We are on the verge of
a major scientific breakthrough.

17
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:17,796
This weapon could be the key factor
in our fight against the Goa'uld!

18
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:21,846
Is it defeating the Goa'uld you're worried
about or impressing Major Carter?

19
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:25,966
Unlike some people in this room, I've seen
what the Goa'uld can do first-hand.

20
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:28,277
I know. You've told me a thousand times.

21
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:32,042
You rescued SG-1
from the evil Lord Whatshisname.

22
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:35,119
Her'ak. He wasn't an evil lord.
He was a first prime.

23
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:40,076
Jay, you're a brilliant scientist.
Some day you'll win the Nobel prize.

24
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,125
What do you care
what these military types think of you?

25
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:48,520
You don't get it. When you've stood side
by side with someone and faced death,

26
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:50,802
it creates an unspoken bond.

27
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:54,641
An understanding
that transcends simple friendship.

28
00:01:54,727 --> 00:01:57,958
Colonel O'Neill and I
have been to hell and back together.

29
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:00,959
When the mission was over,
you know what he said? He said...

30
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:03,402
Is this gonna take long?

31
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:07,035
- Colonel O'Neill.
- Folger.

32
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,802
- Felger. I wasn't expecting you, sir.
- Yes.

33
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:13,600
Well, Major Carter said this was important.

34
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:18,602
D-d-d-d-don't touch it, please.
This is a finely calibrated device.

35
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:22,600
It fires a focused plasma pulse.
Whoo...

36
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:24,484
boom!

37
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:34,079
It's an energy-based weapon, sir. It could
perhaps replace the missiles on the X-303.

38
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:37,159
- Phaser?
- More like a photon torpedo.

39
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:39,158
My assistant Chloe.

40
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:42,442
There you are.

41
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:45,917
- Chloe.
- This is all based on a Goa'uld design.

42
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:54,202
If you'll join me to the rear of the weapon,
we'll proceed with the demonstration.

43
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:01,880
My friends, I present to you...

44
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:05,842
...the 22nd century!

45
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,559
That wasn't supposed to happen.

46
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:47,202
I am really sorry, General. I assure you
nothing like this will ever happen again.

47
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,165
It won't, because I'm pulling
the plug on your research.

48
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:54,957
No, please, General. It was a minor glitch.
We are so close to a working prototype.

49
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:59,837
You've said that for the last six months.
In fact, I've reviewed your records.

50
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:03,476
Most of the projects you've overseen
during your tenure here

51
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:07,196
have been similarly
long on promise and short on results.

52
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,403
What exactly are you saying?

53
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:13,526
I'm saying it may be time for the Air Force
to rethink your position here.

54
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:19,318
That'd be a mistake. It just so happens
that I'm working on a line of research,

55
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:23,525
and it's... Well, I'm on the verge
of a major breakthrough, really.

56
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:27,395
- Really?
- Really, yes, yes. It's gonna be huge!

57
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:31,366
It's gonna make the plasma weapon
look like a squirt gun, sir.

58
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:32,641
- What is it?
- Hm?

59
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:37,801
- What is it?
- Well, I'm not ready for a presentation yet.

60
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:41,323
I still gotta crunch a few numbers
and dot a few i's.

61
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,843
I could probably have something ready
by the end of next week.

62
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,203
- You have 24 hours.
- More than enough time.

63
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:50,482
- Dismissed.
- Thank you.

64
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:57,001
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know!

65
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:00,124
I had to say something.
They were gonna fire me.

66
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:02,721
Besides, all we have to do
is think of something

67
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:05,879
to change the balance of power
in the galaxy by noon tomorrow.

68
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,561
You have anything in mind?

69
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:13,441
As a matter of fact I do - Avenger.

70
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:17,042
You gotta be kidding.
It's nowhere near ready. It's just an idea.

71
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,119
- We can make it work.
- Jay, this is exactly your problem.

72
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:25,281
You try so hard to impress people, you
always bite off more than you can chew.

73
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:30,566
OK, yes, you're right. I have to start
setting more realistic goals for myself.

74
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:33,115
Right after this project, OK?

75
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:42,562
- A computer virus?
- The gate system's just linked computers.

76
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:46,879
Delivering the virus is as easy as dialling
the target gate, uploading the program.

77
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:49,606
The virus would scramble
the DHD's coordinates.

78
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:54,283
So the symbols no longer
correspond with the proper coordinates.

79
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:59,361
- And the target gate would be useless.
- The Goa'uld rely heavily on gate travel.

80
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:02,439
It would be a tactical advantage for us,
don't you think?

81
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,916
- It's interesting.
- Really?

82
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,157
But you don't have a finished program.

83
00:07:07,247 --> 00:07:11,399
Uh, well, not "finished" per se, no.
I really still have to...

84
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:14,524
- Crunch a few numbers, dot a few i's.
- Exactly, yeah.

85
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:17,963
I'll look at it. If it shows promise,
I'll take it to Hammond.

86
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,766
- Oh, yes, OK!
- Whoa, whoa.

87
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:25,967
- Don't celebrate yet. It's not a done deal.
- Of course not. Of course not.

88
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,158
Yes! Yes!

89
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:37,926
Where am I?
How did she get me here?

90
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:48,880
You'd rather stay and geek out
a computer program than come with us?

91
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:52,277
Don't take it personally, sir.
This research shows promise.

92
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:53,959
It's Felger.

93
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:57,517
- He did save our lives, Colonel.
- Yeah, don't remind me.

94
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:03,159
The ability to disable any gate we choose
is a valuable weapon against the Goa'uld.

95
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:07,718
- If it works.
- That's what I intend to find out.

96
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:10,560
Don't forget your safety glasses.

97
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:13,605
Marines, thanks for joining us.

98
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:15,678
Let's move out.

99
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:21,685
To be honest, Major, I share
some of the colonel's scepticism.

100
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:26,477
I know Dr Felger's record is a little
sketchy, but I think he shows potential.

101
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:29,240
All he needs is a little support.

102
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:46,638
Just a minute.

103
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:00,198
Oh, jeez.

104
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:06,556
I'll be with you in a second.
Just, you know, putting the dogs out.

105
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:14,162
- Oh, Major Carter.
- I was in the neighbourhood.

106
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:19,316
- This isn't a bad time, is it?
- Oh, no, no. Please, come in, come in.

107
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:23,764
Just, you know, just, uh,
really wasn't, uh, expecting anyone.

108
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:25,439
Sorry.

109
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:29,202
- Nice place.
- Oh, thank you. I was having it fumigated.

110
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:32,518
- Can I offer you anything?
- No, no, I'm fine.

111
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:34,598
Oh, all righty.

112
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:37,324
Please, please.

113
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:46,516
Uh, what, uh, what brings you by?

114
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:49,565
I took your proposal
to General Hammond.

115
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:52,241
- And?
- He's agreed to give you another chance.

116
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:55,524
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.
That's great. That's great.

117
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:59,361
Cos I thought I was so done for
after that little incident thing.

118
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:01,881
- There is one condition.
- Sure. OK.

119
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,800
He wants me to work
on the project with you.

120
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,398
That'd be, uh, you?

121
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:14,446
- Yeah. That's not a problem, is it?
- No, no, no. God, no, no.

122
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:15,926
What about SG-1?

123
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:20,444
- Daniel's working on a relocation project.
- The moon in the decaying orbit?

124
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:24,725
They're experiencing severe seismic
disturbances and weather anomalies.

125
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,877
What about Colonel O'Neill? Teal'c?

126
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:30,243
They've some negotiations
with the rebel Jaffa leaders.

127
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:36,243
- There's been some infighting, rivalries.
- Well, they have to settle that. Yeah, yeah.

128
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:38,795
I guess that means
you get stuck with me, then.

129
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:41,447
No, no, I wouldn't put it that way.

130
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:46,203
I think the basic idea behind the virus
is actually quite brilliant.

131
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:47,879
No...

132
00:10:48,807 --> 00:10:50,843
- Really?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:05,479
- A tie?
- I wear ties.

134
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,364
And cologne?

135
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:12,316
There is nothing wrong with a man taking
pride in his appearance... and smell.

136
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:15,717
This wouldn't have anything
to do with Major Carter, would it?

137
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:19,083
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Here. Let me.

138
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,638
Of course, you do have to admit

139
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:28,040
she possesses one of the most
brilliant scientific minds of our generation.

140
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,436
And a pair of legs that won't quit...
Agh!

141
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:32,722
- OK. OK.
- Sorry.

142
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:37,642
Well, anyway, what chance has
a guy like me got with a woman like that?

143
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:39,877
She barely notices me.
Know what that's like?

144
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,241
A little.

145
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,921
- Morning.
- Oh, hi. Hi.

146
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,158
- Nice tie.
- Oh, thanks.

147
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,164
We think the virus is ready.

148
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:20,763
Of course, there's no real way to test it,
except on another gate.

149
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:23,805
- Do you have a target in mind?
- P5S-117.

150
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,082
Ba'al's main naqahdah mining site.

151
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,477
If we can disable the gate,
we'd disrupt his supply network.

152
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,717
How will we know if it's successful?

153
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:37,518
A Tok'ra operative there can relay the
results via their communication network.

154
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:39,404
Send the virus.

155
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,478
Yes, sir.

156
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:47,278
You'll wear a hole in the floor.

157
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:50,086
Those Tok'ra are taking their sweet time.

158
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,442
We should've heard something by now.

159
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:56,884
Major Carter to the control
room. Major Carter to the control room.

160
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:58,958
That's it.

161
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:16,839
Chevron seven locked.

162
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:19,997
- What are you doing here?
- What's going on?

163
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:23,523
Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c
missed a scheduled radio contact.

164
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:26,041
Getting a video signal, sir.

165
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:28,880
Colonel O'Neill, this is Hammond.
Do you read?

166
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:32,164
- Nice to hear from you, General.
- What's your status?

167
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:36,604
The mission was going according to plan,
then we hit a little snag.

168
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:38,678
We can't dial the gate.

169
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:43,800
- Say again?
- We cannot get an outgoing wormhole.

170
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:47,118
We've tried all kinds of addresses,
but we can't get a lock.

171
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:49,323
Stand by, Colonel.

172
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,522
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is just a coincidence.

173
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:57,122
There's no way this could have
anything to do with my virus. No...

174
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:59,198
Could it?

175
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:10,722
There's no way Avenger
could have anything to do with this.

176
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:14,243
- Avenger?
- That's what I call the virus.

177
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:18,878
It's named after a comic book I read
when I was a kid. The Amazing Avenger?

178
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:22,164
Green tights, purple cape.
He was super strong, super fast.

179
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:24,841
Not as fast as The Flash.
That would be ridiculous.

180
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:30,998
Of course, this isn't ringing any bells
with anybody, is it?

181
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:36,518
- Could we have sent it to the wrong gate?
- No, sir. We double-checked.

182
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:39,997
The virus was sent here - P5S-117.

183
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:43,159
Colonel O'Neill is on P3C-249,
which is here.

184
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:49,322
Within the gate systems the planets
are close together - about 400 light years -

185
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,398
but that doesn't mean anything.

186
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:57,244
- And until we hear back from the Tok'ra...
- Unscheduled offworld activation.

187
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:08,403
Sir, we're receiving an audio
transmission. It's the Tok'ra.

188
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:12,605
- This is Theless of the Tok'ra.
- This is Hammond of Stargate Command.

189
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:18,364
General, I'm afraid I have to report a
series of malfunctions in the gate system.

190
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:20,244
Malfunctions?

191
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:23,683
Several gates have gone offline.
As yet, we have no idea why.

192
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:25,758
We are gathering information.

193
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:31,524
This is Major Carter. Do you have any data
on a planet we've designated P5S-117?

194
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,598
One moment, please.

195
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:38,724
We're still waiting for
a sub-space transmission.

196
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:42,880
- Can you send us any data you do have?
- Affirmative.

197
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:48,682
Transmission received.

198
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:53,480
Sir, I'll need a few minutes to analyse this.

199
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,364
Go.

200
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:05,437
I'll go help.

201
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:09,478
There it is.

202
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:14,799
- I still don't see how this is possible.
- Automatic correlative updates.

203
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:17,481
I thought those happened
once every 200 years.

204
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,364
That was the theory.

205
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:23,600
Major Carter, report.

206
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:27,965
Sir, first I recommend you recall
all of our offworld teams immediately.

207
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,835
It's already being done. The mining team
from P4F-221 is coming through now.

208
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:36,921
- You might wanna tell them to hurry it up.
- What have you got?

209
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:47,115
This is the original target gate.
This is Colonel O'Neill's position.

210
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:51,041
These are the gates
first reported offline by the Tok'ra.

211
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:55,685
A few minutes later... several more.

212
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:58,520
They're spreading out
from the original gate.

213
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:00,006
Yes, sir.

214
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:04,203
You still think this is a coincidence?

215
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:07,836
Well, sir, we think
we may have an explanation.

216
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:11,602
We know the gate network
undergoes periodic correlative updates

217
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:13,882
to compensate for stellar drift.

218
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:18,597
We've never witnessed it, but we believe
the gates dial each other automatically

219
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:21,326
to transmit
the new coordinates that apply.

220
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:25,764
And you believe Dr Felger's virus
initiated one of these updates?

221
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:30,841
It may have triggered
an automatic internal protocol in the DHD.

222
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:32,997
Before adapting the new coordinates,

223
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,602
it dialled out and transmitted them
to a few neighbouring gates,

224
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:39,724
who then transmitted to a few more,
and so on and so on...

225
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:43,277
- And so on.
- Is there any way we can stop it?

226
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:48,566
No time, sir. If each gate only dials two
others before adapting to the new system,

227
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:52,037
the entire network will be infected
in less than two hours.

228
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:57,155
We need to focus on getting
as many people back as possible, sir.

229
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:04,122
He's really mad, isn't he?

230
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,642
That's the last of the miners, sir.

231
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:12,718
Shut it down.

232
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,358
What's next?

233
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,841
P3L-997.

234
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,363
- That's Daniel's team, sir.
- Dial it.

235
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:33,725
OK, breathe. Everything's gonna be fine.

236
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:35,957
- Grover Cleveland High School.
- What?

237
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:39,437
Chemistry 201.
I had an incident with my midterm lab.

238
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:44,647
They got the fire under control, but poor
Mr Hoffman's eyebrows never grew back.

239
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:48,925
I should have got out of science right then
and saved everybody the trouble.

240
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:52,682
This is SGC. You wouldn't be here
if you weren't good at what you do.

241
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:54,997
You tell that to Colonel O'Neill!

242
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:59,795
- How many teams came back?
- Three.

243
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:02,924
- Out of how many?
- 15. The rest are stranded.

244
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:07,080
- And Dr Jackson?
- His team's still offworld.

245
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:08,600
Oh, this is awful.

246
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:12,646
The flood waters are rising,
but they're safe for the time being.

247
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:17,518
Carter.

248
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,518
- General.
- General Hammond.

249
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:22,997
Yes, sir. I understand.

250
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,083
We contacted the Tok'ra.

251
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:32,160
According to their intelligence,
the entire gate network is down.

252
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:47,446
Colonel O'Neill, report.

253
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:49,836
The mission's been compromised, sir.

254
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:53,806
Looks like one of the Jaffa
commanders sold us out. Go figure/

255
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:58,085
- What happened?
- The negotiations were going just fine,

256
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,317
then the gate broke down.

257
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:05,720
After that, they all started accusing each
other of sabotage and all hell broke loose.

258
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:10,722
Sir, we think we know what caused
your gate to malfunction. It was the virus.

259
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:12,399
Felger's virus? /

260
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:15,638
It created a new coordinate system
that spread to all DHDs.

261
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:20,118
But, since we don't have a DHD,
we have the only gate that can dial out.

262
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:24,837
I told you not to trust
that brown-nosing little weasel/

263
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:27,680
He doesn't know
I'm standing here, does he?

264
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:31,680
- Sir, I'm as responsible as anyone else.
- O'Neill.

265
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,565
We've got incoming, sir. It's Alkesh/

266
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:39,042
- We lost video.
- Must have hit the MALP.

267
00:21:39,127 --> 00:21:43,996
- He was just standing a few feet from it.
- What's your situation? Please respond.

268
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,961
- We're still in one piece, sir.
- Oh, thank God.

269
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,322
We're gonna take cover, sir.

270
00:21:56,407 --> 00:21:58,841
Sir, we could send reinforcements.

271
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:03,921
They'd be stranded too. I can't send
anyone until we fix this problem.

272
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:08,116
Let's think this through logically.

273
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:11,563
The entire gate network is paralysed,
but we can still dial out.

274
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:15,640
We think the virus was spread due to
correlative updates initiated by the DHDs.

275
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:18,036
We have no DHD,
so our gate was unaffected.

276
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:22,882
Right. It also means another change might
result in another system-wide update.

277
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:27,404
So if we can get just one DHD converted
back to the old coordinate system,

278
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:30,126
the gate network would spread it for us.

279
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:34,166
How, when the new one is
based on a completely random principle?

280
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:38,638
There still must be a pattern. If we can get
one DHD to establish a lock with one gate,

281
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:43,357
all we gotta do is compare the addresses
and extrapolate a translation program.

282
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,597
That would mean random dialling.

283
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:49,077
Seven symbols chosen from
a pool of 38 non-repeating candidates?

284
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:53,240
That's about 63 billion
possible combinations.

285
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:58,555
She's good with numbers.

286
00:22:58,647 --> 00:23:01,320
I was gonna get her to do my taxes.

287
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:16,204
- Any word from Colonel O'Neill, sir?
- No. We hope he's just out of range.

288
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:17,276
Yes, sir.

289
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:21,883
According to our latest report, Ba'al is
trying to take advantage of the situation.

290
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,084
- How so?
- At the moment he has the largest fleet.

291
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:28,000
So with the gate system down
he has the advantage.

292
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:32,160
He's attacking the other System Lords
on several fronts, and he's winning.

293
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:57,960
Stargate Command, Felger speaking.

294
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:01,403
Mom, Mom, no, no, no.
I told you not to call me here.

295
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,921
You're not supposed to have this number.

296
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:07,602
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I had to work late. Something came up.

297
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:12,955
If you must know, Mom,
I screwed up again.

298
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:17,563
Yeah, and I think this is the worst one yet.

299
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:20,320
No, no, it's worse than that one.

300
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,760
No, worse than that one too, Mom.

301
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:30,202
Mom, Mom, Mom, I don't need a list
of my personal failures right now, OK?

302
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:33,404
To tell you the truth,
I don't know if I can fix this one...

303
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:40,600
I'll have to get back to you on that,
Simon, OK? All righty, bye-bye... friend.

304
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,598
It's Coombs. He says hi.

305
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:50,398
- Jay, I know you feel bad about this.
- What's to feel bad about?

306
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:55,641
It took the Ancients 1,000 years to build
the gate system, and I wrecked it in a day.

307
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:59,925
I've also isolated us from all the resources
we'll need to defend ourselves,

308
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:04,956
leaving us sitting ducks for
the next Goa'uld attack. But who cares?

309
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:09,279
I need you to get past feeling guilty
and focus on finding a solution.

310
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:12,439
- But you never make mistakes.
- I don't?

311
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:16,759
- You're perfect. Everybody knows that.
- Jay, I'm not perfect.

312
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:19,839
You have to say that
because you're modest,

313
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:22,725
which is just another aspect
of your perfection.

314
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:26,561
- Ever heard of a planet called K'Tau?
- That wasn't your fault.

315
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:31,437
I bypassed dialling protocols that made
the wormhole pass through K'Tau's sun.

316
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:34,519
It could have led to the deaths
of everyone on that planet.

317
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:38,520
- That's it! Even your mistakes are perfect.
- What are you talking about?

318
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:42,486
You bypassed a security protocol
because you created a dialling program.

319
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,797
- So?
- So we can do that here.

320
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:47,720
Instead of restoring the DHD program
to its original form,

321
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:50,640
why not upload everything
from our dialling computer?

322
00:25:50,727 --> 00:25:56,165
Our program is not as sophisticated
as the one that exists in the DHDs.

323
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:59,284
It doesn't have to be perfect, just accurate.

324
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:02,564
The DHD will automatically
make all necessary adjustments.

325
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:05,684
- How do you know that?
- Well, it's...

326
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:10,079
OK, I don't, I don't. But the fact that
Avenger triggered a correlative update

327
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:14,479
seems to indicate that the DHD program
is adaptive by its very nature.

328
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:16,956
Plus, we have nothing else.

329
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:20,722
Trust me, Major, this is gonna work!

330
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:26,004
Yeah, sorry to rain on your parade, guys,
but it didn't work.

331
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:27,520
It should have worked.

332
00:26:27,607 --> 00:26:31,236
We tried dialling Earth,
but we couldn't get a lock.

333
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:36,082
Maybe there's something wrong with
the upload. You can upload better, huh?

334
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:40,285
If you've got any other bright ideas,
now would be a very good time.

335
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:44,485
- What's your status, Doctor?
- Flood water's rising pretty fast,

336
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:47,081
seismic activity is causing rogue waves.

337
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:51,365
We estimate that within 48 hours
the entire city will be under water.

338
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:00,318
It should have worked!

339
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:11,524
Have you and Dr Felger
made any progress?

340
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:13,677
- I can't find him.
- Excuse me?

341
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:17,282
Apparently he left the base.
The pressure was getting to him.

342
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:22,395
- You said all he needed was support.
- I may have been wrong about that.

343
00:27:24,327 --> 00:27:26,795
OK, I admit it.
He's a complete screw-up.

344
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:31,005
He makes rash decisions based on
sketchy evidence, he's clumsy in the lab

345
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:34,045
and it wouldn't kill him
to ease up on the aftershave,

346
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:39,884
but the fact is he's at Stargate Command
because he's a brilliant scientist.

347
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:43,198
No one understands that virus
better than he does.

348
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,926
Then I suggest you get him back.

349
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:47,201
Yes, sir.

350
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:05,405
Jay, what're you doing here?
We've got work to do.

351
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:08,684
- How did you find me here?
- I called your mother.

352
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:12,316
She told me this is where you come
when you need to think.

353
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:19,165
I stood here when I figured out how to
recombine epsilon particles in a matrix.

354
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:22,364
Then I got mugged by some teenagers.

355
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:25,439
Still, it's a nice spot, though.

356
00:28:27,887 --> 00:28:30,003
What are you doing?

357
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:32,078
Feeding the ducks.

358
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:40,566
I need you to come back
to Stargate Command.

359
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:43,798
Before I joined SGC,
my idea of a high-pressure situation

360
00:28:43,887 --> 00:28:47,641
was defending a mathematical thesis
in front of a roomful of balding men.

361
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,844
I don't do well when the fate
of the universe hangs in the balance.

362
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:55,717
Jay, you designed the virus.
You're the man for the job.

363
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:59,402
Forget about the big picture for a second,
and the consequences.

364
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,081
Just focus on the problem.

365
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:07,002
- Why didn't the upload work?
- I don't know. It should've.

366
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:12,559
Every gate in the galaxy should be
back online, except for P5S-117.

367
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:15,718
What do you mean?

368
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:18,526
Avenger's resistant
to that type of tampering.

369
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:23,476
I didn't think it made a difference, since
P5S-117 was sabotaged in the first place.

370
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:29,164
Jay, what if the virus replicated itself and
then travelled along to the other DHDs?

371
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:31,477
No, it wasn't designed to do that.

372
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:34,684
It wasn't designed
to trigger a correlative update either.

373
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:39,363
You said it yourself, Jay.
The DHD program is adaptive.

374
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:45,557
- Sir, we may have found a solution.
- Let's hear it.

375
00:29:47,807 --> 00:29:51,402
- You want me to tell it?
- It's your project.

376
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:58,361
We think we know why we can't upload
our dialling program into the gate system.

377
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:02,679
It now looks like the virus itself somehow
transmitted, with the new coordinates,

378
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,645
to the entire DHD network.

379
00:30:05,727 --> 00:30:08,685
- The virus is blocking the upload.
- That's right.

380
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:13,283
We need to neutralise it first,
but in order to do that, we have to find it.

381
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,358
I don't understand.

382
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:19,998
Well, the truth is, we don't know
how the virus was transmitted.

383
00:30:20,087 --> 00:30:25,115
If it piggybacked with the automatic
update, it's in the dialling program itself.

384
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:28,995
Could be thousands of lines of code -
like looking for a needle in a haystack.

385
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:35,879
But it exists within a specific sub-routine
in the original target DHD on P5S-117.

386
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,482
The catch is, to make this work,
we have to reboot the system,

387
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:42,127
which means
removing the control crystal.

388
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:45,005
Someone's gonna
have to go to the planet, sir.

389
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:48,796
- P5S-117 is controlled by Ba'al.
- Yes, sir.

390
00:30:48,887 --> 00:30:52,323
General, I'd like to volunteer.

391
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:57,198
Major Carter has the experience
required for this mission.

392
00:30:57,287 --> 00:31:00,882
Come on, I've got offworld experience.
I battled the Goa'uld.

393
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:02,559
I zatted a Jaffa.

394
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:06,845
- Sir, it would be better if we both went.
- Major Carter's right.

395
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:09,361
Nobody knows more
about Avenger than me.

396
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:20,840
- Jay, this is crazy.
- I caused this problem. I'm gonna fix it.

397
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:23,760
You're a research scientist,
not a field operative.

398
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:28,921
Did that stop me from infiltrating
a Goa'uld mothership? I think not.

399
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:32,837
They've sent the MALP.
The gate's not even being guarded.

400
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:37,842
Probably cos it doesn't work any more,
but don't worry about me.

401
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:39,997
I know what I'm doing, OK?

402
00:31:40,487 --> 00:31:42,478
- Jay?
- Mm?

403
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,842
The antivirus.

404
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:49,000
OK, yeah, yeah,
I'm gonna need that. All righty.

405
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:50,884
What?

406
00:32:00,447 --> 00:32:02,039
Wh-what was that for?

407
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:04,322
Good luck.

408
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,398
Oh, right.

409
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:41,837
You get set up. I'll be back soon.

410
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:44,964
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna check out the area.

411
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:48,960
Shouldn't we stick together,
in case you need backup or something?

412
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:51,481
I'll be fine.

413
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:53,364
OK.

414
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:57,318
I'm good too!

415
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:18,244
Jaffa landed the Alkesh. Teal'c
and I have organised a counterattack.

416
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:22,400
Be advised, Colonel.
Major Carter has gone to P5S-117.

417
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:25,240
She's attempting to get
the gate system back online.

418
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:28,558
- That's occupied territory, sir.
- Yes, it is.

419
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:30,444
What team did she take?

420
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:33,405
She didn't want to risk
stranding anyone else.

421
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:36,081
- She went alone?
- Not entirely.

422
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,158
Dr Felger's with her.

423
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:41,159
I'm inspired with confidence.

424
00:33:50,047 --> 00:33:54,120
There's no sign of
any Jaffa activity in the area.

425
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,519
I'm in. I'm in.

426
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:58,404
Whoo!

427
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:03,042
Just a sec, just a sec.

428
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:07,002
- OK, something's wrong.
- What?

429
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:10,796
This isn't Avenger.
I mean, it is, but something's hinky.

430
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:14,197
- Hinky?
- Point is, this isn't the program I wrote.

431
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:16,801
It's been tampered with since it was sent.

432
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:22,721
- Maybe it was Ba'al.
- Ba'al?

433
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:25,526
Think about it. He stood the most to gain.

434
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:29,680
He took your idea and modified it
to bring down the entire gate network,

435
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:34,238
- knowing it would give him an advantage.
- That means none of this is my fault.

436
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:37,285
Avenger wasn't designed
to cause a correlative update.

437
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,962
I wouldn't get too excited.
It also means our antivirus won't work.

438
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:44,801
That's right.
It's designed for the original program.

439
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:49,881
Which means that we are now stranded
on a Goa'uld-occupied world.

440
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:54,597
So it's kind of
a "good news, bad news" situation.

441
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:11,238
The Jaffa aren't as protective of the gate
as they once were, but there'll be a patrol.

442
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:15,525
- We have to do something.
- Well, I'm open to suggestions here.

443
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:20,163
You said the virus was modified. So we
need to modify the antivirus to match it.

444
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:22,761
- Go for it.
- I was hoping you could handle it.

445
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:25,884
- I was afraid you'd say that!
- You wanna do this instead?

446
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:30,438
Do you know how many variations I went
through before I got the antivirus right?

447
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:34,042
- This could take days.
- Then you'd better get started.

448
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,519
Yep.

449
00:35:40,887 --> 00:35:42,684
Oh, yeah.

450
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:45,520
Still no word from Sam?

451
00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:49,600
To be honest,
we should've heard back by now.

452
00:35:49,687 --> 00:35:53,566
We're gonna have to abandon
the Stargate and move to higher ground.

453
00:35:53,647 --> 00:35:56,445
Very well. Good luck, Dr Jackson.

454
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:07,561
- How's it coming?
- We're getting there.

455
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:09,797
It's pretty cool, us working together.

456
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:14,165
We're sort of like the intellectual
Butch and Sundance of the SGC.

457
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:18,843
Butch and Sundance got cornered
and killed by the Bolivian army.

458
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,918
That's a good point, yeah.

459
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:26,603
What? What? What?

460
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:28,882
- We got trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

461
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:31,845
- Think Bolivia.
- Oh! Jaffa?

462
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:36,724
They made our position. Keep working.

463
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,395
Oh.

464
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:55,277
Concentrate, Jay. Concentrate.
Just background noise.

465
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:03,556
Argh!

466
00:37:07,807 --> 00:37:10,162
How's it coming?

467
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:12,238
I'm feeling a little rushed. Oh!

468
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,801
There's not enough time.
There's not enough time.

469
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:56,281
Argh!

470
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:18,204
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

471
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:34,003
O'Neill! It's Colonel O'Neill!
Thank God! Oh, you would not believe...

472
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:38,080
Felger. Felger. Felger!
What did I say about touching?

473
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:41,477
Absolutely. It's just that
we were over there, they came,

474
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:44,365
then you... over there,
but now you're here.

475
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,042
- Nice work.
- How'd you manage this one, sir?

476
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:51,119
We got tired of waiting.

477
00:39:02,127 --> 00:39:05,483
- Major, Doctor, welcome back.
- Sir.

478
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:08,843
I trust the solution you found
is of a permanent nature?

479
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:15,400
Yes, General. I modified the antivirus to
neutralise the altered version of Avenger.

480
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:17,762
But I also added a patch to ensure...

481
00:39:17,847 --> 00:39:21,601
The problem is solved, sir. Permanently.

482
00:39:21,687 --> 00:39:25,839
Dr Jackson managed to get the remaining
inhabitants of 997 to the Alpha site.

483
00:39:25,927 --> 00:39:30,000
- Good to hear it, sir.
- What about Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c?

484
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:33,682
They found an alternate means
of transport.

485
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:38,921
I promised the colonel I wouldn't say
anything. He wants it to be a surprise.

486
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,955
- I was so worried about you.
- It was no big deal.

487
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:55,880
Those Jaffa, they could have killed you.

488
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:57,958
Not a chance, baby.

489
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,405
What is this?

490
00:40:08,487 --> 00:40:10,079
Oh...

491
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,964
Hi, guys.

492
00:40:12,047 --> 00:40:17,485
I know we're not really
supposed to be fraternising, but, hey.

493
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:22,322
I turn my back for two seconds
and you take up with this... trollop?

494
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:24,204
Oooh.

495
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:29,077
Don't blame me just because you were
never woman enough to satisfy him.

496
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,646
Ohh!

497
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:32,319
That is it.

498
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:43,804
- Ladies, this isn't necessary...
- Sh!

499
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:46,162
Don't talk.

500
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:47,965
Jay?

501
00:40:48,047 --> 00:40:50,038
Jay?

502
00:40:52,207 --> 00:40:55,119
Jay. Jay!

503
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:58,882
- What? What?
- What were you thinking about?

504
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:03,598
Nothing.

505
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,566
