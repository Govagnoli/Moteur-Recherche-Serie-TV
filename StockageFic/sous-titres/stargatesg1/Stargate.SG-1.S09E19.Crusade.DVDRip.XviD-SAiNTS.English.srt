00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,835
<i>on Stargate SG-1...</i>

3
00:00:03,845 --> 00:00:06,639
These stones are actually
an ancient form of communication device

4
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:10,141
<i>that links their users psychically,
allowing them to see through each other's eyes.</i>

5
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:12,112
I think we're in them.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,570
We're from another galaxy.

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,518
<i>Great holy armies shall be gathered
and trained to fight all who embrace evil.</i>

8
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,540
In the name of the Gods, ships shall be built
to carry our warriors out amongst the stars.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,650
<i>- Doesn't that look an awful lot like a...
- Yeah, it does.</i>

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,746
It can't be, cos I was gonna say, Stargate.

11
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:29,997
<i>Try Supergate.</i>

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,123
<i>What are you doing?</i>

13
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:35,127
<i>Trying to help, Daniel.
Someone had to do something and you wouldn't listen.</i>

14
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:38,973
The singularity is forming.

15
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:45,194
Merlin was conducting research
on some kind of new invention.

16
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:47,957
A weapon capable of destroying ascended beings.

17
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:50,041
<i>I don't need to know Ancient
to understand what that is.</i>

18
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,970
A Gate address to where he hid the weapon.

19
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:08,128
'morning.

20
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:10,030
Have you seen Colonel Mitchell?

21
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:11,615
Men's locker.

22
00:01:20,516 --> 00:01:21,350
<i>'morning.</i>

23
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:42,280
<i>Jackson?</i>

24
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,334
Is there something I should know?

25
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:56,506
Season 9, Episode 19
Crusade

26
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:54,079
How is this possible?

27
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:57,040
Oh, my God.

28
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:58,925
It worked...

29
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,765
I mean, you know, it's working.

30
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:05,005
We didn't think we were ever going to make this work.

31
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:06,485
Make what work?

32
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:10,687
Well, since you disintegrated the Alteran communication
stones and the base terminal in the Kawoosh...

33
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:12,047
- We've been...
- I'm sorry, the what?

34
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:14,087
The unstable vortex of a forming wormhole...

35
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:14,927
Kawoosh.

36
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,687
Don't think I've ever heard you call it that before.

37
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:17,448
<i>Really?</i>

38
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:19,088
<i>Don't get me wrong, it's good.</i>

39
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,968
- No, I mean, I'm sure I...
- Hello? Hi.

40
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:23,888
My name is Vala, but I'm in Daniel Jackson right now.

41
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:29,589
Anyway, we've been working on a way of
artificially emulating the Alteran technology.

42
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:35,209
Dr. Lee was able to collect quite a bit of data
from the time that you were unconscious and
communicating with the people from the Ori galaxy.

43
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:35,970
So using that

44
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:41,370
and this Tok'ra subspace communicator,
we've been trying to mimic the frequencies
sent and received by the stones.

45
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,060
- We just didn't think we were having any luck.
- Well, I'm really glad you are.

46
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,590
- I was desperately hoping this...
- So you're in the Ori galaxy?

47
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,171
Yes.

48
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,971
- Are you able to communicate with Daniel?
- No. Just see and hear you.

49
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:54,971
See, we've been using the data collected from
the stone that Daniel activated on this end,

50
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:58,292
which is why you're connected to his body.

51
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:02,413
That's funny, isn't it?
Daniel always wanted to get into my pants,
and now I'm in his.

52
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:03,972
Oh, that's not funny.

53
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:06,053
He can't defend himself.

54
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:07,733
Yeah, okay. You,

55
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:08,693
Vala,

56
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:11,214
were the only other person
on this end to touch a stone, so...

57
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,054
Oh, I get it, I get it. I can't exactly
connect to myself if I'm not here, so...

58
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:16,054
You know, last time, we couldn't break the connection.

59
00:04:16,094 --> 00:04:18,215
Well that should be easy, this time
we just shut down the computer.

60
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:18,895
No!

61
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,494
I mean... not yet.

62
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:25,215
I didn't just drop in to say hello.
I have something very important to tell you.

63
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:30,855
I remember staggering into the rings.
There were bolts of energy everywhere.

64
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,776
<i>We suspected that the matterstream
was sucked into the black hole.</i>

65
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:37,697
We all appreciate the part you played
in destroying the enemy beachhead.

66
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,657
Don't mention it.

67
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,497
By "part," I assume you mean "lead role".

68
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:45,697
We're happy to hear that you're okay.

69
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:47,617
Actually, for the record, I never said I was okay.

70
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:50,858
Actually, the timing of this is a little awkward.

71
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:54,258
Sir, if we disconnect now, there's no guarantee
that we can reestablish the link.

72
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:56,538
Dr. Jackson was supposed to join me to meet with

73
00:04:56,619 --> 00:05:01,259
the Russian and Chinese representatives
of the IOA in about a half an hour. They requested

74
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:02,339
that he be there.

75
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,460
- Said it was a matter of great importance.
- Not as important as what I have
to tell you, believe me.

76
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,300
I'll try and be as quick as I can
and then you can have Daniel back, I promise.

77
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,061
So, the next thing I remember was
waking up in a bed

78
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:17,941
in a village like Ver Eger.

79
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:23,021
That's the one that Harrid and Sallis
lived in. They're the people that
Daniel and I inhabited for a while.

80
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:29,263
<i>Anyway, it turns out this village was called Ver Isca.</i>

81
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:35,623
You know, this water...

82
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:38,823
is lovely, but I think Daniel skipped breakfast,

83
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:42,584
and I suddenly have a craving
for pancakes and ice cream...

84
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:46,304
double chocolate fudge brownie, if memory serves?

85
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:51,784
Oh, I'll continue while you rustle that up.

86
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:53,985
Thanks.

87
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:56,826
So, where was I?

88
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:57,585
In bed.

89
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:58,706
Ah, yes, in bed.

90
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:03,666
A man named Tomin had apparently
found me lying unconscious in the rings

91
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,906
and had thought the gods had sent me to him...

92
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:12,348
<i>Which I let him continue to believe.</i>

93
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:13,187
Hi.

94
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:17,708
Do you feel strong enough to
get up and go for a walk today?

95
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:18,628
Maybe.

96
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,109
I'll be back after prostration.

97
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:28,189
Have fun.

98
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:31,469
Thank you.

99
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,431
<i>It was obvious he was smitten.</i>

100
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:42,631
Who could blame him, right?

101
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:44,991
Thanks.

102
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:47,951
What?

103
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:55,632
Thanks.

104
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:59,913
I do realize he was a devout Ori follower and

105
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:02,633
<i>probably would have been standing
on the front line cheering while</i>

106
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,113
they burned me to death if
he knew the truth about me, but

107
00:07:05,193 --> 00:07:07,754
he was very sweet in his own way,

108
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:10,154
<i>and not bad looking, actually.</i>

109
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:21,635
<i>I think Tomin had been on his own
before I came along, mostly due to a limp</i>

110
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,356
<i>that had left
him crippled since childhood.</i>

111
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:26,715
<i>He didn't like to talk about it much,</i>

112
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:30,556
<i>but I could see that the other villagers
looked down on him because of it.</i>

113
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:36,597
<i>In their minds, the Ori must have deemed him unfit
for normalcy, so that's how they chose to see him.</i>

114
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:38,958
I did my best to blend in.

115
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:44,588
At first, according to Tomin, and therefore
as far as the villagers were concerned,
I was the woman who fell from the sky,

116
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,678
<i>which made me feel kind of special.</i>

117
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:47,488
I later learned

118
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:54,259
that they always suspected I'd escaped
from another village as a result of some scandal,
and then I started to feel much more like I'm used to.

119
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,080
<i>What worried me most</i>

120
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,360
<i>were the Ori.</i>

121
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:08,460
<i>While no one had actually seen me or
Daniel in person, that didn't mean
that ascended beings couldn't recognize me.</i>

122
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:12,961
<i>After a while, I started to think and</i>

123
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:15,961
<i>hope that maybe things were going to be okay.</i>

124
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:19,642
Ultimately, my goal was to try
and find a way back here,

125
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:21,963
or at the very least,
try and communicate with you

126
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,962
<i>to let you know what was going on.</i>

127
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:27,563
<i>So,</i>

128
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:32,364
<i>I figured my best bet was to root out
any of Fannis's gang from the anti-Ori underground,</i>

129
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:37,765
<i>see if they had any technology or any information
about an Ori Stargate I might possibly gain access to,</i>

130
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:39,125
<i>but I had to be very</i>

131
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:40,164
<i>careful.</i>

132
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:44,765
<i>The village was run by this complete
bear of a man named Seevis,</i>

133
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:46,645
<i>who was both barkeep</i>

134
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:48,966
<i>and administrator,</i>

135
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,765
<i>which seemed the oddest contradiction.</i>

136
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:54,367
<i>He claimed to be the most pious man in the village,</i>

137
00:08:54,566 --> 00:09:00,566
<i>and if anyone strayed from the path of
righteousness, it was Seevis who made
sure you were severely punished for it.</i>

138
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:01,687
<i>But...</i>

139
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:07,567
<i>seems to be a lot more leeway for
sin in the religion of Origin than
one would presume from all the preaching.</i>

140
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:09,968
So, it's just like my grandma used to say...

141
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:13,268
no point going to confession
if you ain't got nothing to confess.

142
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:17,999
<i>- Exactly.
- By the gods,</i>

143
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:22,769
I do not know what the Ori blessed you with,
because it was not brains, and it was not looks.

144
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,880
What makes you think that something like her would have

145
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,570
anything to do with a rodent
like you without reason?

146
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,371
I'll pay, I swear.

147
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,171
Oh, I know you will.

148
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,971
Or I will make you wish you were being
burned alive by the fires of Celestis.

149
00:09:45,572 --> 00:09:49,373
I have picked things more precious
out from between my toes.

150
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:57,773
<i>I soon realized it wasn't a contradiction at all.</i>

151
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:04,374
Seevis was doing the work of the gods
by making sure this village had every
reason in the world to prostrate,

152
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:08,575
making him a very rich and
very powerful man in the process.

153
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:11,935
Believe me, I usually applaud
the colorful details of a good story,

154
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:16,536
especially when told with such interesting
intergalactic and body-snatching means,

155
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,256
but Daniel and I

156
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,337
are late to meet with
the Russian and Chinese representatives.

157
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:24,337
You stated that you had
information of great importance.

158
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:25,977
I do, I do, and I'm getting to it.

159
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,737
<i>We got the back story.</i>

160
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:28,977
Tomin is a nice guy.

161
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:30,877
Seevis is a butthead.

162
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:33,577
How about you skip ahead a little?

163
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:35,217
Fine.

164
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,738
Tomin and I got married.

165
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:40,038
Whoa, married?

166
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,078
Stay with me.

167
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:42,009
I had no choice.

168
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:46,379
I told you, he was very devout, and there's no
way he would have slept with me out of wedlock.

169
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:52,580
Okay, maybe we skipped ahead a little too far.

170
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,780
Well, I tried to lay it out in order.

171
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,310
Ooh, that's a bad choice of words.

172
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,441
Okay. Why exactly did you have no choice?

173
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,181
You know what those people do to you
when you do something wrong?
They burn you alive.

174
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:06,381
And why would they burn you alive this time?

175
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,581
For getting pregnant out of wedlock.

176
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:12,782
- You're pregnant?
- Yes.

177
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:16,983
I keep forgetting you can't actually see me.

178
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:20,983
When I realized why I was feeling sick all the time,
I figured I had to do something.

179
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:27,343
I decided my only choice was to marry Tomin as quickly
as possible and pray the timing was close enough
so he could be convinced the baby was his.

180
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:28,944
All right, hold the phone.

181
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:32,254
And I ask this not 100% sure that I

182
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:34,385
want to know the answer...

183
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:37,105
whose baby is it?

184
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:38,485
That's the thing.

185
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:40,285
I don't know.

186
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:42,415
As in...?

187
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:43,385
<i>I swear.</i>

188
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:46,986
I did none of the necessary bits.

189
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:54,987
Between my arrival in the Ori galaxy
and my wedding night,

190
00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:59,187
which was definitely after I knew for sure,

191
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:03,388
there is no way humanly possible that I know of

192
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:05,888
that I could have gotten pregnant.

193
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:15,990
Someone gonna say something?

194
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:18,789
Anybody?

195
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,991
You have been impregnated

196
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,751
<i>- without copulation?
- Yes.</i>

197
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:32,391
And I'm absolutely terrified.
Have any of you ever heard of anything like it?

198
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,552
Well, there's one...

199
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:40,792
Darth Vader.

200
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:43,192
Really?

201
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:44,992
How did that turn out?

202
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,993
Actually, I was thinking of King Arthur.

203
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:48,393
You were?

204
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:51,593
Yeah, I've been reading everything
I can find on our Ancient friend, Merlin.

205
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,394
<i>According to some of the legends,</i>

206
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:55,994
he enchanted the queen who bore Arthur.

207
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:57,194
I have to go.

208
00:12:57,394 --> 00:13:00,594
Wait.
I haven't even gotten to the bit you have to hear yet.

209
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:04,595
Me carrying this child right now is a problem,
a big problem for me, but

210
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:08,095
believe me, there is one which is much, much bigger.

211
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,196
It's a miracle.

212
00:13:21,797 --> 00:13:22,797
Look at me.

213
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:30,798
The Prior blessed me.

214
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:33,398
I can walk.

215
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:35,198
I can run.

216
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,599
I can fight now.

217
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,399
You can what?

218
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:38,799
I've been conscripted.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,599
<i>They are building ships</i>

220
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,600
<i>and armies by the tens of thousands.</i>

221
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,801
The village I am living in is one of many
on a world among dozens like it.

222
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,001
<i>As we feared, since the day Daniel met the Ori, they
have been preparing their followers for a crusade.</i>

223
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,122
Are you sure this is what you want?

224
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,562
Are you serious?

225
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:08,442
I never dreamed I would one day be
fit to serve the Ori in this way.

226
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,613
By killing

227
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,623
people you know nothing about?

228
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:17,244
All I need to know is
that they are enemy of the Ori,

229
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:20,723
that they reject the teachings of Origin
and would have us stray from the path.

230
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:21,884
These

231
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:24,324
so-called unbelievers...

232
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:26,524
they're so far away. How can they affect us?

233
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,365
- Why do you have to go all the way over there...
- Evil must not be allowed to fester anywhere.

234
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:37,526
Our journey towards enlightenment
may take us to many unexpected places.

235
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:42,566
I...

236
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,967
cannot imagine you

237
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:46,967
killing anyone.

238
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:50,087
I'm not afraid to heed the will of the gods.

239
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:57,408
Nothing I say will change your mind, will it?

240
00:14:57,768 --> 00:14:58,928
Fear not.

241
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:03,248
Once we warriors of Ori have vanquished the wicked,

242
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:05,369
I shall return.

243
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:13,129
You will not be the same.

244
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,490
No.

245
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,370
<i>He is one of the gentlest,</i>

246
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:24,051
<i>most honest souls I have ever known.</i>

247
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:37,893
He has been raised since birth to
believe in the Ori,

248
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:39,332
<i>to follow Origin.</i>

249
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,173
<i>This isn't a fight anyone can win...</i>

250
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:45,133
not without a tragic amount of bloodshed.

251
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:47,174
<i>General Landry to the briefing room.</i>

252
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:50,854
<i>- General Landry, please report to the briefing room.
- I'd better get down there.</i>

253
00:15:50,894 --> 00:15:51,934
Go ahead.

254
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:58,375
Since you've been gone, we've learned
a few things about the Ori that
their followers might be interested to know.

255
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:03,376
It doesn't matter what the truth is about the Ori.
The people won't hear it, no matter what you say.

256
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,096
Obviously some of them are suspicious enough

257
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:07,536
to form a resistance.

258
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:13,697
You're talking about a handful of people
compared to millions who wouldn't know
the truth if it was standing right in front of them.

259
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:16,817
It's all lies and propaganda,
as far as they're concerned.

260
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:17,978
<i>We're wrong,</i>

261
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:18,977
they're right.

262
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:20,057
They're good,

263
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:21,017
<i>we're bad.</i>

264
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:25,938
We must worship the Ori or die, and they
will fight until we are dead or they are.

265
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:27,178
Period.

266
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,099
I'm very sorry to keep you waiting.

267
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,259
Where is Dr. Jackson?

268
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:41,160
He's... otherwise occupied at the moment.
We're going to have to proceed without him.

269
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,400
Ah, it's no matter,

270
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,480
I only asked he be here as a courtesy,

271
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,440
seeing as he negotiated the original
treaty between our two countries,

272
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:52,621
resulting in Russia loaning you our Stargate.

273
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:53,981
Yes, "loaning",

274
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:58,672
in return for full participation in this
program and considerable sums of money.

275
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:00,202
I am aware of that.

276
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:04,682
As I said, I only asked for this meeting
out of courtesy to you and Dr. Jackson.

277
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,813
<i>You have been admirable comrades
in our co-operative efforts.</i>

278
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:10,063
However,

279
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:13,354
official notification has been
given to your President as we speak.

280
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:14,044
Of what?

281
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:17,834
Well, as you know, the treaty
renewal comes up in two weeks.

282
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:21,284
Russia will no longer be participating
under the current structure.

283
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:22,404
What are you saying?

284
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:23,765
I'm saying

285
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:27,286
we are taking our Stargate back.

286
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:33,726
<i>So,</i>

287
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,446
<i>this girl in the bar,</i>

288
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:36,806
<i>her name was Denya,</i>

289
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:39,047
<i>and we struck up a bit of a friendship.</i>

290
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:42,087
By the looks on your faces,
I can see you're not surprised

291
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:47,498
I had more in common with a village harlot than I did
with any of the ladies from the local knitting circle.

292
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:49,067
Don't know what you're talking about.

293
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:52,788
At least she was honest.

294
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:54,949
I was pregnant once.

295
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,029
Really?

296
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:58,229
It didn't last long.

297
00:17:58,548 --> 00:17:59,908
Oh, I'm sorry.

298
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:04,069
Hey, I heard something really weird.

299
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,630
I promise you, I've heard it all.

300
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,470
Well, have you ever heard of someone getting
pregnant without actually doing the deed?

301
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,590
- How could that happen?
- I don't know.

302
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,751
Maybe you fell asleep, you know?

303
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,270
That's happened to me before.

304
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,991
I've been drunk and not remembered whole days.

305
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:20,431
I wasn't talking about me.

306
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:23,801
No, I was just...

307
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:28,492
just wondering if you've ever heard of
the Ori giving someone a baby magically.

308
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:31,632
They perform miracles all the time, right?

309
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:32,913
If you say so.

310
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,573
<i>She's smart, too.</i>

311
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:37,293
<i>She was testing me.</i>

312
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:41,174
Are you saying she was part
of the anti-Ori underground?

313
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:43,714
Took a long time to get her to admit it.

314
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:47,834
She said she was afraid of Seevis,
and that he'd kill her if he found out.

315
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:50,835
What do you want?

316
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,636
Take your hands...

317
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:57,916
off me!

318
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:00,596
So what did I do?

319
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:03,076
She is unholy.

320
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,517
She conspires with those who would

321
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:08,477
lead us from the path of Origin.

322
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:10,597
I don't know who you've been
talking to, but it's a lie.

323
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:15,438
She is an unbeliever, and she
must be punished for her sins.

324
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,449
Get me Richard Woolsey, now.

325
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:27,899
General.

326
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:31,300
Where are the rest of the international
committee representatives? Why aren't they here?

327
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,779
This has nothing to do with them.

328
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,150
I think it does.

329
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,000
The Stargate belongs to Russia.

330
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
Now, in the past,

331
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,760
my government has been unwilling to
establish and support a Stargate program of its own,

332
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:45,201
- but that has changed.
- Because China is backing you.

333
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:47,521
Do the rest of the committee members know this?

334
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:51,542
They will be invited to participate in
the program the same as they have in yours.

335
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:53,262
As will your country.

336
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:56,523
You really think my government will give up the Gate?

337
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:59,843
I do not see what choice they will have.

338
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:11,724
- Who else in the village has been corrupted?
- Apart from you?

339
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:13,884
I have no idea what you're talking about.

340
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:20,805
No one shall look upon,

341
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:21,805
speak to,

342
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,725
or aid such evil.

343
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:31,046
You will tell me who you've conspired with,
and the unbelievers will be found out, and punished...

344
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:33,646
for their sins.

345
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:38,047
- Hallowed are the Ori.
- Hallowed are the Ori.

346
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:53,849
<i>I don't know why I expected him
to come rushing over and unchain me.</i>

347
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:57,450
<i>Just the mother of his unborn child...</i>

348
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,550
<i>or so he was supposed to think.</i>

349
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,863
She's dying out there.

350
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:04,264
I know.

351
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:08,865
Don't you think if she was going to say anything,
she would have told you already?

352
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:34,268
<i>I didn't know why he eventually did it...</i>

353
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:37,868
<i>or why Seevis let us go.</i>

354
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:42,498
I was left out there

355
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,469
without food or water

356
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:47,169
for three days.

357
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:51,570
I can't believe the baby survived that.

358
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,770
Part of me was hoping it didn't.

359
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,971
It's kind of surprising part of you was hoping it did.

360
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:06,371
I mean...

361
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:09,972
given how it was conceived.

362
00:24:14,372 --> 00:24:15,773
It's hard to explain.

363
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:20,873
Seevis?

364
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:24,673
He won't bother us again, I promise you.

365
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:28,473
You don't think I'm evil?

366
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:35,474
I'm sorry I left you out there for so long.

367
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,475
Please forgive me.

368
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:03,478
I will see you this evening. Fear not.

369
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,080
<i>Despite Tomin's reassurances,</i>

370
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,881
<i>the idea of spending a day in the village with
Seevis just a stone throw away made me nervous.</i>

371
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:32,881
<i>Besides, it was high time I did
some more extensive recon.</i>

372
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,085
<i>I knew what was happening.</i>

373
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:09,685
<i>I knew where they were going every day,
what they were doing...</i>

374
00:26:12,186 --> 00:26:15,586
<i>but seeing it was something else entirely.</i>

375
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:18,886
<i>Impressive, isn't it?</i>

376
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:32,888
<i>General.</i>

377
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,489
You wished to see me?

378
00:26:34,988 --> 00:26:39,799
From the sounds of it, the Ori are planning an invasion
of massive proportions in the very near future.

379
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:44,210
It looks like it may be a very bad time to be arguing
over who gets to use the Stargate, Colonel...

380
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,490
but I assume

381
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:46,889
you were counting on that.

382
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,920
No sane individual or country
wants to face war at any time.

383
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:56,091
Telling me about your government's intentions
was more than mere courtesy.

384
00:26:56,431 --> 00:27:02,792
Doing it with the Chinese representative
of the oversight committee present
was meant to point out China's involvement.

385
00:27:02,992 --> 00:27:07,352
That wasn't in the official notification
to terminate the treaty given to the President.

386
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,992
Obviously, it couldn't be.

387
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:10,853
They offered you a deal

388
00:27:10,892 --> 00:27:13,492
to back your own SGC program.

389
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:17,893
In truth, you don't really know if you like that
scenario any better than the one currently in practice.

390
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:22,094
You did, however, see
an opportunity to use it as leverage.

391
00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:26,454
But you couldn't very well

392
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:31,925
present a wish list along with the official
notification without it looking like blackmail,

393
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:34,856
or have it on record that
you were merely using the Chinese,

394
00:27:34,895 --> 00:27:39,295
so you left it to me to figure out
and ask you the question...

395
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:42,596
What is it you really want?

396
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:49,597
Stay back.

397
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:52,197
I promise you don't want to come any closer.

398
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,397
You can put that down.

399
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:54,598
It's okay.

400
00:27:56,498 --> 00:27:58,098
We had to put you through that.

401
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:00,298
To be sure that we could trust you.

402
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,100
He was part of the underground?

403
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Seevis is the leader.

404
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,660
<i>The religious pomp and circumstance is a cover.</i>

405
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:24,501
The rest is for money, power, and influence, the things
you need when you're wanting to mount a rebellion.

406
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:27,901
Do they not fear being discovered by the Ori?

407
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:28,902
Of course,

408
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,902
but the only other choice is to do nothing.

409
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,862
<i>What they were planning
was quite the opposite of nothing.</i>

410
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:35,302
We have the plans

411
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:38,302
and we have many people down there on the inside.

412
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:40,903
You really think it can work?

413
00:28:40,943 --> 00:28:42,343
It has to.

414
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:49,864
The ships had to be activated by the Priors,

415
00:28:49,904 --> 00:28:54,894
but Seevis said he had found a way to rig enough
of them to start off a massive chain reaction.

416
00:28:54,904 --> 00:28:56,425
<i>From what I could tell,</i>

417
00:28:56,465 --> 00:28:58,105
<i>it looked like it might work.</i>

418
00:28:58,145 --> 00:29:00,905
Three days from now, in a grand celebration,

419
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:04,505
each Prior will activate a ship
in a show of the Ori's power.

420
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:06,606
Everyone will be there.

421
00:29:06,906 --> 00:29:10,306
All those who built the ships,
as well as those who will soon board them

422
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:12,706
and go off and fight in the name of the Ori.

423
00:29:12,746 --> 00:29:14,307
Tens of thousands.

424
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:17,507
You're going to kill all of them?

425
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:22,908
Gods cannot be gods without those
who stand beneath them gazing upwards.

426
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:31,788
They were going to try and undermine
the Ori's power by eliminating as many of their
followers as they could in one fell swoop...

427
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:36,409
Something I'm not sure
we would have done in their position.

428
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,910
Shut the windows.

429
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,910
<i>They trusted me.</i>

430
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:44,700
Granted

431
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,511
they nearly killed me so I could earn their trust,
but at this point, I felt I had to take a chance.

432
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,512
<i>I told them exactly who I was and how I'd gotten there.</i>

433
00:30:06,313 --> 00:30:12,474
The communication terminal and the stones
had been taken by the Prior to Celestis after
Daniel and I had been caught using them.

434
00:30:12,613 --> 00:30:14,144
How did Seevis get his hands on it?

435
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:17,514
Apparently, he has spies among
the monks in the city of Celestis.

436
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:20,315
<i>They're humans in training to become Priors.</i>

437
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:26,915
Every now and then, artifacts which predate the Ori
ascension are found or dug up, deemed heretical,

438
00:30:27,055 --> 00:30:29,815
and then brought to the city to be burned in the fires.

439
00:30:29,856 --> 00:30:34,146
When the communication terminal came through,
Seevis's men recognized its significance,

440
00:30:34,156 --> 00:30:38,517
and they risked everything to save
it and smuggle it out of the city.

441
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:46,238
So, it appears that Daniel's crazy little speech
about communication from another galaxy
did not fall entirely on deaf ears.

442
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:50,438
And the Ori didn't know, they couldn't tell what
was happening right underneath their noses?

443
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:51,518
Can't be sure,

444
00:30:51,598 --> 00:30:55,918
but Seevis didn't want me to try and contact
you until after the sabotage plan had gone through.

445
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:58,119
In case the Ori detected it.

446
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,519
Just to be safe.

447
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,719
Vala?

448
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,721
Vala?

449
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,521
Blessed are those who follow the path in unison.

450
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:22,122
Prior?

451
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:30,523
Your wife is not at home, Tomin.

452
00:31:30,563 --> 00:31:31,923
She must be at market.

453
00:31:31,962 --> 00:31:33,123
Must she?

454
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:35,723
To what do I owe the honor of such a visit?

455
00:31:36,324 --> 00:31:39,324
Word of your courage has spread.

456
00:31:40,323 --> 00:31:44,524
If you refer to my unchaining of Vala,
I believe Seevis accused her unjustly.

457
00:31:44,564 --> 00:31:46,325
<i>She is not corrupt.</i>

458
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:50,725
Surely the Ori would not have allowed her
to have survived so long without food or water.

459
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:53,125
<i>They sent her to me.</i>

460
00:31:53,165 --> 00:31:54,525
She is my wife,

461
00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:56,125
the mother of my unborn child.

462
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,926
Is she, now?

463
00:31:59,726 --> 00:32:03,327
The injury that crippled you since childhood,

464
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:08,207
the one I have cured you of to make you a strong,
proud warrior...

465
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:12,128
Trust I will use the strength I have been given
to fight all unbelievers in the name of the Ori.

466
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:12,967
Yes.

467
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:16,928
<i>But the same wound that made you lame</i>

468
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:20,889
also made you unable to father children.

469
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,249
But then...

470
00:32:40,331 --> 00:32:42,011
Are you saying she betrayed me?

471
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:42,931
The child

472
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:45,732
is the will of the Ori.

473
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:47,932
<i>That is all that matters.</i>

474
00:32:48,931 --> 00:32:52,132
<i>Your courage will be rewarded, Tomin.</i>

475
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:53,532
<i>Fear not.</i>

476
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:01,293
Hallowed are the children of the Ori.

477
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,253
Hallowed are the Ori.

478
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:26,936
<i>Don't go.</i>

479
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,856
Today is the day we've been waiting for.

480
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:40,217
Ten Priors from Celestis come to bless
the starcraft we have been building
these past many months.

481
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,618
- I know.
- Everyone is going.

482
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:47,018
Everyone, even the women and children.
Of course, I did not expect you...

483
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,339
I know you've been tired,

484
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,499
but it is going to be a great day,
if you want to come.

485
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:00,900
Please.

486
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:04,100
Stay with me today.

487
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:15,181
I have a bad feeling.

488
00:34:16,462 --> 00:34:18,422
I can't explain it.

489
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,382
Don't you ever just get bad feelings?

490
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:23,862
Of course I do,

491
00:34:24,942 --> 00:34:27,583
but then I turn to the Ori for guidance.

492
00:34:30,183 --> 00:34:30,944
Tomin...

493
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:32,743
The day of reckoning

494
00:34:33,063 --> 00:34:36,224
for all those
who were raised by evil is upon them.

495
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:40,385
<i>I have spent my whole life waiting
for the chance to walk the path as I do now.</i>

496
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,465
My only hope is that you would walk it with me.

497
00:34:52,505 --> 00:34:54,866
Blessed are those who walk in unison.

498
00:35:04,507 --> 00:35:07,108
When you say "day of reckoning..."

499
00:35:07,187 --> 00:35:11,228
We've heard numerous reports of the Priors
in this galaxy warning of an impending doomsday.

500
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:15,349
A day when all who have renounced
the Ori will feel their wrath.

501
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:18,428
We knew the Priors were just the first wave.

502
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:20,949
The real crusade is about to begin.

503
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:23,229
The ships are planning to leave.

504
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:25,989
But that would mean...

505
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,110
Somewhere out there,
the Ori have a working Supergate.

506
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:41,321
<i>Turns out the horrible feeling
I'd lied to Tomin about was completely justified,</i>

507
00:35:41,331 --> 00:35:43,332
<i>but for a different reason.</i>

508
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:47,333
<i>Thousands of men, women and
children did not die that day.</i>

509
00:35:47,472 --> 00:35:49,432
<i>Seevis's plan failed.</i>

510
00:35:58,873 --> 00:35:59,994
<i>It didn't work.</i>

511
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:02,434
<i>The sabotage had broken down.</i>

512
00:36:02,474 --> 00:36:07,074
<i>Whether the Ori had detected it or the Priors
managed to thwart it on their own, we don't know.</i>

513
00:36:07,114 --> 00:36:10,235
<i>All we know is that the ships came
to life and nothing happened,</i>

514
00:36:10,355 --> 00:36:12,755
<i>except the crowd cheered and began prostrating,</i>

515
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:16,116
<i>praying for a swift victory over all unbelievers.</i>

516
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:19,556
Do you have any other intel we could use?

517
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:23,637
You said this Seevis had access to the specs
on the ships. What kind of weaponry do they have?

518
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:24,597
And shields.

519
00:36:24,636 --> 00:36:26,397
And anything on the power source they're using.

520
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:27,997
No, no, I...

521
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:36,358
Guys, what's going on?

522
00:36:36,398 --> 00:36:37,638
Jackson?

523
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:40,129
How did I get here?

524
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:41,418
The emulator is still running.

525
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,779
Something must have happened on Vala's end.

526
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:10,142
Tomin...

527
00:37:10,182 --> 00:37:12,702
You said you did not
think I could kill an unbeliever.

528
00:37:12,742 --> 00:37:14,622
Well, I'm so sorry I was wrong.

529
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:17,263
You have to listen to me.

530
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:17,943
No!

531
00:37:18,263 --> 00:37:21,023
I am deaf to all but the teachings of Origin!

532
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:24,223
The Prior told me

533
00:37:24,464 --> 00:37:25,983
Seevis was corrupt,

534
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:29,864
that he'd tried to sabotage the ceremony
and would have killed thousands.

535
00:37:29,904 --> 00:37:35,345
He sent me here to kill Seevis and here
I found you, with him, conspiring over that device!

536
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:37,905
They made me do it.

537
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:48,386
They told me they would kill me
if I didn't help them, and after what
they did to me out there, wouldn't you?

538
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:54,427
They thought this device was for communication,
but they were too afraid to use it themselves,

539
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:57,608
so they kidnapped me and
forced me to do it for them.

540
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:02,128
Did the Prior tell you I was with them?

541
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,248
<i>Did he tell you</i>

542
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:05,328
<i>- to kill me?
- No.</i>

543
00:38:05,728 --> 00:38:07,408
Well, there you go, then.

544
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:11,488
Were you able to communicate
with the unbelievers far away?

545
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:12,469
Yes,

546
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:15,509
and there is much I can tell you

547
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:19,110
about them, if you just put that weapon down.

548
00:38:22,631 --> 00:38:25,430
Tomin, you have to believe me, please.

549
00:38:31,551 --> 00:38:34,952
I overheard your conversation
with the Prior the other day.

550
00:38:36,511 --> 00:38:39,672
<i>I know, I'm sorry.
I should have told you I was there,</i>

551
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:41,312
but I was so afraid.

552
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,672
What he said shocked me...

553
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:46,113
that this child

554
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:48,274
is the will of the Ori?

555
00:38:52,273 --> 00:38:53,074
Tomin,

556
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:55,034
I swear

557
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:58,754
I have not betrayed you.
I have not been with anyone,

558
00:38:58,914 --> 00:39:00,315
but you,

559
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:05,955
<i>so if you truly cannot father a child,
then this baby is a miracle.</i>

560
00:39:06,195 --> 00:39:10,476
It's our miracle, and this is a great burden,
which I cannot bear alone,

561
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:14,196
so from this point on,
we must walk the path together.

562
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:25,038
I must leave soon for war.

563
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,198
Then I must come with you.

564
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,560
So what exactly
did we have to give up in the end?

565
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:51,670
A 304.

566
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,601
Really?

567
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:55,361
I'm surprised the President agreed to that.

568
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,641
Colonel Chekov's had his eye on one for a while.

569
00:39:57,682 --> 00:39:59,561
The latest was just about to roll out.

570
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:03,642
I thought the next Daedalus-class ship wasn't
due out of the pipeline for over a year.

571
00:40:03,722 --> 00:40:06,442
It was a huge concession, but
we didn't have much choice.

572
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:08,602
<i>Sir,</i>

573
00:40:09,802 --> 00:40:14,803
the Tok'ra and the Asgard are scanning
for any subspace anomalies that
would indicate Supergate activity.

574
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:18,524
We're monitoring the existing black holes
that we know of, but it's a big galaxy.

575
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:20,724
And as we know,
the Ori could have built another one.

576
00:40:20,763 --> 00:40:24,244
The interim council have placed Ha'tak-class
vessels in every region on high alert.

577
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:27,845
This is one needle in a haystack we better find.
Do whatever you have to do.

578
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:31,885
If the Ori can send troops and ships here,
we are going to need every advantage we can find.

579
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:33,925
Merlin was working on a weapon to fight the Ori.

580
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:38,045
Every ally we have and everyone else
on this base has already devoted
themselves to finding the Supergate.

581
00:40:38,246 --> 00:40:40,446
Sir, it won't take us long

582
00:40:40,486 --> 00:40:45,367
to search one planet where there
may be an advanced weapon designed
specifically to fight these guys.

583
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:47,647
This weapon won't help us against their followers.

584
00:40:47,687 --> 00:40:52,017
I don't think so, no, but it'll be a lot easier
convincing their followers their gods are false

585
00:40:52,027 --> 00:40:54,148
if their gods aren't around anymore.

586
00:40:54,228 --> 00:40:55,027
Go.

587
00:40:55,408 --> 00:40:56,728
Thank you, Sir.
