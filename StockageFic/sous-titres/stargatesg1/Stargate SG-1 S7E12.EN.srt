1
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:07,841
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

2
00:00:07,927 --> 00:00:10,316
He was unlike any warrior we have met.

3
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:14,844
We could be dealing with
a new kind of technology.

4
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:18,363
- Who was the first Goa'uld to find it?
- His name was Telchak.

5
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:19,277
Telchak.

6
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:23,519
If it was hidden near a water source,
it could be the basis of the mythology.

7
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,361
It might be possible to engineer a weapon
to use against these warriors.

8
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:32,719
C4!

9
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:44,605
What is your planet of origin?

10
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,000
He just gave us his home world.

11
00:00:56,527 --> 00:01:00,281
The State Department received a ransom
demand for Dr Jackson and Dr Lee.

12
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:03,837
We've been given 72 hours to pay,
or they will be killed.

13
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:07,522
- Do they know who's behind it?
- They haven't identified themselves.

14
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:11,520
Intel indicates we're dealing with
Honduran antigovernment revolutionaries.

15
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:14,167
They're following the book on this one.

16
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:17,319
Officially, they have
no intention of paying any ransom.

17
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:20,444
- Unofficially?
- Ties with their government are at stake.

18
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:24,805
No one is willing to risk
breaking policy over this.

19
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:30,007
So we send a team in to extract'em.
We've done it before.

20
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:34,399
The rebels think our tenuous relationship
with the Nicaraguan government

21
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:37,843
will prevent us from taking action,
but they're wrong.

22
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:39,804
The president has agreed to help.

23
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:44,802
As we speak, he's requesting that
the CIA gather whatever intel they can.

24
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:48,482
But whether he's willing
to risk an international incident...

25
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,558
Thank you, sir.

26
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:54,322
I'll let you know
the second I hear anything.

27
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:58,998
Apúrate, gringo/

28
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:02,398
Rápido/

29
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:06,238
Apúrate/

30
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:20,477
You have not had
water or food for two days.

31
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:27,198
Mm!

32
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:30,798
Muy delicioso.

33
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:34,321
Pick of the season.

34
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,038
This is very good.

35
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,839
Today we're going to start slow.

36
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:47,407
I'm going to ask you again.

37
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:53,163
What is this?

38
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,880
And this is the part where you do not talk?

39
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,764
OK.

40
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,236
Mm?

41
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:12,319
For you... and your friend,

42
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:17,161
if you tell me what this is.

43
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:22,519
I don't know how long
someone can go without food,

44
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:28,125
but I believe the human body
needs water every three or four days.

45
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,158
It's an ancient artefact.

46
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:37,561
- An artefact?
- Yeah.

47
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:43,040
I'm an archaeologist.
That's what I do - I look for... artefacts.

48
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,362
Well... I found one.

49
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:55,238
Seriously, I'm an archaeologist. You can
look me up on the Internet if you want.

50
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:57,716
Do you have a computer?

51
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:00,401
It all makes perfect sense.

52
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:03,479
You're nothing more
than an archaeologist,

53
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:06,365
and you find and study artefacts.

54
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,915
- It makes perfect sense.
- Hm.

55
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:13,316
I'm going to ask you one last time.

56
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:17,400
What is this?

57
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,685
And again you're not so talkative.

58
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:31,882
What gives you the right to come into
our country and steal valuable artefacts?

59
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:37,004
You call yourself a scientist?
You're nothing but a thief.

60
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:40,124
And you think you're better than me.

61
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:44,485
- But I have reasons for what I do.
- I don't doubt that.

62
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,484
Chalo.

63
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:09,876
And here's something else
you should not doubt, compadre.

64
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:14,040
You will tell me what I want to know.

65
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:23,239
The CIA operative in Honduras,
an Agent Burke,

66
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,887
says he knows where Dr Jackson
and Dr Lee were taken.

67
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,276
- Burke?
- Do you know him?

68
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:33,036
- Yes, I do.
- Anything I should know about?

69
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:36,039
He's the only agent on this.

70
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:39,915
- We're stuck with him regardless, right?
- Right.

71
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:45,998
- Nothing you should know about.
- I see.

72
00:06:46,087 --> 00:06:48,647
He's requested
you participate in the extraction.

73
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:50,638
The president has green-lit the op.

74
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:55,960
There's a C-130 waiting at Peterson.
It leaves for Honduras in two hours.

75
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:57,480
Yes, sir.

76
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:14,041
- Sir?
- I'm going after Daniel.

77
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:17,286
Good.

78
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:23,321
- This other mission...
- Shouldn't be a problem, sir.

79
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:26,524
- When do you leave?
- Now.

80
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:27,835
Good luck.

81
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,766
You too.

82
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,155
A este lado.

83
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:53,955
I don't know anything!
I don't know anything!

84
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,684
We've confirmed that Anubis
has a base on Tartarus.

85
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:12,887
A powerful sensor array prevents anyone
from approaching the planet unnoticed.

86
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:18,166
The Stargate on Tartarus is inside the
structure with a force field protecting it.

87
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,080
We need to know why Anubis
created this new soldier,

88
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,160
confirm what we believe his intentions are
and, if possible, stop him. Any ideas?

89
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:29,286
Even if we could defeat the force field, we
have to assume the Stargate is guarded.

90
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:33,280
We must gain access to the planet
by shutting down the sensor array.

91
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:37,246
- I agree. The question is, how?
- I will walk through the Stargate.

92
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:39,443
- Selmak?
- Yes.

93
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:40,801
Come again?

94
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,355
I wear the armour of Anubis's assassin.

95
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:47,963
According to your account on Ramius's
planet, it passed through the force field.

96
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:50,800
But at what physical cost?
We have no way of knowing.

97
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:54,243
The force field at that Stargate is
more powerful than the one we used.

98
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm sorry, kid.
I'm with Selmak on this one.

99
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:00,477
He'll keep me alive.

100
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:04,765
Does anyone else have a better idea?

101
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:12,796
Once I've deactivated the sensor array,
a scout ship can then approach the planet.

102
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:16,846
Radioactive isotopes taken beforehand
will permit us to move around freely

103
00:09:16,927 --> 00:09:19,919
without being detected
by sensors inside the base.

104
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:23,363
- What's your exit plan?
- The scout ship.

105
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:26,803
I will conceal it in one of the planet's
many low-lying chasms,

106
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:29,685
powering down to further avoid detection.

107
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:32,156
Major, you have a go.

108
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:45,719
¿Estás bien?

109
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:47,798
Sí, bueno, gracias.

110
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:57,438
You don't look very happy to see me.

111
00:09:57,527 --> 00:10:02,442
I'd have given anything to see your face
when you heard my name.

112
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:04,916
Hey, it's OK, man...

113
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:06,998
It's not OK.

114
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:11,478
I've got 48 hours to find my friend
before he's killed.

115
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:17,358
- Just tell me what you know.
- OK, all business. I can dig that station.

116
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:20,764
This is the last place Daniel was seen

117
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:23,839
before he hired a Rogelio Duran
to take him into the jungle.

118
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:29,877
A short time after that, he was snatched
by anti-Honduran extremists.

119
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:32,242
And you know this... how?

120
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:34,522
It's how this splinter group does business.

121
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:38,725
Last year they kidnapped an important
engineer working on the Cajon River Dam.

122
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:41,037
Big American contract,
insurance pays off,

123
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:45,166
and they finance their little war
against the government with the ransom.

124
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:49,479
- This engineer. Did he live?
- Yeah, he did. Sometimes they don't.

125
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:54,804
- What about weapons?
- OK, this is colourful.

126
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,845
Honduras and Nicaragua
are having a territorial dispute.

127
00:10:57,927 --> 00:11:00,395
I know what you're thinkin'.
When are they not?

128
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:03,001
So anyone
in the "I hate Honduras" fan club

129
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:05,760
can shelter behind
the Nicaraguan borders and buy guns.

130
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:08,600
What kinda guns?
AKs, AKs for days.

131
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:11,121
Nicaragua gets their stuff
from Russia now,

132
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:13,846
but in the '80s they inherited
all of it from Cuba.

133
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:17,602
They let us fight Cuba from their shores,
we got our asses kicked,

134
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:20,326
and Cuba gives them the guns.

135
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:25,959
We could get shot at by an AK-47
that was fired at the Bay of Pigs attack.

136
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:30,756
- You've been down here too long, Burke.
- You think so?

137
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:35,443
- You know why I got this crappy posting?
- Are you gonna blame me now?

138
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:37,597
You coulda stood up for me.
Hillary left me.

139
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:41,726
What happens when one team member is
killed and the other won't vouch for you?

140
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:46,244
I didn't see what happened to Woods.
I told 'em what I knew. I wasn't gonna lie.

141
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm not talkin' about lying. I'm talkin' about
my head. We were buddies. You knew me.

142
00:11:57,207 --> 00:12:00,882
- I told 'em what I knew.
- You didn't tell 'em enough.

143
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:05,802
And now you're here, stuck in
my part of the world. You need me.

144
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,560
- And I'm calling it on this one.
- I don't think so.

145
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:12,196
I know how to get over the borders,
I know where these rebels operate.

146
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:15,324
- Oh, yeah, I'm in charge.
- No.

147
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:18,877
- You're just the guide.
- Just the guide?

148
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:22,642
- That's what you think of me now?
- That's right.

149
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:26,959
You're not so gone you don't understand
the need for a clear chain of command.

150
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,515
You wanna know how "gone" I am?

151
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:36,965
¿ Quieres algo más, señor?

152
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:40,357
Sí. Necesito un guía.

153
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,844
I am a guide.

154
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:46,122
This? It's just my day job.

155
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:06,607
I never thought I would die like this.

156
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,803
Oh, you're not dead yet.

157
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:14,876
I'm sorry, Daniel.
I couldn't take it.

158
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:20,201
- I told them.
- What?

159
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:23,757
What did you tell them?

160
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:25,644
Everything.

161
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:05,445
- How's that, sir?
- Pretty good.

162
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:09,839
- Reminds me of my old football days.
- Did they have helmets in those days?

163
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:11,246
Funny.

164
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:15,718
- Jacob, you OK in there?
- It's surprisingly light.

165
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,162
- I guess it's time.
- Good luck.

166
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:20,238
Thank you, George.

167
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:04,597
You. Come with me.

168
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,958
Sit.

169
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,158
You seem damaged.

170
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:55,080
- Come on, Dad.
- The array is yet to be shut down.

171
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:59,240
We are helpless to act. Even if we were
to attempt secure communication...

172
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:05,800
We'd have to leave our hidden position,
making us visible to their sensors.

173
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:22,637
- Thoth.
- Lord Anubis, I was not expecting you.

174
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:25,400
Tell me how this one has fared.

175
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:27,921
This one has just returned, my lord.

176
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:32,637
I need time to finish my preliminary
analysis before I make a proper report.

177
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:34,797
It can wait.

178
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:39,483
There is a remote probe malfunctioning.
It requires your attention.

179
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,444
Yes, my lord.

180
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:53,721
So many things could go wrong.
He's so stubborn.

181
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:57,800
Perhaps it is time to consider...

182
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:02,477
The sensor ray is powered down.

183
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:08,041
No doubt your father's stubbornness.

184
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:15,838
- Dad, we're on the way.
- Good.

185
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:19,237
When you touch down, proceed
to the exhaust port assemblage.

186
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:23,036
- I think I've found a way to get you in.
- Copy.

187
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,558
Now, hold up.

188
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:42,565
- This is it.
- As I told you, there's nothing here.

189
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:45,400
There is this well
in the middle of nowhere,

190
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:49,082
standard US military boot-tread
all around.

191
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:52,684
Make a wish.

192
00:17:57,007 --> 00:18:02,639
What took you so long? How hard
could it be to track their GPS locators?

193
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:06,003
I'm just kiddin'. I only been here
a couple of minutes myself.

194
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:10,080
- Change your mind?
- In a manner of speaking.

195
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:15,480
- Vete. Regrésate a la cantina.
- ¿ Cuatro mil? Muchas gracias, señor.

196
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,717
Momentito.

197
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:19,923
This is the end of the road, man.

198
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:24,000
You didn't think these guys were
gonna make it easy on you, did ya?

199
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:27,557
- I'll take you where you need to go.
- For old times' sake?

200
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:32,323
You know, I took an emotional inventory
and I realised that I have some issues.

201
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:36,605
Thought maybe we can put
our petty differences aside on this one.

202
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:39,963
You're gonna need me
when this thing goes down, buddy.

203
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:42,686
Come on, give me a chance.
I won't let you down.

204
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:52,160
Sí, vete. Gracias. Vamos.

205
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,157
Vaya con Dios.

206
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:59,207
Now we're talkin', sports fans!

207
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,523
OK, my name is Burke
and I'll be your guide.

208
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:07,885
Today we'll be looking at indigenous
vegetation of Central America.

209
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,197
Watch your step, ladies.
It's not Minnesota.

210
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:12,278
Easy.

211
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:23,315
If you value the life of your friend,
you will tell me what I want to know.

212
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:28,083
Your friend told me this device may be
the origin of the "Fountain of Youth" myth.

213
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,556
- Maybe.
- How does it work?

214
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:34,765
I don't know. You grabbed us
five minutes after we found it.

215
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:38,402
Who is this "Telchak"?

216
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:41,004
He's a mythological figure,

217
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:44,523
a Mayan god that may or may not
have lived here thousands of years ago.

218
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:48,486
So this device is
many thousands of years old?

219
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:49,397
Possibly.

220
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:53,844
And this Mayan god
brought this device to this temple?

221
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,043
For what purpose?

222
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,155
- To hide it? To use it? I don't know.
- Use it? On whom?

223
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,842
- People! Mayan people!
- What would it do to them?

224
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:14,364
The research I used to find it just
gave a cryptic warning the device was...

225
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:18,122
dangerous, even harmful.
That's all I know!

226
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:22,557
I do not think it is so harmful.

227
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:29,725
I have never in my life felt
as strong as I do right now.

228
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,842
- You turned it on?
- Yes.

229
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:41,397
Turn it off. You don't know
what you're dealing with.

230
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:43,717
The effects of the device may be unstable.

231
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:48,403
It's very dangerous. It's beyond
our comprehension. Turn it off!

232
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:51,081
- You're lying.
- What if he isn't?

233
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,603
The device is cursed.
Rafael, we should turn it off.

234
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,484
Turn it off?

235
00:20:56,567 --> 00:21:01,482
- Do you not feel different as well?
- I do, and it scares me.

236
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:04,563
Por favor, Rafael.

237
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:07,719
If you will not turn it off... I will.

238
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:44,916
What happened?

239
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:47,521
I fooled the exhaust port
into purging the system.

240
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:50,804
- I mean with the sensor array.
- I got held up.

241
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:54,163
You weren't worried about me, were you?

242
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:58,323
Help me get this off.

243
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:03,356
Rebels move around a lot.
The grunts are self-taught bush fighters.

244
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,245
It's harvest season.
Most of them tend to their farms now.

245
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:13,119
Those who don't are ex-military, holding
up about 20 clicks northwest of Ocotal.

246
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:34,357
Well... this wasn't
supposed to be on the tour.

247
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,757
At least we know we're on the right track.

248
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,558
I've been shot.

249
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,359
Agh! No, no, no.

250
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:53,802
You have been shot.

251
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:55,957
Sí.

252
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:58,766
Air Rescue should be here
in about an hour.

253
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:00,917
I've been lying here for days.

254
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:03,760
- What's another hour?
- Who did this?

255
00:23:03,847 --> 00:23:08,318
Unos malditos bandidos
que mueren del dolor del culo.

256
00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:10,318
All right, all right.

257
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:14,878
- We're looking for two scientists.
- Dr Jackson?

258
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:19,836
They have him.
They went north, across the border. Go.

259
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:23,556
- We're not just gonna leave you.
- Sure you can, señor.

260
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:25,638
Help will be here soon.

261
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:30,164
Don't worry.
This is not the first time I've been shot.

262
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:34,282
Save your friends.

263
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:39,202
- Please. They owe me lots of money.
- Ah.

264
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:49,802
I love American gum.

265
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:53,805
Good guys.

266
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:15,085
Speak.

267
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:18,876
Lord Anubis,
one of the Kull Warriors is missing.

268
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:21,606
What is the reason for this behaviour?

269
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:23,917
There was... damage,

270
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:27,238
but I believe our method of
governing the symbiote mind is flawed.

271
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:29,887
Unacceptable.

272
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:34,358
Determine the origin of the flaw
and report back to me.

273
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:37,118
Yes, my lord.

274
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:47,679
He moved, I killed him.
It was as simple as that.

275
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:53,205
- I thought he was a hostile.
- It's all history, Burke. Now's not the time.

276
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:56,518
I know we were out of position.

277
00:24:56,607 --> 00:24:59,883
I wanted to cut the angle down
as you approached the objective.

278
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:02,527
I guess Woods was doin' the same.

279
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:06,885
So you both took it upon yourselves
to improvise at the same time?

280
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,958
That's right.

281
00:25:21,527 --> 00:25:26,157
- That's the third one I've seen.
- How many do you think Anubis has?

282
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:31,560
There's no way of telling yet.
I'm just guessing, but at least a handful.

283
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:35,242
The lab I was in
was made to service several.

284
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:57,004
- Symbiote holding tanks.
- All empty.

285
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:02,278
This one is not.

286
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:29,359
- Shouldn't we at least wait till night-time?
- I don't think we have that long.

287
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:33,998
- We won't get far before they kill us.
- If we stay, they'll definitely kill us.

288
00:26:34,087 --> 00:26:36,806
I saw the short-term effects of that device.

289
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,482
I know what a sarcophagus does to
a person's sanity. This is more powerful.

290
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:45,925
I don't want to stick around to find out
what long-term exposure does.

291
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:15,322
Judging by the holding tanks in this room,

292
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:20,606
Anubis must plan to have the queen
spawn thousands of Goa'uld. But why?

293
00:27:20,687 --> 00:27:24,202
A symbiote is spawned with the genetic
memory of the maternal bloodline.

294
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:26,517
They're egomaniacal and power-hungry.

295
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:28,882
Not a great combination for a foot soldier.

296
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:31,640
That's right. But look at this.

297
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:34,525
This queen, whoever she is,
must be in league with Anubis.

298
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:38,680
She's preparing for a spawn cycle,
yet her brain-wave pattern is minimal.

299
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:41,839
She has no intention of
passing on her genetic memory.

300
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:45,966
- The symbiotes will be blank slates.
- Much like Egeria on Pangar.

301
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:49,676
And Anubis will be free to
imprint them however he sees fit.

302
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:53,396
No free will - they're drones.
They make the perfect soldier.

303
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:57,480
Deadly, fearless, unquestioning loyalty.

304
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:01,196
This is too similar to what happened
on Pangar to be a coincidence.

305
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:05,917
- How did Anubis find out about Egeria?
- Jonas Quinn.

306
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:11,483
Anubis must have found out
when he scanned Jonas Quinn's mind.

307
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:14,718
If Anubis had any designs
on creating a drone soldier,

308
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:18,277
that information would've been
the final piece of the puzzle.

309
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:21,837
This queen must not
be permitted to spawn again.

310
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:24,236
- Teal'c's right.
- OK.

311
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:29,404
We take what time we have remaining and
try to find out what else Anubis is up to.

312
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:32,684
Then we detonate the C4
and get outta here.

313
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:44,845
Could be just a coupla clicks now.

314
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:49,638
How can you trust me?

315
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:52,286
I don't.

316
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:55,439
Think I asked you to come here
so I could shoot you too?

317
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,518
Why would I think that?

318
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:01,962
- Forget I said anything.
- You've had opportunities before now.

319
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:04,322
What's worse is that
you think I'm incompetent.

320
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:06,238
For crying out loud, Burke.

321
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,797
You're willing to go into a hot situation
with me watching your back?

322
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:14,119
I have no choice, and I was thinking
of sending you in first, me watching you.

323
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:16,277
You wanna know the truth?

324
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:20,165
Come on, you really don't wanna know?

325
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:24,206
Man, it wasn't my fault.

326
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:29,919
I mean, I didn't choose, I just reacted.
It stinks, the whole damn thing stinks.

327
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:33,522
You wanna know what really happened?
Fine, I'll tell ya.

328
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:38,442
Woods was ghosting us.
He sold out, he was no good.

329
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:42,156
He was sending out a rogue transmission,
giving our position away.

330
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:49,039
Woods realised I was onto him, he turned
his weapon on me, and I just reacted.

331
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:55,487
- Why didn't you come forward with this?
- You remember how close we were.

332
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:59,446
The wives and the beers and the
barbecues. I couldn't do that to Cindy.

333
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:02,519
It comes out Woods was a traitor,
she doesn't see a pension.

334
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:04,484
A month away from his retirement?

335
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:09,402
He wasn't retiring. He was setting himself
up as a mercenary for that warlord.

336
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:14,720
He made his choice, he's gone.
That's all that matters.

337
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:47,678
That's not good.

338
00:30:50,007 --> 00:30:51,679
Disparen/

339
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:22,683
No! No!

340
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:24,644
You let them escape.

341
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:26,718
Vamos a matarlos.

342
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:54,043
There must be a console somewhere that
will let us access a log of recent activity.

343
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:56,277
Even if it doesn't contain Anubis's plans,

344
00:31:56,367 --> 00:32:00,360
we might be able to gather intel
on the movement of his fleet.

345
00:32:00,447 --> 00:32:06,204
Nothing but labs, corridors
and storage in this direction.

346
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:09,563
I think Anubis's quarters are this way.

347
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:43,082
Bill, you gotta keep movin'.

348
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:46,918
Mátenlos/

349
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,998
Mátenlos/ Síganme/

350
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:14,080
- I can't. I can't breathe.
- Yes, you can. Come on!

351
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:18,406
Stay down. I'll draw them off.

352
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:21,717
You are all my children,
Kull Warriors.

353
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:25,277
You are the instruments of my conquest.

354
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:29,565
Hail Anubis! Hail Anubis!

355
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:32,797
Hail Anubis!

356
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:45,882
Machete.

357
00:34:48,247 --> 00:34:50,681
I'm going to skin you alive.

358
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:06,686
How many more are there?

359
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:13,479
- Daniel!
- That's it. You got 'em all.

360
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:17,323
What are you doing here?

361
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:25,165
There must be thousands of them.

362
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:26,805
Fools!

363
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:42,922
- C4.
- Bra'tac, we need that ride, now!

364
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,601
I will be there momentarily.

365
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:08,121
- Will you be able to walk on this?
- Yeah.

366
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:17,036
- Telchak's device reanimates dead tissue.
- Yeah, whatever.

367
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:29,599
Hey, get down!

368
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:46,282
What's with the guy from Evil Dead?

369
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:48,961
- Um...
- Classified?

370
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:52,963
Yeah.

371
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:56,039
You guys are into some crazy crap, man!

372
00:36:59,327 --> 00:37:01,318
Got it!

373
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:18,966
Go!

374
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:22,483
- What was that?
- It can't be good. Just punch it.

375
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:30,478
- Someone has opened the rear hatch.
- We're mid-flight.

376
00:38:09,207 --> 00:38:11,323
Teal'c, are you hurt?

377
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:13,762
- Indeed.
- Where?

378
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:15,838
My pride.

379
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:20,435
An old man did what I could not.

380
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,684
Sam?

381
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:28,920
Sam.

382
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:34,039
No, don't move. Just lie still.

383
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:41,042
- What hurts?
- Everything.

384
00:38:41,127 --> 00:38:43,641
That's a good sign.

385
00:38:54,447 --> 00:38:59,237
Perimeter's clear. Just heard
from Air Rescue - they got the guide.

386
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:03,525
- Rogelio?
- He's gonna be OK. They'll be here soon.

387
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:06,325
Hey.

388
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:11,684
- Nice backup.
- Sure thing, buddy. Anytime, anywhere.

389
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:19,524
You know... I think I should recommend
that you be posted to a nicer place.

390
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:23,486
A temperate zone?
Not too hot, not too cold?

391
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:29,164
Fine-lookin' women that put out
like broken candy machines?

392
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:31,522
Whatever. I'll see what I can do.

393
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:33,598
Thanks, buddy.

394
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:38,356
Is that the thing that
made the guy do that thing?

395
00:39:38,447 --> 00:39:43,237
- Yeah, it's OK. It's off now.
- Good. That's good.

396
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:46,763
Yeah. At least, we think it's off.
It's not glowing any more, so...

397
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:51,477
The glowing thing gives it away, so if it's
not glowing any more, it shouldn't be on.

398
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:54,358
- Do you wanna hold it?
- No, no.

399
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:02,404
That's crazy!

400
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,642
So... Miss me?

401
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:18,555
Of course, sir.

402
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:22,478
It couldn't have been that bad.
You're all still alive.

403
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:25,081
- As are you and Daniel Jackson.
- Daniel?

404
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:28,523
- I'm fine. We got the device from Telchak.
- Good.

405
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:30,802
Hopefully we can
engineer a weapon from it.

406
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:35,039
You must, or we will be left helpless
to combat these new warriors.

407
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:39,439
We have some bad news, sir. Anubis has
an entire army of these super-soldiers.

408
00:40:39,527 --> 00:40:41,245
There are thousands of them.

409
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:44,524
The best we could do was delay
his ability to manufacture more.

410
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:48,520
We'll debrief fully in one hour.
Welcome home.

411
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:53,404
Hey.

412
00:40:55,847 --> 00:41:01,046
- So, nice command.
- We did manage to make it out alive, sir.

413
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:02,560
There's that.

414
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:07,160
Lunch?

415
00:41:58,607 --> 00:42:01,121
