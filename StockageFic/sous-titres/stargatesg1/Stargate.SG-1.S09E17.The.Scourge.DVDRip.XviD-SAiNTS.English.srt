1
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,496
<i>I'm just a "glass half full" kind of guy.</i>

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,548
We found a cure to the Prior's plague,
we got it after the planets needed it.

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:10,867
And it has been some time
since the last reported outbreak.

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,853
That's right, so I'm chalking
that one up to the "win" column.

5
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:14,531
Look, all I'm saying
is let's not get carried away.

6
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:16,199
Yes, we stopped them this time, but

7
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:17,382
you can be damn sure they're already

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,786
digging up some other means of spreading fear
and destruction through this galaxy.

9
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,688
Yeah, that's why we call them the bad guys.

10
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:24,950
And by the looks of things,
the next one's gonna be something big.

11
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,785
The Priors are already starting to step up
the rhetoric with all this talk of doomsday,

12
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:30,363
"when all shall witness the final battle
between the light and darkness."

13
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:33,543
That's what they said about Tyson-Holyfield.
There's always a rematch.

14
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,331
Alright, let's move out.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,640
Those ancient ruins
aren't going to explore themselves.

16
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,985
<i>Hold up, SG-1.</i>

17
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:43,903
Shut her down.

18
00:00:44,654 --> 00:00:46,740
Your mission has been scrubbed.

19
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:48,041
Why?

20
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,985
Because you're needed elsewhere.

21
00:00:58,594 --> 00:00:59,526
General, what's going on?

22
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:05,432
A team of representatives from the
International Oversight Advisory are
going on a tour of the Gamma site.

23
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:09,445
Pentagon wants SG-1 to accompany
them as their official escort.

24
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:11,264
<i>That is a most unusual request.</i>

25
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:13,733
It'll be IOA's first time offworld.

26
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:16,829
The President wants to make sure
it goes off without a hitch.

27
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:19,414
He figures who better to ensure that

28
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:20,884
than our top team?

29
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:22,342
Sir, I don't mean to gripe...

30
00:01:22,352 --> 00:01:23,937
Permission to gripe granted.

31
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:25,729
We're being put on babysitting duty?

32
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:28,325
<i>Don't underestimate
the importance of this mission.</i>

33
00:01:28,809 --> 00:01:30,435
This is the IOA.

34
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:33,495
These people carry a lot of influence
with the Stargate program...

35
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:35,439
how it's run, how it's funded.

36
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:36,700
You should feel honored.

37
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:41,929
Just don't keep them up past 10:00

38
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,402
and remember to read them a bedtime story
before tucking them in for the night.

39
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:58,408
Season 9 - Episode 17
The Scourge

40
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,187
It's...

41
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:03,063
It's much bigger than I imagined.

42
00:03:03,073 --> 00:03:04,431
We get that a lot.

43
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:09,424
Mr. Chapman,

44
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:10,962
Mr. Lapierre,

45
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,021
Miss Shen,

46
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,417
I'd like you to meet our escort
to the Gamma site...

47
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:15,456
SG-1.

48
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:17,133
Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell.

49
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:20,608
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter.</i>

50
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,446
<i>Teal'c.</i>

51
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:24,524
And Dr. Daniel Jackson.

52
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:28,038
<i>PhD in archaeology, anthropology, and philology.</i>

53
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:31,354
The man who solved the riddle of the Stargate.

54
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:33,391
Shen Xiaoyi.

55
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,184
Graduate of Beijing Foreign Studies University and
the London School of Economics and Political Science,

56
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:42,019
former attaché to the Chinese
mission in the United States.

57
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:44,595
<i>Your Chinese is supposed to be quite good.</i>

58
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:46,472
<i>Not as good as your English.</i>

59
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:48,610
<i>Of course. What about him?</i>

60
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:51,925
<i>We are still teaching him.</i>

61
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:55,120
<i>Yeah, that's very funny.</i>

62
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,018
<i>Go to hell.</i>

63
00:03:58,555 --> 00:03:59,954
<i>Chevron Seven locked.</i>

64
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:12,156
The Gamma site is 24,000 light years from here,

65
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:16,671
but once we step through the event horizon,
it will take us less than one second to get there.

66
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,168
After you.

67
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:32,987
Just to clarify.

68
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:35,903
I'm going to be disassembled at the molecular level,

69
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:38,140
then reassembled on the other side?

70
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,148
That's right.

71
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:42,034
And the chances of my being reassembled incorrectly...

72
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:43,673
Highly unlikely.

73
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:50,922
But not impossible?

74
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:55,196
That's a word I stopped using nine years ago
when I joined the Stargate program.

75
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:13,690
This planet was chosen for several reasons,
including its unique radioactive ionosphere,

76
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:16,796
which makes it difficult to lock
onto surface targets from orbit.

77
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:18,883
So no one can steal the Stargate.

78
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:20,361
You can't be too careful these days.

79
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,355
We have over 30 scientists engaged in
ongoing projects here at any given time.

80
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:26,792
This is Dr. Myers, our lead entomologist.

81
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:30,267
Doctor, would you mind telling us
a little about your research?

82
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:31,346
Yes.

83
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,220
I'm studying an asexual, fast-reproducing insect

84
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,215
<i>responsible for the devastation
of numerous offworld crops.</i>

85
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:40,453
A space bug?

86
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:42,850
Right. Space bugs.

87
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:48,003
However, for the purposes of
my research, I refer to them as R75.

88
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,840
<i>Now, the fact that these</i>

89
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,396
<i>insects have only manifested themselves on planets</i>

90
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:56,531
recently visited by Priors
makes their analysis a top priority.

91
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,526
Is there anything to indicate that
this is more than mere coincidence?

92
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,785
No, not yet.

93
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:05,199
Now, our initial research proved
incredibly challenging due to the short

94
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:07,755
lifespans of the R75 specimens,

95
00:06:08,294 --> 00:06:14,006
until we succeeded in dramatically increasing
their life cycles by depriving them of sustenance.

96
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,762
They feed, and they die, within a matter of hours.

97
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:20,317
They starve, and they live.
So far, it's been three days and counting.

98
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:22,155
Would you stop that, please?

99
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:25,070
A bit lethargic, aren't they?

100
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:34,977
They're nocturnal.

101
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,255
No.

102
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:39,849
They function during the daylight.
They just prefer the darkness.

103
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:44,604
They spend most of their time burrowing underground,
consuming crops from the roots up.

104
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:50,715
Now, R75 also displays a
rather interesting defense mechanism,
which we're still in the process of studying.

105
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:51,953
Observe.

106
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,243
Echolocation.

107
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:01,020
Exactly.

108
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,494
I theorize they use it to detect their
enemies, such as birds for instance...

109
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:06,732
<i>Alright.</i>

110
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,479
Dr. Myers.

111
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:10,806
- Let's move on.
- Well, I'm not done yet.

112
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:12,723
<i>We get the idea. Thanks.</i>

113
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:13,763
Our next stop

114
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:16,558
is Dr. Sharma, our lead botanist.

115
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:22,151
Seriously, what are we doing here?

116
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:24,987
Honest answer? PR for the Stargate program.

117
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:29,420
I'm telling you, today it's escorting
foreign delegates on offworld tours,
tomorrow it's comic book conventions

118
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,295
- and supermarket openings.
- I know how you feel,
but if we can somehow reassure the IOA

119
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:37,249
- of the job Stargate command is doing...
- Daniel Jackson, the problem is not the IOA.

120
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,566
Okay, if we can somehow
reassure the Chinese government...

121
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:41,763
Oh, I think they're looking
for more than reassurances.

122
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:42,962
Well, can you blame them? I mean

123
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:47,076
- three years ago, we promised to
share all offworld technologies...
- Of a non-military nature.

124
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:48,633
That wasn't in the original wording of the agreement.

125
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:50,191
Look, I don't want to argue about this.

126
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:53,427
- I'm right. We'll leave it at that.
- Compelling argument. Teal'c, what do you think?

127
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:56,063
I think I should have remained with the tour.

128
00:07:56,763 --> 00:07:58,280
Science fair's over.

129
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,374
Looks like Dr. Toshiaki's magnetic resonance
field study was the crowd favorite.

130
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:04,172
How wonderful for him.

131
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:07,168
What's for lunch?

132
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,103
Meatloaf, monday.

133
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:12,360
Do you mind if I go grab something?

134
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,599
Take your time.

135
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:15,636
I'm gonna run some tests.

136
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:32,831
Come and get it.

137
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:40,481
<i>Not hungry?</i>

138
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:11,457
You can't possibly have a taste for...

139
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:18,648
For meatloaf?

140
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:38,420
Don't feel like joining us at the other table?

141
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,376
- I'm just in the middle of...
- Okay, don't mind if I do.

142
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:49,685
Sorry, you were just in the middle of something.

143
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:52,281
Taking notes on my visit here...

144
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,957
while the details are still fresh on my mind.

145
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:58,232
This tour has provided me some wonderful insight into

146
00:09:58,272 --> 00:10:00,469
tedious offworld research and

147
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:03,425
the lunch menu here on your Gamma site.

148
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:06,420
- Well, believe it or not, the...
- Is this where you tell me,

149
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:11,693
the SGC has no choice but to maintain
its air of secrecy surrounding its operations?

150
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:15,848
That, as an outsider, I could never
understand nor appreciate the work you all do,

151
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:18,284
saving our planet time and again?

152
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:21,919
Well, actually, I was going to say,
believe it or not, the meatloaf's pretty good.

153
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:28,469
In the three years since our nations
signed the Gate alliance treaty,

154
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,904
your government has made great
strides in the field of military technology,

155
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:35,899
but left us out in the cold.

156
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:38,416
Well, I hate to say it, but so long as the

157
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:42,131
U.S. military is running the show,
that's just the way it's gonna be.

158
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,248
Perhaps it's time that changed.

159
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:49,121
There's no way the american military will ever
give up control of the Stargate program.

160
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,598
Maybe it won't have a choice in the matter.

161
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,229
- So what did the tests say?
- I don't know.

162
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,626
I was called in to help Santiago
with his mealworm situation.

163
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,182
You know, Pullman, if I wasn't
such a patient man, I swear...

164
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:03,581
Oh, my God.

165
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:34,977
All clear.

166
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:45,323
Damn thing bit me.

167
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:03,537
<i>I must say, Colonel, the</i>

168
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:06,373
scope of the facility has surpassed my expectations.

169
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:08,410
Yes, quite remarkable.

170
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,687
For my part, I'm somewhat disappointed.

171
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:13,243
I was hoping the tour would be a little more thorough.

172
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:16,079
The Gamma site is a U.S. Military facility, Miss Shen.

173
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:19,195
Access to some of the more
sensitive areas is restricted.

174
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:22,909
Dr. Myers...

175
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:24,308
are you okay?

176
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:40,205
R75 breached containment,
and we had to exercise a disposal protocol.

177
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:43,521
Dr. Myers was bitten, but he went
to the infirmary to get checked out and

178
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:45,079
they didn't find anything wrong with him.

179
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:47,196
How the hell did the bugs breach containment?

180
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:48,793
Well, Dr. Myers thinks he may have

181
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:52,508
triggered some sort of massive reproduction
cycle after feeding them a piece of meatloaf.

182
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:53,387
Wait a minute.

183
00:12:53,946 --> 00:12:55,983
R75 is omnivorous?

184
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,701
Carnivorous, actually.

185
00:12:57,741 --> 00:13:00,258
They seem to have lost their taste for plants.

186
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:02,933
The representatives are getting a little anxious.

187
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:07,008
I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist that we
be permitted to return to Earth as scheduled.

188
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:09,085
I'm sorry, Mr. Woolsey.
No one's going anywhere.

189
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:13,679
This base is under lockdown until we can
establish the source of Dr. Myers' condition.

190
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:17,953
Where's he going?

191
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:20,110
Back to Earth, where he'll be quarantined.

192
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:21,547
He gets to go back?

193
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:23,465
We don't have the medical facilities for this.

194
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:24,983
If we don't send him back, he could die.

195
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:27,540
<i>I am sorry this is totally unacceptable.</i>

196
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:32,412
The Pentagon will be hearing from
the IOA about this, and you can be certain
your name will be mentioned, Colonel.

197
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:44,895
Carnivorous.

198
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:46,273
Move, now!

199
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,869
This is outrageous.

200
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,405
Mr. Woolsey assured me that
we would be leaving on schedule.

201
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:59,474
- Back to the elevator, we're going upstairs.
- What's going on?

202
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:01,352
We have a bit of a bug problem.

203
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:02,869
You don't want to be last.

204
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:05,147
I'll explain everything.

205
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:08,991
<i>I don't understand.</i>

206
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,239
What happened to him?

207
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:14,573
Well, I can't say for sure, but my guess is
that the bug must have laid its eggs in him.

208
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:16,850
They incubated, and when they hatched...

209
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:20,085
Well, we know they eat meat.

210
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:21,723
I'm sorry I asked.

211
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:26,716
Well, I think we're past the point of coincidence.
There's no question these bugs are
the Priors' follow up to the virus.

212
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:31,030
And it appears they were designed to circumvent
any attempt to forestall their destructive nature.

213
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,185
Deny them crops, and their physiology
adapts to an alternate food source.

214
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:35,424
Yeah, us.

215
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:36,901
Colonel Pearson?

216
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,537
Colonel, do you read?

217
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:44,212
It's alright. I imagine it's just a little

218
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:46,688
power fluctuation. Nothing to worry about.

219
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:48,585
Oh, damn it.

220
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:50,164
That's enough of this.

221
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:53,719
Colonel, what's the situation?

222
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:56,634
Not good. There were thousands
of those things in the pod.

223
00:14:56,754 --> 00:14:58,472
They killed one of my men before we retreated.

224
00:14:58,512 --> 00:14:59,750
We lost the Gate room?

225
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:02,347
- We need to take it back.
- Sounds like a plan.

226
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,864
Mr. Woolsey...

227
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,459
my men will escort you
and your people to the surface,

228
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:09,096
get you to a safe location,

229
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:12,852
get you as far away from here as
possible until this situation is contained.

230
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:14,130
I don't think so.

231
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:16,007
Excuse me?

232
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:18,244
<i>SG-1 will escort us out.</i>

233
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,481
They're here to ensure
the safety of this delegation.

234
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:23,876
You understand that no one gets off
this planet until the Gate is retaken.

235
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:28,070
And I'm sure colonel Pearson and his people will do
everything in their power to make sure that happens.

236
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:31,066
<i>In the meantime, you will take us to the surface.</i>

237
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:34,541
You will protect us, as per
your orders from the pentagon.

238
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,780
Alright.

239
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:37,896
Get them out of here.

240
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:01,703
<i>Excuse me.</i>

241
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,077
Surely we could have taken a jeep.

242
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:08,075
We're headed to an unmanned research station.

243
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:11,030
It's located approximately 10 clicks
from here through dense forest.

244
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,586
Then I have to ask if this is really necessary.

245
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:16,992
I mean, couldn't we just wait here until
colonel Pearson gives us the all clear?

246
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:20,636
Our orders were to take you to the
research station. That's where we're going.

247
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:28,206
Teal'c?

248
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:35,635
What is that?

249
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,353
It's the bugs.

250
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:40,329
What's happening?

251
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:56,387
We have to move!

252
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:57,346
Now!

253
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,615
<i>Hold up!</i>

254
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,612
Hold up.

255
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:11,685
I think we can assume
the bugs got off the base.

256
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:14,481
They must be using their echolocation
as a mean to hunt their prey.

257
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:16,039
Us.
She means us.

258
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,077
Where can we go?

259
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:18,595
They move underground.

260
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:22,190
We need rocky terrain, somewhere
difficult for them to move.

261
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,828
We can try the caves.

262
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:24,667
This way.

263
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:36,491
Get them inside.

264
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:46,756
They're coming.

265
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:49,233
They're highly sensitive to sound.

266
00:17:49,272 --> 00:17:52,428
The concussive force of our weapons
should be enough to drive them back.

267
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:53,706
Are you serious?

268
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,262
Fine. Where do we shoot?

269
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,140
Just fire at the ground!

270
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,257
Very nice.

271
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:17,933
Alright, folks, listen up.

272
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:21,168
We're surrounded by rock here, so
there's no way the bugs are digging in.

273
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,163
We've got the entrance covered.
Everything's gonna be fine.

274
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:30,974
Until we run out of bullets.

275
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,270
Bullets.

276
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,108
Yeah.

277
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:41,500
What do you have for me, Chief?

278
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:47,051
Sir, we were unable to acquire a video feed from the
surveillance cameras in the Gamma site Gate room, but

279
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:50,606
I've managed to pick up motion sensor telemetry.

280
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:00,633
What have you found out?

281
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:03,269
I learned that bugs still creep me out.

282
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:08,581
It all started when I was a kid, and my parents took
me out on this picnic, and this bug crawled up on me...

283
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:10,778
maybe you'd prefer
to hear this story another time.

284
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,498
I doubt it.

285
00:19:11,638 --> 00:19:12,716
Oh, well...

286
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:19,806
After careful analysis of the telemetry
we got back from the Gamma site Gate room,
I have determined that this

287
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:21,962
is our culprit, R75.

288
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:23,001
<i>The Prior bugs.</i>

289
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:25,268
Yeah, well, that connection
is yet to be determined, but

290
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:29,792
you know, we were originally investigating this
pesky little crop-killer as a possible weapon against

291
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:33,867
the addictive kassa harvests being produced
and distributed by the Lucian Alliance, and

292
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:38,020
the various specimens we got from different
offworld locations were incredibly voracious,

293
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,366
so voracious that they would
literally eat themselves to death, but

294
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:42,734
when deprived of nourishment,

295
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:47,088
- these insects underwent some sort of...
- Fascinating. How do we kill them?

296
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:52,241
Well, I mean, given the updated data,
I should be able to whip something up.

297
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,077
Very well. As per protocol CR91,

298
00:19:55,117 --> 00:19:59,191
we'll be sending the Odyssey to deliver
the payload from planetary orbit.

299
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:00,230
CR91?

300
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:01,428
Sir?

301
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:04,663
The toxin will be lethal to humans as well.

302
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,822
I mean...

303
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:09,906
we'll have to be sure that the Gamma
site is evacuated before we deploy it.

304
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,792
That's assuming there's anyone left to evacuate.

305
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,398
On the bright side,

306
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:41,831
I was worried that my report
would make for a boring read.

307
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:43,590
So, I'm

308
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:47,484
guessing we're gonna
lose points for this little incident.

309
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:52,537
To be honest with you,
my report is a mere formality.

310
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:58,388
Ultimately, it'll have no bearing on my government's
plan of action in regard to the Stargate program.

311
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:02,782
What exactly
should we be expecting down the line?

312
00:21:03,022 --> 00:21:04,780
- Dr. Jackson...
- Daniel.

313
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:07,975
Daniel...

314
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:12,289
maybe now is not the right time
to be having this conversation.

315
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:14,286
When would be a good time?

316
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:16,923
Perhaps when we're

317
00:21:17,162 --> 00:21:18,761
all back on Earth

318
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,274
and not having to worry about
being eaten alive by alien insects.

319
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:27,229
Look, I understand your government
has issues with Stargate command,

320
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:30,344
but you cannot deny the accomplishments, nor the

321
00:21:30,384 --> 00:21:32,661
- significant...
- That has nothing to do with it.

322
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,936
Daniel, let me ask you something.

323
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:37,374
If,

324
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:40,170
nine years ago,
it had been my country, not the

325
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,688
United States military,

326
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:45,523
that had given you the
opportunity to travel to the stars,

327
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,239
would it have made a difference to you?

328
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:51,355
<i>- Would you have turned us down?
- No, of course not.</i>

329
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:55,069
So long as the priority remained offworld
exploration that could benefit Earth,

330
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:57,466
I would have gladly accepted the offer.

331
00:21:57,626 --> 00:22:00,142
I may hold you to that someday.

332
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:12,285
At ease.

333
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:18,396
Colonel Pearson, come in.

334
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:22,032
Pearson, come in.

335
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,426
Gamma site, do you read?

336
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,937
- Damn it.
- If they haven't answered by now...

337
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:33,256
Yeah, I know.

338
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:36,731
You okay?

339
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,648
Yes, Sir, I'm fine.

340
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:41,165
I'm just a little bit rattled, is all.

341
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:10,165
We have heard nothing from
the Gamma site since we left.

342
00:23:10,844 --> 00:23:13,440
I fear we must assume
the worst and plan accordingly.

343
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,267
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

344
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:17,074
<i>We cannot remain here indefinitely.</i>

345
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:19,072
<i>Eventually, this position will be overrun.</i>

346
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:21,069
Yeah, we need to get as far away as possible.

347
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:25,263
Well, given the rate these bugs are multiplying,
it's doubtful we could outpace them on foot.

348
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:28,159
We must return for the F-302s.

349
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,255
<i>He's gone!</i>

350
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,627
<i>- Airman Walker's missing.
- What do you mean, missing?</i>

351
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,864
I just went to the front to check on him.
He's not there anymore.

352
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:41,540
Perhaps he's just stepped out to relieve himself.

353
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:43,737
We'll be back.

354
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:55,920
Walker.

355
00:24:36,663 --> 00:24:38,261
Think I got something.

356
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:39,859
Coming to you.

357
00:24:50,644 --> 00:24:52,042
We're too late.

358
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:00,430
Walker!

359
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:02,827
Hey!

360
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:04,424
Just take it easy.

361
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:13,912
Wait.

362
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:15,309
Don't move.

363
00:25:25,415 --> 00:25:26,494
Jackson...

364
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:31,087
why don't you go back to the cave,
tell Carter that Teal'c and I are going for the 302s.

365
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:32,965
Where are you planning on landing them?

366
00:25:33,004 --> 00:25:35,081
We'll do an aerial
surveillance we'll find some place

367
00:25:35,122 --> 00:25:38,476
and then we'll come back, we'll get everybody,
and ferry them to a safe location.

368
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:40,474
Okay, where would that be?

369
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,671
Far away from here.

370
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,866
Right, okay, well.

371
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:47,864
Good luck.

372
00:25:58,049 --> 00:25:59,847
Let me ask you a question.

373
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:02,244
In all the years you were fighting the Goa'uld,

374
00:26:02,284 --> 00:26:06,518
did you ever just step back and say,
"sooner or later, our luck's going to run out.
We're going to get our asses kicked?"

375
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:07,516
Never.

376
00:26:07,556 --> 00:26:08,835
Never, not once?

377
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:14,027
Even though you were massively outnumbered, fighting
an opponent with superior technology and firepower?

378
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:18,421
They may have had the superior forces and resources,
but we possessed something far greater.

379
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,419
Which was?

380
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,417
A just cause.

381
00:26:21,557 --> 00:26:24,193
I had no doubt the Goa'uld would be defeated.

382
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:25,820
Perhaps not in my lifetime,

383
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,508
but I knew eventually they would fall,

384
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:30,803
and I have no doubt the same fate awaits the Ori.

385
00:26:30,843 --> 00:26:32,402
See, that's what I like about you.

386
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:33,799
You're always positive.

387
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,715
Hell, you're probably
already past this bug situation,

388
00:26:36,755 --> 00:26:39,591
thinking about what movie
you want to watch tomorrow night.

389
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,589
I was considering "Old school".

390
00:26:42,787 --> 00:26:44,584
My boy blue.

391
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,378
What was that?

392
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:50,776
Wait here.

393
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:58,266
Teal'c, Cameron, what's your status?

394
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:04,257
We're okay, Carter.

395
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:05,455
<i>What happened?</i>

396
00:27:06,653 --> 00:27:09,249
Looks like the base self-destruct triggered.

397
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:13,244
The Gamma site's gone.

398
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,529
<i>How could the self-destruct have been triggered?</i>

399
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:22,826
The bugs must have gotten into the system.

400
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:24,343
What difference does it make now?

401
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:27,619
<i>- The base has been destroyed!
- Please, calm down.</i>

402
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:29,576
<i>Don't tell me to calm down!</i>

403
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:33,611
<i>- If we'd been allowed to leave on schedule...
- Please, keep your voice down.</i>

404
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,607
I am sick of being told what to do.

405
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,504
Why should I listen to you?

406
00:27:38,544 --> 00:27:40,302
Why should any of us listen to you?

407
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:43,896
Because you are alerting
the bugs to our presence.

408
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,669
Colonel,

409
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:50,287
a word.

410
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,556
I understand you're doing everything
in your power to help us, and I appreciate that,

411
00:27:58,696 --> 00:28:02,371
but I think you're being a bit insensitive
to our needs right now.

412
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,569
All I'm asking

413
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:05,366
is for a little reassurance,

414
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:07,763
a few words to let them know that
everything is gonna be okay.

415
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:10,958
I don't think it's too much to ask,
all things considered.

416
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,555
Mr. Woolsey,

417
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:15,512
if I could go back in time,

418
00:28:15,552 --> 00:28:19,147
which, admittedly,
is an opportunity I am occasionally presented with,

419
00:28:19,187 --> 00:28:22,343
I would have made sure that
we left the base as scheduled,

420
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:25,138
but the reality is, for the time being,
we are stuck here,

421
00:28:25,178 --> 00:28:29,931
trapped in this cave, surrounded by predatory insects,
with no way of getting to the Stargate.

422
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:31,630
Now, I'm sorry,

423
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:35,424
but I'm gonna have a hard time
mustering up a convincing pep talk,

424
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,422
all things considered.

425
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:39,019
I see.

426
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:46,010
In that case, I'd just like to point out that this
routine offworld excursion has turned into a disaster,

427
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,125
and the ramifications for Stargate
command will be enormous.

428
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:51,482
Saving our lives would go a long way

429
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,998
toward minimizing the damage.

430
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:56,395
I'll keep that in mind.

431
00:29:01,188 --> 00:29:01,987
Don't worry.

432
00:29:02,027 --> 00:29:04,184
She said everything is going to be okay.

433
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:08,977
I'm telling you, it's time you got your own place.

434
00:29:09,577 --> 00:29:12,572
I endeavored to establish a life offbase last year.

435
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:15,927
I even went so far as to acquire my own apartment.

436
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:18,484
Unfortunately, it did not work out.

437
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,361
Yeah, I know you got framed for murder,

438
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:23,477
but you can't let one bad experience put you off.

439
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:25,274
Hell, the first time I moved out,

440
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:28,750
I lived next door to a guy who practiced
his drum solos all night long.

441
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:30,947
When we get back,

442
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:33,942
- I'm going to help you find your own place.
- No, that will be unnecessary.

443
00:29:33,983 --> 00:29:35,141
Dude, what are friends for?

444
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:38,136
For listening when they are told,
that will be unnecessary.

445
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,387
What the hell is taking them?

446
00:30:22,295 --> 00:30:23,573
Where are you guys?

447
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:25,970
Requesting radio silence.

448
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:46,940
I think we're good to go.

449
00:30:48,158 --> 00:30:52,432
Perhaps we should keep any
unnecessary conversation to a minimum.

450
00:30:52,832 --> 00:30:54,031
Okay.

451
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:08,370
Sir?

452
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:11,206
Just received a subspace
transmission from the Odyssey.

453
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,004
Its E.T.A. is five hours...

454
00:31:13,883 --> 00:31:16,998
and the Pentagon's on line two.

455
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:19,394
Thank you, Chief.

456
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,184
Landry here.

457
00:31:35,172 --> 00:31:38,368
<i>- Alright, scratch plan B.
- What do we do now?</i>

458
00:31:38,727 --> 00:31:41,564
If the Gate is buried,
they won't be able to send a rescue team.

459
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:42,922
Which means they'll send the Odyssey.

460
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:46,117
In fact, it's probably already on its way here,
so all you've got to do is sit back,

461
00:31:46,157 --> 00:31:47,276
relax.

462
00:31:47,316 --> 00:31:48,634
Everything's going to be fine.

463
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:50,591
Theoretically.

464
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:54,106
Theoretically?

465
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:59,059
Theoretically, yes, the Odyssey could
come and beam us off the planet's surface.

466
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,058
But?

467
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:05,610
Look, I'm sorry, but there's no
point in sugar-coating this.

468
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:11,082
If Stargate command is operating under
the assumption that the base has been lost,
they'll enact protocol CR91.

469
00:32:11,323 --> 00:32:12,311
What's that?

470
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:14,558
Once in orbit, the Odyssey will launch a payload,

471
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:17,913
probably a neurotoxin, that will wipe out R75.

472
00:32:17,953 --> 00:32:21,268
That will allow Stargate command to mount
a salvage operation of the Gamma site.

473
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:23,245
But they'll beam us out of here first.

474
00:32:23,286 --> 00:32:26,322
Our transmitters won't work because
of the interference in the atmosphere.

475
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,999
What about our life signs?

476
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,471
<i>Because the bugs are multiplying at
an alarming rate, and because of the
fact that we are completely surrounded,</i>

477
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:37,336
the Odyssey won't be able to pick up our
individual readings inside a sea of life signs.

478
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:38,424
Oh, my God.

479
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:41,140
What you're saying is that
they're coming out all this way,

480
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,336
but instead of rescuing us,
they're going to kill us with poison gas?

481
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:46,972
Because they have no way of
knowing that we're still here.

482
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,169
Then we're going to die on this planet,

483
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:50,967
25,000 light years from Earth.

484
00:32:51,006 --> 00:32:51,805
Hey, relax.

485
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:55,001
For starters, it's only 24,000 light years.

486
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:58,037
What's your E.T.A. for Odyssey?

487
00:32:58,396 --> 00:33:01,233
Well, I have no way of knowing
exactly when it was sent,

488
00:33:01,592 --> 00:33:04,788
<i>but given the approximate time that Stargate
command lost contact with the Gamma site,</i>

489
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:07,024
<i>and allowing for the production of the toxin</i>

490
00:33:07,224 --> 00:33:09,141
I'd say inside of a few hours.

491
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:14,174
We must find a way to contact the Odyssey
to let their crew know that we are alive.

492
00:33:14,214 --> 00:33:17,250
Except our only way of communicating with
that ship went up with the Gamma base.

493
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:18,209
Maybe not.

494
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:19,567
The research station.

495
00:33:19,686 --> 00:33:22,842
It must have some sort of
communication array that allows it
to transmit data back to the Gamma site.

496
00:33:22,882 --> 00:33:25,438
But is it capable
of reaching a ship in planetary orbit?

497
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:27,276
It could, if I had some time to work on it.

498
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:29,792
Then all we have
to do is get to the research station.

499
00:33:29,832 --> 00:33:30,751
<i>Right,</i>

500
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:33,028
and the only thing between us and it...

501
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:35,943
is five miles of forest
and a whole lot of bugs.

502
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,997
Piece of cake.

503
00:33:57,134 --> 00:33:58,173
Keep moving.

504
00:33:58,372 --> 00:33:59,570
I cannot.

505
00:34:02,047 --> 00:34:03,285
We're almost there.

506
00:34:03,325 --> 00:34:05,562
That is what
you said almost half an hour ago.

507
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:13,032
The transmission we'll be sending will
enable the Odyssey to triangulate our
position and pick up our individual life signs,

508
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:15,668
but we all have to be within the target area.

509
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:17,346
We've been walking for hours.

510
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:19,902
We don't have time to sit around.

511
00:34:19,942 --> 00:34:22,498
We are in violent agreement.

512
00:34:22,578 --> 00:34:23,737
You know what?

513
00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:24,896
Sit here.

514
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:26,692
You cover our 6,

515
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:28,090
but stay alert.

516
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:31,566
You'll hear the bugs coming.
The tree ferrets give no warning.

517
00:34:32,245 --> 00:34:33,363
Tree ferrets?

518
00:34:34,242 --> 00:34:35,640
Yeah, nasty buggers.

519
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,315
Swoop down and separate a man's
head from his torso before he can blink.

520
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:46,505
You... you're lying.

521
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:53,775
Wait!

522
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,328
We're almost there.

523
00:34:58,368 --> 00:34:59,766
Stop saying that.

524
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:10,192
There it is.

525
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,868
Let's pick up the pace.

526
00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:32,640
<i>Frack!</i>

527
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,112
<i>Let's go!</i>

528
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:08,710
Look out, look out!

529
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:17,976
Can you do it?

530
00:36:21,572 --> 00:36:24,338
Colonel, is it working?

531
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,426
It's too late.

532
00:36:25,906 --> 00:36:27,064
We're too late.

533
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:28,302
They're right outside.

534
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:29,660
Is it going to work?

535
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:31,178
Do you think you can make it...

536
00:36:31,218 --> 00:36:32,816
Shut up, shut up!

537
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:34,713
Let her do her work!

538
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:38,089
Thank you, Mr. Woolsey.

539
00:36:39,188 --> 00:36:40,546
You're welcome.

540
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:53,487
How's it going?

541
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:57,801
I need to significantly boost the power in order
to penetrate the radioactivity in the ionosphere.

542
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,519
Alright, boost it already.

543
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,957
Yeah, I think I'm good.

544
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:21,019
The vibrations being generated by
the communications array must
be attracting the bugs.

545
00:37:21,029 --> 00:37:22,147
<i>Think you can hold them off?</i>

546
00:37:22,187 --> 00:37:25,103
Is this a bad time
to tell you we're almost out of ammo?

547
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,408
It's time to improvise.

548
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:57,817
Okay, go.

549
00:37:58,856 --> 00:38:00,943
How long before they receive the transmission?

550
00:38:00,953 --> 00:38:03,150
They should pick it up
as soon as they enter orbit,

551
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:06,005
but like I said, we have no way of
knowing when that's gonna be.

552
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:07,963
How long can they hold off the bugs?

553
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:22,782
They are approaching from the right.

554
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,938
Well, the motion sensors work.

555
00:38:30,551 --> 00:38:32,110
That pushed them back a little.

556
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:35,624
Over here!

557
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:04,623
That's the last charge.

558
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:39,355
<i>Miss Shen suffered a broken ankle</i>

559
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:41,512
and has taken an indefinite leave.

560
00:39:41,991 --> 00:39:47,504
Mr. Lapierre and Mr. Chapman, meanwhile, have
gone back to work, none the worse for wear.

561
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:50,619
What kind of fallout should we
be expecting from all of this?

562
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:52,377
Surprisingly minimal.

563
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:54,693
You may face an official reprimand, but

564
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:58,928
the IOA recognizes the fact that these
were circumstances beyond your control.

565
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:03,521
It may seem like they do an inordinate
amount of complaining, but off the record,

566
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:07,815
the IOA has nothing but praise
for the job you're doing here.

567
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:10,731
Just don't let it go to your heads.

568
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:15,644
Well, I'm heading back to Washington.

569
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:17,922
Thank you again for the offworld tour.

570
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:19,280
It was...

571
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,396
an eye-opening experience.

572
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:31,222
While you were gone,
we received reports that two more planets

573
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,220
have been hit by these bugs.

574
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:38,891
R&D are working on solutions that target these insects
without harming other plant and animal life.

575
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,808
I thought I'd lost you there.

576
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:45,443
Nice to have you back.

577
00:40:51,714 --> 00:40:54,191
So, we still doing movie night?

578
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,309
Yeah, why not.

579
00:40:55,348 --> 00:40:57,186
Good. Already picked something out...

580
00:40:57,226 --> 00:40:58,344
Old school?

581
00:40:58,384 --> 00:40:59,582
Starship Troopers.

582
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:03,098
- Is it humorous?
- Is it ever.
