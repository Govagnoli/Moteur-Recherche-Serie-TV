1
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:12,514
It's a Daedalus. It has a few
advantages over the Prometheus.

2
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:17,315
Advanced alien technology was integrated
into the original design, not tacked on.

3
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:20,636
- When will it be ready?
- They're testing the Asgard hyperdrive.

4
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:25,355
- When it checks out, she'll be good to go.
- Hopefully we all get to go this time.

5
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:28,323
Last time, they worried about
spreading our resources.

6
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:30,873
Now Anubis is gone,
the replicators are gone.

7
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:35,197
There's a few System Lords, but without
the Jaffa armies, they've lost their power.

8
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,674
Indeed.

9
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:41,438
Carter. Yeah, hold on.

10
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:43,595
It's for you.

11
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:45,880
Hello. Yeah, hi.

12
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:50,881
What?

13
00:00:50,965 --> 00:00:53,957
No, I was just talking to her last week.

14
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:58,479
Yeah, I'll be there. Thank you.

15
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:03,676
What is it?

16
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:06,962
Catherine Langford died last night.

17
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:21,153
Catherine Langford was more
than just kind and generous.

18
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:23,236
She had a gift...

19
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:28,482
of an endless, open-minded,
childlike curiosity.

20
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:33,002
She saw the world, not for what it was,
but for what it could be.

21
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:37,158
And she saw potential in people
that others failed to recognise.

22
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:42,597
Like her father before her,
her contributions to science

23
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:45,483
have changed the world
more than most people know.

24
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:50,116
I, for one, have no idea where
I would be today if I'd never met her.

25
00:02:50,205 --> 00:02:55,484
She changed my life in more ways
than I ever could have imagined.

26
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:13,681
Dr Jackson?

27
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:15,164
- Hi.
- Hi.

28
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:19,397
- I'm Sabrina Gosling, Catherine's niece.
- Oh, yes, of course.

29
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:22,522
I just wanted to thank you for coming.
And for speaking.

30
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:24,994
I know she would have
really appreciated it.

31
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:27,155
No, it was an honour.

32
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:32,676
You know, my aunt
used to talk about you all the time.

33
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:35,996
It's funny, I always used to picture
some Indiana Jones type,

34
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:39,919
with a bullwhip and a pistol, chasing
bad guys through some ancient temple.

35
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:42,963
Well, I generally
leave the whip at home, so...

36
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:45,320
Right. Me too.

37
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:51,642
She wanted you to have this.

38
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:57,278
No. You're family. You should keep that.

39
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:59,879
She thought of you like a son.

40
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:10,398
Thank you.

41
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:13,841
There are a few other odds and ends
she wanted me to give you,

42
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:17,713
but I wasn't able to bring them today. Is
there an address where I can send them?

43
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:21,275
- Yeah, of course.
- Great.

44
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:31,159
- Jack.
- Daniel.

45
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:34,874
- What's goin' on?
- Have you been shopping on line lately?

46
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:38,037
- What you talking about?
- You've got a little delivery.

47
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,161
It's from Catherine's estate.

48
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:43,920
Yeah, it looks like
she sent the whole thing.

49
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:48,643
Holy... buckets.

50
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:53,238
Looks like her entire collection.

51
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:57,280
I prefer stamps.

52
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:04,520
Now, in addition,
we discovered several grains of troilite.

53
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:09,633
And a mesostasis phase
which contained micrometer crystals.

54
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:10,919
Hmm!

55
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:15,556
It's undergoing testing, but we hope to
have the results on your desk tomorrow.

56
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:18,159
- Don't you keep me waiting!
- No, sir.

57
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:21,476
Here's where things get interesting,
cos you will notice...

58
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:25,035
Jack! We need to talk.
Sorry for interrupting.

59
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,717
No, it's OK.

60
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:31,083
If it's important,
you must interrupt. You must.

61
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,237
- I think we may have found a ZPM.
- Yes!

62
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:38,757
Great stuff with the rocks. Go.

63
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:44,234
Among the items Catherine left me,
this one caught my attention.

64
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:49,399
It's an original 1889 edition of The Eye of
the Sun, the only one in known existence.

65
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:54,764
It details customs and rituals observed by
Ancient worshippers of the sun god, Ra.

66
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:59,475
While I was flipping through the pages,
I noticed this.

67
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:04,644
- It appears to be a Zero Point Module.
- Worshippers call it the "heart of light".

68
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:08,513
This is a reproduction of a wall painting
discovered by Germans in 1885.

69
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:11,597
- It was later destroyed in a fire.
- The ZPM was never found?

70
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:14,245
No.

71
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:21,483
We did a satellite sweep of the Gîza
plateau, searching for an energy signature

72
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:24,523
like the one given off
by the ZPM we found near Teonas.

73
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:28,120
Even if it's buried under dirt and rock,
we should have detected it.

74
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:32,835
We found nothing. I'm sorry, Daniel, but
if it's there, it's probably been depleted.

75
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,520
I don't think so. The text says
it was a religious artefact, an icon.

76
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:41,360
- It was never used as a power source.
- It's possible Ra took the device with him.

77
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:45,233
In which case,
it could be anywhere by now.

78
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:50,240
We don't know where it is now,
but we do know where it was.

79
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:53,044
Gîza, 3,000 BC.

80
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:56,203
- You can't be serious.
- What?

81
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:58,082
- It's the only way.
- What?

82
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:01,601
- No, we agreed.
- If I say "what" again, heads will roll.

83
00:07:01,685 --> 00:07:04,279
We have a time machine.
We can go back and get the ZPM.

84
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:07,755
She wouldn't let me go back
and watch the Cubs win the World Series.

85
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,678
This is a unique opportunity.
Ra never knew what he had,

86
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:14,394
which means we can go back and take it
without affecting the time line.

87
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:17,477
- Actually, he may be right.
- You're on board with this?

88
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,523
I'm not happy,
but we don't have any historical evidence

89
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:25,520
to show that any Goa'uld has ever used a
ZPM. In which case, it wouldn't be missed.

90
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:29,723
We'd have to be careful to minimise our
interaction with the people of the period.

91
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:33,844
Yeah, there's that. But I thought
you said you couldn't get it to work.

92
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:36,837
No one at Area 51 has been able
to engage the time device.

93
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:41,715
They've barely gotten the ship off
the ground. But you were able to fly it.

94
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:46,799
Indeed. You've demonstrated exceptional
ability to control Ancient devices.

95
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:50,082
With a fully functional ZPM,
we could power Earth's defences

96
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,680
and open up a wormhole
to the Pegasus galaxy.

97
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:01,558
Remember, Jack, 3,000 BC.

98
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:05,236
After Sam hooks up the power,
think about that date only.

99
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:09,477
This thing's Ancient.
How is it going to know from BC?

100
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:11,601
Your mind is controlling it.

101
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:14,995
It should be able to extrapolate
from your concept of time.

102
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:20,717
Shouldn't we test it
on a slightly smaller leap, say, to 1908?

103
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:25,754
Actually, sir, we determined from the
data log that the technology only works

104
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:30,123
in time jumps longer
than a couple of hundred years.

105
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,117
- I think that's it.
- 3,000 BC.

106
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:37,595
Any particular day
of this century for you?

107
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:01,201
- What happened?
- I didn't feel anything.

108
00:09:01,285 --> 00:09:03,276
The time machine pulsed.

109
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:05,356
Try the radio.

110
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:12,073
Stargate Command, this is
Daniel Jackson. Do you read?

111
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:15,202
Stargate Command, this is
Daniel Jackson. Come in, please.

112
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:23,477
The stars are different.

113
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:28,434
Earth was in a different orbit
around the sun 5,000 years ago.

114
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:30,914
I think we did it.

115
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:34,197
Huh.

116
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:43,160
I can't believe I'll get proof
the pyramids predate the fourth dynasty.

117
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:46,681
What will you do? Stand in the picture
with a paper with today's date?

118
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:49,598
This is an archaeologist's dream.
I wanna get footage.

119
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:53,917
Be careful. We're here for the ZPM. In and
out. Minimal interaction, minimal impact.

120
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:57,395
- No problem.
- I mean it. All of you. Sir.

121
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:01,683
- We got it. We got it.
- You're gonna need this.

122
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:06,475
We've determined that it
remotely activates the ship's cloak.

123
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,362
Nice.

124
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:43,639
My Ancient Egyptian's rusty,
but I got the gist of what they're saying.

125
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:47,434
That's Katep and his brother Salatis.

126
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,516
Hey, guys.

127
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:53,199
They're going to the temple of Ra
to make an offering.

128
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,753
- Oh, there's timing.
- Tomorrow.

129
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:59,474
I told them we were travellers.
They offered to put us up for the night.

130
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:02,477
I was kind of hoping
we wouldn't have to stay that long.

131
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:05,875
I'm sorry. I keep thinking
I'll step on a bug and change the future.

132
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,433
We can't just walk
into the temple unannounced.

133
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:10,914
A public audience
is the perfect way to get in.

134
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,644
We'll just have to keep a low profile.

135
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:20,799
Yes. But, more importantly,
did they say what was for dinner?

136
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:42,516
Kree, telok!

137
00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:08,156
Shal-tar!

138
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:19,320
Vash-mal! Vash-mal jel-na.

139
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:25,915
I don't think he was too impressed.

140
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:30,044
Tana-akal maltar! Jaya-nok-shol!

141
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:34,437
He says he will not tolerate
such disrespect from his followers.

142
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:43,677
- Sir.
- If I do it, I won't have to in 5,000 years.

143
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:47,963
You can't do that. There's no telling
what effect it might have.

144
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:13,720
Kree, ria-nok!

145
00:13:57,165 --> 00:14:02,478
It's gotta be some sort of treasure room.
If the ZPM is anywhere, it'll be in there.

146
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:28,481
You really think they're gonna let him
just waltz in and take it?

147
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:31,204
Like I said,
they don't even know what a ZPM is.

148
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:34,083
To them, it's like
any number of ritualistic objects

149
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,804
they pull out for any number of occasions.

150
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:38,955
Besides, he's wearing the shiny suit.

151
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,720
Good luck.

152
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:09,564
- Come on, T.
- We'd have heard if he was in trouble.

153
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:32,636
Nice.

154
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:49,524
- Oh, my God.
- We got a little problem here.

155
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:53,564
There must have been
a sandstorm during the night.

156
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:57,479
The Jaffa will call for reinforcements,
if they have not already done so.

157
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,557
- We must move quickly.
- Sir, we can't.

158
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:04,035
- We've taken on more Jaffa than that.
- You know what I mean.

159
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,401
This is the sort of high-impact
event we're supposed to avoid.

160
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:11,000
They have the ship. Will that not
alter the future more than what we do?

161
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:16,239
Not necessarily. They don't know what it
is, and even if they did, they can't use it.

162
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:19,237
None of them have the gene.
Even Ra won't be able to work it.

163
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:21,520
So what are we supposed to do?

164
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,800
Nothing.

165
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:26,604
- Nothing?
- Well, close to it.

166
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,155
No. Here's a better idea.
We take back our ship.

167
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:32,805
Sir, we kill those Jaffa,
or worse, get captured,

168
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:35,353
and we could
alter the future immeasurably.

169
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:38,437
If you're thinking
we can go forward and then back again...

170
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:41,562
Just a couple of days.

171
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:43,954
Then we park it where nobody can find it.

172
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,117
We alter this time line
and the future is already different.

173
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:50,800
We could set into motion a spiral
of changes that we could never fix.

174
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,876
We've already done too much.

175
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:57,277
I'm sorry, sir, I should never
have allowed us to do this.

176
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,883
So what? We live out
the rest of our lives here?

177
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:13,720
We know there's a rebellion. The
human slaves rise up, Ra abandons Earth.

178
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:16,239
Daniel learned that on Abydos
nine years ago.

179
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:18,964
There is a chance
that we can get the jumper back

180
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:23,357
without creating too big a ripple
in the events of this time line.

181
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:26,278
- When does that happen?
- I don't know. It could be years.

182
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:31,041
- What? Years?
- Sir, we don't have a choice.

183
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,515
Carter, what about the ZPM?

184
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:38,883
If we wait, we lose any chance
of getting it back to our time.

185
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:42,480
Preserving the time line
is more important.

186
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:45,238
For all you know, things could get better.

187
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:49,079
Or they could be worse.
We can't take that chance.

188
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:52,635
I know a way we can get the ZPM
back to our time, even if we don't.

189
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:56,638
A month before I left, there was
a dig that uncovered a tomb near Gîza.

190
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:59,239
If we bury the ZPM in that tomb,
let them find it,

191
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:02,761
maybe our future selves
won't have to take on this mission.

192
00:18:02,845 --> 00:18:05,120
That's bizarre, but it might work.

193
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:10,484
Carter, a lot of good people died
when Anubis attacked Earth.

194
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:14,194
I don't think their families would mind
if we fussed with the time line.

195
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:18,517
Sir, I know this is hard for you,
your instinct is to change things,

196
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:20,835
but for once, it's exactly what we can't do.

197
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:26,124
We have to let things play out
exactly the way they're meant to.

198
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:31,114
English is a complex language.

199
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:33,844
A hybrid of many different influences,

200
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:36,280
much like the culture it represents.

201
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,721
To understand it is to gain
an insight into that culture

202
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:43,639
and the process of integration
that created it.

203
00:18:47,805 --> 00:18:50,638
OK. Let's start with a simple greeting.

204
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:56,197
The best way to interact with someone
is to find a topic of common interest.

205
00:18:56,285 --> 00:19:00,756
Everyone can relate to the weather,
so let's start with that, shall we?

206
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:04,121
Introduce yourself
and talk about the weather.

207
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:09,082
Yes.

208
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:16,759
Hello,
my name is Carlos. You make me so hot.

209
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:19,284
OK.

210
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:24,794
Not quite right,
but the introduction part was good.

211
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:29,481
Daniel. Sorry to bother you, but there
are some people here to see you.

212
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:32,602
Excuse me for just one second.

213
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:37,195
- What kind of people?
- Air force people.

214
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:51,875
This is totally unbelievable.
You are a small and pathetic man.

215
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:54,195
Those were my theories
on spin wave technology

216
00:19:54,285 --> 00:20:00,042
and the effects of antigravity
on electromagnetism, and you know it.

217
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:04,562
Just because my reproductive organs
are on the inside instead of the outside...

218
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:07,762
God! That's horrible.
Who would ever say that?

219
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:10,439
Carter.

220
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,721
- Who are you talking to?
- No one.

221
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:18,115
- Are you talking to yourself?
- No.

222
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:22,244
Have you proofread my review
on the solid fuel rockets yet?

223
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:25,442
I'm almost done. Good job.

224
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:28,119
Thank you.

225
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:32,244
Keep up the good work, Carter.
You'll be moving up around here.

226
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,635
Excuse me.

227
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:38,159
Major Davis, United States Air Force.

228
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:41,476
- Dr Hirschfield.
- I know who you are.

229
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:45,238
- What's this about?
- A matter of national security.

230
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:48,123
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to discuss that here.

231
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,595
Oh, of course, by all means.

232
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:57,760
- We can talk privately in my office.
- Oh, no. I'm not here to talk to you.

233
00:20:58,565 --> 00:21:01,125
I'd like to speak to Dr Carter.

234
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:07,717
Me?

235
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:20,762
- Colonel O'Neill.
- Samuels.

236
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:24,233
You looking to charter a boat for the day?

237
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:28,876
No, sir. I've been sent by the Pentagon
to escort you back to Washington.

238
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:31,115
I could give a rat's butt.

239
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:36,282
- It's a matter of national security, sir.
- Find someone else.

240
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:40,275
We can't. It has to be you.

241
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:45,280
Now, if you'll allow me,
I'll try and explain it on the way.

242
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:48,562
Sammy, it just doesn't sound like fun.

243
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,116
Oh, God.

244
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:25,517
If you'll just wait here, General Hammond
will be with you in a moment.

245
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:33,996
- Hi.
- Hi.

246
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:37,995
- Dr Daniel Jackson.
- Dr Samantha Carter.

247
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:40,883
- Oh, PhD.
- Oh, me too. Astrophysics.

248
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:45,004
- Oh, Egyptology.
- You happen to know why we're here?

249
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:49,283
5,000 years ago, maybe, but now, no.
I was kind of hoping you did.

250
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:51,356
Sorry.

251
00:22:57,005 --> 00:23:00,475
- I teach English as a second language.
- Department of Aerospace.

252
00:23:00,565 --> 00:23:03,079
Oh. Not as an astronaut.

253
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,474
No. I...

254
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:09,524
I check other people's scientific reports
for factual errors or omissions

255
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:12,517
before they get sent up to the director.

256
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,322
Interesting.

257
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:17,714
Yeah. Not really.

258
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:21,514
Dr Jackson, Dr Carter,
I am General George Hammond.

259
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:23,402
Please.

260
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:39,444
- What's this?
- Nondisclosure agreement.

261
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:45,043
What we're about to discuss has been
classified top secret by the government.

262
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:50,119
- What if we don't wanna sign it?
- Well, then you're free to leave.

263
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:11,885
You have a background in archaeology.

264
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:14,081
- Isn't that right?
- That's right.

265
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:19,637
But your theories failed to gain much
acceptance among your colleagues.

266
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:24,879
- You could say that.
- Pyramids as landing pads for alien craft.

267
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,433
I did not say that unequivocally.

268
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:30,358
I put forth the possibility,
based on the knowledge...

269
00:24:30,445 --> 00:24:34,040
It's all right, Doctor, you don't
have to defend your theories here.

270
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:38,721
A month ago, a team of archaeologists
from the University of Chicago

271
00:24:38,805 --> 00:24:42,593
uncovered an ancient
Egyptian tomb near Gîza.

272
00:24:42,685 --> 00:24:45,597
Inside, they found artefacts
typical of the period,

273
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:49,564
plus one or two objects
that have yet to be identified,

274
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:53,240
- and a video camera.
- A video camera?

275
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,682
It was perfectly preserved
in a vacuum-sealed canopic jar.

276
00:24:57,765 --> 00:25:01,997
The technology is somewhat different
to what is commercially available today,

277
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,235
but we managed to charge the battery.

278
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:07,601
However, we didn't bring you here
because we found a camera.

279
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:13,635
We brought you here because of what had
been recorded on the tape in that camera.

280
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:15,920
OK, I think it's ready.

281
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:23,041
OK. My name is Dr Daniel Jackson.
I'm part ofa team called SG-1.

282
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:27,482
And we havejust travelled
back in time 5,000 years.

283
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:40,760
See, the thing is,
we're not sure we're gonna make it back.

284
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:44,679
The chamber where you found this tape
should be discovered before we leave.

285
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:50,044
Hopefully, the time line hasn't changed.
Let's see. What are some recent events?

286
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,561
Communism recently failed
in Eastern Europe.

287
00:25:53,645 --> 00:25:58,002
They should be well on their way towards
democracy. Henry Hayes is president.

288
00:25:58,085 --> 00:26:00,645
- Henry Hayes?
- Secretary of the Interior.

289
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:05,355
President Kinsey was less than amused
when he saw that portion of the tape.

290
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:07,879
Sam, help me out here.

291
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:11,753
Samantha Carter. Lieutenant Colonel,
US Air Force, and a member of SG-1.

292
00:26:11,845 --> 00:26:14,757
- We'll talk about the Stargate.
- Oh, my God.

293
00:26:14,845 --> 00:26:17,040
- What's SG-1?
- Watch.

294
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:21,198
Carter and I work for Stargate Command.
It is located under Cheyenne Mountain.

295
00:26:21,285 --> 00:26:24,004
For the past eight years,
we've been travelling

296
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:27,634
through a large ring-shaped device,
known as the Stargate.

297
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:31,274
It should have been discovered in 1928
near where this tape was found.

298
00:26:31,365 --> 00:26:35,722
By means ofthese offworld missions,
we've acquired advanced technology,

299
00:26:35,805 --> 00:26:39,400
which has helped us defend Earth
against several alien attacks.

300
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:43,319
Ifthe things we're talking about
are not true, then it is possible

301
00:26:43,405 --> 00:26:45,600
that we have somehow
changed the future.

302
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:50,520
The purpose ofthis is to provide you with
the tools to go back and set things right.

303
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:55,759
Ifthe Stargate has not been discovered,
you'll have to find it and get it running.

304
00:26:58,245 --> 00:27:01,282
- Jack, say something.
- No, I'm good.

305
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:07,361
- We should all appear on the tape.
- We don't know ifthings have changed.

306
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:13,559
Uh...

307
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:19,038
General Jack O'Neill, United States
Air Force. How are ya doin'?

308
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:21,719
Tell them about the future.

309
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:28,675
College football is played on Saturdays,
pro on Sundays.

310
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:32,519
And there are no fish in my pond...

311
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:35,358
at all, where I fish.

312
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:38,440
I think that covers it for me.

313
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:47,401
- Did he say "Stargate"?
- Time travel?

314
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:52,757
- What else did the tape say?
- Details of the Stargate,

315
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,597
SG-1,

316
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:59,839
including a fourth member, who appears
to be some kind of humanoid alien.

317
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:04,842
Are you telling us that,
in some alternate time line,

318
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:08,713
we're part of a team
that travels to other planets

319
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:12,081
and defends Earth
against alien invasions?

320
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:14,156
I know.

321
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:17,838
It seems difficult to believe.

322
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:20,155
What about the Stargate?
Did you look for it?

323
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:24,079
We searched the coordinates provided
on the tape, but didn't find anything.

324
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:29,956
The area had already been excavated
previously in 1934 by a Dr Langford.

325
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:34,394
We found nothing but a tablet
inscribed with hieroglyphics

326
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:36,680
that no one has ever
been able to translate.

327
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:39,404
We were wondering
if you'd like to take a crack at it.

328
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:42,318
Are you kidding?

329
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:47,364
Hey.

330
00:28:47,445 --> 00:28:49,242
Hi.

331
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:52,322
So...

332
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:57,118
- What do you think of all this?
- To be honest, I don't know what to think.

333
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:59,196
- It's pretty overwhelming.
- Yeah.

334
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:03,915
Time travel is theoretically possible.
There's been research in quantum gravity,

335
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:07,998
which suggests that time flows
like rotating fluid within our galaxy,

336
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:11,475
technically allowing the traveller
to journey back and forth at will,

337
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:15,035
but there's a huge amount
of energy required.

338
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:18,242
Actually, I was talking about us.
The other us.

339
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:22,921
I guess we could call it
"the us we're supposed to be".

340
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:26,156
Didn't you always think
you were destined for something more?

341
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:29,601
Something a lot more fulfilling
than a nine-to-five desk job.

342
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:34,713
- I suppose.
- I just always felt like my life was wrong.

343
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:39,876
Well, life is what you make it,
for better or worse.

344
00:29:39,965 --> 00:29:42,354
Look at this
as a way to change everything.

345
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:45,198
If we help them find this Stargate...

346
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:49,523
What do you think they're gonna do?

347
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:54,759
Ask us to join an elite team
of intergalactic space heroes?

348
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:59,441
Look at us. The only reason that they
showed us the tape is because we're on it.

349
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:01,083
Exactly.

350
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:04,237
Oh.

351
00:30:06,565 --> 00:30:09,079
That's the gate dialling system,
point oforigin,

352
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:13,238
the address to Chulak,
and the home address. What else?

353
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:15,885
Oh, right.

354
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:21,119
OK. Now, this is very important.
It's called a ZPM. Zero...

355
00:30:21,205 --> 00:30:24,561
Daniel Jackson. I believe
the battery is about to expire.

356
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:27,796
This is called a Zero Point Module,
and its purpose...

357
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:31,434
How's that for timing?

358
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,881
This ZPM was recovered with the tape?

359
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:40,800
Yes, we have a team of scientists
studying it as we speak.

360
00:30:40,885 --> 00:30:44,958
- How's the translation coming?
- Oh, whoa...

361
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:49,755
It's obscure dialect.
I can see why your experts had trouble.

362
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:51,437
But?

363
00:30:51,525 --> 00:30:56,599
But it's almost as if the person who
chiselled this tablet knew my research.

364
00:30:56,685 --> 00:31:02,954
In 2995 BC, about five years after the team
arrived in the past, there was an uprising.

365
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:08,244
The Egyptians rebelled against
the sun god, Ra, or an impostor.

366
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:12,876
Apparently, whoever this impostor was,
he left in a great flying ship

367
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:15,559
- and took the Stargate.
- That is unfortunate.

368
00:31:15,645 --> 00:31:19,684
The tablet refers to a location where there
might be a second Stargate on Earth.

369
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:21,596
Where?

370
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:24,965
I'm still working on that.

371
00:31:25,045 --> 00:31:27,639
Thank you, Doctor.
I look forward to your report.

372
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:29,124
General.

373
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:36,561
If it's all right with you, I'd like to join
the expedition to find the second gate.

374
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:46,285
- They're gonna shut us out.
- I can't say I'm surprised.

375
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:51,234
I haven't finished the entire translation,
which means we still have some leverage.

376
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:53,634
What else does it say?

377
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:58,082
It says the second Stargate
is somewhere in Antarctica.

378
00:31:58,165 --> 00:32:01,794
- Somewhere in Antarctica?
- It doesn't even say that.

379
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:05,639
It says "the land of cold to the south",
which, I guess, means Antarctica.

380
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:08,285
It's a big place. Lots of ice.

381
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:13,393
Whoever wrote the tablet couldn't explain
latitude and longitude in hieroglyphs.

382
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:17,683
At least you're still useful to them. I don't
know why they're keeping me around.

383
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:21,235
I'm not gonna let them shut you out either.
We're supposed to be a team.

384
00:32:21,325 --> 00:32:23,998
We have to stick together.

385
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:26,918
That's nice. Really.

386
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:28,802
Yeah.

387
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:32,679
We need someone
who's willing to go to bat for us.

388
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:35,802
Someone they can't say no to.

389
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:44,796
Agh!

390
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:46,682
Damn!

391
00:32:56,525 --> 00:33:01,474
- You folks looking for a little tour?
- Jack O'Neill?

392
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:03,283
Yeah.

393
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:07,961
Uh... I'm Daniel Jackson.
This is Samantha Carter.

394
00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:16,634
- You two a couple?
- No, no, no. We just met.

395
00:33:17,765 --> 00:33:20,074
What do you want?

396
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,962
Well...

397
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:26,358
We were recently approached
by the military

398
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:29,994
about a... a matter of...

399
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:34,044
- national security.
- Don't care.

400
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:39,358
This is really important. All we're asking
is a little bit of your time.

401
00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:43,680
150 bucks an hour to rent the boat.

402
00:33:43,765 --> 00:33:47,599
- We don't wanna go anywhere.
- It's your money.

403
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:53,756
What we have to do is find the Stargate,
then get hold of this time travel device.

404
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:58,873
- Locate this alien named Teal'c.
- Get Teal'c first, then go back in time to...

405
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:01,604
change the past, fix the future.

406
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:09,759
- Are you listening?
- I was trying not to.

407
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:14,675
- I suppose it does sound a little crazy.
- Really?

408
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:16,756
Which part?

409
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:21,961
I'd have to say
the moment I let you on board.

410
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:24,161
You don't have to believe us.

411
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:27,442
All we ask is that you watch the tape
and decide for yourself.

412
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,517
You know, I have decided -
and hey, look, your time's up.

413
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:36,475
Aren't you the least bit intrigued that
there might be something else out there?

414
00:34:36,565 --> 00:34:38,920
Something more than this?

415
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:47,716
No.

416
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:50,444
We're supposed to be a team.
We save the world.

417
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:54,438
- Several times.
- Yeah, OK.

418
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:57,881
Sure. I buy that. Uh-huh.

419
00:34:58,725 --> 00:35:02,638
The three of us.
The world, we save it. Great. OK.

420
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:06,798
I can't believe
I wasted my Frequent Flier miles on this.

421
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:12,000
- Sorry to bother you.
- Not a problem.

422
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,836
Ah-ah.

423
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:38,315
No worries, eh?

424
00:35:49,685 --> 00:35:53,314
Do you have any idea what's going on?

425
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:56,920
- Dr Carter, Dr Jackson.
- Major, what's this about?

426
00:35:57,005 --> 00:36:01,203
- Did you find the second Stargate?
- No, but we'll show you something else.

427
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:03,082
Airmen.

428
00:36:09,485 --> 00:36:10,838
Whoa.

429
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:16,283
We think this was the ship
SG-1 used to travel back in time.

430
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:27,715
- Where did you find it?
- It was uncovered during an excavation

431
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:32,799
of the area around the tomb
where the tape was found. Please.

432
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,320
This is incredible.

433
00:36:43,405 --> 00:36:45,873
- Is it operational?
- Not yet.

434
00:36:54,405 --> 00:37:00,082
According to the tape, Jack O'Neill has
a special gene that enables him to fly this.

435
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:02,235
These are constellations.

436
00:37:02,325 --> 00:37:07,797
The tape said this was able to go through
the Stargate, as well as time travel.

437
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:11,002
So this must be what dials the gate.

438
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:13,553
Don't touch anything.

439
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:17,001
Please. Leave the touching to the experts.

440
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:20,361
Dr Rodney McKay
is the lead scientist on the project.

441
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:23,437
- Hi.
- This is Dr Carter. Dr Jackson.

442
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:26,039
Pleased to meet you.

443
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:30,793
We're hoping they may
be of assistance to you.

444
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:33,001
Yes. Well.

445
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,962
Thank you.

446
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,434
I'll leave you to it, then.

447
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:45,361
So, did you dial the Stargate address that
the Daniel Jackson on the tape mentions?

448
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:48,164
No. Why would we do that?

449
00:37:48,245 --> 00:37:51,203
- Well, just to see...
- Of course we tried.

450
00:37:51,285 --> 00:37:54,914
It's called sarcasm. We tried
numerous times, nothing happened.

451
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:57,917
- Did you try any other combinations?
- I'm sorry.

452
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:00,121
What are your areas of expertise?

453
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:02,594
- Astrophysics.
- Archaeology.

454
00:38:02,685 --> 00:38:05,518
And I would listen to you because...?

455
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,360
- We're on the tape.
- You I would listen to

456
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:12,198
- if you were reading a phone book.
- Oh, brother.

457
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:15,595
You see, I love this
whole sexy librarian thing.

458
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:18,199
Why don't I take you to lunch,
get you up to speed?

459
00:38:18,285 --> 00:38:21,994
I hear it's lemon chicken today.
My favourite.

460
00:38:22,085 --> 00:38:24,235
Got a lot to talk about.

461
00:38:28,485 --> 00:38:30,476
Daniel!

462
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:33,033
- Is he behind me?
- Who?

463
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:35,116
McKay.

464
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:40,114
Thank God. I think I lost him.
The guy is driving me nuts.

465
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:42,560
Any progress with the ship?

466
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:44,795
The technology is way beyond us.

467
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:47,763
- But I do have something. It could be big.
- What?

468
00:38:47,845 --> 00:38:52,600
Remember how McKay said they dialled
the address and nothing happened?

469
00:38:52,685 --> 00:38:55,245
- Yeah.
- I started thinking.

470
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:57,998
Nothing happened here.

471
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:05,123
- What have you got?
- We're waiting to see General Hammond.

472
00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:11,641
He's busy. Why don't you tell me?
I'll decide if it's worth interrupting him.

473
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:21,404
I cross-referenced
our attempts to dial the gate

474
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:25,524
with some recent seismic activity
in Antarctica. They're a perfect match.

475
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:28,961
The epicentre in all eight cases
was exactly the same.

476
00:39:29,045 --> 00:39:32,082
Approximately 50 miles
outside of Mcmurdo.

477
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:36,920
That... is where you'll find
your second gate.

478
00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:39,914
Worth it.

479
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:43,193
Excuse me.

480
00:40:00,885 --> 00:40:03,445
General, you wanted to see us.

481
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:09,918
It was exactly where you said it would be.

482
00:40:10,005 --> 00:40:12,678
- Good work.
- Thank you, sir.

483
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:18,123
I want you both to know that your help
on this project was most appreciated.

484
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:21,675
Your country owes you
a debt of gratitude.

485
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:26,884
- But we're not done yet.
- Actually, we're not done.

486
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:30,116
You two, however,
have a plane waiting to take you home.

487
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:34,118
I'm sure I don't need to remind you
of the nondisclosure agreement.

488
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:36,196
