1
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,864
So? How did it go?

2
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,499
Absolutely incredible, sir.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,738
You can forget about the Ori. With an act
like that, Sam will be headlining in Vegas.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,836
Okay, stop.

5
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,974
The performance of the device did exceed
all expectations, General Landry.

6
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,984
I'm telling you, sir,
a few tweaks here and there,

7
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:24,022
we'll be able to hide anything we want,
troops, ships, planets.

8
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,092
It's a lot more complicated than that, sir,

9
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,422
but I do think we're ready
for a large-scale test.

10
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,964
Good. Get changed.
I may have just the thing.

11
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:39,630
Colonel Reynolds has been conducting
reconnaissance on P9C-882,

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,539
as part of the ongoing mission
to track the Ori advance in the galaxy.

13
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:47,409
Approximately four hours ago,
the people of 882 were visited by a Prior.

14
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,608
Let me guess. He made them
an offer they couldn't refuse.

15
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,481
With a slight twist.
He told them to build this.

16
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,160
I take it you've seen that before?

17
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,285
Yes.

18
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:06,957
They use these to burn people alive
who don't follow their rules.

19
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,461
He gave them three days,

20
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,470
at which time, he said
he'd return to check their progress.

21
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,099
- What has been the villagers' response?
- Already rejected the idea.

22
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,474
They lived under the Goa'uld for centuries.

23
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,341
They're not about to give up
their freedom again.

24
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,540
They've asked for our help.

25
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,015
You want to use Sam's device
to make them disappear.

26
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.
First of all, it's Merlin's device.

27
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:33,156
And second, while I agree the
modifications I've made have potential,

28
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,126
it's far from ready to deploy in the field
on that scale.

29
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,754
But I'm sure that that's not
what the General is proposing.

30
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,698
Actually, Colonel,
that is what I'm proposing.

31
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,429
The IOA has reviewed the reports
of your experiments,

32
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,870
and they think it's time to take
this new technology out of the lab.

33
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,202
I happen to agree with them.

34
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:55,248
With respect, sir, you're talking about
trying to hide an entire village of people.

35
00:01:55,348 --> 00:02:00,684
I realize it's a tall order, Colonel, but
we seem to have a three-day window here.

36
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,883
Any chance you can make
the necessary adjustments in that time?

37
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,050
Can do, sir. Not a problem.

38
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:08,994
Good.

39
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:16,834
What? Don't look at me like that.
You've got a village to save.

40
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,933
You have returned. Bless us all.

41
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,369
SG-1, this is Thilana, leader of the village.

42
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,243
This is Colonel Mitchell, Teal'c,
Vala and Colonel Carter.

43
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,716
I cannot express our thanks to you
in coming to our aid.

44
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,286
It's our pleasure.

45
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,877
We are at your service.

46
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,549
The building we have selected is this way.
Matar.

47
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,987
- Allow me to carry this.
- Thank you.

48
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,828
Don't you just love helping people?

49
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,230
I hope this location is suitable for you.

50
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,139
I can have the rest of these things
removed, if you'd like.

51
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,178
No, it's great. Thank you.

52
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,543
For years, my ancestors
were forced to record

53
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,781
the true history of our people in secret,
beyond the eyes of the Goa'uld.

54
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,652
This room now houses their legacy.

55
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,352
It seemed appropriate
you do your work here.

56
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,826
I'm flattered.

57
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,464
I must admit, Colonel Carter,

58
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:32,766
some of my people are concerned about
what this machine will do.

59
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,636
I would like to be able to reassure them.

60
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,178
Yeah, of course.
Let me walk you through it.

61
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,737
Basically, this machine shifts all matter
within a preset range,

62
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,751
in this case the entire village,
into another dimension.

63
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,913
So, when the Prior returns,
he won't be able to see or hear you.

64
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,253
In fact, he'll be able to walk
right through you.

65
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,019
But don't worry, it doesn't hurt at all.

66
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,255
And it is just temporary,
just long enough to fool the Prior.

67
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,730
Once he leaves,
we can put everything back to normal.

a little disappearing act here.

Please remember to keep your arms
and legs inside the village at all times,

a complete and final stop.

whose wisdom, generosity and kindness

86

have allowed us to resist those
who wished to return us to slavery.

and most sincere thanks.

What was that?

90
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,871
I think the displacement field collapsed.
I'll go check it out.

91
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,215
Okay, I've got some good news
and some bad news.

92
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,309
Good first.

93
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,617
Well, in order to bring everything
back completely,

94
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,591
the machine has to maintain a connection
with every single molecule

95
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,160
that it sends out of phase.

96
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,823
Now, obviously, that requires a lot
of energy, so I implemented a fail-safe

97
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,298
that would automatically bring everything
back into our own dimension

98
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,096
in the event of a power disruption.

99
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,830
And such a disruption occurred?

100
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,135
Well, it was just a slight fluctuation,
but it was enough to trigger the fail-safe.

101
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,208
So what do we do?

102
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:28,076
Actually, that's the problem.
I thought I'd stabilized the power supply.

103
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,239
Can you fix it?

104
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,089
- You will not abandon us?
- We're not.

105
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,526
But is there a safe place
that you can take your people?

106
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,291
A planet, maybe, you're familiar with?

107
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,461
Won't the Prior find us wherever we go?

heeding the Prior's wishes.

No.

00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:00,274
I will not stand by while we are once again
subjugated into serving false gods.

We must stand our ground.

112
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,443
The Prior is very powerful.

113
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,679
Then, please, you must help us.

to watch for the Prior.

Look, I hate to rush you, Sam,
but we gotta make a decision about this.

119
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,517
Landry was pretty clear, we're not
to let this thing fall into enemy hands.

120
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:43,146
I know. I've rigged an Ancient capacitor,
similar to the kind used in the stargates,

121
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,747
between the device and the generators.

122
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,021
It should collect the power
and, hopefully, feed it more evenly.

00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,493
Well, that sounds great.

00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,803
- It's no good. They're fried.
- (GASPING) All of them?

173
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,904
Well, we've got one working.

174
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,040
Bypass the other two, connect the leads.

175
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,254
(BUZZING)

176
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,725
All right, what's next?

177
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,126
There's a macro on
the main control screen.

178
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,260
I have no idea where that is!

179
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,633
Sam? Sam!

180
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,547
That's it, I think.

181
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,886
Well, it better be it.

182
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,325
Where'd it go?

183
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,135
What just happened?

184
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,134
How did that building disappear?

185
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,071
Perhaps it was the will of the gods.

186
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:09,077
All those who oppose the Ori shall perish.

187
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,246
Stop.

188
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:20,250
Commander, all those here
have resisted with force.

189
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,585
And they shall be punished.

190
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,356
Tomin.

191
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,761
Have her taken to the rings.
Transport her to the ship.

192
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,808
Kill the rest.

193
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,936
No! Tomin, no!

194
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:42,936
No!

195
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,113
(FIRING)

196
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,946
(PEOPLE GROANING)

197
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,612
Hold still, hold still. Hang on.
This'll help you.

198
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,678
(CONTINUES GASPING)

199
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,354
How long was I out?

200
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,895
Well, unfortunately, not long enough
for me to finish this.

201
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,499
Just hang on.

202
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,932
What's going on outside?

203
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,375
The shooting has stopped.
The Ori army is in control.

204
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:47,837
Cam!

205
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:53,915
Damn it, Sam!

206
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,650
- Don't scare me like that.
- What?

207
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,356
The device is on. I forgot to mention that.

208
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,487
Yeah.

209
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,689
I don't know how big the field is.

210
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,165
I think you and I are
the only ones inside it.

211
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,292
Teal'c and Vala?

212
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:14,702
Well, I tried to contact them on the radio,
but there was no response.

213
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:18,233
- Well, that could mean anything.
- It could.

214
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,506
We'll pull through this, Sam.

215
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:43,158
Why are you still wearing the clothes
of a blasphemer?

216
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:49,931
If I put on this dress
and say, "Hallowed are the Ori,"

217
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,544
will you stop mass murdering
innocent people?

218
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,180
Tomin, wait.

219
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,549
I know you think that everything
that comes out of my mouth is a lie.

220
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:03,087
I've deceived you too many times
to change that now,

221
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,055
but there's one thing
I want you to know that is the truth.

222
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:10,185
There were real moments between us.
I did fall in love with you.

223
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:16,599
In your heart, you were a good man,
not because Origin told you to be.

224
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,327
I know you can't possibly like
what you've become,

225
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,464
what this "faith" has made you do.

226
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:26,874
After all that time we spent together,
you still know nothing about me.

227
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,542
I know you must still love me.

228
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,209
Why else would I be here?

229
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,218
If it were up to me,

230
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:43,556
I would light the fire that would
burn you alive for your desecration.

231
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,526
The only reason you are still here
is because it was so ordered by the Orici.

232
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,230
You will remain in this room.

233
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,237
You will see no one.
You will speak to no one.

234
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,068
You will be educated in the ways of Origin

235
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,008
until such time as
evil no longer possesses you.

236
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,578
No, Tomin.

237
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,173
I'm street-smart. That's always got me by.

238
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,911
But I have to warn you,
I've never been much for school.

239
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,748
I am to teach you.

240
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,187
This is my punishment
for allowing you to deceive me.

241
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,254
If you continue to resist, you will die.

242
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,441
Teal'c.

243
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,170
Thilana, I am happy to see
that you are uninjured.

244
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,145
You as well.
Where is the rest of your team?

245
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,978
- I was hoping that you had seen them.
- I have not.

246
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,116
I have spoken to many others, Thilana.

247
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,920
We have decided that, as village leader,

248
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,190
you must go forward to the Prior
and embrace Origin on our behalf.

249
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,494
What? You have no right.

250
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,401
- You see how powerful they are.
- A poor reason to abandon one's beliefs.

251
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,837
This no longer concerns you.

252
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,500
Your attempts to have us resist
have only led to death.

253
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,273
My concerns extend to those
who would worship false gods.

254
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,048
The Ori are not worthy of your devotion.

255
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:17,214
Well, gods or not, their power is real.
The same cannot be said for your people.

256
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,725
You pledged to protect us, but
when the time came, you failed to do so.

257
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,692
We have no choice.

258
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:29,460
We shall bow down to the Ori and beg
for their mercy or we shall all perish.

259
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,069
It's getting worse?

260
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:41,974
Not getting better.

261
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,814
- Listen, I've been thinking...
- Uh-oh.

262
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,546
Yeah. Dangerous, I know.

263
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:53,516
I can leave the field
and still stay out of phase, right?

264
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:58,486
So, I was thinking I'd take some C4,
plant it around the village,

265
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,333
come back here,
use the explosions as a distraction to...

266
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,902
What?
You haven't heard the rest of the plan.

267
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,130
You can't leave the device here.

268
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,408
Well, I was going to save some C4
for that as well.

269
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:09,874
Well, I was going to save some C4
for that as well.

270
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,376
You cannot sacrifice the device for me.

271
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,639
It's still our best chance against the Ori.

272
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:19,444
No offense, but that gizmo's not showing
a whole lot of promise right now.

273
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,146
It'll work. I just wasn't ready for this.

274
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,118
I'm probably not going to make it
either way.

275
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,786
No. Don't you start to talk like that.

276
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:36,261
Cam, we have to face the fact
that I am going to die here.

277
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:40,805
No, I don't have to face that fact,
because I am not going to let it happen.

278
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,771
I appreciate that.

279
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,708
But the truth is,

280
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:51,044
even if you manage to create a distraction
and destroy the device,

281
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,379
you are never going to get me
to the gate by yourself.

282
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,454
- Yes, I will.
- Not alive.

283
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,824
"So it came to pass that Ver Omesh
was gripped by a great famine.

284
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:12,700
"So Markon went to the prophet Articus
and asked to go to the forest for food."

285
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,102
How many people have you killed?

286
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:21,109
Do you keep track?
Put little notches in your Ori belt?

287
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,547
"The prophet bade him be patient,
for the Ori provide for all who have faith.

288
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,017
"But Markon did not believe."

289
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,213
Do you remember their faces?

290
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,653
Or are there too many of them?

291
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,323
Hundreds?

292
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,296
Thousands?

293
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,296
"So the prophet drew a line in the sand,
and told him,

294
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,373
"'Step across,
and you may do as you wish.'

295
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:53,501
"So Markon did, and left the village,
and feasted on wild berries."

296
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,206
What about the stories in there
that are all about not...

297
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,577
Enough!

298
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,483
They were each given a chance
to save themselves.

299
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,520
Those who do not walk the path
are not worthy.

300
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,646
You can preach all you want to me, Tomin,

301
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,848
but I know that's not what you believe.

302
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,549
"The fruit was bitter
and did not satisfy him.

303
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,183
"He longed to return to the village,

304
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,854
"but found that the line had widened
to a great chasm."

305
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,454
I've read the book. I've read it.

306
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,193
I understand why you think
it's so important.

307
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,666
The words give you comfort,
and, at face value,

308
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,203
it appears to be as if they're trying
to inspire the best out of people.

309
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,273
"He called out to the prophet in fear,
but the prophet said,

310
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,466
"'The line has not changed."'

311
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,338
- Honesty, morality...
- "It is you who have changed.

312
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:29,175
- "Step across if you truly believe..."
- This whole crusade is a manipulation.

313
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,545
Nothing in there says that those who
don't believe should be massacred.

314
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,311
"So Markon prayed for forgiveness,
and took the first step."

315
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:34,407
Where does it say that, Tomin?

316
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,544
- Where does it say that?
- "And the hands of the Ori enveloped..."

317
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,418
The Ori are not gods.

318
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,490
(GRUNTS)

319
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,001
You should kill me now.

320
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:08,552
There is a building in the village square
that disappeared upon our arrival.

321
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,952
You will tell me what trickery
is being used to conceal it.

322
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:21,190
I am Thilana, leader of this village.

323
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,030
We do not know what magic is at work.

324
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,764
But it strikes me
by your asking us lowly peasants.

325
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:35,279
You are saying that the great power
of the Ori cannot see past such deception?

326
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:41,785
I ask you so that you may show the Ori
the error of your ways.

327
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:47,421
If you do not bow, your village
will be burned to the ground.

328
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,424
- Wait!
- Matar, no.

329
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,303
She would stand by while
more of our people are murdered?

330
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,374
To protect the identities of those
who have failed us?

331
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,238
What do you speak of?

332
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,437
This man is not of our village.

333
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,951
He came with the others
to try to conceal us.

334
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,100
You have served the Ori well, my friend.

335
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,066
Seize him!

336
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,014
Both of them as well.

337
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,089
Forgive me for striking you.

338
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,900
Hitting me is nothing compared to the
lives that you mercilessly extinguished.

339
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,099
You can never make up for that, Tomin.

340
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:14,370
I thought that I could save you,
but I realize now it's too late.

341
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,812
Yes, it is. You'll never see me again.

342
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,383
One last story

343
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:21,979
from me.

344
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:29,122
A long time ago, some people
just like you and me, over time, evolved,

345
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,058
and they became so advanced
that they figured out

346
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:35,861
how to turn themselves into energy,
and ascend to a higher plane of existence.

347
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,994
I know, it sounds crazy,

348
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,037
but it happened.

349
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:46,668
Then they discovered that
if regular humans worshipped them,

350
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,212
that made them more powerful.

351
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:53,910
So they used their knowledge
to make as many people as they could,

352
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,887
and then created a religion that would
force them to prostrate in their name.

353
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,389
The more prostrating, the more power.

354
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:04,292
The religion said that these beings
were benevolent,

355
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,296
but they couldn't offer
their followers ascension

356
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,161
because that would mean
they'd have to share their power.

357
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,531
They'd just use people up
and throw them away.

358
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,662
I know I'll never convince you otherwise,

359
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,732
but everything you believe is a lie.

360
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,855
Tell me what you know.

361
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:57,575
Please, Prior, we were misled.

362
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,742
The outsiders tried to convince us
the Ori were false gods.

363
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,786
- Matar.
- Forgive us,

364
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:07,824
for we are now ready to embrace
the teachings of Origin with open hearts.

365
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,154
Tell me.

366
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,196
Do you know how the outsiders
have concealed themselves?

367
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,795
This is not good.

368
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:25,434
Hey.

369
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,871
Carter, wake up. No sleeping.

370
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:37,448
- My laptop. There's a file.
- You want me to get it?

371
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:45,055
In my personal directory. Letters, mostly.

372
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:46,922
Sam.

373
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:52,828
One to Cassie and some other people.

374
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,571
Password's "fishing."

375
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,368
See?

376
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,876
Now you're going to have to
change the password.

377
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:13,057
Sam, don't give up on me.

378
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,715
You've got to think of my position here.

379
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:19,126
I worked my ass off to get this team
back together. Now we've lost...

380
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,434
Well, we've lost Jackson.

381
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,432
I can't lose you, too.

382
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,766
I've spent my entire life
dedicated to science.

383
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:39,412
The last 10 years trying to convince people
they believed in false gods.

384
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,050
I don't feel like
science is going to help me.

385
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,755
Right now,

386
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:53,528
I'm just hoping that, somewhere,
one of those gods...

387
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:04,670
My grandma used to say,
"God is like a prairie windstorm.

388
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,835
"If you look too hard,
you get dust in your eyes,

389
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,574
"but there's still plenty of ways
you know it's there."

390
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,650
Is that what you believe?

391
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:16,052
I generally just nodded
until she gave me a macaroon.

392
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,716
(CHUCKLES)

393
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:24,221
There is one thing that I do know is true.

394
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,255
The mind is a powerful thing.

395
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,625
No matter who or what you believe in,

396
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:34,535
sometimes belief itself
makes all the difference in the world.

397
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,805
You just don't give up.

398
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,112
Tell yourself whatever you have to.

399
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,648
Just believe you're going to make it, Sam.

400
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,954
Crap.

401
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,389
Guess your little bag of tricks
don't work on us, huh?

402
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:37,195
Show yourself
or this village will be destroyed.

403
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,080
Score one for science.

404
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:09,695
Prior, I beg forgiveness for my failure
in teaching the mother of the Orici.

405
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,497
You have only just begun, Tomin.

406
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,368
Please allow me to recuse myself.
She is intolerable.

407
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,065
I fear I will be of no further use.

408
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,473
My skills are much better spent
as a commander.

409
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:20,839
Indeed.

410
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:26,406
You have proven yourself a ruthless
and skillful warrior and a fine leader.

411
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,417
Thank you.
I'll head straight back down to the planet.

412
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,545
That won't be necessary.
We are done here.

413
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,453
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

414
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,187
- The village will be destroyed.
- Why?

415
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:42,858
They have been touched by evil.
There is no salvation for them.

416
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,060
But we eliminated all of the unbelievers.

417
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,500
Not all of them.

418
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:49,004
I thought the village had capitulated.
If you'll allow me...

419
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:53,806
Markon walked away from the Ori
to satisfy his hunger,

420
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:58,440
but no matter how much he ate,
he did not feel full.

421
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:05,082
Realizing his mistake,
he ran back to the Ori,

422
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:10,354
but they denied his pleas and struck down
the village that welcomed him back.

423
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:14,124
Forgive me, Prior, but I was reviewing
that very passage just this morning.

424
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,894
Markon prayed for forgiveness
and took the first step...

425
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:22,462
And the hands of the Ori enveloped
all those who welcomed him back.

426
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,702
The village was destroyed.

427
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:31,714
All those who stand by and
accept transgressions must be punished.

428
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,920
That is not the implication
of the text, Prior.

429
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,478
The Ori granted forgiveness
when Markon realized his mistake,

430
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,117
and blessed the village with their light
for showing him the way back to the path.

431
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:46,924
You dare question my judgment?

432
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,392
No, it's just not how I was taught.

433
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,800
There are many words, but only one truth.

434
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:05,007
They're going to clear out
and bomb the village from orbit.

435
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,549
I reckon we'll be okay.

436
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:18,186
The device will be preserved, and they'll
go away thinking they've wiped us out.

437
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,591
But they're going to kill all those people.

438
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,167
I know.

439
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,997
So what are we going to do about it?

440
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,805
Teal'c.

441
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,210
I'm so sorry.

442
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,615
I told the Prior of the device.

443
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,381
He decreed that
the village will be destroyed

444
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,548
if your friends do not show themselves.

445
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,131
Stand aside, Thilana.

446
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,168
What do you think you're doing?

447
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:02,706
He must be sacrificed to show the Ori
we are not allied with them.

448
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,037
You will do no such thing.

449
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:08,544
If you stand in the way,
you, too, will be shown no mercy.

450
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,216
So what we've got to do is we have
to expand the field around the village

451
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,985
just for a little while.

452
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,754
There's not enough power.

453
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,989
Carter, come on!
There's got to be something.

454
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:28,665
(GROANS)

455
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,768
Hang on, hang on.
I'll get you some morphine.

456
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,207
Wait. I need to think clearly.

457
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,172
There might still be a way.

458
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:51,016
Matar, killing Teal'c will prove nothing.

459
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:55,888
If these gods are truly worthy of
our devotion, then pray to them.

460
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:03,189
No god should ever ask you to kill
an innocent man to prove your sanctity.

461
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,601
I know you're afraid.

462
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,937
We all are.

463
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,042
But if you are going to die,

464
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:21,074
let us die in noble peace
and truth of spirit.

465
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,838
TOMIN: Why do they not
reveal themselves?

466
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,945
- Who?
- Your friends.

467
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,920
They're concealing a building
on the planet's surface.

468
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:02,459
The Prior plans to destroy the village
because of them.

469
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,892
Hundreds will die
because of your friends' treachery.

470
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,397
- Innocent people.
- Yes.

471
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,960
- You're not happy about that.
- No.

472
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,506
He twisted the meaning.

473
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,411
- Who?
- The Prior.

474
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,849
He changed the meaning of the story
of Markon to suit the situation,

475
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,181
to justify killing the villagers.

476
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,417
Well, if you think that's wrong,
you should do something about it.

477
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,616
He's a Prior.

478
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,625
Tomin, those people down there
don't have to die,

479
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:40,128
and you're the only one
who can do something about it.

480
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,069
You want to use this?

481
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,207
The power crystal in Merlin's device
was depleted.

482
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,112
That's why we needed
the naquadah generators.

483
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,685
I'm sorry, is that not apples and oranges?

484
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,380
Ancient and Ori technology is similar.

485
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,248
We could make it work for a short time.

486
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:12,253
All right. So, what do I do?

487
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,127
Put the crystal in the back of the device.

488
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,405
Got it.

489
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,531
It's too big. It doesn't fit.

490
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,403
- Power interface adapter.
- What?

491
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,675
Connector. Generator to Ancient tech.

492
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:32,973
(SIGHING)

493
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,779
Carter! Carter.

494
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,986
You've had a lot of morphine.

495
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:42,583
So I want you to explain it to me
so that it makes sense.

496
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:50,355
- Excuse me, Prior.
- Come in, Tomin.

497
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:54,131
It is good that you have seen
your way clear.

498
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:57,435
Hallowed are those who walk in unison.

499
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:01,602
Forgive me, Prior, but I am still troubled.
I believe we are in error.

500
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,772
The people of the village have expressed
a willingness to seek the truth.

501
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,611
I believe they are in earnest.

502
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:11,552
Do not the Ori wish all who seek
their wisdom to follow the path?

503
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,590
I'm disappointed, Tomin.

504
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:18,653
It seems that you have begun
to question the will of the Ori.

505
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:24,201
Or is it the unbeliever under your tutelage
that has corrupted you?

506
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,999
No, I have not begun to question
the will of the Ori,

507
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,472
but I have begun to question
the interpretation of their words.

508
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,566
No matter what you say, I will not believe

509
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,806
the <i>Book of Origin</i> asks us
to massacre innocent people,

510
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:40,611
and I will not stand by while
the holy doctrine of good will and faith

511
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,652
that I have sworn to uphold

512
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,813
is twisted into a hammer
and used to beat people down!

513
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:48,118
How dare you?

514
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,690
(EX CLAIMS)

515
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,434
That's a good sign.

516
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,835
That's easy for you to say,
you with the little flesh wound.

517
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:06,834
- All right, what next?
- Laptop.

518
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:18,644
(MOANS)

519
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,951
- You okay?
- No.

520
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,719
Right.

521
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:30,424
Behold, the hand of the Ori at work.

522
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,144
What happened?

523
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,303
- Come with me.
- Let go of me.

524
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:45,109
The Prior destroyed the village.
There was nothing I could do.

525
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,117
Now keep silent, please,
for both our sakes.

526
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,062
The ship is about to break orbit.

527
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:03,759
They'll probably kill me for this, but
I'm going to ring you down to the planet.

528
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:08,396
- Come with me. Please, Tomin.
- You're right, I still love you.

529
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,304
Then come.

530
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,679
- This is all that I can do.
- No, Tomin, you can do more.

531
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,012
(BEEPING)

532
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,804
Hello?

533
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,678
Anyone?

534
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,381
Vala Mal Doran.

535
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,151
Colonel Carter was able to expand
the range of the device in time.

536
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,086
Colonel Mitchell. Vala Mal Doran is here.

537
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,459
That's good news.
Do we know if that ship has left?

538
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,764
- As far as I know, it has.
<i>- Okay.</i>

539
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:17,807
Look, Carter's in bad shape.
We need a med team here right away.

540
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,385
Hey there.

541
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,890
- You're looking better.
- CARTER: Thanks.

542
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,187
A few more weeks
and I should be back in action.

543
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,524
Yeah. No, I don't want to rush you.

544
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,361
- Listen, Cam...
- Sam, don't say a word.

545
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,365
Here.

546
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,666
I baked you some macaroons.

547
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,145
- You baked them?
- Yeah, Grandma's recipe.

548
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:58,215
- Wow. Thanks.
- Go on, try one.

549
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,783
You know what? Maybe a little later.

550
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:08,689
- You don't like macaroons?
- It's just that I'm still a little queasy.

551
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:13,988
Well, try one. They'll make you feel better.
Here, I'll get you a good one.

552
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,464
Pretty good, huh?

553
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,001
Actually, they are pretty good.

554
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:34,213
- You hate it.
- Yeah. Sorry.

555
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,724
Well, to each their own.

556
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,586
Thank you.
