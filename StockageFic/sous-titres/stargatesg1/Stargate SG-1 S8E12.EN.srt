1
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:08,842
- Come on. It isn't on a permanent basis.
- Still no, Daniel.

2
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,997
I didn't let you go in the first place.
Why would I change my mind?

3
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:15,794
- Because...
- Can you try to do better than that?

4
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:19,514
They need someone to translate Ancient.
I'm the most qualified.

5
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:22,722
Which is exactly why
you're gonna stay right here.

6
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:25,319
Because I'll quit.

7
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:30,115
Why don't you just hold your breath?
You haven't done that in a while.

8
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:36,839
- General.
- I let myself in. Hope you don't mind.

9
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:40,361
- Absolutely not. Welcome.
- Thank you.

10
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,434
- Miss the chair?
- Actually, I do.

11
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:46,800
- Want it back?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

12
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:49,683
My new one just isn't the same.

13
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:53,118
That's not exactly what I meant.

14
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:56,033
Dr Jackson, nice to see you again.

15
00:00:56,645 --> 00:00:59,603
Likewise. We miss you around here, sir.

16
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:02,475
So, to what do we owe this pleasure?

17
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:06,160
I came to ask if you'd be interested
in joining the mission to Atlantis.

18
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:07,519
You did?

19
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:09,914
He's the most qualified person
on this planet.

20
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:14,123
And the mission commander needs
someone who can translate Ancient.

21
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:15,763
- Really?
- With respect, sir,

22
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:20,282
I think you should tell the mission
commander that I need Daniel right here.

23
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,515
- You just did.
- I did.

24
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:24,800
I did?

25
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:29,359
- You, sir?
- Yes. Request denied.

26
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,355
Dr Jackson, you're with me.

27
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:36,916
I'll have the chair shipped to Washington.
You can requisition a new one.

28
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:39,121
I'll do that, sir.

29
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:44,199
We leave tomorrow.
Oh, and I'll be taking Walter, too.

30
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:07,998
General.

31
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:10,155
Welcome aboard.

32
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:12,236
Thank you, sir. Again.

33
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:17,160
My motives were selfish. We haven't
heard a word from the Atlantis expedition.

34
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:20,681
We have no idea what we're going to find.

35
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:23,837
Your knowledge and expertise
will prove invaluable.

36
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:26,997
- General, if you don't mind my asking...
- Why am I going?

37
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:29,280
You could've chosen anyone.

38
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:33,324
I sat back and watched you people
go on a lot of adventures over the years.

39
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:37,876
I thought when you were replaced at
the SGC you were bucking for retirement.

40
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:42,083
- Then I led Prometheus against Anubis.
- Got your dander up.

41
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:45,237
That's why I took the job
as head of home world security.

42
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,476
Then this came along.
The president put me in charge,

43
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:52,399
- so I could choose anyone I wanted.
- So why not choose yourself?

44
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:55,682
I've sent a lot of people
into action over the years

45
00:03:55,765 --> 00:04:00,475
and more than a few didn't come back.
I'd like to see this one through personally.

46
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:05,798
- We've never left anyone behind, sir.
- And we're not going to this time.

47
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:15,404
Last reported telemetry from Atlantis
indicated a space with life-support.

48
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:17,362
Stop it!

49
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:21,438
We're going on the assumption the team
found the lost city and set up a base.

50
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:25,073
- Sorry.
- Dr Novak?

51
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,963
The Asgard hyperdrive
is functioning at 100 per cent.

52
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:29,273
Thank you.

53
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:32,914
- Dr Jackson.
- I'm sorry. What was I saying?

54
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,644
You were assuming Atlantis
is at the end of this trip.

55
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:38,034
Please ignore me.

56
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,401
- It's hard to.
- You disagree, Doctor?

57
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:45,194
As far as we know they found
an outpost like the one in Antarctica.

58
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,357
Could be on a moon,
or at the bottom of some deep dark ocean.

59
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:52,757
- If they're trapped and need help...
- If they're even alive at all.

60
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:58,522
As for contact, hopefully it's just a matter
of being unable to locate a power source.

61
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:01,563
Using information
from the Ancient outpost on Earth,

62
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:05,763
Jackson and his team have pinpointed
our destination in the Pegasus galaxy.

63
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:08,234
Which is here.

64
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:12,003
Damn it to hell.

65
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:33,800
- Dr Novak.
- Dr Jackson.

66
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:35,113
Daniel.

67
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:38,436
You can call me Lindsey.
I'm sorry for contradicting you.

68
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,834
Oh, no. Don't be. I mean, you were right.

69
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:46,921
The fact that we haven't heard from the
expedition since they left is a bad sign.

70
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:54,116
- Have you tried holding your breath?
- I've tried everything.

71
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:59,757
- Yeah, it doesn't work for me either.
- It's been like this since I was a kid.

72
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:04,919
It comes out when I get scared, but this
is the worst since my PhD presentation.

73
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:07,803
I mean, I don't do well
in stressful situations.

74
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:10,524
That's why I turned down
Atlantis the first time.

75
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:14,598
I'm sure you're gonna be fine. Hammond
says you're very good at what you do.

76
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:16,880
Thank you.

77
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:20,560
- What's that? What's wrong?
- I don't know.

78
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:24,474
OK.

79
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,044
We're picking up
what sounds like a distress call.

80
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,162
- Where are we?
- We're still well inside the Milky Way.

81
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:39,917
- Play it back.
- Yes, sir.

82
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:42,121
Help...

83
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:45,356
Require assistance... Have failed...

84
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:48,721
Lost power to... Repeat, stranded and...

85
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,924
- She sounds human.
- What do you think?

86
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:54,997
Much as I hate to delay this trip,
we have to check it out.

87
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:59,601
- How far away is it?
- It's just over 50 light years off our route.

88
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,722
We could be there in... 20 minutes.

89
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:05,558
- Set a course.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:21,280
- Set shields at maximum. Arm weapons.
- It looks like an Alkesh and a cargo ship.

91
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:26,120
They've suffered significant damage. The
distress signal is from within the Alkesh.

92
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:30,437
I don't understand. A human call from
a Goa'uld ship - that makes no sense.

93
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:33,676
- I agree. It could be a trap.
- I know this looks suspicious,

94
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:37,474
but what if there was an uprising
on board one of those ships?

95
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:41,001
There could be human prisoners
in need of our help.

96
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,804
- Open our channel.
- Yes, sir.

97
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:47,036
This is General Hammond,
of the Earth vessel Prometheus.

98
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:51,323
We're answering your distress call
and standing ready to assist you.

99
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:56,396
We can transport a sensor unit on board
to determine life-support viability.

100
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:59,636
General, an Alkesh
is a potentially valuable ship.

101
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:05,880
Even if there are no survivors, if it's
spaceworthy, we should salvage her.

102
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:08,638
- Take a team.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,801
Prometheus, this is SG-3.

104
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:38,479
We are on board.

105
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,723
General, we're seeing
some energy-weapon damage.

106
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:08,478
We have one Jaffa...

107
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:09,884
KIA.

108
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,399
Sir, over here.

109
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:23,078
Make that four Jaffa.

110
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:25,998
Looks like these folks
had an on-board firefight.

111
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:28,553
Still no sign of life.

112
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:30,522
We're heading to the bridge.

113
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:39,039
"Prometheus",
someonejust activated the...

114
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:44,245
- Colonel Reynolds, say again.
- Sir, our rings just activated.

115
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:54,284
Security team to level four ring room.

116
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:56,833
Visuals on screen.

117
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,877
- Seal it off.
- Controls are not responding, sir.

118
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:03,284
Airman.

119
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:07,244
It's no good, sir.
The rings will not activate.

120
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,674
- Security team, report.
- All shipboard communications are down.

121
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:14,756
- Initiate lockdown.
- I can't, sir.

122
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:18,804
- It may be possible from the engine room.
- Go.

123
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:47,005
That wasn't me, sir.

124
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:49,921
Let's get 'em outta there.

125
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,633
Can we pursue?

126
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:05,077
Engines are offline.
Controls are unresponsive.

127
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:08,123
The weapons too.
It looks like we're dead in the water.

128
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,719
General, I just did a head count.

129
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:14,275
Daniel Jackson
is still aboard Prometheus.

130
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,436
Oh, crap.

131
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,559
- Are you OK?
- I feel like my head's going to explode.

132
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,682
But on the bright side,
I think my hiccups are gone.

133
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:59,997
- What do you need, sir?
- I need this ship operational now.

134
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:01,518
Yes, sir.

135
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:03,084
Thank you.

136
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:14,082
We're lucky the life-support systems
are still working.

137
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:16,725
- How much time do we have?
- It's hard to say.

138
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:20,434
I've got some systems online,
including some short-range sensors.

139
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:25,440
Scans of the cargo ship indicate
that it's in worse shape than this Alkesh.

140
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:31,316
- It's strange, isn't it, sir?
- That a Goa'uld soldier keeps us alive?

141
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:04,757
Hey, how's it going?

142
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,563
Guess it's just you and me, huh?

143
00:14:18,845 --> 00:14:21,643
It's a little strange, isn't it?

144
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:25,443
See, that weapon I shot you with
should've killed you.

145
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:31,441
What's stranger is you guys usually don't
take prisoners. It's kinda kill first and...

146
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:37,761
No, that's generally just about it.
Just the killing.

147
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:41,121
I'm just gonna talk to myself
cos you're not gonna talk to me.

148
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:44,481
Not that you guys are very talkative, but...

149
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:46,874
You may prove useful.

150
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:50,563
OK, now we're getting somewhere.

151
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:56,356
- Where's everybody else?
- I transported them onto the Alkesh.

152
00:14:57,045 --> 00:15:02,722
Well, you kept the wrong guy,
cos I don't know anything about the ship.

153
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:06,518
But you are very attractive.

154
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:12,720
What?

155
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:15,483
Hey...

156
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:19,080
Big guy, I'm flattered,
really I am, it's just that, uh...

157
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:21,599
you're not my type.

158
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:26,042
I'm more than a little disturbed
that I might be yours.

159
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:31,276
Whoa! Whoa! No, no. You don't have
to do that. Don't! Don't! Don't! No!

160
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:38,083
Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you...

161
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:41,758
- Thank God.
- ..much.

162
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:44,120
I hope.

163
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:56,315
I wish to send a long-range transmission
using the communication systems.

164
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:59,283
- Sorry, don't have a clue.
- You lie.

165
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:02,755
In general? Uh, no. Yes.
Well, I try to be honest, but, uh...

166
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:08,040
you know, occasionally a little white one
slips out every now and again.

167
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,797
Ow.

168
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:13,484
Shall I kiss it better?

169
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,603
Um... No.

170
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:21,873
Just don't do it again.

171
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:28,601
Look, even if I knew what you wanted me
to do, what makes you think I'd tell you?

172
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:31,358
How can you steal a ship
if you don't know how it works?

173
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:34,881
I got the sublight engines going.

174
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:39,117
- Yeah. So you did.
- You really expect me to believe you?

175
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:41,765
OK. Um...

176
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:46,919
Look, my name is Daniel Jackson.
I'm an archaeologist. A historian.

177
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:50,793
I study ancient cultures.
Histories. Ancient civilisations.

178
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,445
- Have you heard of Earth? Tauri?
- No.

179
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:58,599
- We were on our way to rescue friends...
- I really don't care.

180
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:03,641
- Look, this isn't necessary...
- "Can I have this ship?" "No."

181
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:07,684
"OK. Discussion over."

182
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:08,561
Oh.

183
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,634
Here we go.

184
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,435
Tenat of Oran.

185
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:25,761
Tenat, this is Vala.
If you can hear me, please respond.

186
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,155
I've managed to procure a vessel
better than what I hoped for.

187
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:31,759
Tenat, if you get this,
I apologise for the delay,

188
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:35,474
and we'll meet at the
designated coordinates in one day.

189
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:37,874
Vala out.

190
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:40,160
Now, about the hyperdrive...

191
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:52,874
Colonel, Doctor.

192
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:57,800
I've rerouted the power to shields and
life-support, but as far as the engines go...

193
00:17:57,885 --> 00:18:00,683
The control crystals for both are fried.

194
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:04,121
- It looks like they were sabotaged.
- Can they be repaired?

195
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:07,436
In a word, no. We need new ones.

196
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:11,598
- I was thinking about that cargo ship.
- Harriman says life-support's minimal,

197
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:14,438
barely enough to sustain one person
for a few moments.

198
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:18,803
And if we don't get new crystals...
Sorry, kill me now.

199
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:20,921
- I'll go, sir.
- No. I'll go.

200
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:24,964
- With all due...
- Someone took my ship. I want it back.

201
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:42,238
- Access is restricted by a code.
- Yeah. Too bad.

202
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:45,162
Aagh!

203
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:53,844
- That hurts?
- Ow! Yeah!

204
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,641
I can fix it.

205
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:59,603
I don't know the code.

206
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:16,156
There.

207
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:18,634
Feel better?

208
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:27,362
- You're a Goa'uld.
- No.

209
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:29,436
But I was once a host to one.

210
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:33,074
Which explains the naqahdah
that lets you use their technology.

211
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:36,043
And how I can quickly learn
to fly this primitive ship.

212
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,685
So primitive one would wonder
if it was worth it.

213
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:41,802
Well, in this case
it's the size that matters.

214
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:46,278
Actually, pretty much in every case.

215
00:19:50,085 --> 00:19:52,724
Tell me the code.

216
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:57,837
Please.

217
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:02,124
I don't... I don't know it.

218
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:05,196
Fine.

219
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:24,960
How much time will he have?

220
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:29,118
I'm guessing a few minutes. Maybe less.

221
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:32,356
- Sir...
- Not another word, Colonel.

222
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,403
- Do it now.
- General...

223
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:43,516
Godspeed.

224
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:09,524
General? General, can you hear me?

225
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:12,199
I'm here in the engine room.

226
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:15,197
Open the third panel down
on the centre column.

227
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:26,755
- Done.
- You want the blue one.

228
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:30,724
It should be located
at the centre ofthe panel.

229
00:21:34,805 --> 00:21:36,682
Got it.

230
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:39,643
One panel up, you should find a clear one.

231
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,514
It's hard to tell.

232
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:52,763
The light in here is...

233
00:22:00,325 --> 00:22:02,520
Something's...

234
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:06,041
- General, can you hear me?
- It's only been two minutes.

235
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:11,677
There was a firefight on board.
If the life-support is not cycling the air...

236
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:14,563
- What?
- Staff blasts give off carbon dioxide.

237
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:17,443
In a small enclosed space...

238
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,473
General.

239
00:22:58,565 --> 00:23:00,317
General. Sir.

240
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:07,084
Is he breathing?

241
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:10,403
He may need mouth-to-mouth.

242
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:26,919
Excellent! Excellent waking up, sir!

243
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:30,284
Good job on the crystals, too.

244
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:32,674
Get the ship moving.

245
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:35,677
- What did he say?
- He said, "Get the ship moving."

246
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:43,277
Come on up, General. Let's get you up.

247
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:06,359
Much better.

248
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,755
Lose the weapon
and move away from the console.

249
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:12,680
I liked you better tied up.

250
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:15,723
Against the wall. And lose the weapon.

251
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:24,161
- This suit still absorbs zat blasts.
- It doesn't cover your head.

252
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:28,284
- Still, you should make me take it off.
- I'll turn the ship around first.

253
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:31,357
If I had me at gunpoint
that wouldn't be my first choice.

254
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:33,436
Yeah, well.

255
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:46,683
- What's going on?
- I rewrote the access code.

256
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:49,563
- Undo it.
- Listen. Hundreds of lives are at stake.

257
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:52,398
I'm trying to save my people.
This ship is their only hope.

258
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:55,841
- If you'd mentioned that...
- Would you really have helped?

259
00:24:55,925 --> 00:24:59,554
Look, as I was saying before,
we were also on a rescue mission.

260
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:09,160
- What is it?
- A ship just appeared. It's an Alkesh.

261
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:12,794
This quadrant is crawling with vessels.
It won't be your friends.

262
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:15,558
That ship was fully disabled
when you showed up.

263
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:17,442
We'll see.

264
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:19,436
We have to raise shields
and arm weapons.

265
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:23,200
I'm gonna try and hail them first.

266
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:34,838
Ow. You hit me.

267
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:37,120
- You hit me.
- You know...

268
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:40,003
you know, we could just have sex instead.

269
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:17,434
- Feeling better, sir?
- Yes. Thank you.

270
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:21,040
- We've just caught up to the Prometheus.
- Nice work.

271
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,685
It was all Novak, sir.

272
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:27,201
They're not responding to our hail, sir.

273
00:26:53,565 --> 00:26:56,523
- Are we done?
- I am.

274
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,356
Oh.

275
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:07,924
You're a fruitcake.

276
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:32,554
- Weapons?
- Online. We are in range.

277
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:36,001
Target the rear thrusters.
Take out her sublight capability.

278
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:43,523
She just jumped into hyperspace.

279
00:27:58,365 --> 00:28:00,356
Ow.

280
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:06,757
Huh.

281
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:08,722
Oh.

282
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:10,557
That's just great.

283
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:25,401
I see you.

284
00:28:30,365 --> 00:28:33,675
- Did you have fun taking offmy clothes?
- It was your idea.

285
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:39,761
I meant when I was conscious. So I could
distract you and kick you in the head.

286
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:45,117
I kept my eyes closed the whole time.

287
00:28:45,205 --> 00:28:47,435
I'm sure you did.

288
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:56,714
- So, where are we going?
- I told you.

289
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:59,444
To save my people.
Can you please let me out?

290
00:28:59,525 --> 00:29:01,436
Oh...

291
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:03,402
no.

292
00:29:06,405 --> 00:29:08,077
You know,

293
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,884
I haven't eaten in days.

294
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:17,120
Could you please tell me
how to access the navigation controls?

295
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:22,074
It isn't very nice, you know,
starving a prisoner to death.

296
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:25,759
Come on, Daniel.

297
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:30,919
You've seen me naked.
The least you could do is cook me dinner.

298
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:41,479
Aren't you hungry?

299
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:46,236
No.

300
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,480
Thank you.

301
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:54,556
You know who the Tok'ra are?

302
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:56,636
Yep.

303
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:03,157
Ten years ago
a Tok'ra incited a rebellion on my planet.

304
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:08,365
When people rose up against the Goa'uld,
and once the Jaffa had been overcome,

305
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:11,357
the Goa'uld was captured alive, tortured,

306
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:13,800
and beaten for days on end.

307
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:18,359
I was host to that Goa'uld at the time.

308
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:23,838
The people didn't understand that it was a
symbiote that had ruled them so harshly.

309
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:27,163
I guess the Tok'ra felt responsible.

310
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:31,204
He rescued me.
Removed the Goa'uld symbiote.

311
00:30:31,285 --> 00:30:34,083
Nursed me back to health.

312
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,361
You said your people are in trouble now.

313
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:42,083
Well,

314
00:30:42,165 --> 00:30:45,475
it was only a matter of time
before another Goa'uld showed up.

315
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:47,920
A System Lord named Camulus.

316
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:50,280
That's when the Tok'ra disappeared.

317
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:53,114
People still refused to surrender.

318
00:30:53,205 --> 00:30:56,277
Camulus ordered that they be wiped out.

319
00:30:56,365 --> 00:30:58,754
We controlled several ships,

320
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:01,359
troop transports, cargo ships, Alkesh.

321
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:06,155
Many people were saved, flown to an
inhabitable nearby moon in the system.

322
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:11,239
The ships made several trips before most
of them were intercepted and shot down.

323
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:15,398
Camulus never knew there were
any survivors, so we were safe.

324
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:21,117
- Problem was, we didn't have a Stargate.
- So you were trapped.

325
00:31:21,205 --> 00:31:25,835
We only had a few ships left,
not enough to relocate everyone again.

326
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:29,600
Wasn't a problem. He seemed
to have little interest in other planets.

327
00:31:29,685 --> 00:31:32,518
He left behind a small force
to guard the Stargate.

328
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:38,237
We used the ships to keep appraised of
what was happening and to steal supplies.

329
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:44,479
You know that Camulus is gone now.
He was beaten by Baal.

330
00:31:44,565 --> 00:31:48,797
And Baal's forces are searching every
inhabitable world in Camulus's territory.

331
00:31:48,885 --> 00:31:52,355
His ships are everywhere.
It's only a matter of time.

332
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:58,202
- So you tried to steal that Alkesh.
- It was damaged in the firefight.

333
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:02,836
I was hoping one of my ships
would answer my distress call.

334
00:32:02,925 --> 00:32:05,997
You can imagine how lucky I felt
when this ship showed up.

335
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:11,717
It's big enough to rescue all my people
and take them to a world far away.

336
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,444
Free from the Goa'uld.

337
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,597
- You don't have to lock me up.
- I think I do.

338
00:32:23,685 --> 00:32:28,156
What difference will it make? This ship is
flying to my home world. You can't stop it.

339
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:31,954
When I get to your planet I'll explain.
Maybe we can work something out.

340
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:37,119
My people are not gonna trust you.
You have to let me talk to them.

341
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,718
No.

342
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:42,076
Daniel.

343
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,161
This is bad.

344
00:32:58,245 --> 00:33:03,638
Vala, this is Tenat.
We have you on our scanners.

345
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:07,434
- Uh, yeah. Hi.
- Where is Vala?

346
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:11,914
She's here.
She's just indisposed at the moment.

347
00:33:12,005 --> 00:33:15,122
She did not mention
she was working with someone.

348
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:17,878
No, I guess not.

349
00:33:17,965 --> 00:33:21,435
Look, I realise I owe you an explanation.

350
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:23,834
It's a bit of a long story, really.

351
00:33:23,925 --> 00:33:27,042
We will hear it in person
and inspect your vessel.

352
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:30,276
Good, because apparently
we're coming in for landing.

353
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:33,516
We will meet you
at the designated coordinates.

354
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:36,324
Okey-dokey. See you there.

355
00:33:54,485 --> 00:33:56,282
Ow!

356
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:01,320
OK.

357
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:05,284
You want the truth?
I'll tell you the truth.

358
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,634
Daniel, are you there?

359
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:15,199
I hope you can hear me. The planet
wejust landed on is not my home world.

360
00:34:15,285 --> 00:34:18,755
Whatever you do,
you must not go out there.

361
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:24,519
- Hi, guys.
- Who are you?

362
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,483
Uh, name's Olo.

363
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,033
Hans Olo.

364
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:33,081
- Where is Vala?
- She's inside.

365
00:34:33,165 --> 00:34:37,124
- We will only do business with Vala.
- Business.

366
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,924
Yeah. That figures.

367
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:44,237
Not that I'm surprised or anything.
I don't look surprised to you, do I?

368
00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:48,876
- What?
- It's just that I was expecting refugees.

369
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:51,240
Human sort of refugees.

370
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:54,522
Not that there's anything wrong with you,
that I know of.

371
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:57,199
We have the naqahdah.

372
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:06,035
- Refined weapons grade.
- Oh, that's nice.

373
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:10,960
This was the price we agreed upon. This
ship is impressive in size, but we cannot...

374
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:15,277
OK, you know what? Seriously,
there's been a big misunderstanding.

375
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:18,084
I don't care what you've got,
I'm not gonna sell.

376
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:22,920
- You know what? That is not necessary.
- We had a deal. We must have this ship.

377
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:31,276
Goa'uld gliders. Fool! You were followed.

378
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:34,163
Of course we were.

379
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:39,799
OK, you know what?
I'd love to stay and chat, but...

380
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:05,040
Daniel? What's going on?

381
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,197
We're being attacked.
Tell me how to access the systems.

382
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:12,563
- Let me out and I'll help you.
- You gotta be kidding me!

383
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:20,243
Let's go.

384
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:22,839
- No funny stuff.
- What did you do with my buyers?

385
00:36:22,925 --> 00:36:26,201
- We'll talk about that later.
- And the naqahdah?

386
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:29,834
- Move!
- Do you have any idea what that is worth?

387
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:31,517
Ohh!

388
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:46,437
All right, raise our shields.

389
00:36:55,365 --> 00:36:57,674
- Let's go to hyperspace.
- It's not working.

390
00:36:57,765 --> 00:37:02,316
We've already taken too much hull
damage. And we have incoming Alkesh.

391
00:37:02,405 --> 00:37:04,475
Arm weapons.

392
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:17,756
Shields are failing.

393
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:32,915
And shields are down.

394
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:35,394
We are almost out of weapons.

395
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:47,960
- What just happened?
- An Alkesh just took out one of its own.

396
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:52,844
Nice work, Sergeant.
Target the second Alkesh. Fire at will.

397
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:54,802
Roger that, sir.

398
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:06,920
Dr Jackson?
This is General Hammond. Do you copy?

399
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:14,919
General, it's me.
Good to hear your voice, sir.

400
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:18,793
Likewise. Are you all right, son?

401
00:38:21,445 --> 00:38:25,154
- We're fine, sir.
- Are we clear to ring aboard?

402
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,241
Stand by.
Unlock the system.

403
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:31,401
Those gliders retreated nearby.

404
00:38:31,485 --> 00:38:35,478
We have to get out of here now.
Unlock the system.

405
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:43,884
You're all clear, sir.

406
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:53,997
What are you gonna do with me?

407
00:38:57,725 --> 00:39:00,114
I'm not sure.

408
00:39:02,645 --> 00:39:05,034
Look, Daniel,

409
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:08,800
whatever happens,
I just want you to know...

410
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:33,517
We got the shields and hyperdrive back
online. However, there's hull damage.

411
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:37,883
- I wouldn't recommend a long journey.
- We have no choice but to return to Earth.

412
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:41,037
- How long before the ship's ready again?
- Hard to say.

413
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:44,003
That was good work.
Both here and on the Alkesh.

414
00:39:44,085 --> 00:39:46,440
Thank you, sir.

415
00:39:46,525 --> 00:39:48,481
Hey.

416
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:50,840
Hiccups are gone, huh?

417
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:53,598
I didn't notice.
I guess I was having too much fun.

418
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:56,916
Security team to level four.
The prisoner has escaped.

419
00:39:57,005 --> 00:39:59,997
Ring room.

420
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:05,201
Wow.

421
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:10,993
- Status?
- Security team one unresponsive.

422
00:40:12,885 --> 00:40:14,876
Rings on level four just activated.

423
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:32,080
General Hammond?
SG-3 was just transported here.

424
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:34,725
She's on the Alkesh.

425
00:40:38,165 --> 00:40:42,841
- Lock weapons on its engines.
- Aft thrusters targeted.

426
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:44,913
Target is...

427
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:51,320
It's gone, sir.

428
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:53,396
Can we track it?

429
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:58,081
No, sir. Our long-range scanners
are being scrambled.

430
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:04,275
She's good.

431
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:35,801
