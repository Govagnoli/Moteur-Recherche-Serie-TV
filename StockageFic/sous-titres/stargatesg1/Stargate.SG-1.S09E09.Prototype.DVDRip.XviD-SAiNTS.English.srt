1
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:04,831
- Sir!
- Colonel!

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:05,982
I need you to read this.

3
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:07,650
Good morning to you too, Colonel.

4
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:09,302
Sorry Sir. How are you?

5
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:10,261
What is it?

6
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:11,830
It's a report from the Tok'ra.

7
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:15,008
They've discovered a gravitational disturbance,
with their long range sensors.

8
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,493
Another Ori incursion.

9
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:18,703
Well, it could simply be a yet
undiscovered black hole,

10
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:21,023
but the Tok'ra won't have
a ship in range for some time.

11
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:24,326
I've located a planet with a Stargate close
to the disturbance. If you'll permit me to take a...

12
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:26,562
Go! SG-5 should be available.

13
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:28,413
Thank you Sir.

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,499
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

15
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:38,299
Walter?

16
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:41,744
Receiving an iris code, Sir.
It's Colonel Carter.

17
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:43,829
That was fast.
Open the iris.

18
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:44,956
Yes Sir.

19
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:52,572
Colonel!
Tell me you've got good news.

20
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:56,092
Actually Sir, I think there was a little glitch.

21
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:58,294
We were on the wrong planet, Sir.

22
00:00:58,311 --> 00:00:59,311
Was the intel wrong?

23
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:00,289
We don't know Sir.

24
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,975
When we arrived,
there was no sign of the MALP.

25
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:06,103
I checked our telemetry based
on known star positions.

26
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:09,256
We weren't on P3X-584, Sir.

27
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:11,758
Somehow, we got sent to a different planet.

28
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:12,826
Walter?

29
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:15,646
I'm reviewing Gate diagnostics, Sir.

30
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:17,531
How could this happen?

31
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:19,594
If it is a Gate malfunction, it's a pretty big one.

32
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,594
Unlike any we've seen before.

33
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:25,957
Chief, inform all offworld teams to use
the Alpha Site until further notice.

34
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:26,549
Yes Sir.

35
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:30,595
If there's something wrong with this Gate, I wanna
know what it is before anyone else walks through it.

36
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:31,329
Yes Sir.

37
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:35,292
Find the problem.
Until we do, all Gate activity is shut down.

38
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:48,854
Season 9 - Episode 9
Prototype

39
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:47,807
<i>Run the cross comparison program.</i>

40
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:49,818
Hey! How's it going?

41
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:54,844
Well as far as our computer is concerned
the dialling sequence to P3X-584 ran perfectly normal.

42
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:58,062
Except for the fact you ended
up 12,000 light years off course.

43
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:01,783
Oh, here's something.

44
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:08,538
<i>Maybe it wasn't our fault.</i>

45
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,630
I thought it was always our fault.

46
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:14,771
We just ran a program that compares the energy
signatures of the last thirty outbound trips,

47
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,219
to look for anomalies.

48
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:18,450
It's kinda like a bump.

49
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,576
A bump?

50
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:26,071
Actually, more like a series of bumps.
Exactly 8.5 seconds apart.

51
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,725
Well, that explains everything.

52
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:30,735
Actually, it might.

53
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:34,596
Defence mechanism?

54
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:35,520
Yes, Sir.

55
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:40,066
I think each of these spikes represents a request
by the offworld Gate, for an authorisation code.

56
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:42,206
If the correct authorisation
code is not entered in time,

57
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:44,107
we are prevented from reaching the planet.

58
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,033
That doesn't explain how you an SG-5
ended up half way across the galaxy.

59
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:50,922
<i>Well, I have a theory about that too.</i>

60
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:56,250
Instead of using an iris, like we do, the offworld
gate stores incoming data in its buffer system.

61
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,321
Then, if the correct code isn't received,

62
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:01,579
it dials a random address and empties
the buffer into the new wormhole.

63
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:04,213
Interstellar call forwarding.
That's pretty cool!

64
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:08,395
How did the MALP get through to 584? I mean,
initial telemetry confirmed it was on the right planet.

65
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:12,819
My guess is, the 584 security system filters
incoming matter based on certain protocol.

66
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:15,471
Organic versus inanimate, for instance.

67
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:17,484
That seems like an awful
lot of trouble to keep people out.

68
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,897
Which makes me curious as
to what's being hidden there.

69
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:21,605
Always want what you can't have.

70
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:26,391
I've calculated it'll take the Prometheus
two weeks to reach 584 at maximum speed.

71
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,448
If the Ori are constructing a Supergate,
then we may not have that much time.

72
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,450
I will contact the High Council
and have a Jaffa ship scout the area.

73
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:36,524
Can you figure out a way
to crack this authorisation code?

74
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:38,252
Certainly try Sir.

75
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:42,716
Teal'c. No offense, but I'd feel better
if we investigated this ourselves.

76
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:44,163
Dismissed!

77
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:56,589
<i>MALP is enroute.</i>

78
00:04:56,991 --> 00:05:00,310
We placed a bacterial culture inside
the MALP's cargo compartment.

79
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:05,135
Hopefully, the organic material will force the 584 Gate
to hold the MALP and ask for an authorisation code.

80
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:09,458
I'm receiving the Gate's authorisation request.

81
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:11,509
Now we just hope this program works.

82
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:16,655
What does that mean?

83
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:18,304
I think it was good.

84
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:21,018
The MALP is coming online.

85
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,929
Rotate the camera to the left.

86
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:30,529
It's the first MALP.
It worked.

87
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,374
Good!

88
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:45,308
Alright, let's see what all the fuss is about.

89
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:48,566
Well, we'll have to wait till nightfall
to get a visual confirmation of the black hole.

90
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,380
In the meantime Major,
you can set up the gravity sensors.

91
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:54,999
I'll make sure we can dial home.

92
00:05:58,617 --> 00:06:02,056
SGC, this is SG-1 leader.
We have arrived safely.

93
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,410
<i>Thank you Colonel.
We'll dial again in 15 minutes.</i>

94
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,019
<i>Prometheus is standing by.</i>

95
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:09,214
Hopefully that won't be necessary, Sir.
Mitchell out.

96
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,989
I'd rather not wait around two weeks for a ride.

97
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,408
We're gonna have a look around.

98
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,557
I think I found the problem.

99
00:06:25,663 --> 00:06:27,071
You see anything like it before?

100
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:31,353
Nope. And I don't wanna remove it until I know
exactly how it's connected to the system.

101
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:34,006
Good news is,
it won't affect any outbound dialling.

102
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:37,585
<i>Colonel Carter!
We've got the gravity centers up and running.</i>

103
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,796
<i>- Good! I'll be right there.
- Hey guys, this is Daniel!</i>

104
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:42,249
<i>You might wanna come and check this out first.</i>

105
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,561
I got it.
You check out the black hole.

106
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:51,598
It's amazing what people leave laying around!

107
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:53,206
Where do those go?

108
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:55,016
Only one way to find out!

109
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:20,452
I don't think anyone's been home for a while.

110
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,278
This is some kind of science lab.

111
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:31,107
This looks familiar.

112
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,532
It's Nirrti's DNA Manipulation Device.

113
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:36,416
Nirrti?

114
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:40,115
She was the Goa'uld who was trying
to create an advanced host, right?

115
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,930
Ended up with a bunch of
super freaks who turned on her.

116
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,377
That was a cool file.

117
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:58,853
This writing is in Ancient

118
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,504
Oh, I was wrong.

119
00:08:10,817 --> 00:08:12,024
There is someone home.

120
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,676
Wait! Wait!

121
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:22,480
What?

122
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:25,194
I was looking for the light switch!

123
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:28,009
New guy!

124
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:29,518
You touched that!

125
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,327
I know how to read that!

126
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,407
I got a faint pulse.

127
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:53,444
Carter! Get back to the gate.
Tell the SGC we need a med team here, right away!

128
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:01,767
Well, you're clean!
No sign of any exposure to infectious agents.

129
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,678
Great! How's pod man?

130
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:04,683
Also going to be fine.

131
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:07,378
I suspect the convulsions were just
a reaction to coming out of stasis.

132
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,851
Although, his preliminary test results
were quite interesting.

133
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:10,534
How?

134
00:09:10,936 --> 00:09:15,762
We've been able to study the genetic
characteristics of the Ancients, from the
database sent back to us from Atlantis.

135
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:19,381
Our patient X definitely shows
some physiological similarities.

136
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:21,331
You think he's an Ancient?

137
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:23,966
I'm runnning a more detailed analysis.
There are some more strange anomalies.

138
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:26,177
But in the meantime,
why don't we ask him?

139
00:09:34,863 --> 00:09:35,667
Hello.

140
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:42,503
I'm Doctor Caroline Lam.
Do you understand me?

141
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:44,312
Yes.

142
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:48,535
Good. Try to relax.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

143
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:52,757
You're safe.
You're on a planet called Earth.

144
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:57,562
I'm Lt Col Samantha Carter
of the United States Air Force.

145
00:09:57,603 --> 00:09:59,694
Cameron Mitchell.
Ditto on the other stuff!

146
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:01,906
Can you tell us your name?

147
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:06,932
- It's Khalek.
- Khalek.

148
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:12,562
We found you on another planet, in stasis.
In what looked like some sort of science lab.

149
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,186
Earth?

150
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:18,896
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

151
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:23,319
I want to go home.

152
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:26,938
Home?
Where is home?

153
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:28,747
They took me.

154
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:31,160
I was a prisoner.

155
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:33,975
So long.

156
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:38,197
He did experiments on me.

157
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,007
He, who?

158
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,219
I never knew his name.

159
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,749
Please.
I just want to go home.

160
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:49,760
Can you tell us what this guy looks like?

161
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,896
Do you have the Stargate address
for the planet you call home?

162
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:54,384
<i>The symbols to dial?</i>

163
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:55,591
Yes.

164
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:59,812
OK. When you're feeling better,
we'll see what we can do.

165
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,458
So, not an Ancient.

166
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:09,463
Too bad.

167
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:14,087
Poor guy, this is exactly what Nirrti did,
kidnapped people and then experimented on them.

168
00:11:14,128 --> 00:11:16,199
Yeah but, Khalek there said he...

169
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:20,020
Well, I'm sure Nirrti wasn't the only Goa'uld
with an interest in evolved Human hosts.

170
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,633
That lab looked more Ancient than Goa'uld.

171
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,252
You think it was an Ancient
experimenting on him?

172
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:28,263
I don't know.

173
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:31,078
But I'm sure Jackson will get to the bottom of it.

174
00:11:31,118 --> 00:11:34,375
In the meantime, we'll get the address
to Khalek's homeworld and send a malp.

175
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:37,410
Hopefully, it'll still be somewhere
he wants to go back to.

176
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,374
Hey, what's up?

177
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,234
Well, it looks like that our black hole's
just a regular old black hole.

178
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:56,205
<i>No giant Ori Supergate.</i>

179
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:57,411
That's good.

180
00:11:57,913 --> 00:11:59,603
Teal'c said you could use some help in here.

181
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:02,243
Yeah, there's something wrong with the power supply.
It's driving me nuts.

182
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:03,444
We'll look what we can do.

183
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,707
Colonel Mitchell says
the man we found in stasis is not an Ancient.

184
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:10,320
He was being held prisoner
and experimented upon.

185
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,773
We do not believe
that he knew his captor.

186
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:14,944
Have you found anything, Daniel Jackson?

187
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:18,885
Just pages and pages of logs.
Notes about the exper...

188
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,966
What is it?

189
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,379
This is bad.

190
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:30,767
- Where is he?
- Isolation room 1.

191
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:32,678
- Under guard?
- Why? What did you find?

192
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,653
I should have known when I saw the Ancient writing.
He used to use it as code on his ships.

193
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:39,192
- Dr Jackson.
- The lab does not belong to an Ancient.
- It belonged to Anubis.

194
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:40,392
But he's long gone now.

195
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:45,124
Yes, but the man he left behind is not the victim
of experiments, he's a genetic hybrid.
He was grown in that lab.

196
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,371
I'm sorry?

197
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:47,858
<i>Whatever he told you, he's lying.</i>

198
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:49,386
The Goa'uld pass on genetic memory.

199
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:52,201
Now he may not have a snake in his head,
but the man we defrosted and brought back here,

200
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:54,734
has Goa'uld DNA intermingled with his own.
That makes him,

201
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,584
the son of Anubis.

202
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:10,421
The log entries said Anubis managed
to replicate his pre-ascension DNA,
using the genetic manipulation device.

203
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:15,367
Then, he combined it with Human DNA and
was able to rapidly grow our, our friend there.

204
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:19,389
The analysis I did, suggests that
Khalek is significantly more evolved than we are.

205
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:22,888
Much more in line with
the Human form of the Ancients, prior to ascension.

206
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,662
So he could have all kinds
of super funky powers?

207
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:29,321
Well, the subjects Nirrti manipulated,
demonstrated telekinetic and psychic abilities.

208
00:13:29,362 --> 00:13:30,568
Like the Priors?

209
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:33,342
The goal of the experiment seems
to have been to create an advanced Human.

210
00:13:33,383 --> 00:13:36,077
With a little Anubis blended in.

211
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:37,927
You said he used his pre-ascended DNA.

212
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:40,198
Do you think he was doing his
experiments before he ascended?

213
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,969
No. See, that timeline
doesn't track with the log.

214
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:44,582
Plus it says he had to reproduce his DNA.

215
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:48,282
Which means he was doing all this after
he ascended and was sent back by the Ancients. Well,

216
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:49,287
halfway.

217
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:50,614
But this doesn't make any sense.

218
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:54,273
Even a highly evolved Human host
wouldn't be as advanced as he was.

219
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:55,158
Why bother?

220
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:56,766
<i>Maybe he didn't like being stuck in limbo.</i>

221
00:13:56,806 --> 00:14:00,385
Maybe even a small step back to mortality
was worth it to him on some level.

222
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:04,084
Perhaps he was attempting to create
an even more powerful servant than the Kull warriors.

223
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:08,589
No matter what Anubis' ultimate goal was,
Khalek is extremely dangerous.

224
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,223
- Options?
- Put him back in his pod.

225
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:13,796
I doubt we'd be able to get
the one from 584 back here.

226
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:17,397
If we leave him there, others could circumvent
the security and find him, as we did.

227
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:19,970
We could post guards.
What about the Antarctica pod?

228
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:23,790
Look, I think we need to consider
whether we want to preserve him at all!

229
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,737
Look, the fact is, we don't know
how successful Anubis was.

230
00:14:32,777 --> 00:14:36,236
Khalek is advanced. Yes, but we don't know
how far along he actually is.

231
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:40,055
Now, if he is aware of his own state of evolutionary
advancement and I bet you anything he is,

232
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:44,157
it's possible the only thing keeping him from ascending
right now is that he hasn't figured out how.

233
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:46,449
- What would that take?
- I don't know!

234
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,178
But if he can do it. If,...

235
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:52,320
if he knows how or figures out how. At the very least,
we're gonna have another Anubis on our hands

236
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,773
and at that point it's going
to be too late to stop him.

237
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:57,708
Well he couldn't progress his state
of being while he was in stasis.

238
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:00,805
Look, you know I would never suggest this lightly.

239
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,841
But he is what he is

240
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:09,189
and given the danger he poses,
I think we have to ask ourselves,
what is the point in keeping him alive at all.

241
00:15:16,226 --> 00:15:18,277
I hear you, Doctor Jackson.

242
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:21,878
<i>For the moment, we're taking
every security precaution we can.</i>

243
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,607
I'll contact Washington.

244
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,859
Discuss how we're going to proceed.

245
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,438
<i>In the meantime, I suggest
all of you learn as much as you can.</i>

246
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:33,740
Including what Khalek does and doesn't know.

247
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:43,995
Khalek, can you hear me?

248
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:47,935
Yes.

249
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,675
<i>My name is Doctor Daniel Jackson.</i>

250
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:58,028
Why have you restrained me like this?

251
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,210
Why is everyone suddenly acting like they fear me?

252
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,421
Look, you can drop the act.

253
00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:08,443
I don't understand.

254
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:11,378
Have you contacted my homeworld?

255
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:15,118
We found you on your homeworld.

256
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,592
I understand Ancient.

257
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:21,874
Those research notes Anubis left?

258
00:16:23,926 --> 00:16:26,781
<i>We know that you were grown in that lab</i>

259
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:29,697
and you possess Anubis' DNA

260
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:32,551
and his genetic memories.

261
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:44,173
My memories DO include you, Doctor Jackson.

262
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,435
<i>The confrontation you once had with my father.</i>

263
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,818
I sense it is some time since I was last awake.

264
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:57,684
- What has become of him?
- I'm not here to answer your questions.

265
00:16:58,045 --> 00:16:59,051
<i>The others,</i>

266
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:02,308
they wish to study me, don't they?

267
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:06,772
Why else would I still be here,
given the danger you know I pose?

268
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:12,201
They want to learn what I am.
How I came to be.

269
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:14,010
But you.

270
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,956
Have you ever taken a life,
Doctor Jackson?

271
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,143
I believe you have...

272
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:26,194
killed a man.

273
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,312
My memories are so sharp and clear.

274
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:36,187
It's as if they happened
only moments ago.

275
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:39,525
The countless lives my father extinguished.

276
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:42,642
All those that came before him
that did the same.

277
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:46,099
Such pleasure it gave them.

278
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:50,804
But I have not experienced it myself yet.

279
00:17:51,508 --> 00:17:54,967
Does it really feel that good?

280
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:59,671
Millions of slaves bowing before me.

281
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:03,291
A galaxy of desperate, pitiful lifeforms at my feet.

282
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:05,743
That's clearly intoxicating.

283
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:10,609
I can almost taste it, as if it was me there
and not those whose memories I possess.

284
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:13,766
But nothing,

285
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:19,838
nothing do I anticipate more than the sweetness
I know I will feel, when I'll kill for the first time.

286
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,112
I can hardly wait to watch
as fear stops a man's heart.

287
00:18:27,197 --> 00:18:29,931
So much more intimate,

288
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,384
one on one.

289
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,607
To watch as the blood flows from his veins

290
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,225
and savour his ever fading hope for life.

291
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:45,112
There's only one way to stop it.

292
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:49,415
I know you wish to take my life
and I promise you,

293
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:51,626
before this is over,

294
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:55,527
one of us will feel the pleasure.

295
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:20,781
Mr Woolsey!
Given the timing,
this can't be a good sign.

296
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:24,038
The International Committee overseeing the SGC

297
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:28,119
has read and considered your recommendation
to place the prisoner back in stasis.

298
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,432
At least until we can decide
what to do with him.

299
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:32,563
We think that's a mistake.

300
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:34,714
Oh, you think we should kill him.

301
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:36,444
On the contrary!

302
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:38,374
We think he must be studied.

303
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:43,079
You understand how dangerous he is.

304
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,100
We understand how dangerous you seem to think he is.
There's very little coroborating evidence at this point.

305
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:49,593
That's why more study is required.

306
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:52,367
Is this a joke?

307
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,579
Cos if you look closely,
I'm not laughing.

308
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:59,123
You and your people went before
the Senate Appropriations Committee

309
00:19:59,224 --> 00:20:02,683
and demanded that the budget for
this facility not be cut in half. Why?

310
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:06,020
Because of a formidable new enemy
that now threatens our galaxy.

311
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:08,192
What would we do without you?

312
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:13,901
All we have heard, is that the Ori must
be taken more seriously than the Goa'uld.

313
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:18,083
That the Priors who represent them are extremely
powerful and dangerous in their own right.

314
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:21,220
And yet, in the months since
this threat emerged,

315
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:23,735
not one proposed counter measure.

316
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:28,922
Not one shred of technology. Not even so much
as a theory or strategy to fight these missionaries,

317
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,697
has resulted from ongoing Stargate operations.

318
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:33,225
Until now!

319
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:35,798
<i>And you want to freeze him.</i>

320
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,367
Go, go! You're on a roll.

321
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:41,669
Based on the report, the only thing
that we do know about this Khalek,

322
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:45,791
is that physiologically he may be
very much like the Priors of the Ori.

323
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:49,892
An advanced form of Human,
far along in evolutionary development.

324
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:54,007
First and foremost, studying him,
may be the key

325
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:56,307
to learning a way to fight the Priors.

326
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:58,398
Actually, that had not escaped me.

327
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:01,775
Not to mention the fact that he may be
the missing link between ourselves and ascension.

328
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:03,225
<i>Certainly that merits more research.</i>

329
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:08,268
The members of the committee feel
very strongly about this.

330
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:11,567
Then neither they nor you
understand the risks.

331
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:13,658
Oh, we do.

332
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,875
The issue is,

333
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,549
<i>if this command doesn't have the ability</i>

334
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:23,531
and security in place to take
full advantage of an opportunity like this,

335
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:27,673
then we believe we need to reevaluate it's leadership.
And ultimately,

336
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,970
its operation.

337
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:40,397
If Woolsey and the bean counters are
gonna force us to keep Khalek conscious,

338
00:21:40,737 --> 00:21:43,130
maybe we'd better figure out
what he's capable of, and fast.

339
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,146
It was like he was goading me into killing him.
Like he wanted us to do it.

340
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:48,941
He know's he's on the path to ascension.
Maybe he thinks that's the final step.

341
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:51,194
If that's the case, we may have no other
choice but to freeze him again.

342
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:54,491
<i>- With strict instructions never to defrost.
- Indeed.</i>

343
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:58,029
Unfortunately, we must now convince others
this is the prudent course of action.

344
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:01,165
Major Altman seems to think
he has something that will help us.

345
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,498
<i>Yeah, this unit, it seems to be self contained.</i>

346
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,876
Well it's what analyses a subject's
current physiological status

347
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:08,907
and feeds back into the DNA manipulator.

348
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,677
We should be able to bring it back with us

349
00:22:10,837 --> 00:22:13,411
and rig it to give us a better idea of
how advanced Khalek really is.

350
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:15,341
That'd be good.

351
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:17,151
Nice work.

352
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:19,483
I'm gonna keep working on the translation.

353
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:26,761
He's out cold, Colonel.

354
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:29,013
I gave him enough sedative
to keep him out for hours.

355
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,662
Can't be too sure.

356
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:32,311
<i>That...</i>

357
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:34,039
should be good.

358
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:44,414
We're pretty sure these red patches indicate areas
of the brain where synaptic activity is maximised.

359
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:46,807
A normal Human brain, you or I say,

360
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:49,139
should show roughly five to ten percent coverage.

361
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:50,627
Me being five, you being ten.

362
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:53,141
So what's it at now? Sixty percent?

363
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:54,991
<i>Sixty-eight, exactly.</i>

364
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:57,444
Daniel says the research theorized that eighty,

365
00:22:57,524 --> 00:23:01,263
possibly ninety percent activity was required
for conscious, willful ascension.

366
00:23:01,384 --> 00:23:02,510
<i>So he's not there yet.</i>

367
00:23:02,873 --> 00:23:05,164
- Well no, but...
- Wait a minute. What's that?

368
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:08,341
<i>That wasn't there a minute ago.</i>

369
00:23:08,462 --> 00:23:09,306
<i>No.</i>

370
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,322
The percentage just jumped to seventy one.

371
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:14,997
Are you saying this guy is
evolving right before our eyes?

372
00:23:16,323 --> 00:23:19,218
- His heartrate's increasing.
- I wonder if that has something to do
with the brain scan device.

373
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,149
- I'm going to administer some more sedative.
- No, no, just a second!

374
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,923
Let me just make sure that there's
no interference with the lines here.

375
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:55,168
I shot him, twice.

376
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:56,899
At point blank range.

377
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:58,789
And he appears to be healing.

378
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:00,979
Very quickly.

379
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:03,051
I should have emptied the clip.

380
00:24:04,217 --> 00:24:06,268
I don't get it, Sir.

381
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:11,133
How can Woolsey not know that keeping
this guy around is a bad idea?

382
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:12,379
He's an ass.

383
00:24:12,781 --> 00:24:16,360
So what? He's risking a
catastrophe, just to embarrass us?

384
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,210
Woolsey's a pretty straight shooter.

385
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,608
I think he really believes
this is gonna be of benefit.

386
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:23,679
Look, we're the ones who've spent the last eight years

387
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:26,373
justifying enormous risk
for the advancements we've made.

388
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:28,928
<i>Fact is, we are recording some incredible data.</i>

389
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,341
Khalek's healing ability, his advanced brain function.

390
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:34,781
That scanner was still operating when
he was using his telekinetic ability

391
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,056
and we've been able to isolate the areas
of the brain he was maximising at the time.

392
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:41,876
See! I think the point is,
is that he has telekinetic abilities

393
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:45,898
and he's continuing to evolve, while
we sit around yammering about it.

394
00:24:45,938 --> 00:24:48,431
All the while, he's getting
closer and closer to ascending.

395
00:25:04,717 --> 00:25:08,657
You should know there are now 50,000 volts
running through that floor, Sir.

396
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,714
And a Tok'ra shield generator barring the door.

397
00:25:11,754 --> 00:25:12,840
It's one way,

398
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:16,097
so we can still fire
bullets in there if we have to.

399
00:25:16,137 --> 00:25:20,640
Finally, Dr Lam believes your abilities can
be controlled with a dopamine inhibitor.

400
00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:23,356
A shunt has been inserted
into the base of your skull

401
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:27,337
and a massive dose will be automatically
injected, should you try anything else.

402
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,034
Thanks for the warning, Richard.

403
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:34,855
Or do you prefer, Dick?

404
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:38,956
<i>No, you didn't tell me your name.</i>

405
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,048
Shame about Major Altman.

406
00:25:41,953 --> 00:25:43,521
He's going to be fine.

407
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:44,848
We'll see.

408
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:48,909
Any further outbursts will not be tolerated.

409
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,429
Whatever you say, Dick.

410
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:04,452
Hey, I heard you guys could use some help.

411
00:26:04,492 --> 00:26:05,892
Yeah, we heard what happened.
How's Major Altman?

412
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,287
He's gonna be OK.

413
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:10,343
The Ascendometer says
Khalek's about 80% there.

414
00:26:10,384 --> 00:26:11,630
Ascendometer?

415
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:12,675
Mitchell

416
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:14,944
Wish I'd thought of it.

417
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:19,527
After Khalek was shot and started to heal,
it shot up another five percent or so.

418
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:20,733
Yeah, we're helping him.

419
00:26:20,973 --> 00:26:23,909
The healing process helped him
to learn another aspect of his advancement.

420
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,780
I'll bet anything,
he wanted to get shot.

421
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:26,664
You think?

422
00:26:26,704 --> 00:26:29,881
Well, according to the research,
the way it works is,

423
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,650
the subject gets the treatment in this machine

424
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:35,309
and certain physiological
changes are made in the brain.

425
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:37,863
Then it takes some time, weeks,
months, to adjust.

426
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:41,462
The individual needs to get used to the changes.
Learn how they work. It's a gradual process.

427
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:42,670
That's what the scans are showing us.

428
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:45,443
Khalek is learning to use the advancements
the latest treatment gave him.

429
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:49,385
Now eventually, with enough physical evolution and
mental control, he will reach a critical stage,

430
00:26:49,425 --> 00:26:52,119
where he will learn to shed his
physical body and exist as energy.

431
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,296
Yeah, I always thought there was a
spiritual component to ascension.

432
00:26:55,736 --> 00:26:57,709
That you had to be a good
person at heart, to do it.

433
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,599
There's certainly one,
when there's an Ancient helping you.

434
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,514
Well, obviously, when the process happens
naturally, there are no rules.

435
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,243
Well, if you can call this naturally.

436
00:27:04,283 --> 00:27:06,897
Still, the Ori prove you don't have
to be moral to ascend.

437
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,103
Who knows, maybe it's...

438
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:11,621
part of a grand cosmic balance.
Good and evil have to coexist on all levels.

439
00:27:11,661 --> 00:27:14,475
Well for now, Khalek is still mortal.

440
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:17,271
I don't think he really wants to die
before he's figured it all out.

441
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:19,764
He's probably been hiding the
full extent of his powers from us.

442
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,941
For all we know, he's mocking us because
he knows we can't really hurt him.

443
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:24,611
What else have you learned?

444
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:25,496
Not much.

445
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:28,994
I don't think this database is going to be
much help anymore. We've been through it twice now.

446
00:27:29,035 --> 00:27:31,085
Well, the reason I came is
because I have an idea.

447
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,026
Based on the data we've collected
from the scans on Khalek's brain,

448
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:39,247
I'm thinking that we can run a simulation on
the DNA machine, to see where it's really going.

449
00:27:39,469 --> 00:27:42,525
To the best of our knowledge, this
has never been done before, right?

450
00:27:42,765 --> 00:27:46,024
Artificially advance a Human being
to ascension using technology

451
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,914
rather than the help of another ascended being.

452
00:27:48,155 --> 00:27:49,281
The log is incomplete.

453
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:52,137
Anubis seems to have been stopped
before he could finish his experiments.

454
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,032
Let's see if it's really
going where we think it is.

455
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:57,283
I mean, at the very least,
maybe get a timeframe.

456
00:28:04,455 --> 00:28:05,863
General.

457
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:11,737
I'm reconsidering the arrangement with the
International Committee that's keeping you here.

458
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:15,134
Then I suggest you start
going through your budget.

459
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:15,857
Because without their support...

460
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:18,774
How can you still be convinced that
this is the right course of action?

461
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:23,920
The scans indicate his advancement has plateaued
at roughly 80% of potential brain activity.

462
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:26,333
That might have something to
do with the dopamine inhibitor.

463
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:28,273
How long are we going to keep this up?

464
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:31,663
Until we find a way to counteract
someone with his abilities, in the field.

465
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:35,482
According to your own account,
the man was able to read your mind.

466
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:37,331
Doesn't that concern you?

467
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:38,798
Gravely.

468
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,042
The fact that there are dozens of Priors
with abilities like his, roaming the galaxy right now,

469
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:47,263
also concerns me. And the committee representing
the free nations of this planet, General.

470
00:28:47,804 --> 00:28:51,544
For the moment, in my opinion,
this situation is under control.

471
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:03,588
Well, I certainly hope that at the point at
which you change your mind isn't too late.

472
00:29:24,077 --> 00:29:25,404
You wanted to see me?

473
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:27,576
I'm pulling the plug.

474
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:31,517
You can notify the committee that
the SGC no longer requires their support.

475
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:32,522
General,

476
00:29:33,263 --> 00:29:35,017
Khalek's condition is stable.

477
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:37,068
You've taken ample security precautions.

478
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:40,445
Every minute we have to study him, record data,

479
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:43,260
the closer we get to a means
of fighting the Priors.

480
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:46,859
Not to mention the possibilities of
solving the mysteries of our own existence.

481
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:51,242
The issues we face can be overwhelming at times. I
can see how someone might lose their perspective.

482
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:52,890
I haven't lost perspective, General.

483
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,986
I recognise the importance of this research.

484
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,158
That's why I'm not gonna let you stand in the way.

485
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:02,737
Ultimately, the decision is mine!

486
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:08,011
I'm having Khalek transferred back to
his stasis pod on 584, immediately.

487
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:12,564
Regardless of the consequences
to this command.

488
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:14,143
Thank you.

489
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,527
Nuts!

490
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:27,613
Just about done.

491
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,210
Each of these sections represents a treatment
on the machine and the result of advancements.

492
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,547
- You said that Khalek has had five treatments?
- Yeah, according to the log.

493
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:44,342
Well this is where he should be now in maturity.

494
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:46,414
Does that mean what I think it means?

495
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:48,384
We need to report this to Landry.

496
00:30:48,988 --> 00:30:52,768
Yeah. There's one more thing
I think you should do first.

497
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:01,815
Just to give you a heads up, we're gonna
keep you attached all the way home.

498
00:31:01,956 --> 00:31:05,655
You try anything, you're gonna be a drooling
idiot in a couple of seconds.

499
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:06,742
Corporal.

500
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:26,422
Continue.

501
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,434
Go ahead.

502
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:40,059
We were just preparing to send Khalek
through, to place him back in stasis.

503
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:43,195
Bad idea. 584 is the last place
we should be taking him right now.

504
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,045
In fact it was probably what he was hoping for.

505
00:31:48,603 --> 00:31:52,262
<i>This is General Landry.
Belay the order! Resecure the prisoner!</i>

506
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:58,069
Back in the seat

507
00:32:00,805 --> 00:32:03,158
Now explain why I just did that.

508
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:07,161
The reason his advancement hasn't plateaued
is not because of the dopamine inhibitor.

509
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,058
<i>He's gone as far as he can.</i>

510
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,532
<i>Now, he may have learned to use
the physical advancements he now has,</i>

511
00:32:16,572 --> 00:32:18,241
but he'll never be able to ascend
in his current state.

512
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:20,735
<i>He needs more treatments on
that machine to make it happen.</i>

513
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:25,077
Keep clear.

514
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:35,069
<i>The one place we can't send him to,
is the lab on 584.</i>

515
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:36,718
<i>I bet he's been waiting for us to try.</i>

516
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:40,276
This is Mitchell. Tell General
Landry, the prisoner is secure.

517
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:19,639
Seems things are no longer in control, Dick!

518
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:31,870
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just help me up.

519
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:34,323
No you're not. You have a
concussion. You need to stay put!

520
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:36,272
Look, my head can wait.

521
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:39,629
We just finished securing him.
He went nuts and killed two S.S.

522
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:41,962
You think he could have heard us?

523
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:43,410
Head off to the Gateroom.

524
00:33:44,353 --> 00:33:46,042
Gateroom!

525
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:52,396
Go! Go!

526
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,602
Levels 12 through 28 are now secure.

527
00:34:08,704 --> 00:34:11,922
Full emergency contingent is
in position and on high alert.

528
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:16,747
There!

529
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,538
Target is on level 21.

530
00:34:22,578 --> 00:34:24,268
Hallway B. Heading north!

531
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:04,459
Security systems down!
We've gone to auxillary power.

532
00:35:04,499 --> 00:35:05,787
Damn!

533
00:35:57,919 --> 00:35:59,370
He went that way.

534
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,743
Medical team to level 24.
Hallway D!

535
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:08,499
Meet me at the Gate we'll call this in.

536
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,590
Khalek just went down emergency exit tube 3!

537
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:50,360
Get those doors open!

538
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:51,204
I'm trying Sir!

539
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:53,576
Controls are not working!
They're sealed shut!

540
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,420
Halt the dialling program!

541
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:21,867
I can't, Sir!

542
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,722
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

543
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:02,583
He's locked us out of the system.

544
00:38:02,623 --> 00:38:04,352
Iris control is still down, too.

545
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,159
<i>Incoming wormhole.</i>

546
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:15,972
Cutting auxillary power
to the blast doors!

547
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:20,396
<i>Cameron! The electronic locks are down.
You should be able to prise the doors open.</i>

548
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:23,854
Yeah! That's easy for you to say!

549
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:28,720
What took you so long?

550
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:41,789
Iris will not close!

551
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:09,776
Nice shot!

552
00:39:38,304 --> 00:39:41,324
I rigged the call forwarding device on 584,
to dial back here.

553
00:39:41,364 --> 00:39:42,431
And you didn't tell me?

554
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:44,482
We were going to Sir,
but we didn't get a chance.

555
00:39:44,521 --> 00:39:46,210
It's a good thing too,
he would have heard us.

556
00:39:46,975 --> 00:39:51,840
Medical team to level 28!
Base is secure!

557
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,347
Doctor Jackson! I just wanted you to know.

558
00:40:14,087 --> 00:40:15,897
The men who died?

559
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:20,083
I'm going to see to it personally that
their families are well taken care of.

560
00:40:20,623 --> 00:40:23,479
Look, for what it's worth,

561
00:40:24,546 --> 00:40:26,194
I understand how you felt

562
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,790
and why you took the position you did.

563
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:32,208
It almost sounds like
you might find it in yourself

564
00:40:32,751 --> 00:40:33,957
to forgive me.

565
00:40:34,962 --> 00:40:36,329
No.

566
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:42,762
That doesn't mean we don't
all want what you're looking for

567
00:40:42,803 --> 00:40:44,673
and the answers are still out there.

568
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:47,828
And you were right about the risks.

569
00:40:56,515 --> 00:40:59,571
Believe me. I wish I'd been wrong.

570
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:09,926
Me too.
