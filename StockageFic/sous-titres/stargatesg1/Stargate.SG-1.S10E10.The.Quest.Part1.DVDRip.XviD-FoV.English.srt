1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,903
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,132
<i>TEAL 'C: According to those</i>
<i>who witnessed the battle,</i>

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,267
<i>the enemy is led by a young woman</i>
<i>of extraordinary powers.</i>

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,771
You want Merlin's weapon for yourselves.

5
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:19,147
A weapon capable of destroying
not only the Ori, but the Ancients as well.

6
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:23,848
I did find one reference in that library
that might prove to be useful, Atlantis.

7
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,949
You think the location of Merlin's weapon
is hidden in their database?

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,527
I think it's worth checking out.

9
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,323
We're looking for the names
of two planets

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,921
known on Earth in ancient times
in the dialect of Old English

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,831
as Castiana and Sahal. Satisfied?

12
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:39,166
Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor.

13
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,108
Hey, Jackson, what are you doing?

14
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,647
Oh, just trying to figure out
the location of Merlin's weapon,

15
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:54,379
so we can find it in time to defeat the Ori,
hopefully save our galaxy. You?

16
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,647
We're going for Szechwan.
You want to come?

17
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:56,722
No, I'll pass.

18
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,218
How is your search coming,
Daniel Jackson?

19
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:04,126
Slowly, but I think I'm onto something.
Here, take a look at this.

20
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,998
These are the locations of the planets
that Arthur and his knights set off to

21
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:16,633
in their quest for the Sangraal,
Castiana, Sahal and Vagon Brei.

22
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,711
Now, we searched all three
and came up empty,

23
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,179
so I thought it was a dead end,
until I noticed this.

24
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,810
Their coordinates form
an equilateral triangle.

25
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,549
Now, add their departure point,
the Camelot planet, and you get

26
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,192
a tetrahedron.

27
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,354
A perfect pyramid.

28
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:38,988
Well, that's a hell of a coincidence.

29
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,035
Exactly, and it means something.
I'm just not sure what.

30
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,738
(VALA PANTING)

31
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,974
I have the answer. I've figured it out.

32
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:01,346
- Those three planets are part of a puzzle.
- This much I already know.

33
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,981
The pyramid is a visual representation
of "three into one."

34
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,149
Three addresses into one.

35
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,624
That's what Morgan
was trying to tell you,

36
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,820
that the Sangraal is located on a planet

37
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,126
the address of which is made up of
symbols from each of those three worlds,

38
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:18,000
Castiana, Sahal, Vagon Brei.
It just came to me in a dream.

39
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,345
Okay, this program will cross-reference
the addresses in the database

40
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,472
with those of Castiana,
Sahal and Vagon Brei,

41
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,913
searching out planetary designations

42
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,679
made up of symbols
from all three addresses.

43
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,123
Given the number of symbols and
the amount of addresses in the database,

44
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,988
we could be looking at dozens,
maybe hundreds, of permutations.

45
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,488
(SIGHS)

46
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,326
(BEEPING)

47
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,230
Or maybe just the one.

48
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,412
JACKSON: The culture and
level of technology looks similar

49
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,486
to what we found on the Camelot planet.

50
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,647
MITCHELL: Yeah, I'm going to assume
that's a good thing.

51
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,625
I think some of these folks have
figured out we're not from around here.

52
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,956
Excuse me?

53
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,690
I was wondering
if we could get some help.

54
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,127
A little information?

55
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,532
We've come in search of the Sangraal.

56
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,769
It's a red thing, about yea big.

57
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,602
We know what the Sangraal looks like.

58
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,199
It's been many generations
since anyone has come in search of it,

59
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,779
and now you're the second group
of adventurers in less than a week

60
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,939
to take up the quest.

61
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,142
The second group?

62
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,015
A number of Jaffa passed through here
three days ago.

63
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,782
Were they accompanied by anyone?

64
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:54,053
Yes. They were led by a man who clearly
commanded their fear and respect.

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,354
Ba'al has been here.

66
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,258
And he's got a three-day head start on us.

67
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,126
If you truly seek the Sangraal,

68
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,531
you must consult with the
<i>Parchment of Virtues</i> in the village library.

69
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,502
It will prepare you for the journey to come.

70
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,597
Over there? Thank you.

71
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,368
But I should warn you,

72
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,742
no one has ever returned
from the quest alive.

73
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,112
If you value your lives,
you would do well to reconsider.

74
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:22,210
We appreciate that,
but that is quitter talk.

75
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,964
Hello!

76
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,629
Right, <i>Parchment of Virtues.</i>

77
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,728
Do we look under "P" for "parchment"
or "V" for "virtues"?

78
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,808
I'd say look for any and all materials
related to the Sangraal.

79
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,640
Or you could simply ask me.

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,611
I am Osric, keeper of the village archives.

81
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,949
Hi. We're looking for something called
the <i>Parchment of Virtues.</i>

82
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:59,957
Another band of stalwart heroes
come to tempt fate

83
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,688
in the hopes of claiming
the legendary prize.

84
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,892
- What do you know of the Sangraal?
- Only what I have heard from legend.

85
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,960
That it is located in a cave
beyond the outlying forest,

86
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,701
but that the journey there
is fraught with peril.

87
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:25,240
Ages ago, Morgan Le Fay
enchanted the area with a terrible curse.

88
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,685
Since then, it has claimed countless lives.

89
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,624
Well, we don't put much stock in curses.

90
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,823
Yeah, well, neither did Phaedra,
the cobbler's wife.

91
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,162
Several weeks ago,
she set off in search of her son

92
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,998
who had strayed too far from the village.

93
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:49,234
Neither have been seen nor heard
from since.

94
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:53,574
This parchment was purportedly
left behind by Morgan herself

95
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,944
as a guide for knights of noble spirit,

96
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:02,783
since it is said that only the most virtuous
will succeed in claiming the Sangraal.

97
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,417
"Only those of virtue true
may win the prize concealed.

98
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,790
"Beyond the reach
of the flawed and tainted,

99
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:13,389
"the Sangraal shall instead belong to he
who speaks the guardian's name."

100
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,761
The guardian's name?

101
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:20,066
They say that the Sangraal is protected
by the most powerful of magical beasts.

102
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,765
A dragon.

103
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,175
Dragon?

104
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,575
You doubt the legend?

105
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,671
Well, I'm sure the Sangraal is protected
by something very powerful,

106
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,410
but I don't think it's an actual dragon.

107
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,281
OSRIC: (SCOFFING)
Believe what you will.

108
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:38,221
With luck, you may have the opportunity
to prove the truth for yourselves.

109
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:43,023
"Prudence, wisdom, charity,
kindness and faith.

110
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,257
"Let these be your guide
on this perilous quest."

111
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,833
Well, I'm sorry, but I think we're going to
need a little bit more than that to go on.

112
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:56,841
No, all Morgan left behind
was this parchment

113
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,003
and the map.

114
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,808
- There's a map?
- Yes.

115
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,884
- May we see it?
- No.

116
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,043
Why not?

117
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,916
I showed it to the last group
of adventurers

118
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,955
who came in search of the Sangraal,

119
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,083
and they rewarded my trust
by trying to take it.

120
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:18,425
Yeah, we know the guy
that runs that operation.

121
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,527
We're not like him.

122
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:24,125
Well, I'm sorry.
It's not for public view.

123
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:28,298
Hey! We wouldn't dream
of trying to steal it.

124
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,832
(OSRIC CHUCKLES)

125
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:30,042
- We have to steal it.
- We are not stealing the map.

126
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,909
- We have to steal it.
- We are not stealing the map.

127
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,503
Nightfall, sneak in
under cover of darkness.

128
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,709
Maybe I can just talk to Osric and
convince him that our cause is virtuous.

129
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,445
That's brilliant,
and while you're distracting him,

130
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,781
the rest of us can steal it.

131
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,686
For the last time, we are not...

132
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,315
Are you certain I cannot tempt you
with a final meal?

133
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,793
What is it with this town
and the "no-can-do" attitude?

134
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,663
Every time we turn around, someone's
trying to write us off or scare us away.

135
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:59,704
I apologize. I should have said, "A final
meal before you set off on your journey."

136
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,773
Well, that's better.

137
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,638
Although, it need be said,
in the many thousands of years

138
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,874
that adventurers have been seeking
the Sangraal, not one has succeeded.

139
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,178
(PEOPLE CLAMORING OUTSIDE)

140
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,593
What is this? What do you want here?

141
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,347
We are soldiers of the Ori,

142
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,907
and we have taken this village
as part of their holy crusade

143
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,011
to rid this galaxy of evil.

144
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,717
Cooperate, and you won't be harmed.

145
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,525
Go through the buildings.
Bring everyone out.

146
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,064
Who are these men?

147
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,607
Well, that is a long story.

148
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,709
Look, I know you have no reason to trust
us any more than you do those guys...

149
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,717
I have not seen you shoot anyone.

150
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,548
That's an excellent point.

151
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,814
We're going to need your help.

152
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,633
They've got a dozen men
guarding the gate,

153
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,570
another 50 or so in and around the village.

154
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,166
- Is that what I think it is?
- The contents of the library.

155
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,412
You have spent your time
ignorant to the truth,

156
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:02,551
stumbling aimlessly through the darkness
cast upon your world

157
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,460
by the trappings of the past,

158
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:10,433
but now, the path to fulfillment
stands revealed,

159
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:15,803
and the time has come
to embrace a new faith.

160
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:27,044
Let the light of Origin show you the way.

161
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,571
You've encountered them before.

162
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,774
Many times and on many different worlds.

163
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,443
And how did the inhabitants
of those other worlds resist them?

164
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,577
They didn't.

165
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,450
They either surrendered
or they were slaughtered.

166
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,423
What are you saying, there's nothing
we can do? We are doomed?

167
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,890
No, no, not necessarily.

168
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,291
We believe they can be defeated.
That's why we're here.

169
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,761
We think that's why they're here as well,

170
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,300
to destroy the one thing
capable of stopping them.

171
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,368
The Sangraal.

172
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:17,999
(BANGING ON DOOR)

173
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,908
OSRIC: Please, I know they're here.
Please...

174
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,211
I must speak with you.
The soldiers are looking for me.

175
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,307
Why?

176
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,751
Because they believe
I can lead them to the Sangraal.

177
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,618
- Can you?
- Well, of course!

178
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,089
What... You saved the map?

179
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,457
No, they unwittingly burned it
with the rest of the village archives,

180
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,360
but a copy still exists.

181
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,591
Where?

182
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,626
Here.

183
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,431
I will lead you to Merlin's treasure.

184
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,664
(BANGING ON DOOR)

185
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,977
We want the old man.
He has information we seek.

186
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,086
Not today, fellows.

187
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,421
Wow, this is awkward.

188
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,494
Our army has taken this village.

189
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:19,291
If you resist, there will be no escape.

190
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:23,357
Now, stand aside.

191
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,642
Oh, I think somebody
must have heard that.

192
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,050
This way. Come quickly.

193
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,930
You should come with us.

194
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:04,772
My place is here. I'll be fine.
I'll blame everything on you.

195
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,511
Good plan.

196
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,557
This way.

197
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,473
What the hell?

198
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,752
(BEEPING)

199
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,534
What's the matter with them?

200
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:07,732
I don't know. I'm picking up
varying anomalous readings.

201
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,074
Stronger here. Weaker here.

202
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,168
Stronger here. Weaker here.

203
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,943
And then rising again.

204
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,444
Well, this is weird.
They're temporal fluctuations.

205
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,577
Meaning?

206
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,885
Meaning these people are trapped
in a time distortion field.

207
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,390
Are you sure?

208
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,587
If it's a time distortion field,
why are the leaves moving in the trees?

209
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,655
CARTER: It could be an illusion designed to
reproduce the standing weather pattern.

210
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:40,897
These readings indicate the time
within the field is extremely decelerated.

211
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,704
I mean, these people may look like
they're standing perfectly still,

212
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,677
but, in fact, they're moving,
imperceptibly slowly.

213
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,771
Are they aware
of what is happening to them?

214
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,543
Doubtful.

215
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,880
Several years may pass
on our side of the field

216
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,477
in the one or two seconds
it takes them to take even one step.

217
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,351
Why don't we just go around it?

218
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,518
Well, the outer edge of the field extends
as far as I can tell in either direction,

219
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,890
and it has a slight curve to it.

220
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,987
I mean, for all I know,
it could form a complete circle.

221
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,658
We could walk for miles
and never find a way through.

222
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:12,066
Sam, if you've got another idea,
I'd love to hear it.

223
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,966
Well, I'm definitely picking up
varied readings. It's almost as if...

224
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,410
I think I may have found a way in.

225
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,785
There's a circuitous path of real time
winding through the temporal field.

226
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,616
- It's a maze.
- Yeah.

227
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,747
It's a maze.

228
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,690
These readings are unmistakable.
I can use them to guide us through.

229
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,283
Follow my lead.

230
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:40,491
If you stray off the path, you could
wind up trapped in the distortion field.

231
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,098
(BEEPING STOPS)

232
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,040
- Uh-oh.
- What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?

233
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,339
"Uh-oh," you left your stove on, right?

234
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:32,884
The temporal distortions
are affecting these readings. We're blind.

235
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,123
MITCHELL: Okay, here's a stupid question.

236
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,169
You did check the batteries in that thing
before you left Stargate Command, right?

237
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,295
It's not the batteries.

238
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,034
We could just retrace our steps
and try our luck with the Ori soldiers.

239
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,110
Do you know the way back?

240
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,814
That way.

241
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,508
We have to be exact.

242
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,175
Any deviation from the path of real time,

243
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,345
and we could wind up frozen
like the rest of these people.

244
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:13,186
If Morgan Le Fay left clues
as to the whereabouts of the Sangraal,

245
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,554
then it is safe to assume

246
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,151
that she believed
that someone would eventually reach it.

247
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:21,892
It also stands to reason that our task,
though challenging, is far from impossible.

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,663
Teal'c's right. She set this trap
to weed out those she deemed unworthy.

249
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:30,936
There is a way out. We just have to be
resourceful and carefully think it through.

250
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:36,605
Well, Arthur and his knights wouldn't have
had access to this advanced technology

251
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,080
to guide them through,

252
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:42,381
so, presumably,
the answer could be deceptively simple.

253
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,858
Follow me.

254
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,412
Dead end.

255
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,117
You're right. Deceptively simple.

256
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,927
All right, we're through.

257
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,028
We'd better pick up the pace
if we want to cut into Ba'al's lead.

258
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,078
OSRIC: You say that these Ori
are possessed of god-like abilities,

259
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,273
OSRIC: You say that these Ori
are possessed of god-like abilities,

260
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,904
and yet they are not gods?

261
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,643
JACKSON: No, they're very powerful beings
who would have their followers

262
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,845
believe as much
because faith is the source of their power.

263
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,550
Faith is something that cannot be won
through intimidation and fear.

264
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:30,116
If their followers have faith,
then they must truly believe.

265
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,288
No, they only believe
because they've been misled.

266
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,093
You see, to many
less-developed civilizations,

267
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,660
certain advanced technologies would
strike them as supernatural in nature.

268
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:44,498
Merlin wasn't a wizard,
and Morgan Le Fay was not a sorceress.

269
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,373
- Ridiculous.
- They simply used their advanced abilities

270
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,743
to fashion seemingly magical creations,
like the Sangraal,

271
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,782
or that time dilation field we encountered.

272
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,180
So you would have me believe that

273
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,550
you are possessed of a complete
understanding of these amazing feats?

274
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,818
No, but just because I don't know how
the trick is done doesn't make it magic.

275
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,793
And I would argue that your inability
to comprehend such feats

276
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,420
does, in fact,
prove their supernatural nature.

277
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:10,991
Their army just ran roughshod
over your village, forced you into hiding,

278
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,094
- now you're defending them?
- Hardly.

279
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,605
I condemn the actions of their soldiers,

280
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:20,474
but I'm in no position to judge the Ori
or their message. Not yet.

281
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:27,211
Truth is elusive to those
who refuse to see with both eyes.

282
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,650
What?

283
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,778
(MALE VOICE
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

284
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,559
BA'AL: I don't believe they abandoned me.
They're going to pay.

285
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,194
All of them are going to pay.

286
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,201
Wait!

287
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:53,669
(SIGHS)

288
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:58,077
Well, make yourselves comfortable.
We're going to be here a while.

289
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:10,120
It won't do you any good.
Believe me, I've tried. It's a one-way door.

290
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,525
How long have you been trapped in here?

291
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,497
Three agonizingly tedious days.

292
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,726
Which reminds me,
I don't suppose you have any food?

293
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,769
What's that?

294
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,201
That's bait.

295
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,832
When I approached to investigate,
I unwittingly triggered the trap.

296
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,466
CARTER: You've had the Ancient database
for months.

297
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,442
Why did it take you so long to get here?

298
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,106
I can't think clearly on an empty stomach.

299
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:42,919
(CHUCKLES)

300
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:49,159
I only possessed two of the three
addresses needed to complete the puzzle.

301
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:54,000
As a result, I had significantly
more possibilities to investigate.

302
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:59,102
By a process of elimination,
I was left with one prospect,

303
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,703
and when I went in search of the planet,
it wasn't there.

304
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,544
What do you mean it wasn't there?

305
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,949
It wasn't where it was supposed to be.

306
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,353
I calculated its position, I sent my ships
to its approximate location,

307
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,357
but they couldn't find it.

308
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,917
In the end, my only recourse
was to access it via the stargate

309
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,520
and secure the device
with a handful of my Jaffa,

310
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:25,126
and when I became trapped in here, they
set off in search of a means of freeing me.

311
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,201
They have yet to return.

312
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,807
Something must have come up.

313
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,472
Obviously, Morgan must have rendered
this planet inaccessible to ships

314
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,574
to ensure that enemies such as the Ori
could not destroy the Sangraal from orbit.

315
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,152
You're wasting your time.

316
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,348
I've had three days to search for a way out
of here. There's nothing inside.

317
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,425
Well, that's the point, isn't it?

318
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,991
The <i>Parchment of Virtues</i> told us
that we'd have to rely on five things

319
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,997
in order to reach the Sangraal.

320
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,590
Prudence, wisdom, charity,
kindness and faith.

321
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,226
You're saying the parchment
was intended to be interpreted literally?

322
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,565
Why not?

323
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,203
We were able to make our way
through the time dilation field

324
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,935
by patiently and carefully
negotiating the maze.

325
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,035
In other words, we demonstrated
prudence, as opposed to recklessness,

326
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,909
which would have stranded us.

327
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,813
So ask yourselves,
"What does this trap exploit?"

328
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,386
- Curiosity.
- Greed.

329
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,282
A person approaches a chest
expecting to find treasure inside,

330
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,019
but instead finds nothing
and gets trapped for his trouble.

331
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,790
So in order to reverse the trap,
you have to reverse the impetus.

332
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,229
Right. The opposite of greed is charity,

333
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,630
one of the virtues mentioned
in the parchment.

334
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:33,761
Instead of taking something,
something must be sacrificed.

335
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,493
(CHUCKLES) Well,
that was an interesting theory.

336
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:59,496
Well, we're all trapped,
so we all have to contribute something.

337
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,284
No, wait!

338
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,188
(CLEARS THROAT)

339
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,502
I have nothing to donate.

340
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:58,217
That particular item
holds great sentimental value.

341
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,769
Well done. Another day in there,
I would have gone mad.

342
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,275
Guess that makes it time to say goodbye.

343
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,239
- It would be foolish of you to kill me.
- How so?

344
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,646
Amongst the information I obtained
regarding the Sangraal

345
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,581
is the name of the protector.

346
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,553
- Protector?
- The dragon.

347
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,850
You see? I told you there was a dragon.

348
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,793
I'm sure there's something
guarding the device.

349
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,193
Maybe it's a hologram.

350
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,787
Holograms can be dangerous, you know.

351
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,459
It could be a ship.
Flies, breathes fire, has armored skin.

352
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,230
It's a mistake a medieval storyteller
could easily make.

353
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,135
Then if it's based on technology,

354
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,675
the name is no doubt a password
or a command code.

355
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,576
Either way, if you want it,
you'll have to take me with you.

356
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:04,614
You know, I hate to say this,
but he could prove useful.

357
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,436
MITCHELL: Come on.

358
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,574
Yet again, we find ourselves
the unlikeliest of allies

359
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,544
joined together in common purpose.

360
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,707
You know, the word "allies" implies
some sort of partnership,

361
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,044
and that just isn't the case here.

362
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:38,145
You see, we are going after the Sangraal,
while you are tagging along for the ride.

363
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:44,653
According to the map,
the Sangraal is hidden in a cave

364
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,027
beneath a lone mountain.

365
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,123
Right. We're getting warm.

366
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,998
This is it. The cave entrance.

367
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,374
The Sangraal is located within.

368
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,539
It's too bad you won't be coming with us.

369
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,947
I thought I made it clear. You need me.

370
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,020
I wasn't talking to you.

371
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,985
Well, allow me to get out
of your line of fire.

372
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,789
Have you lost your senses?

373
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,024
"Truth eludes he who does not seek it
with both eyes wide."

374
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:25,899
It's a quote from the <i>Book of Origin.</i>
You paraphrased it earlier today.

375
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:30,407
Now, I might not have noticed, but I spent
the past year studying the good book, so...

376
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:34,569
Surely, you're not basing your suspicions
on this mere coincidence?

377
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,840
And when it came time to give up
a possession to free ourselves

378
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,381
from the force field trap,

379
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,848
I noticed the designs on your ring,

380
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:43,751
not Celtic as one might expect given
the cultural background of this planet,

381
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,880
but distinctly Ori.

382
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,959
The ring was a gift
from a traveling merchant.

383
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,288
You're making a mistake.

384
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,523
You're the one who screwed up.
Now drop the act.

385
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,537
It would have been so much easier
if you had remained oblivious.

386
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,537
But now, things will be
much more difficult.

387
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,388
Especially for you.

388
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,632
You're doing something new
with your eyes.

389
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,543
So the troops in the village,
the shoot-out in the tavern,

390
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,703
that was all a set-up.

391
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,440
More than you know.

392
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:47,609
I grew impatient waiting for you
to discover the location of the weapon,

393
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,653
so I gave you a little help.

394
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,587
The dream I had, "three into one."
That was you?

395
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,056
- Yes.
- So you planted the solution in Vala

396
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,422
knowing it would lead us right to you.

397
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,496
Apparently, Morgan put safeguards
in place

398
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,087
to ensure the weapon
could only be secured by...

399
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:05,170
What was the term again?
"Those possessing truth of spirit."

400
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:05,795
What was the term again?
"Those possessing truth of spirit."

401
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,533
I can't think of anyone more appropriate
than a former Ascended.

402
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,077
With your help, I'll secure the device.

403
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,008
Hate to disappoint.

404
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,783
You've seen a demonstration
of my powers.

405
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,688
You know what I'm capable of.

406
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,522
So I'm offering you a choice,

407
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,960
either we work together
to reach the device,

408
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,090
or I'll start killing off members
of your team.

409
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,005
- Starting with her.
- All right!

410
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,140
We'll work together.

411
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,513
For now.

412
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,253
ADRIA: We thwarted all efforts against us,
crippled your fleet,

413
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,488
met with little, if any resistance,
on the worlds that we redeemed.

414
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,724
Opposition to the Ori is clearly hopeless,

415
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,528
but you continue to struggle
against the inevitable.

416
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,229
JACKSON: Yeah, well, what can I tell you?
We're optimists.

417
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,067
Your only hope lies with Merlin's weapon.

418
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,836
Once I take that away from you,
your defeat will be complete.

419
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,467
Now look who's the optimist.

420
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,739
You disappoint me, Mother.

421
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:26,408
I would have expected you to see reason
by now, but it doesn't matter.

422
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:29,884
Eventually, you'll have no choice
but to accept the truth.

423
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:34,925
And when you do, I'll accompany you
on your path to enlightenment.

424
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,589
You know, the second we find that thing,
she's going to kill us.

425
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,327
- Not if we kill her first.
- That could be a bit of a problem.

426
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,960
I don't know, we're pretty resourceful.
I'm sure we'll think of something.

427
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,164
Yeah? Just don't do it too soon.

428
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,969
She may not be true of spirit
and all that jazz,

429
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,703
but she has done her homework.
I hate to say it, but...

430
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,507
- She could prove useful.
- For the moment.

It's a riddle. I'm good at these.

433
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:19,800
"The way that is just and true."
Just and true...

434
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,472
It's telling us to go that way.

435
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:30,013
"The way that is just and true,"
that is, the "right" way.

436
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,609
What...

437
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,809
- The writing's in Ancient.
- So?

438
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,943
So in Ancient, the word meaning
"Just and true" is very different

439
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:39,148
from the word meaning "right,"
as in, "opposite of left."

- Or quite possibly a test.

ADRIA: We're walking right into a trap.
JACKSON: No, we're not.

451
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,228
The parchment provided us with clues
to reaching the Sangraal.

452
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,032
It mentioned kindness as one
of the virtues that would guide us.

453
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,697
So if we show kindness
by helping this child,

454
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,707
it should bring us one step closer
to the device.

455
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,333
The parchment also mentioned wisdom,

456
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:36,311
which we would be demonstrating
by avoiding this trap.

502
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,383
There's no hidden triggers
or secret passages.

503
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,824
If there's a way through, we didn't find it.

504
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,486
Then I suppose we should head back.

505
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,628
Not an option.

506
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,831
The passageways have re-sealed
behind us.

507
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,073
Then I was right. We walked into a trap.

508
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:27,110
No. We made all the right choices
to lead us to this point.

509
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,645
I know the Sangraal lies
beyond that wall of fire.

510
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,580
We just have to find a way through.

511
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,579
Why don't you do something?

512
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:40,487
You're the Orici. You're supposedly
possessed of significant powers.

513
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,718
So snuff out the flame
and get us on our way.

514
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,728
My abilities don't work that way.

515
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,967
Of course. How does the saying go?
All flash, no photo.

516
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:54,037
Actually, it's "All flash, no substance."

517
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,003
I prefer my version.

518
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,633
Would you care for a demonstration?

519
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,515
Taking your life would be
a waste of my time.

520
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,318
Which I suppose would be put
to better use complaining.

521
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,394
Oh, jeez, why don't you two
just get a room?

522
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,896
It's the only one left.

523
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,631
Daniel?

524
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,433
The parchment told us
that five virtues would guide us

525
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,170
in our quest for the Sangraal.

526
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,679
Prudence, kindness, charity,
wisdom and faith.

527
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,548
Now, we displayed prudence
in finding a way out of the temporal maze,

528
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,621
charity, in escaping the force field trap,

529
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,156
kindness, by helping the child
and finding the hidden passageway,

530
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,227
and wisdom, in solving the riddles.

531
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,762
The only virtue left is faith.

532
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,330
- Daniel!
- Jackson!

533
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:12,015
Well, after you, Muscles.

534
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,767
There it is. We've found it.
Ours for the taking.

535
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,134
Hang on.

536
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,610
Yeah, that's pretty deep.

537
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,152
- I'll go.
- We'll both go.

538
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:53,712
I think I'll stay here
and support you from a distance.

539
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:54,813
We should all go.

540
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:59,521
No, only Daniel and I will go.
The rest of you will stay.

541
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,120
It's all right.

542
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,861
Take it.

543
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,065
- After you.
- I told you.

544
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,965
Morgan put safeguards in place to ensure

545
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,470
that someone such as myself
couldn't claim the device.

546
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,835
Is that why you didn't just use
your powers from back there?

547
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:48,934
What are you talking about?

548
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,981
Well, you have telekinetic abilities.
I've seen you use them.

549
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,880
You should have just snatched
the Sangraal off the dais

550
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,977
without taking a step, but you didn't.

551
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:01,387
Probably for the same reason you didn't
use your powers to lift the portcullis

552
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,655
or kill Ba'al the second
he stepped out of line.

553
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,855
- You can't.
- Of course I can.

554
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,626
No. My guess is Morgan
did put safeguards in place,

555
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:13,726
and that those safeguards
are neutralizing your Ori-given powers.

556
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,102
You saw me withstand
the bullets fired against me.

557
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,675
Yeah, thanks to your personal shield.

558
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,711
The only powers you can manifest
originate from that pendant,

559
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,679
and they're purely defensive in nature.

560
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,817
Do you really want to test me?

561
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,982
Yep.

562
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:42,055
You know what?
I changed my mind about helping you.

563
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,529
Knock yourself out.

564
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,270
What's the holdup?

565
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,541
Thought so.

566
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:05,786
Well, I guess I'm not as true of spirit
as you thought I was.

567
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,982
(RUMBLING)

568
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,487
Jackson, move it!

569
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,139
What the hell is that?

570
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,479
We agreed there's no such thing
as a dragon, right?

571
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:31,878
Yeah.

572
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,583
(WINGS FLAPPING)

573
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,231
(SCREECHING)

574
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,800
Because that looks pretty real to me.
