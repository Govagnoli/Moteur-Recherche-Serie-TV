1
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:33,758
To be on a show for seven years,
you're blessed, first of all.

2
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:36,645
To do anything for seven years, you know,

3
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:42,199
to have that sort of relationship
with a group of people

4
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:46,963
that are as great as this group of people,
it's so fortunate.

5
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,845
To be on a show like Stargate

6
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:54,762
that's really kept its level of commitment
to turning out a good product,

7
00:00:54,847 --> 00:01:02,162
but also to having fun and laughing
in the work environment every day,

8
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:04,841
is just phenomenal.

9
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:07,487
As we go through the seventh year,

10
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:12,595
we laugh even harder
and have more fun than we ever have.

11
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:16,396
So it's been a very unique experience.

12
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:47,041
Do not hold back.
You will only anger me further.

13
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:52,281
Well, the relationships
that we have between the cast...

14
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:56,724
Basically we're one
great, big, dysfunctional family.

15
00:01:56,807 --> 00:02:01,835
We've all kinda learned
each other's isms and quirks,

16
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:07,524
and have found that, rather than
trying to make each other feel better,

17
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:10,360
that it's much better
just to laugh at each other.

18
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:14,326
Will someone tell Rick
he's not really dead? He can move now.

19
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:15,999
He's a Method guy.

20
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:23,926
That's how we make it through each day,
with Rick and his love of irreverence.

21
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:29,320
Rick and I actually didn't really
speak to each other for two years.

22
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:31,398
We're both very alpha male.

23
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:35,480
And then when Rick's child was born

24
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:40,641
I can remember being in the circus
and we were talking about it

25
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:46,324
and I related to him my own experiences
with the birth of my children,

26
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:51,003
and by the end of it
we were both crying like babies.

27
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:56,400
And that was really
the genesis of our true friendship.

28
00:02:56,487 --> 00:03:01,356
It took it out of the workplace
and we actually became friends.

29
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:07,716
And Michael Shanks and I, we've had
this bond from the very beginning.

30
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:14,838
The cat is the most "cassionate" -
that means he's passionate, but for cash.

31
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:17,236
That makes you "cassionate".

32
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:21,161
No, this dude can see
the good side of anything,

33
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:23,715
can see the positive side of anything,

34
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:28,483
as long as it doesn't involve him because
he needs to be angry about something.

35
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:34,517
We got into some really entertaining
shouting matches early on.

36
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:38,316
Through the years we've come
to know each other extremely well

37
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:43,197
and he's just one of
my best friends, really.

38
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:49,086
Amanda Tapping, she really lives her life
through her character, actually.

39
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:53,479
- He thinks he knows how to act.
- No theatre. Real actors make no money.

40
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,956
You can cut that part, right?

41
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:03,322
No, Amanda's like everybody's sister.
She's just a joy to be around every day.

42
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:10,722
She's always making sure that everyone's
OK, doing well, everything's fine at home.

43
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:17,565
She just takes it upon herself to make
sure that everything is smooth every day,

44
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:20,400
and that's invaluable.

45
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:23,365
Don Davis is nuts.

46
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:30,603
He's crazy, but he's also one of the most
kind-hearted, gentle souls I've ever met.

47
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,326
But, you know, it's everybody on the cast.

48
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,400
We are truly just a big, happy family.

49
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:45,644
We know each other's kids, parents,
wives, husbands, boyfriends, whatever.

50
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:48,560
That just makes it one big, cohesive unit.

51
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:54,643
Cos we spend more time with each other
than with our significant others at home.

52
00:04:54,727 --> 00:05:00,040
And that's another reason that
the seven years have been so remarkable,

53
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:07,124
because of the general happiness that is
pervasive through the set on a daily basis.

54
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,038
Join me beyond the gate.

55
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:11,846
Join me beyond the gate.

56
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:15,283
Join me beyond... the gate.

57
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:26,841
I have this sickness,
this terminal sickness, called golf.

58
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:34,356
And a lot of the crew plays,
a lot of our producers play.

59
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:39,919
If there's been a big tournament on
at the weekend,

60
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,761
all filming will stop till we talk about
all the good shots and bad shots,

61
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:45,644
who did what and da-da-da,

62
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:51,040
then talk about each other's rounds and
how everybody played on the weekend.

63
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:55,245
It's fun cos there's a lot of
good-natured ribbing that goes on,

64
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,718
and everybody's
true sense of competitiveness...

65
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:04,562
But also you can really see how much
everybody really enjoys each other.

66
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,717
You take a Saturday or Sunday -

67
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:11,005
you're usually through in the morning,
so we can get back to our families -

68
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:15,285
but we take that time and we go
and play golf together and it's a real hoot.

69
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:19,918
But what I really like is taking money
away from the big guys, like Brad.

70
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:21,759
I'm better than Brad.

71
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:25,806
And Coop - I'm better than Coop.
Greenburg - I'm better than Monty. Better.

72
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:29,004
Get in the hole, baby.

73
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:34,081
I hate to say. Maybe this might
cost me my job, I don't know.

74
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:40,402
I am killing this course.
This course has got my name all over it.

75
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:43,445
Cos you have to allow them their ego.

76
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:46,883
I'm in the limelight,
I'm the one that's on TV,

77
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:51,006
so for a little while
I had to just let them beat me for a while.

78
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:55,239
I'm playing with the producers. I'm about
to take the rich guys for some money.

79
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:58,125
I am the worst golfer out there though.

80
00:06:58,207 --> 00:07:01,358
There's none of that one-upmanship,

81
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:05,076
so I just had to smooth everything out
cos that's how I am.

82
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:10,446
I had to make it look like I shanked the
ball a lot, or hit the ball wide left and right.

83
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:12,324
I had to make it look like that,

84
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:15,877
but, little do they know,
I was doing that for their benefit.

85
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:21,360
I suffered the slings and arrows for them
cos that's just what kinda cat I am.

86
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:23,438
I'm off track again.

87
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:31,364
I've actually written for a very long time.

88
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:34,359
Even in the early days
I talked about writing an episode,

89
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:38,076
but it's tough for writers and producers
to take you seriously

90
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:41,637
when you show up for work
late every day for three years.

91
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:49,805
So I think the first step was that I had
to show them that I was serious about it,

92
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:54,324
which meant kinda cleaning up
my entire act

93
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:58,241
and showing them that I was serious
about being here and being around.

94
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:04,323
Brad Wright gave me my first opportunity
to actually write a story for "The Warrior".

95
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:07,001
So I pitched the story
and then wrote the story,

96
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,681
then the teleplay
was given to Peter DeLuise.

97
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:13,442
One of our two most prolific directors.

98
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:17,202
Initially Pete and I
were gonna collaborate on the teleplay

99
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:21,166
and then Pete realised he'd have
to split the teleplay money with me,

100
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,681
so Pete didn't return my calls
until he was done.

101
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:29,285
So I've still got a little thing
with DeLuise over that,

102
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:33,997
but, you know, you got me. You got me.
You made all the money. That's all right.

103
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:39,366
My name was still on the cover.
"Story by", but...

104
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:48,401
So the following year I had actually been
working with Brad on a pitch,

105
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,718
and we were just having a few problems

106
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:57,757
kind of tying all the elements of the story
together to turn into the teleplay.

107
00:08:57,847 --> 00:09:05,162
And I thought of a completely different
story on the way upstairs to his office.

108
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:09,923
I knew that he would
spoon-feed me the script,

109
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:16,003
so after the outline phase, I asked him
if I could just write the script from there.

110
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:24,005
The reason I did that was cos I wanted
a true assessment of my writing abilities.

111
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:26,965
And Brad said "Fine."

112
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:31,802
So I emailed the script to Brad
and I emailed the script to Martin Wood,

113
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:33,957
who was gonna be directing it.

114
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:36,686
Anyway, that story was "The Changeling".

115
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,237
OK, Probie. Get ready to get your feet wet.

116
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:46,562
The genesis of it was "What if Teal'c was
a normal guy? How would that play out?"

117
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:51,038
And that was the seed of the story.

118
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:54,642
I was just so proud
to be part of that process.

119
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:01,000
Everybody outta there/

120
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:12,042
T, get your ass outta there.
That's an order.

121
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:16,955
Agh/

122
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:20,278
- Save yourself.
- I'm getting you out, old man.

123
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,885
Teal'c/

124
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:28,277
- Get a medical team down here, now.
- Yes, ma'am.

125
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:31,723
Then I was allowed to write
another episode, season seven,

126
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:38,883
and got to work with Robert Cooper,
who I also enjoy immensely.

127
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,925
And that was for "Birthright".

128
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:46,444
"Birthright" was the original story
that I had been working with Brad on.

129
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:52,602
And then we were able to get
Jolene Blalock to play the lead,

130
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:57,283
and it really just turned out fantastically.

131
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:06,957
Do not make this mistake.
Moloc will not allow this to continue.

132
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:10,323
- You give me no choice.
- How many warriors have to die?

133
00:11:10,407 --> 00:11:16,403
Our sisters in your care will be returned
safely, or the two of you will be sacrificed.

134
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,478
Kree, sha Mel lak/

135
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:30,159
Maybe I could put pen to paper
for an episode or two if there's a spin-off.

136
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:33,876
That would be a great boon
to my writing career.

137
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:38,002
Fo' shizzle my nizzle.

138
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:50,557
Part of what has really made Stargate so
great over the years is just the absolute...

139
00:11:50,647 --> 00:11:53,923
- Welcome to Stargate.
...crazy support of the fans.

140
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:58,842
It's really heart-warming and we love you,
guys, and thank you so much.

141
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:04,718
But, ladies, you gotta
stop sending me underwear. All right?

142
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:11,360
But really we want to thank you all
for seven great years of love and support.

143
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:14,917
We'll keep puttin' 'em out there.

144
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:17,475
Thanks for watching "Beyond the Gate".

145
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:21,560
We're about to wrap up year seven, so we
are going full speed ahead on year eight.

146
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:25,196
We'll see you then...
Well, we won't really see you,

147
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,721
but you'll see us.

148
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:30,446
Hey! Hey, Bobby.

149
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,916
Janice, what's up, girl? How you doin'?

150
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:35,760
What's up, Lizzie?
What's up, baby? How you doin'?

151
00:12:36,327 --> 00:12:38,124
We'll see you season eight.

152
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,438
ENHOH
