1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:09,314
Teal'c and Bra'tac believe
the way to eliminate all System Lords

2
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:12,158
is to recruit Jaffa into the fifth column.

3
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:17,273
Only when their numbers are sufficient
will it be possible to destroy the Goa'uld.

4
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:21,916
Even then, Baal controls the supersoldier
army, which cannot be turned.

5
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:25,202
So even if the rebel Jaffa
can take out most of the System Lords,

6
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:29,756
there'll still be a massive war to fight.
The problem is, Ishta doesn't want to wait.

7
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:33,474
Moloc continues to order the deaths
of female Jaffa born in his domain,

8
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:36,159
and her railroad to Hak'tyl
can't save them all.

9
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,521
Even now, she's organising a rebellion
to overthrow Moloc.

10
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:45,840
Teal'c and Bra'tac are trying
to convince her to see the bigger picture.

11
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:49,679
- What was my question again?
- Um, "How's it going?"

12
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:52,040
It seemed so innocuous at the time.

13
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,923
Fellas. How was the trip?

14
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:58,634
I have been betrayed
by those I trusted most.

15
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,681
That good, eh?

16
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:03,120
His mood is foul indeed.

17
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:06,038
Greetings. It is good to see you both.

18
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,593
Bra'tac, what's wrong?

19
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:11,643
- There was a complication.
- Ishta?

20
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:17,157
She is well. And as lovely as ever, O'Neill.

21
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:20,396
- The problem, I fear, lies with Rya'c.
- Is he OK?

22
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:23,875
He is in love and plans to be married.

23
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:39,359
So when's all this supposed to happen?

24
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:41,515
Ow!

25
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:46,679
- Three days.
- Three days, huh? That's kinda quick.

26
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:48,039
Indeed.

27
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:53,404
Well, you know,
love is a strange and mysterious thing.

28
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:57,602
Ow!

29
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:02,803
Rya'c did not even consult me
before making this decision.

30
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:06,241
This girl has caused all reason
to leave Rya'c's head.

31
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:09,283
- Zero serving three.
- Serving eight.

32
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:10,514
Eight.

33
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:12,724
Oh!

34
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:17,763
So what's Ishta think of all this?

35
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:20,882
Ishta believes traditions
should persist at all costs,

36
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:24,002
especially in the face of oppression.

37
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:26,235
I see.

38
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:32,403
Rya'c is too young
to know what love is, O'Neill.

39
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:36,637
Or how it inevitably
weakens a warrior's resolve.

40
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:40,195
Look, T, I'm not gonna tell you
how to raise your kid,

41
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:44,039
but I've found sticking your fingers
in your ears and humming loudly

42
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,923
solves a whole slew of problems.

43
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:49,360
What good am I as a father, O'Neill,

44
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:54,439
if I cannot keep my son
from making this crucial mistake?

45
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:58,643
Unscheduled offworld activation.

46
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:05,555
Got one.

47
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:10,081
Receiving IDC, sir. It's Ishta.

48
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:12,725
Open the Iris.

49
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:24,077
Greetings.

50
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,474
There is an urgent matter
we must discuss.

51
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:29,557
Hak'tyl may have been compromised.

52
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,720
- How do you know?
- Yesterday we were to meet a contact.

53
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:40,320
A high priestess
stationed within Moloc's temple.

54
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,919
She failed to appear at the allotted time.

55
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:46,156
- You must evacuate immediately.
- I agree.

56
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:50,523
But we know not
of another uninhabited planet like Hak'tyl.

57
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:52,994
Hiding female warriors and children

58
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:57,317
within a populated planet in Moloc's
domain is difficult and dangerous.

59
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,919
I'm sure we could help you folks out.

60
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:01,199
Carter?

61
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:04,675
No problem. We have a number
of possible worlds on record,

62
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:08,758
but they should be explored more
thoroughly before you take up residence.

63
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:11,962
If Moloc is aware of our location,

64
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:17,517
every moment my people remain
on Hak'tyl puts them at greater risk.

65
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,276
Oh. Um...

66
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:32,723
You're welcome to stay here.

67
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:37,279
I'll go start the paperwork.

68
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:08,433
- Colonel Carter, Dr Jackson.
- Rya'c. It's good to see you again.

69
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:10,595
This is my sim'ka, Kar'yn.

70
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:13,995
Rya'c, stop using those old terms.
We are betrothed.

71
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:16,440
An honour to meet friends
of my husband-to-be.

72
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:18,595
Right back at you.

73
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:22,473
- Is she not the most beautiful thing?
- Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

74
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:26,080
I am not an object to be worshipped.

75
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,763
Thank you for agreeing
to host our union ceremony.

76
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:32,518
It will be an honour
to be betrothed among friends.

77
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:35,358
- You're gonna have the wedding here?
- Of course.

78
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:38,960
Ishta said it may take some time
to find a planet for our new home.

79
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:42,924
We are to be married in three days.

80
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,473
There is much to do.

81
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:47,078
Rya'c.

82
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,281
Excuse us.

83
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:56,318
They're having the wedding here.
Does Jack know about this?

84
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:59,761
I'm gonna work on finding them a planet.

85
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:01,437
Yeah.

86
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:12,038
Come in.

87
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:15,434
Bra'tac.

88
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:21,845
What's that smell?

89
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:25,122
I believe that is the horses, O'Neill.

90
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,954
The warriors of Hak'tyl
are grateful for your generosity.

91
00:07:30,045 --> 00:07:31,524
Well,

92
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:33,596
you know me.

93
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:37,837
Always willing to help
those who need help.

94
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:43,124
You are indeed a wise and gracious
leader, O'Neill of Minnesota.

95
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:46,163
Sit down, you old coot.

96
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:48,802
What?

97
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:54,925
I am to officiate the rite of everlasting
union between Rya'c and Kar'yn.

98
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:57,599
I have consulted with Ishta on the matter,

99
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:02,759
and despite the evacuation, she wishes
the wedding to proceed as planned.

100
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:06,201
- And as scheduled.
- Meaning here?

101
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,516
A more suitable world
is not likely to be found in time.

102
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:13,518
Delaying the ceremony would grant
another victory to Moloc's tyranny.

103
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:18,520
You know what it took to get approval
for tailgate Tuesdays? Huh?

104
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:25,515
There'll be cake?

105
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:40,239
You have been avoiding me.

106
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:44,722
You have indicated
I am not worthy of your presence.

107
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:47,114
How so?

108
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:51,995
Your refusal to bless this union
is an insult to Kar'yn, and thus to me.

109
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:54,360
That is not what I intended.

110
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:58,836
Rya'c has pledged to help lead the Jaffa
in the battle against the Goa'uld.

111
00:08:58,925 --> 00:09:01,837
As have I and my people.

112
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:06,840
A warrior is always stronger
with another at his side.

113
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:12,602
So you must believe Kar'yn's an unworthy
warrior, and I'm at fault as her teacher.

114
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,961
Ishta, this is not about you.

115
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:20,641
Soon enough Rya'c will have to choose
between his family and his cause,

116
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:23,000
just as I once did.

117
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:26,077
I merely believe that he is young
and has much time ahead,

118
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:30,283
and need not undertake
such decisions so soon.

119
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:33,562
In the same way
Rya'c had no say in your decision,

120
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:35,761
you have no say in his.

121
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,003
None of us choose oppression
at the hand of the Goa'uld,

122
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,553
nor what must be done
to free ourselves of it.

123
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:50,923
But we must not sacrifice
that which makes us Jaffa.

124
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:59,957
I have organised both men and women
to fight together to rise up against Moloc.

125
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:05,165
Maybe once we are free of his tyranny,
you will see we are worthy of your war.

126
00:10:05,245 --> 00:10:09,284
Overthrowing Moloc alone
will ultimately prove nothing.

127
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:13,074
Were he to fall, his worlds
would be usurped by another Goa'uld.

128
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:17,716
I will not stand idly by and watch more
of my sisters slain at the hand of Moloc,

129
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:21,036
while you and the leaders
of this so-called "Jaffa rebellion",

130
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,754
you plot and you scheme
and you ultimately do nothing!

131
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:27,803
You have no wish to fight side by side,
only to dominate.

132
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:30,194
As my sisters have been for generations.

133
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:32,594
As you will remain
due to short-sightedness.

134
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,153
I will not rest until Moloc is dead.

135
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:38,715
I will not rest until all Goa'uld are dead.

136
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:55,281
- They want a what?
- A goat, sir.

137
00:10:56,965 --> 00:11:00,844
You can tell them lamb is far less gamey.

138
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:02,722
They...

139
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:06,160
They want it for a ritual sacrifice.

140
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:11,603
- Tell them that's not gonna happen.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

141
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:14,438
They can have a pinata. That's always fun.

142
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:16,914
I'll suggest it, sir.

143
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:29,843
Please tell me
you're close to finding a planet.

144
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:32,564
We scouted one
Ishta seems comfortable with.

145
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:35,239
Fresh water, stable climate.

146
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:41,279
Good. When's moving day?

147
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:44,118
Ishta thinks it'll take a week
to get a camp going.

148
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:47,356
- A week?
- Yes, sir.

149
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:50,994
The wedding is still gonna happen here.

150
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,963
- Have you seen Teal'c?
- He's locked himself in his room.

151
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,717
That chicken.

152
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,636
Let this fire
bear witness to this ceremony.

153
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:06,355
May its flames keep warm
the souls of those who came before us.

154
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:09,243
We ask those spirits now
to bless this union

155
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:13,113
and to protect it
through each day of its existence.

156
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:16,277
And then the horn will sound.

157
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,919
Good. Now.

158
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:31,715
You will place the circle of fidelity
upon Kar'yn's head.

159
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:45,839
And you the totem of bravery
around Rya'c's neck.

160
00:12:55,885 --> 00:13:00,800
The bride will then
kneel before her husband in respect.

161
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:06,122
- I will do no such thing.
- Kar'yn.

162
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,924
I kneel before no man,
not even my husband.

163
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,599
This action has been
part of the ceremony for...

164
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:14,995
Then he should kneel before me as well.

165
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,963
Or am I too weak
to have respect given to me in return?

166
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:21,879
- You disgrace my name.
- Perhaps if we took a short recess.

167
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:25,674
And if you insist on treating me
like a fragile handmaiden,

168
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:28,757
then I have chosen poorly for a husband.

169
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:32,281
Perhaps I have chosen poorly as well.

170
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:47,519
I can see
why one must rehearse these events.

171
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:52,677
Unscheduled offworld activation.

172
00:13:57,405 --> 00:14:00,602
We're receiving a message. On screen.

173
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:07,278
Ishta, this concerns you.

174
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,598
It's from one of my contacts
among Moloc's Jaffa.

175
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,360
- He's requesting a summit.
- For what reason?

176
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:21,678
Our forces that are hiding among
the Jaffa of Moloc have become large.

177
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:25,715
But there are still many
who are loyal to him.

178
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:28,444
We risk being exposed.

179
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:32,279
We must send the coordinates of the
new home world to those who will attend.

180
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:34,560
Very well.

181
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:37,364
I will accompany you to this summit.

182
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,879
You have no say in our matters.

183
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:43,275
Perhaps there is counsel I can provide.

184
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:47,200
You will abide by my ruling.

185
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:03,915
- Can I come with you?
- You have a union to prepare for.

186
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:06,599
There will be no union.

187
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:15,722
Kar'yn, you must learn not to let
your emotions take you to such extremes.

188
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:21,516
I cannot be betrothed to Rya'c.
He is as pig-headed as his father.

189
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:27,123
Until you have fought as many battles, do
not speak of Teal'c with such disrespect.

190
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:30,402
Without him, we would not have tretonin,

191
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:33,761
and we'd still be slaves
to the Goa'uld symbiotes.

192
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:38,123
Why do you accept his affection, knowing
he doesn't support our war against Moloc

193
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:42,801
and the archaic traditions
that oppress female Jaffa?

194
00:15:46,765 --> 00:15:49,325
We differ often.

195
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:52,954
But deep down, we both possess
the same hunger for freedom.

196
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:55,081
Does he not see me fit for Rya'c?

197
00:15:55,165 --> 00:16:00,637
He could search a thousand worlds
and never find someone like you.

198
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:03,558
Teal'c has lost much
in the war against the Goa'uld,

199
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:07,194
and does not wish Rya'c to feel
the pain of such loss.

200
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:12,518
What about Rya'c? He does not respect
me as a warrior as Teal'c respects you.

201
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:16,803
That took some convincing, believe me.

202
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:22,835
What you must remember is that
as much as you desire Rya'c's respect,

203
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:25,120
he too burns for yours.

204
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:40,597
Your parries are too low.
Hold your staff higher.

205
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:43,040
Step into each blocking blow.

206
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:46,719
Leave me be.

207
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:49,795
As you wish.

208
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:52,755
Have I not been a dutiful son?

209
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,758
- Have I not brought honour to my name?
- You have indeed.

210
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:59,757
Then why will my father
not bless my union with Kar'yn?

211
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:03,633
- Then the union is still to be?
- That is not the point.

212
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:09,004
You have made a choice. You pledged
your life to fight for freedom for all Jaffa.

213
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:13,681
- You must commit to it without question.
- I know.

214
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:16,757
That is why my father
abandoned my mother and I -

215
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:19,643
because we made him weak.

216
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:24,243
- That is not true.
- He knows I forgave him for that long ago.

217
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:29,080
- I understand why it was necessary.
- Do you? Hm?

218
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:33,397
Teal'c stayed first prime of Apophis as
long as he did because he feared for you.

219
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:38,479
He committed atrocities because he
wanted you and your mother to be safe.

220
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:41,477
When he chose to leave to join the Tauri,

221
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:44,398
it was the most difficult thing
he has ever done.

222
00:17:44,485 --> 00:17:48,922
It is not you that made him weak,
but his own fear and doubt.

223
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:52,122
When he realised the Goa'uld
could indeed be defeated,

224
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:57,279
that if he fought hard enough
you could one day be free,

225
00:17:57,365 --> 00:17:59,435
it made him stronger.

226
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:05,361
It is the same for me with Kar'yn.
She fuels my desire to fight for freedom.

227
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:10,121
We know what we must face,
and we choose to do it together.

228
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:16,396
You still have much to learn
about yourself. About being a warrior.

229
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:21,718
Neither of you truly know what we will
all face in full-scale war with the Goa'uld.

230
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:24,717
I do not need his blessing.

231
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:28,637
No. You do not.

232
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:36,236
And he insults Kar'yn. She is a formidable
warrior who deserves his respect.

233
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,714
And yours.

234
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:55,004
The ranks of rebel Jaffa
are sizeable enough to win.

235
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:59,044
The time to strike is now.

236
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,913
Aron is right. If we wait longer,
it is only a matter of time

237
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:07,396
before our numbers grow too large
for Moloc not to discover.

238
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:10,397
We risk losing everything.

239
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,280
Aron is right. We must strike now.

240
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,276
Jaffa.

241
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,395
Hear me.

242
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:26,516
I know your hearts are prepared for battle,

243
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:29,881
but I have come to ask for your patience.

244
00:19:31,245 --> 00:19:33,713
You have prepared well
for the demise of Moloc,

245
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:38,560
but only when all Jaffa rise up as one
can the Goa'uld be defeated.

246
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:43,673
And only then will all of our brothers
and sisters truly be free.

247
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:48,164
This is the counsel
you have come to offer?

248
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,195
What is it?

249
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:55,923
Down!

250
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:57,279
Argh!

251
00:19:57,365 --> 00:19:59,037
Agh!

252
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,357
Go.

253
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:42,761
- The gate is well guarded.
- We must return to the meeting tent.

254
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:45,723
- If anyone survived, they will be tortured.
- Wait.

255
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:48,000
For what?

256
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,515
- Teal'c? Are you there?
- Proceed, O'Neill.

257
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:02,003
You know how I get when you don't call.

258
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:07,034
Moloc's Jaffa ambushed us. The planet
address has fallen into the wrong hands.

259
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:12,153
I am with Ishta and another rebel Jaffa
named Aron. We are cut off from the gate.

260
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:14,281
- How bad?
- Very.

261
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:18,677
- Backup?
- It would be unwise at the moment.

262
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:22,636
I'm uncertain as to the extent of forces.

263
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:25,797
I will gather intel
before deciding on a course of action.

264
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,922
All right. I'll check in in about an hour.

265
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:32,035
And, T...

266
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,197
- My head is down, O'Neill.
- Over.

267
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:59,716
Someone has betrayed you. That can be
the only explanation for Moloc's presence.

268
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:04,515
I do not have my tretonin. It was in my
pack, and in our haste I left it in the tent.

269
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:07,199
I have enough for both of us.

270
00:22:10,165 --> 00:22:12,759
It must have shattered when you fell.

271
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:15,723
We must move.
A search patrol approaches.

272
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:19,522
Indeed.

273
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,723
- What's going on here?
- Silence!

274
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:37,433
Thank you.

275
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:39,197
Now,

276
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:43,515
Daniel, what's going on here?

277
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:45,596
Silence.

278
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:49,119
I said, "Daniel".

279
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:53,644
- As you can see, everyone's a little upset.
- We will not abandon Ishta.

280
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:57,513
- We insist a rescue mission be devised.
- We're devising.

281
00:22:57,605 --> 00:23:01,564
- Teal'c has said the gate is guarded.
- Can we not journey to this planet?

282
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:05,638
- It would take at least a week to get there.
- Please, return to your quarters.

283
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:08,319
- I cannot go until...
- Please!

284
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:14,274
In time, your skills may be required,
then you must be ready.

285
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:16,481
Go.

286
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,481
- There are only six.
- Many more may be hiding nearby,

287
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:35,556
anticipating our approach.

288
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:41,283
We must do something.

289
00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:44,598
I cannot bear this.
The Tauri have troops and weapons.

290
00:23:44,685 --> 00:23:47,995
We have not determined
the size of Moloc's forces they would face.

291
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:51,361
Many more lives than our own
could be lost.

292
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:56,836
- Then what are we to do?
- For the moment... nothing.

293
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:12,800
We cannot hide forever from their patrols.

294
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:16,840
We will rest here.

295
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:24,201
They will not rest until we are found.
If your plan is to wait until they give up...

296
00:24:24,285 --> 00:24:28,961
I need to gather the information that I can
concerning the forces against us.

297
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:32,640
We are severely outnumbered.
What more do you need to know?

298
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:33,953
Aron.

299
00:24:36,045 --> 00:24:39,117
I need to speak to Teal'c privately.

300
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:43,164
- You do not trust my loyalty.
- I do.

301
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:46,203
This is a private matter. Please.

302
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:57,919
He could be the informant
as easily as anyone,

303
00:24:58,005 --> 00:25:01,475
and be gathering knowledge
concerning the rebellion.

304
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:03,442
I know.

305
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:06,198
But he is right about one thing.

306
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:10,039
We cannot wait to act.
I am already growing weak.

307
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:13,081
You need rest.

308
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:15,633
As do you.

309
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:18,285
I will take first watch.

310
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:20,356
Teal'c.

311
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:28,154
I promised all Jaffa under Moloc's rule
they will be free from his tyranny.

312
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:32,553
It was not a foolish promise.

313
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:35,682
One day, we will all be free.

314
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:41,239
"One day" is not soon enough.

315
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,320
Where is Ishta?

316
00:25:58,405 --> 00:26:00,794
It was her turn to take w...

317
00:26:42,485 --> 00:26:44,601
Moloc is here.

318
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:54,044
- We must act.
- I am aware.

319
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:57,640
Even if Ishta cannot be saved,
we must kill Moloc.

320
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:59,841
- That is not my goal.
- It is mine.

321
00:26:59,925 --> 00:27:02,644
And that of all the Jaffa
in the rebellion against him.

322
00:27:02,725 --> 00:27:06,001
Without reinforcements,
we will be swarmed by Moloc's forces.

323
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:08,121
I am willing to die for my cause.

324
00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:11,163
You will die for nothing
if you do not succeed.

325
00:27:11,245 --> 00:27:16,114
You are weak. Your mind is clouded
with feelings for Ishta.

326
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:24,119
And you cannot be trusted.

327
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:35,284
Ishta's been captured.
Apparently Moloc is there in person.

328
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:39,916
We'll coordinate an attack to provide
a distraction for Teal'c's rescue attempt.

329
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:42,235
Moloc will kill her before surrendering.

330
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:47,274
Teal'c's more worried about what
he's going to do to her in the meantime.

331
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:52,117
Oh!

332
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:57,601
It is not too late
to repent for your sins.

333
00:27:57,685 --> 00:28:02,042
Grovel before your god
and beg for my forgiveness.

334
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:06,434
Tell me of the sinners
who would betray me.

335
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:10,962
How many would renounce the privilege
of carrying the children of their god,

336
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:13,081
like you?

337
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:17,277
Tell me while their souls
may yet be saved.

338
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,682
You cannot be Ishta of the Hak'tyl,

339
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:27,679
wicked leader of the depraved.

340
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:33,483
I sense nothing but weakness in you.

341
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:38,400
Or maybe that is what happens when
you abandon the strength of the Goa'uld.

342
00:28:38,485 --> 00:28:42,364
All that is left is this burning desire to die

343
00:28:42,445 --> 00:28:45,835
at the hands
of your great and powerful god.

344
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:53,518
We're preparing a UAV
to drop tretonin for Teal'c.

345
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:57,393
He will need all his strength
if he is to rescue Ishta from Moloc.

346
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,158
The UAV will then
paint the targets on the gate.

347
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:05,399
Ishta did not exaggerate. The rebel Jaffa
on Moloc's worlds are a mighty force.

348
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:09,478
As we speak, they prepare for war
against those still loyal to Moloc.

349
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:14,320
- You think they can win?
- I do not know.

350
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:18,034
Even if they do, another Goa'uld
could simply take his place.

351
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:21,800
Or worse, come in and wipe them out
to prove rebellion is a bad idea.

352
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,002
Indeed. That is something
we asked them to consider.

353
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:28,998
And yet, such reason is beyond them now.

354
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:35,158
- UAV ready to launch, Colonel.
- Thank you.

355
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:37,440
Dial the gate.

356
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,003
Launching UAV in three, two,

357
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,882
one.

358
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:15,117
Receiving Teal'c's signal.

359
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:23,641
The UAV's been hit.

360
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,042
Teal'c, do you copy?

361
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,274
Proceed.

362
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:36,393
The UAV should be halfa click
southwest ofyour location.

363
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:38,919
- I am on my way.
- Be careful, Teal'c.

364
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,121
We'll dial back in 30 minutes.

365
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:55,277
- Can we not still send missiles through?
- Without a painted target they'd crash.

366
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:06,717
Argh!

367
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:15,401
Moloc. Shnee ka.

368
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:18,158
Jaffa, shel na kree.

369
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:20,634
Kree nok, Jaffa.

370
00:31:30,885 --> 00:31:33,399
Shel kek nem Ron.

371
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,358
If you know who I am, brothers,

372
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:43,122
you know that there is no need
to sacrifice your lives for a false god.

373
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:52,197
Sho klok.

374
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,482
Rin nok, shol'va.

375
00:31:58,245 --> 00:31:59,394
Aargh!

376
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:28,121
It would have been easier
had you left me with a weapon.

377
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:37,678
My thanks.

378
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:42,043
Is there anything else I can do
to prove my loyalty?

379
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:45,755
Indeed.

380
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:08,073
Is this what you want?

381
00:33:09,485 --> 00:33:12,079
Evil serum to poison you further?

382
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:17,319
Or will it give you strength enough
to last a little longer?

383
00:33:17,405 --> 00:33:19,600
Then take it.

384
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:25,275
Take it so that you may have
more precious time with your god.

385
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:27,276
My lord.

386
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:29,640
Word comes from Goranak.

387
00:33:29,725 --> 00:33:34,845
An uprising has begun. An army of
two thousand is marching on your temple.

388
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:39,123
They control a garrison of gliders
and several Alkesh.

389
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:41,400
As I have foreseen.

390
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:46,160
Your fleet of Ha'tak
have gathered themselves in orbit.

391
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:49,954
They await your command
to crush this insolence.

392
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:52,240
I am done with this one.

393
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:57,274
Trivial as it may seem, this distraction
has given me a few moments of pleasure.

394
00:33:57,365 --> 00:34:00,721
Use her to capture the shol'va, Teal'c.

395
00:34:01,965 --> 00:34:05,924
- Then bring him to me.
- Yes, my lord.

396
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:17,599
When the gate opens again,
merely aim this at your target.

397
00:34:17,685 --> 00:34:22,520
The missiles will come through
and strike where you aim.

398
00:34:23,725 --> 00:34:26,717
You're certain your strength has returned?

399
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:29,603
This time I will not be there
to come to your rescue.

400
00:34:29,685 --> 00:34:33,837
I assure you,
this time it will not be necessary.

401
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,234
Open the Chaapa-ai.

402
00:34:50,765 --> 00:34:52,915
Jaffa, kree nok.

403
00:34:54,645 --> 00:34:56,476
Teal'c, do you read?

404
00:34:57,325 --> 00:34:59,395
Colonel, I am ready and in position.

405
00:34:59,485 --> 00:35:02,875
- So we're on?
- Indeed.

406
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:17,158
Aargh!

407
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:48,876
She's weak to the point of death.
Zatting us both, even once, will kill her.

408
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,762
Drop your weapon.

409
00:35:56,805 --> 00:35:59,603
Shoot them down.

410
00:36:12,565 --> 00:36:14,123
Drop it now!

411
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:20,155
That is the sound of your false god dying.

412
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:23,362
- Gods cannot be killed.
- Teal'c...

413
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:26,243
- Not another word.
- Shoot.

414
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:29,914
Aargh!

415
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:31,404
Ooh!

416
00:36:31,485 --> 00:36:35,160
There is no need. I have taken mine.

417
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:40,364
Is it true that Moloc is dead?

418
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:44,916
If you have the strength,
we can see for ourselves.

419
00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:52,200
In a moment.

420
00:37:01,965 --> 00:37:06,197
Kar'yn, speak of your love
and devotion to Rya'c.

421
00:37:06,285 --> 00:37:10,483
Rya'c, your heart is pure
and your spirit strong.

422
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:13,918
You give me strength.

423
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:16,439
And joy.

424
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,801
And I will stand by your side.

425
00:37:19,885 --> 00:37:21,876
Always.

426
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:25,519
- Rya'c.
- Kar'yn,

427
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:29,719
you are as beautiful as the sun.

428
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:34,754
My love for you is like the morning rays
that dawn over an endless day.

429
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,641
The rite is complete.

430
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:44,842
May you love and fight like warriors,

431
00:37:44,925 --> 00:37:47,120
just not with each other.

432
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:05,684
A legend speaks of a place
where mountains meet the sea,

433
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:07,756
of hidden pools beneath waterfalls.

434
00:38:07,845 --> 00:38:10,962
It is no legend.
I have seen it with my own eyes.

435
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:14,401
You have chosen the location
for your Shim'roa very well.

436
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:17,955
Master Bra'tac said
this is where you took my mother.

437
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,842
Indeed.

438
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,842
Rya'c.

439
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:28,282
I can think of no better mate
for you than Kar'yn,

440
00:38:28,365 --> 00:38:32,438
and I am certain
your mother would have felt the same.

441
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,754
Thank you.

442
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:45,960
Before your departure,
there is a matter that bears discussion.

443
00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:49,481
Father, I am aware of the ways
between a man and a woman.

444
00:38:49,565 --> 00:38:52,841
Good. Then you are prepared
for the rite of Oronak.

445
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:59,443
- Surely it is not still expected.
- On the first eve of Shim'roa.

446
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:03,723
My advice is that the knife
be as sharp as possible.

447
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:10,922
Perhaps Kar'yn is right. Not all of
the old traditions are worth holding onto.

448
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,442
Indeed.

449
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:21,193
- And what of you and Ishta?
- What of us?

450
00:39:21,285 --> 00:39:25,801
Well, your relationship would be much
easier if you both admit you are in love.

451
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:29,514
- For us all.
- Perhaps one day.

452
00:39:29,605 --> 00:39:32,483
When I am as wise as you.

453
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:41,160
Once again, we owe you our thanks.

454
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:45,477
For your hospitality and for helping us
find yet another new home world,

455
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,635
where the Hak'tyl may be safe.

456
00:39:47,725 --> 00:39:50,114
Think nothing of it.

457
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:57,635
You sure you got everything?
You didn't forget any kids or horses?

458
00:39:58,885 --> 00:40:03,037
- May I speak with Teal'c alone?
- Sure.

459
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:05,195
It's good to see you again.

460
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:11,354
I will see you soon, Father.

461
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:18,159
Yes,

462
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:20,156
Father.

463
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:22,236
Be well.

464
00:40:29,085 --> 00:40:33,158
I did not wish to spoil
the days of Shim'roa for Rya'c and Kar'yn.

465
00:40:33,245 --> 00:40:36,362
- What have you discovered?
- As predicted, another Goa'uld

466
00:40:36,445 --> 00:40:38,436
has claimed the domain of Moloc.

467
00:40:38,525 --> 00:40:41,039
- Baal.
- Yes.

468
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,559
Do not wait too long to visit.

469
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:49,081
We have a war to plan,
among other things.

470
