00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,132
Hello, and welcome to Sol's Diner.

2
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,540
I'm Val. I'll be your waitress today.

3
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,578
Have you had a chance
to look over the menu?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,012
Might I suggest the meatball sandwich?

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,380
It's the owner's personal favorite.

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:19,884
WOMAN: Sounds good.

7
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,952
- Sir?
- Hi.

8
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:26,753
Two Junior Meals for the kids,
and I'll have the club sandwich.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,294
- Okay.
- Oh, can I get some extra pickles on that?

10
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,954
- No problem.
- Thank you.

11
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,131
VAL: Waters all around?

12
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,256
- Sure.
- Sure.

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,355
Okay.

14
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:37,197
WOMAN: Okay, once the food comes,
that's it for the games.

15
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:42,230
All right! Wallets and purses
on the table in front of you, now!

16
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,969
Valuables in here.

17
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,468
Hey! You listening to me?

18
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:50,979
(GROANING)

19
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,299
What did you do?

20
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,475
I don't know.

21
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,804
(WOMAN CHATTERING)

22
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,318
Thank you.

23
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:37,988
Your menu.

24
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,752
WAITRESS: And for you, sir.

25
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,789
Fancy.

26
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,624
Well, I know you don't
get off the base much,

27
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,566
except for official business,

28
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,396
so I thought I'd take you somewhere nice.

29
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,563
Well, I don't mind telling you

30
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,141
I've been looking forward
to this little date all week.

31
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,233
I wouldn't exactly call it a date. It's...

32
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,006
Oh, I've watched enough of your television
to know what a date is, Daniel.

33
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:05,744
It's a romantic event typified
by dinner, movie, and/ or karaoke,

34
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,015
and usually culminating in a night of...

35
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,790
Okay, this is definitely not a date.

36
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,951
It's two friends and co-workers
out for dinner.

37
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,787
- Oh, well, I...
- WAITER: Hi.

38
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,885
Hi.

39
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,830
- Can I start you off with a drink?
- Absolutely.

40
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,026
Well, tonight's feature martinis

41
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,933
are the chocolate, passion fruit,
and shochu plum.

42
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,030
They all sound wonderful.
So one of each, then?

43
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,574
Yeah, I think
we're going to pace ourselves.

44
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,474
She'll do the passion fruit.

45
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,671
(EX CLAIMS)

46
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,010
And I'm going to have the bottled water.

47
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,207
Sure.

48
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,581
Listen...

49
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,249
- Let me start.
- Okay.

50
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:52,788
Look, I know it hasn't been easy for you,
adjusting to your new life here,

51
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,130
learning to trust other people,
and, most importantly,

52
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,138
refusing the temptation
to fall back on your old ways.

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,367
But you have worked hard

54
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,273
to make a place for yourself with us and...

55
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,472
And dinner tonight
is my way of saying thank you.

56
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,315
Thank you for proving me right

57
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,214
when I said we could
take a chance on you.

58
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,782
I don't know what to say.

59
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,925
Just say what you were going to say
before I interrupted.

60
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,527
Okay. I need to use the bathroom.

61
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,801
Yeah. It's...

62
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,563
Okay.

63
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,300
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

64
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,018
(GRUNTING)

65
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,722
(MOANING)

66
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,357
She needs some fresh air.

67
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,539
Your friend has taken ill.

68
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,349
What? Where is she?

69
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,521
She was escorted outside
by another gentleman.

70
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,424
ATHENA: I apologize for that.

71
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,999
The surgery was performed
in a moving car.

72
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,968
They were more concerned about
removing the subcutaneous transmitter

73
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,163
than being gentle about it.

74
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,310
Do I know you?

75
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,144
You did, a long time ago.

76
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,847
Qetesh, the Goa'uld
that once occupied your body,

77
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,354
was a rival of mine.

78
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,321
She was a very intelligent adversary,

79
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,826
which is why I eventually decided
to partner with her.

80
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,024
In retrospect,

81
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,726
it's also the reason I should have
been more careful about trusting her.

82
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,893
VALA: As the host to her Goa'uld,

83
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:47,700
I was an unwilling participant
in many of Qetesh's thoughtless actions.

84
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,402
So, if this is a revenge thing,

85
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,480
your anger is, well, misplaced.

86
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,980
This isn't a revenge thing.

87
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,418
Oh.

88
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,718
This is a search for answers.

89
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,457
My position in the Trust
has afforded me considerable resources.

90
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,860
(GROANING)

91
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,033
Ever since I heard
that you joined Stargate Command,

92
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,797
I've been watching and waiting
for an opportunity,

93
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,971
which finally presented itself tonight.

94
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,171
What exactly do you want from me?

95
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:29,943
The code to an Ancient tablet
that I helped Qetesh locate long ago.

96
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,517
A treasure map of sorts.

97
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:37,612
She was supposed to share it with me,
but instead decided to keep it for herself.

98
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:41,056
From what I understand,
she was never able to decipher it.

99
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,219
I'd like that opportunity.

100
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,763
To be honest, it doesn't ring a bell, so...

101
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:50,302
That's because you've suppressed many of
the details from your time as Qetesh.

102
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,995
The full genetic memory of the Goa'uld

103
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,596
would drive
your inferior human mind insane.

104
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,174
Luckily, we have this device
to help us find what we're looking for.

105
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,315
This'll take a while.

106
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,382
I'll leave you to it then.

107
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,223
We've got the local authorities
searching the area

108
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,629
and conducting interviews
with every possible witness.

109
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,564
So far, they've come up empty.

110
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,102
General, there's no question
the Trust is behind her disappearance.

111
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,694
I mean, they're the only ones
with the resources

112
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,637
capable of pulling something like this off.

113
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,266
Agreed. I've already put a call
through to Agent Barrett.

114
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,242
He's got his people working on it.

115
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,836
We'll find her.

116
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,746
KAKALIOS: We're starting to get images
from her suppressed memory.

117
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,790
Dial it down.

118
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,425
(GRUNTING)

119
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,030
How are you feeling?

120
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,560
A little dizzy.

121
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,266
A little tired. And very, very angry.

122
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,875
Oh, that's because the flashbacks
you're experiencing

123
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,638
are dredging up
some long-buried emotions

124
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,714
that may be coloring your conscious mind.

125
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,874
I'm going to kill both of you
in the most painful way possible.

126
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,678
Things will go a lot faster if you just relax.

127
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,522
Whenever you're ready.

128

129
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,090
Jackson, rise and shine.

130
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,599
What is it? What's going on?

131
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:30,964
Barrett, he came through for us.

132
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,368
He just sent over a list of
suspected Trust safe houses.

133
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,963
Hopefully our girl's in one of them.

134
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,515
<i>LANDRY: Team One, what's your status?</i>

135
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,681
Team One is in position.

136
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,185
Team Two?

137
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,660
Team Two in position.

138
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,762
- Team Three?
<i>- LEADER: Team Three is in position.</i>

139

(SHUDDERING)

140
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,770
- Do you know what I think the problem is?
- That I can't strangle you?

141
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,538
You're fighting the process.

142
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,877
In the end, all you're really doing
is delaying the inevitable.

143
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,747
Why don't we try and keep an open mind?

144
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,521
All five teams are in position.

145
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,184
<i>You have a go.</i>

146
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,999
Who was that?

147
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,096
Turn it down.

148
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,473
Damn.

149
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,243
Maybe they'll have better luck
at the other locations.

150
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,067
- Cover the door.
- Right.

151
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,576

(GASPS)

153
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,683
It's all right. We're here to help.

154
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,595
CARTER: Four out of the five safe houses
we hit were empty.

155
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:21,264
Only one, it turned out,
was still in play, and that was SG-15's.

156
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,831
We lost them and three members
of the local team.

157
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,708
One Trust operative survived
the explosion with minor injuries.

158
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,374
He confirmed that the place was rigged
to blow in the event it was stormed.

159
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,976
He also confirmed
that Vala was being held at that location.

160
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,715
So, it's possible they moved her
before the place was raided?

161
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,814
Unlikely. They wouldn't have had the time.

162
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,985
Besides, the guy we caught claims
he saw Vala making a run for it.

163
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,926
Then she could've gotten out on her own.

164
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,160
If that were the case, why has
she not yet attempted to contact us?

165
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,520
JACKSON: So, what did you want with her?

166
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,789
I mean, what exactly was going on
in that warehouse?

167
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,695
Look, I already told you. I can't say.

168
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,629
It's not that I don't want to help you,

169
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,703
but right now,
I'm more concerned for my well-being.

170
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,066
We can protect you.

171
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,662
No, you can't.

172
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:30,868
Okay.

173
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,038
He's all yours.

174
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,342
Where are you going?

175
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,889
I'll be out in the hall.
Just yell loudly if you need me.

176
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,127
Don't bother.

177
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,164
Your Jaffa interrogation tactics
won't work.

178
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,901
Believe me, I've seen
some pretty horrible things in my life.

179
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,734
You can't break me.

180
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,611
(INAUDIBLE)

181
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,024
A member of this facility
gets kidnapped unchallenged.

182
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,890
It's no wonder
he doesn't think we can protect him.

183
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,361
But we can protect him.

184
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,830
Yeah, by locking him away
for the rest of his life.

185
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,198
What can you say? There's a downside
to working for super villains.

186
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,935
Well, this is probably going to
take a while.

187
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,303
What do you say we grab a bite to eat?

188
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,070
You're done?

189
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,477
He was surprisingly forthcoming.

190
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,820
Whenever you're ready, honey.

191
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,576
How you doing?

192
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,514
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

193
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,880
I'm Sal, the owner.

194
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,853
Sal, the owner of Sol's Diner?

195
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,254
Yeah, Sol was the original owner.
I bought the place from him.

196
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,393
Oh.

197
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,825
- So, how was lunch?
- Delicious.

198
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,791
Delicious enough to pay for it?

199
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,131
Yes. If I had the money, I would
certainly have paid for that meal

200
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,434
and given the lovely waitress
a sizeable gratuity.

201
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,004
The service was impeccable.

202
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,874
Look, lady, everybody's got problems.

203
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,949
I got rent on this place,
a mortgage, a wife, three kids,

204
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,951
and a Shih Tzu
with a recurring gastrointestinal condition

205
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,455
that requires a very specialized diet,
all right?

206
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:56,682
That requires a very specialized diet,
all right?

207
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,881
Okay.

208
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,025
I'm sorry for trying to cheat you.

209
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,431
Okay. All right, look, if I let you leave,

210
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,398
can I trust you to come back
with the money you owe me?

211
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,490
No.

212
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,229
No? What do you mean, no?

213
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,670
What, you're telling me
you can't be trusted?

214
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,138
Truthfully?

215
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,469
I don't know.

216
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,081
I... I don't remember.

217
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:29,178
I have no idea who I am,
much less what I'm capable of.

218
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:33,054
All I know for certain is that about
an hour ago, I was lost, hungry,

219
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,889
and drawn to the delightful aroma
of the blue plate special.

220
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,929
Is this a joke?

221
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:44,059
I have absolutely no memory of my life
prior to wandering in here.

222
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,405
If that's true,
we need to get you to a hospital.

223
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,666
No hospitals!

224
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,643
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

225
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,839
Hey.

226
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,476
- Everything okay here, Sal?
- Yeah. Everything's fine.

227
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,885
Don't worry about it.

228
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,655
- Let me go.
- Go where?

229
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,325
Please?

230
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:17,532
- What, you got a home, you got a family?
- I don't know.

231
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,436
I would pay you back. I would.

232
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,310
Just right now,
I just don't have the means.

233
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,707
Maybe I can do something to help you.

234
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,658
Jackson, how's it going?

235
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:45,025
Well, from what we learned
from the Trust operative

236
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,657
and the information provided to us
from the Jaffa and the Tok'ra,

237
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,168
this is what I've been able
to piece together so far.

238
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:56,100
Athena, the Greek goddess of war,
a.k.a. Charlotte Mayfield,

239
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,403
a.k.a. The Goa'uld responsible
for kidnapping Vala.

240
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,602
Now, according to what I've learned,

241
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,611
she was a minor player
who rose to mid-tier status

242
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,079
by pursuing alliances
with more powerful rivals:

243
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,811
Cronos, Camulus, Svarog, and even Anubis

244
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,784
when he was first on the outs
with the System Lords.

245
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,287
So, her partnering up with Ba'al
is just her latest power play?

246
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,379
No, it's more than that.

247
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,823
You see, we know Athena was once allied

248
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,395
with Qetesh,
the Goa'uld that formerly inhabited Vala.

249
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,794
See, apparently,
Qetesh double-crossed her

250
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:24,062
when they partnered up to search
for the Clava Thessara Infinitas,

251
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,330
the key to infinite treasure.

252
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,770
Now, according to legend,
it will allow he who possesses it entry

253
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,742
to a vast storehouse of riches hidden away
by the Ancients prior to their ascension.

254
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:33,812
Wow, that's big.

255
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,880
Yeah, and by all indications,
nothing but an elaborate hoax.

256
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,539
- So, they didn't find it?
- No, but for some reason,

257
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,913
Qetesh wanted Athena to think she had.

258
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,452
Athena believed her,
which is why she went after Vala.

259
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,853
And she used Ba'al's resources
here on Earth to get her.

260
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,621
Which reminds me, I'm supposed
to check in with Major Harper.

261
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:54,256
He's got people querying hospitals
in the area where Vala disappeared.

262
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,665
It's possible she may have been injured
and has been unable to contact us.

263
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,966
Hey, listen,
I spoke with the medical examiner's office.

264
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:05,407
They're doing DNA testing
on the remains recovered at the blast site,

265
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,641
but it's going to take a while.

266
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:18,147
You know, when Vala first disappeared
when the Ori gate was destroyed,

267
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,384
I refused to write her off.

268
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,550
Although the odds were against it,

269
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,289
I believed somehow
she'd found a way to survive,

270
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,927
and it turned out I was right.

271
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,304
I want to be right again.

272
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,766
Sure.

273
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,773
- I just figured you should know.
- Yeah. Thank you.

274
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,015
Major Harper, please.

275
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:52,112
I don't care what the so-called experts
have to say.

276
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,623
I want you to free up the capital

277
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,491
and move it into a company
called Beringer Consolidated.

278
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,620
I have it on good authority

279
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,393
that they'll be announcing
a major breakthrough before week's end.

280
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,866
All right.

281
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,832
The DNA results are in.

282
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,966
They were able to ID 12 victims,
none of them our girl.

283
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,738
My guess is there wasn't enough
of her left to run tests on.

284
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,837
Or there wasn't anything left
because she didn't die in that explosion.

285
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,474
If she got out, she would've gone
straight back to Stargate Command.

286
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,984
They wouldn't still be looking for her.

287
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,816
I don't know, maybe you're right.

288
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,118
Maybe she is dead.

289
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,594
But until we have confirmation,
I want you to keep looking for her, too.

Listen to you. You've been practicing.
Very nice.

293
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,451
Val, you okay?

294
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,454
Hey.

295
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,454
You all right?

296
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,532
Is it that visions thing again?

297
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,461
Look, I told you, you should
go get yourself checked out, honey.

298
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,630
No.

299
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,006
Sal, what am I doing,

300
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,839
working here, sleeping out the back,

301
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,313
watching reruns of <i>The X-Files</i>
in my spare time?

302
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,579
I appreciate everything
you've done for me,

303
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,281
but I've got to tell you,
I've been thinking about leaving.

304
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,447
So, where are you going to go?

305
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:38,621
I don't know, but this isn't my life.
It just doesn't feel right.

306
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,694
Trust me, sweetheart,

307
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,462
running away isn't
going to make things better for you.

308
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,730
Working tables here may not feel right,

309
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,806
but at least you've got a roof
over your head

310
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,740
and some friends who care about you.

311
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,113
It may not feel like your life right now.

312
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,444
Just give it some time, okay?

313
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,514
- Okay.
- Good.

314
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,347
Now, get back to work
before I fire your butt.

to look over the menu?

I don't know.

323
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,466
Okay. Name?

324
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,161
You know my name.
You're a regular at the deli.

325
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,237
So, what, is "Val" short for "Valerie"?

326
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,464
Okay.

Yes. Valerie.

Look, Val, is there any reason

332
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,696
why you don't want me
to know your real last name?

if I took a moment to freshen up?

00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,511
Sure. I need a coffee anyway.

Oh, sorry.

Oh. Hello.

340
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,728
I didn't know how long
we were going to be,

00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,771
so I was just going out
to get us some lunch.

see if anything comes up.

I don't understand.

344
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,448
I didn't do anything illegal.
I didn't hurt anyone.

00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,852
Well, apart from those two fellows who,
from what I understand,

346
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,652
I was totally within my rights to hurt.

347
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:57,194
Witnesses say you took them both down
without even breaking a sweat.

348
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,626
How did you manage that?

349
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,857
- Instinct.
- No. I think training.

350
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,925
Don't suppose you want to tell me
where you learned those moves?

351
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,633
That's what I thought.

352
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,106
- Sir.
- What is it, Chief?

353
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,646
I thought you should see this.

<i>A THENA: Listen to me.</i>
<i>This is what you're going to do.</i>

355

You're going to sell all of our
remaining stock in Beringer Consolidated.

356
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,823

that they're about to be rocked

357
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,593
by a major accounting scandal that will...

358
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,038
Nathan, I'm going to have to call you back.

359
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,844
- What is it?
- We got a call.

360
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,448
Apparently, some people,
they're looking for you.

361
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,987
- Who?
- The United States Air Force.

362
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,924
They're sending a Colonel Carter
to pick you up.

363
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,050
No.

364
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,827
- What do you mean, no?
- I'd rather stay here.

365
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,263
If you need me to commit a crime,
I'd be happy to oblige.

366
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,459
Look, Val, I don't pretend to know
what you're all about,

367
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,130
but when people start throwing
around words like "national security,"

368
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,503
there's not a lot I can do.

369
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,099
All right, I'll be honest with you.

370
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,638
The reason why I can't tell you who I am,

371
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,647
is because I don't know.

372
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,773
I don't remember.

373
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,547
I don't know where I'm from.
I'm not even sure if Val is my real name.

374
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:33,351
My memory only goes as far back
as that day, two weeks ago,

375
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,894
when I wandered into the deli for a lunch
I couldn't pay for.

376
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,088
I don't remember any of
my life before that,

377
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,165
although I do have flashbacks.

378
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:45,259
Occasionally, they're terrifying,
like something out of a horror movie,

379
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,394
but they don't make much sense.

380
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,132
I was hoping that, sooner or later,
my memories would just come back,

381
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,368
or that something would help remind me
of who I really am,

382
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:56,641
but after what happened today,
I'm not sure I want to know anymore.

383
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,688
You know, Val, it would be a lot easier
if you'd just be honest with me.

384
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:13,587
I'm Colonel Carter.
I'm here to take custody of the prisoner.

Prisoner?

00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,324
Would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

387
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:19,426

for Miss Mal Doran for a while now.

- About a minute ago.

Okay, here goes.

Your name is Vala Mal Doran.

You're a member of Stargate Command,

beneath Cheyenne Mountain.

437

It's the command center
for a military organization

00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,359
responsible for off-world exploration
and reconnaissance

439
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,662

transport between planets.

Not good.

I know it sounds crazy, but it's the truth.

444
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:10,882
Okay. So, we're space explorers?

445
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,184
Well, technically,
me and my team are the explorers.

446

You're just along for the ride because...

447
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,122
Well, you're not originally from this planet.
You're an alien.

448

And I mean that
in the nicest possible way.

my neighbors, especially that guy in 304.

Okay, just wait right here.
I'll be right back.

Well, he's of no help.

462
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:08,142
All he remembers was the gun,
then he was off to the races.

for the missing vehicle.

In the meantime, it turns out the deceased

00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,948
were all carrying phony ID.

467
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,286
The license plate was also bogus.

468
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,382
As for the car itself,

469
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:26,987
it was a company vehicle registered
to a Forsythe Chemicals.

470

missing this morning.

Okay, I think I've figured out
what happened to you,

479
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,253
why you don't remember anything.

480
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,124
Oh, good.
Does it involve an alien abduction?

481
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,098
Well, in as much as that you're an alien
who was abducted, yes.

482
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,364
You were undergoing a procedure

483
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,303
which was designed to dig up
some of your suppressed memories.

484
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,998
The scientist that we captured told us

485
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,168
that during the procedure,
the device was destroyed,

486
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,108
which allowed you
the opportunity to escape.

487
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,840
From the aliens.

488
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,711
No, they weren't aliens.

489
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:22,047
They're working for an alien,
but that's not really important.

490
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,587
Vala isn't a particularly alien name.

491
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:28,216
So, I'm thinking that this device
was in the middle of digging up

492
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:32,626
these suppressed memories
when it overloads and fries your brain.

493
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,097
So, instead of helping you remember,
it actually made you forget.

00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,670
- What?
- Nothing.

517
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,373
I just think it's funny
how you're always losing your pants.

518
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,280
I'm not "always losing my pants."

519
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:36,787
It's happened twice.

520
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:37,617
It's happened twice.

521
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,020
Twice is not always.

522
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,216
DANIEL: Okay, thank you.

523
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,452
We've got something on Vala.

524
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,138
DANIEL: Vala?

525
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,486
Vala, it's me, Daniel.

526
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:16,659
We know you're in here.
There's nowhere else you could've gone.

527
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:21,923
Vala?

528
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:28,964
DANIEL: Vala?

529
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,809
I know you're scared,
but we're not here to hurt you.

530
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,080
We can help you remember.

531
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:41,909
Colonel Carter!

532
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,725
(GUNFIRE)

533
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,685
(GUNFIRE)

534
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,994
Get out of my way.

535
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,595
Get out of my way or I will shoot you.

536
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,293
You don't remember who you are, but I do.

537
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,219
You won't shoot.

538
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,169
(GROANS)

539
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:23,476
If I let you go, I know
you're going to make yourself disappear.

540
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,414
You've been running so long,
it's almost second nature to you.

541
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,120
You don't remember it,
but you made a decision to stop running.

542
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,097
It's over.

543
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,829
Now it's time to come home.

544
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,218
Daniel.

545
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,727
(SIRENS WAILING)

546
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,654
You know, I don't mind getting shot,

547
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:35,122
but I pulled a hammy
when I took out that last Trust operative.

548
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,694
At least you didn't lose your pants.

549
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:40,723
You wanted to see me?

550
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,597
- Hey, what did Dr. Lam say?
- I've been cleared for active duty.

551
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,329
LANDRY: Glad to hear it.

552
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,768
What's this?

553
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,739
Let's just call it a welcome-back present.

554
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,938
- These are...
- Team badges.

555
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:01,074
You're now officially a member of SG-1.

556
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,483
Congratulations. You earned it.

557
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,599
Perhaps a celebration is in order.

558
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,592
That's a great idea.

559
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,832
We can check out that new rib joint
near my place.

560
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,100
Excellent.

561
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,872
Of course, that means we'll have to wait
until next week to complete our date.

562
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,773
It wasn't a date.

563
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:34,110
(STUTTERING) It was two friends
and co-workers out for dinner.

564
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,585
Seriously.

565
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,953
It wasn't a date.
