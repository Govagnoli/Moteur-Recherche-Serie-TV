1
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:18,559
- What's going on?
- Getting MALP telemetry from P3X-289.

2
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:20,797
Atmosphere is completely toxic.

3
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,765
Sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide,
methane, ammonia.

4
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:26,805
If there was a gate,
there was life there at some point.

5
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:30,084
Yeah, I think that's a safe assumption.
Look at this.

6
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:33,284
We got these images two hours ago
after the MALP went through.

7
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:37,758
The dome seems to be the only thing that
withstood the effects of the atmosphere.

8
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:43,046
- How big is it?
- About 2.2km wide and 500 metres high.

9
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:46,115
The MALP's giving us a proximity alert.

10
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:49,916
Three metres,
and we're picking up a static charge.

11
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:51,520
Stop.

12
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:54,397
Extend the arm.

13
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:01,837
- It went right through.
- Whatever it is, it's not solid.

14
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:03,838
Move forward.

15
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:18,640
We've lost contact.
The MALP's not responding.

16
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:20,922
Bring up that last image.

17
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:30,316
- How is that possible?
- I have no idea.

18
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:46,920
- Colonel O'Neill, report.
- We're good, sir, but not much of a view.

19
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:50,556
- What about suit integrity?
- The hazmats could withstand

20
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:53,878
12 hours of exposure
before any serious degradation.

21
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:58,199
Not a problem, sir. We can make
it to the dome and back inside an hour.

22
00:02:58,287 --> 00:03:00,676
Understood. Hammond out.

23
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:16,004
- Picking up a static charge.
- Yeah, I can feel it.

24
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:22,402
So what do we do,
just walk through?

25
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:26,446
- The MALP met no resistance.
- But it disappeared.

26
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:32,443
It did transmit for a while before we lost
the signal, which suggests it got through.

27
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:07,921
I'm reading normal atmosphere -
oxygen, nitrogen.

28
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:11,956
We're clean, too.

29
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:15,642
Seems the barrier scrubbed
the suits when we passed through.

30
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:20,960
The inside of the barrier
seems to be some kind of hologram.

31
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:23,800
You can feel the resistance.

32
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:27,800
That, combined with the static charge,
must act as a warning,

33
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:31,084
so you don't accidentally step through.

34
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,035
The MALP appears to be fully operational.

35
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:41,595
The barrier must block the signal.

36
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:46,836
This is an amazing piece of technology.

37
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:51,318
Permeable to solid objects, but won't
allow the poisonous atmosphere in.

38
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:55,002
We really need to study this further.

39
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,605
All right, come on out. Let's go.

40
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,364
Hello.

41
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:29,761
We're not gonna hurt you.

42
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:34,597
- You came from outside.
- Yes, we did.

43
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:37,918
- What's your name?
- What's yours?

44
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:40,396
I asked you first.

45
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:45,483
- I'm called Nevin.
- Hello, Nevin.

46
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:49,355
I'm Jack. That's Sam, Daniel and Teal'c.

47
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,920
You wear strange clothes.

48
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:56,237
You caught us on a bad day.

49
00:05:56,327 --> 00:06:00,081
- Nevin, where are your parents?
- My father's in the town.

50
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:04,365
- Can you show us?
- We just want to talk to him.

51
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,597
Maybe we could trade.

52
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:30,517
You know, sir, we probably could have
found the town without his help.

53
00:06:57,687 --> 00:07:00,326
- Nevin?
- I found some people in the garden.

54
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:03,797
Jack, Sam, Daniel and Teal'c.

55
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:10,837
- I'm Kendrick, Nevin's father.
- I assume you don't get many visitors.

56
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:14,840
We thought we were the only survivors.

57
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:17,521
Survivors of what, exactly?

58
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,995
You'd better speak to the council.

59
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:36,681
- You came from outside the dome?
- That's right.

60
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:42,000
But the atmosphere is toxic. Anyone who
went outside would die almost instantly.

61
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:46,558
- We wore protective suits.
- But where do you come from, originally?

62
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:51,721
From a planet called Earth.
It's about 6,000 light years from here.

63
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:56,119
- You came in a spaceship?
- No, we came through the Stargate.

64
00:07:56,207 --> 00:08:01,679
It's that big, circular object with symbols
carved on it. It's right outside the dome.

65
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:08,484
- There must be a historical reference to...
- One moment, please.

66
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:23,198
The Gate of Mahg Mar.
Discovered 563 years ago.

67
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:27,121
Believed to have been of significance
in the worship of Goddess Morrigan.

68
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:31,120
Taken from Danaan and displayed
in the National Museum of History.

69
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:35,166
- So you do know about the gate?
- We do now.

70
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:41,199
We've accessed the relevant information
through the Link.

71
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,404
It's a direct neural interface
with a databank.

72
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:45,556
Ow.

73
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:48,480
The Link contains
the sum total of our knowledge -

74
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:51,445
all our history, our culture,
our science. Everything.

75
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:54,325
You can call up this information
whenever you need it?

76
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,398
Precisely.

77
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:08,205
Think this'll work?

78
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:11,757
The signal was lost only when
the transmitter crossed the barrier.

79
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:16,762
We need only manoeuvre the MALP
into the correct position.

80
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,206
Nice.

81
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:30,160
We have a scheduled
radio contact with SG-1, sir.

82
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:32,886
Dial the gate.

83
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:37,237
SG-1, this is General Hammond. Come in.

84
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:41,078
Yes, sir. We read you, loud and clear.

85
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:44,204
- Loud and clear.
- Colonel O'Neill, report.

86
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:47,643
It turns out this planet's
not so dead after all, sir.

87
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:50,002
- I take it the dome's inhabited.
- Yes, sir.

88
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:54,478
So far the natives are very friendly,
if a bit odd, if you know what I mean.

89
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:58,606
- Will they share information?
- They'll show Carter the technical stuff.

90
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:01,838
In the meantime,
they've offered to put us up for the night.

91
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:04,600
All right, next contact in 24 hours.

92
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,917
Yes, sir.

93
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,155
Thank you.

94
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:50,522
- What?
- How many planets have you been to?

95
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:55,282
I don't know. Lots.

96
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:57,881
- More than ten?
- Yeah.

97
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,844
- More than 20?
- Yes.

98
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,440
- More than 30?
- Yeah.

99
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,085
- More than 40?
- Yes.

100
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:04,441
- More than 50?
- Maybe.

101
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,757
Nevin...

102
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:09,361
Let the poor man eat.

103
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:12,007
It's more than 50, isn't it?

104
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,603
You think it's too late to pitch a tent?

105
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:33,078
- Are you sure you've had enough to eat?
- Yes, it was delicious.

106
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,556
You've obviously no trouble growing food.

107
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:39,765
- Everything in the dome is self-sufficient.
- What about power?

108
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:43,044
We draw energy from geothermal vents
beneath the town.

109
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:45,322
Tomorrow I can show you the generators.

110
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:48,797
Pallan's one of the technicians
who maintains the system.

111
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:53,483
Your level of architecture seems to be
out of step with your level of technology.

112
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,876
Technology destroyed our world.

113
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:59,437
The dome was created because
industrial growth poisoned the air.

114
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:05,523
Our people were dying, so the survivors
made a choice to simplify their lives.

115
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:10,397
We have environmental problems. If we
learned your history, it might help us.

116
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:15,766
The easiest way for you to learn
about our history is through the Link.

117
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:17,917
- Is that possible?
- Of course.

118
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:21,522
Thousands of historical books are on file.

119
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:26,479
Maybe that isn't such a good idea.

120
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:32,363
We don't know if our brain physiology
is compatible with the technology.

121
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:33,926
Ah.

122
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:38,157
Thanks. Maybe later.

123
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,763
Hello, Nevin.

124
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:16,716
I'm not Nevin. I'm Colonel O'Neill
from Stargate Command.

125
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:21,362
All right, Colonel O'Neill.

126
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:26,005
Will you please take off my hood?

127
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:32,362
Nevin, time for school.
Go to your room and access your lessons.

128
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,837
When I grow up, can I be an explorer?

129
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:39,236
We'll talk about it later.

130
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:51,682
- None of you has been out of the dome?
- Not in over 400 years.

131
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:55,316
We monitor the levels of toxicity,
but we've never seen it.

132
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:58,399
- What's it like?
- It's not very pretty.

133
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:03,561
I've seen images on the Link of a great
city with tall buildings of glass and steel.

134
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:07,435
I'm afraid there's not much left but rubble.

135
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:09,518
I suppose...

136
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:13,047
that's why they created this.

137
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,801
So we're not always reminded
of what happened.

138
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,766
A pretty convincing illusion.
I'd love to see how it's made.

139
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:31,240
The control room's underground,
but the entrance is this way.

140
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:52,046
As you can see, Major, we haven't
abandoned technology altogether.

141
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:53,924
Yeah.

142
00:15:57,007 --> 00:16:02,764
If using the Link is out of the question,
then this is your only option.

143
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:11,517
We don't have much need
for books any more.

144
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:17,687
These are all that's left from the old world.

145
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:21,680
Interesting. The writing's similar
to a language we've seen before.

146
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:24,440
Can you translate it?

147
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:26,518
With your help?

148
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:28,643
Let's get started.

149
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:37,719
Atmospheric analysis,
dome integrity, power utilisation.

150
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:39,877
Very impressive.

151
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:45,644
If you don't mind, I just have
to check the coolant pressure. Please.

152
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,964
Pallan.

153
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:59,357
This looks like some kind of religious text.

154
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:01,244
Evalla?

155
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:04,844
Evalla.

156
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:06,724
Pallan?

157
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:14,479
Yes?

158
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,365
- Are you OK?
- Of course.

159
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:19,358
Let me see.

160
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:30,756
- Did you see that?
- See what?

161
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:34,078
The screens became filled
with some sort of streaming code.

162
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:38,604
Impossible. They always display
the status of these systems.

163
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:43,681
- I know what I saw, Pallan.
- I'm afraid you must be mistaken.

164
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:59,885
- So, what do we know?
- Well, their technology's incredible.

165
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:05,963
Pallan and I are rigging up a computer
interface to download some of the specs.

166
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:16,005
- Do they wish anything in return?
- Apparently not.

167
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:21,844
- They seem happy with their situation.
- It makes no sense. They live in a bubble.

168
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:24,760
They've managed to survive
for over 400 years.

169
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:27,884
Sometimes there is more to life
than mere survival.

170
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,765
We could offer them relocation.

171
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:34,001
Yeah, I suppose.

172
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:39,244
- Are you suggesting we leave the dome?
- We're just saying it's possible.

173
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,046
There are many worlds
where your people can live.

174
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:46,245
- But we have all we need right here.
- Except room to grow.

175
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:49,637
We're talking about fresh water,
fresh air, mountains, trees.

176
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,525
We can experience all these things
through the Link.

177
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:54,916
You've gotta be kidding me.

178
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:59,842
It is a very generous offer, Colonel,
but this is our home.

179
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:02,521
What about the other folks in the town?

180
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:05,075
Some of them have to think differently.

181
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:09,763
The council speaks for the town,
and the council's decision is unanimous.

182
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:15,365
What about the other council member,
the woman that was here?

183
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:19,201
There hasn't been a woman
on the council since the last election.

184
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:21,323
And that was two years ago.

185
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:23,796
What? There was
a woman here yesterday.

186
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:29,962
Colonel, I can assure you, the council
has always consisted of three members.

187
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:51,561
I spoke to Pallan. He has no memory of
there ever being a fourth council member.

188
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:53,683
She was just there yesterday.

189
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:56,042
Maybe the Link
has something to do with this.

190
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:58,925
If it can download data
into people's brains,

191
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:03,762
maybe it can also be used
to alter their perceptions or memories.

192
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:08,244
Perhaps she opposed the others
and they got rid of her.

193
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:11,444
So they erased her from existence?
Seems a little harsh.

194
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:14,644
The bottom line is
we can't trust these people.

195
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:17,958
I'd still like to finish my research
on the dome technology.

196
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,959
Maybe something in the archive
can shed some light on it.

197
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:26,599
The behaviour of the people does seem
odd, but they don't appear to be a threat.

198
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:31,039
All right, see what you can find out.

199
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:44,165
How's it coming?

200
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:49,116
I still can't find any historical reference to
the time period when the dome was built.

201
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,767
By then, our people
had begun using the Link.

202
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:56,363
It's possible not much written material
survives from that era.

203
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,677
Let me ask you something.

204
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:07,285
If you had a chance to leave the dome and
live on another planet, would you take it?

205
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,325
Pallan told me about the talk
you had with the council.

206
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:14,161
- And?
- We have everything we need right here.

207
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:16,044
That's what they said.

208
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:20,518
We hope someday the poison'll dissipate
and we'll be able to reclaim the planet.

209
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:23,804
- But not in your lifetime.
- No.

210
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:27,402
What about children? Don't you
and Pallan want to have a family?

211
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,160
Of course.

212
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,522
But there must be population controls.

213
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:35,804
- A couple's allowed a maximum of two.
- You're OK with that?

214
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:40,165
Limited resources dictate we maintain
the population at a certain level.

215
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:44,479
- How many people are we talking about?
- At this precise moment?

216
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:46,842
1,373.

217
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,516
And what would happen
if someone decided to break the rules

218
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:55,326
and have more than two children?

219
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:57,318
I don't know.

220
00:21:57,407 --> 00:21:59,398
No one ever has.

221
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:09,682
Try the interface now.

222
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:12,798
We got it.

223
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:20,279
You believe this technology
will be useful on your world?

224
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:23,120
Why don't you and your wife
come see for yourselves?

225
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:24,720
Oh.

226
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:26,798
Just for a visit.

227
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:30,804
- Do you have oceans?
- Oceans, deserts, rainforests.

228
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:34,846
- It would take a lifetime to see it all.
- It sounds wonderful.

229
00:22:34,927 --> 00:22:36,918
Wait a minute.

230
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:42,204
- These are the power utilisation figures?
- That's right.

231
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:46,724
- What's a normal variation?
- Between 0.01 and 0.07%.

232
00:22:46,807 --> 00:22:48,877
Well, then, we've got a problem.

233
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,323
These levels are 2% lower
than when we first came down here.

234
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:54,398
No, that can't be.

235
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:03,441
No, you're mistaken.
These figures are within normal range.

236
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:07,725
- Do you have this morning's readings?
- Of course.

237
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:12,963
You see? No variation.

238
00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:16,643
This is wrong.

239
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:20,879
- These measurements are foreign to you.
- Doesn't mean I can't recognise a drop.

240
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:25,563
Major, I can access 400 years of recorded
power utilisation figures on the Link.

241
00:23:25,647 --> 00:23:28,320
There's never been
more than a 0.1% variation.

242
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,604
Hypothetically speaking, if there was,

243
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:34,520
would it threaten
the integrity of the force field?

244
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:38,043
I suppose it might, but it's never come up.

245
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,444
Colonel O'Neill!

246
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:54,076
Is it true you've offered to take us
through the gate to another world?

247
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,919
Yeah, that's right.

248
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:58,760
Then Nevin and I will come with you.

249
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:03,557
I see the way he is with you. I realise he
deserves more than this world can offer.

250
00:24:03,647 --> 00:24:07,037
Are you certain?
This is not a decision to be taken lightly.

251
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:08,924
I want my son to be in a world

252
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:14,604
where the sky and the clouds aren't
part of an illusion created by computer.

253
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,882
That's good enough for me.

254
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:25,844
- Colonel, come in.
- Go ahead.

255
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:30,079
Sir, I've run some calculations here
and I've discovered something.

256
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,566
O'Neill.

257
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,556
Sir, are you reading me?

258
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:41,043
- Carter, the MALP's gone.
- Say again?

259
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:45,166
The MALP is no longer parked
where we parked it.

260
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:48,364
Someone does not wish us
to communicate with SGC.

261
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:52,201
That's not our only problem.
The dome is losing power.

262
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:56,883
I noticed a discrepancy with output levels,
but the computer data showed no change.

263
00:24:56,967 --> 00:25:02,519
I converted the units and compared the
current levels with yesterday's readings.

264
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:03,596
And?

265
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:08,317
In the last 24 hours
there's been almost a 4% drop.

266
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,796
If this continues, the dome will fail.

267
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:13,685
- How much time?
- It's hard to say.

268
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:16,884
But when it does
everyone here will die.

269
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:40,684
Evalla?

270
00:25:56,807 --> 00:26:01,198
The computer's giving me new data.
The power level is definitely dropping.

271
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:04,882
Major Carter,
should we not warn the townspeople?

272
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:06,958
I'm not sure we'd convince them.

273
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:09,436
Our only evidence is the readings,

274
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:13,122
and, for some reason,
Pallan couldn't see they were changing.

275
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:15,198
Maybe he's in on it.

276
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:17,124
I don't think so.

277
00:26:17,207 --> 00:26:23,476
I think his memories are being altered.
The same may hold true for the others.

278
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:27,284
Evalla!

279
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:36,044
Evalla!

280
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:16,686
I called out to her and she ignored me.
It was like she was in a trance.

281
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:19,201
Perhaps she was
under the influence of the Link.

282
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:22,120
Who knows what level
of manipulation is possible?

283
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,517
- So... brainwashing?
- That's one way of putting it.

284
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:28,838
We have to help them.
They're being held against their will.

285
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:34,001
As long as they've got those things on,
they won't be convinced of anything.

286
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,203
Is it possible to disable the Link?

287
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,801
The same computer system
controls the dome.

288
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:43,119
If we tamper with it, we risk
bringing the whole force field down.

289
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:46,040
However, if I could use the computer
to access the Link,

290
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:48,721
maybe I could reprogram
the data being sent out.

291
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:51,241
Do a little brainwashing of our own.

292
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:53,887
The only problem is, I need Pallan's help.

293
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:58,040
If I can find historical evidence
in the library that contradicts the Link,

294
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:00,595
some people may believe
they're being lied to.

295
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:05,203
The records of council meetings will show
there used to be over three members.

296
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:07,084
Exactly.

297
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:14,164
All right. You two do what you do.

298
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:18,035
Teal'c, you and I
are late for a radio contact.

299
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:28,996
Colonel O'Neill!

300
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:30,884
Where are you going?

301
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:34,596
Back to the house.
We need those special outfits we had.

302
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:38,646
- The house is this way.
- You are mistaken. It is in that direction.

303
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:42,561
There's nothing over there.
It's the edge of the dome.

304
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:45,722
Come on, I'll show you.

305
00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:03,323
Here it is. See?
Right where you left it.

306
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:12,998
Hey.

307
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:16,875
- Is this where we slept last night?
- It is not.

308
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,358
What's going on here?

309
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:23,798
Colonel.

310
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:27,675
- Are you going back to Earth now?
- No, we were just gonna send a message.

311
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:32,045
- Don't worry. We won't leave without you.
- Excuse me?

312
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:35,642
Anyone who wants to leave
is welcome to come with us.

313
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:38,605
Why would I leave?

314
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:42,316
You desire to live in a world
where the sky is not artificial.

315
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:46,002
You must have me mistaken
for someone else.

316
00:29:48,007 --> 00:29:50,885
Nevin, you wanted to be
an explorer, right?

317
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:54,039
I'm going to be a gardener, like my father.

318
00:29:55,847 --> 00:29:59,806
- You are under the influence of the Link.
- What are you talking about?

319
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:03,675
- Those things on your head - lose 'em.
- No, no.

320
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,598
Yes.

321
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:08,520
They're messing with your mind.
Get rid of 'em.

322
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:13,840
- The Link gives us everything we need.
- Just take it off a minute. Just flick it off.

323
00:30:13,927 --> 00:30:15,440
I can't!

324
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:19,156
To be disconnected from the Link
would cause instant death.

325
00:30:19,247 --> 00:30:23,877
Now, see, that's something
you've never said before.

326
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:27,277
Colonel, I think you should leave now.

327
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:37,405
- Carter, what's your status?
- I'm on my way to the control room.

328
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:41,162
Well, watch yourself.
They got to Kendrick.

329
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:52,278
I've almost finished
downloading the generator design.

330
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:55,245
- Pallan, we need to talk.
- All right.

331
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:58,876
Do you remember earlier I said
I noticed a drop in the power levels?

332
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:01,561
I remember you being mistaken.

333
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:05,643
What about now?
Do you notice any change?

334
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:08,321
- Power levels are constant.
- No, they're not.

335
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:12,685
It's just that every time these screens are
updated, the data on the Link is as well.

336
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:15,759
It alters your memory,
so you don't see what's happening.

337
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:17,599
Major, this is absurd.

338
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:21,316
Pallan, the dome is failing.

339
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:25,719
- I told you you're mistaken.
- No. I am not mistaken.

340
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:31,242
If you don't help me warn the others, you,
Evalla and everyone in this city will die.

341
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,921
- Who?
- Evalla, your wife.

342
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:40,081
Major, I don't know what's come over you,
but I've never been married.

343
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,516
I need you to disconnect yourself
from the Link.

344
00:32:11,607 --> 00:32:13,598
That's insane.

345
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:16,520
You believe that
removing that node will kill you.

346
00:32:16,607 --> 00:32:20,486
- I've known that since childhood.
- Evalla removed hers. Nothing happened.

347
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:24,276
- Who is this Evalla?
- I told you. She's your wife!

348
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:26,483
Your memories of her have been altered,

349
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:29,764
just as you've been kept
from realising the dome's dying.

350
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:34,762
I thought the council was responsible, but
the changes are happening too quickly.

351
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:37,998
I think it's automatic.
The computer makes changes,

352
00:32:38,087 --> 00:32:41,716
then updates the memories of everyone,
so no one's the wiser.

353
00:32:41,807 --> 00:32:45,959
- Pallan, you have to disconnect.
- That would be suicide.

354
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:50,563
No. That's just a lie
that's been planted by the computer.

355
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:56,882
We need to reprogram the Link to
convince the others, but I need your help.

356
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:58,958
- No.
- Sam!

357
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,204
- Got it.
- What is that?

358
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:09,882
Legal documents.
All I can say is, thank God for lawyers.

359
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:13,880
When everyone else was converting
to the Link, they still used paper.

360
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:18,563
When the dome was made, you all signed
a contract on land ownership rights.

361
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:20,638
Look at the number.

362
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:24,639
- That can't be.
- There were originally 100,000 people.

363
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:27,719
Impossible. The dome
can't sustain that many.

364
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:31,117
- Not any more.
- Oh, my God.

365
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:34,404
I thought the power loss
would cause the dome to fail,

366
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:37,877
but the computer found a way
to compensate. The dome is shrinking.

367
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:42,597
That's what happened to the MALP. It's
where we left it, but now on the outside.

368
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,564
Wait a minute.

369
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:49,357
If there were over 100,000 people
living here, where did they all go?

370
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:08,604
O'Neill.

371
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:31,443
There are other remains, but the bones
have been eaten by the corrosive air.

372
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,837
I understand why
you're reluctant to believe us, Pallan.

373
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:49,966
Things in your head must seem like
memories of a lifetime, but they're not.

374
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:53,756
Yesterday you didn't know disconnecting
from the Link could be fatal.

375
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:57,317
- You're lying.
- These documents are over 400 years old.

376
00:34:57,407 --> 00:35:01,798
They're in your language. How could we
fake this? Why would we fake this?

377
00:35:01,887 --> 00:35:05,846
They only exist because the computer
did not foresee outside interference.

378
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:09,442
- To anyone on the Link, they're irrelevant.
- But why?

379
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:12,439
The computer is programmed
to maintain the community.

380
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,325
Individuals were sacrificed
for the good of the whole,

381
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:20,481
only each time someone vanished no one
noticed because all memory was erased.

382
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:22,559
Please.

383
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:25,559
No.

384
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:28,480
- It's all right.
- No.

385
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:30,558
I...

386
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:38,922
You see?

387
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:43,755
Now we need your help.

388
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:51,446
- What's your status?
- Pallan's trying to access the Link.

389
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:55,918
- We might be able to reprogram it.
- Understood. We're coming to you.

390
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:08,035
- What did I do?
- It's another update.

391
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:23,605
Nevin, I want you to stay here.

392
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:25,405
Father?

393
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:27,876
Is Colonel O'Neill sick?

394
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:31,323
Yes, but we're gonna make him better.

395
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:04,918
What is it?

396
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:09,558
These systems are so complicated.
I'm not sure I know what I'm doing.

397
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:11,877
You've been doing this your whole life.

398
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:15,084
You just have to try
to remember the old-fashioned way.

399
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,964
Right.

400
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:33,485
- Maybe not that way.
- Agreed.

401
00:37:39,327 --> 00:37:41,443
Let's keep moving.

402
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:47,324
- Carter, we may have a problem.
- They're controlled by the computer, sir.

403
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:05,604
O'Neill.

404
00:38:05,687 --> 00:38:07,279
Hey.

405
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:14,566
Everything's gonna be all right, Colonel.

406
00:38:14,647 --> 00:38:16,638
These are for you.

407
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:20,564
I don't think so.

408
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:27,079
You've been disconnected from the Link.
You're not well.

409
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,158
Let us help you.

410
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:33,165
Carter, now would be a good time.

411
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:43,960
- I'm in. What do I tell them?
- There's no time to explain everything.

412
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:47,119
Try to erase all memory of us completely.

413
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:58,482
- Don't make me shoot you.
- You're not yourself, Colonel.

414
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:01,604
Without the Link,
your mind is playing tricks on you.

415
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:42,358
Who are you?

416
00:39:45,727 --> 00:39:47,718
I did it.

417
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:12,562
We ran tests on the geothermal vents
that supply the town's power.

418
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:15,115
They started to cool about 200 years ago.

419
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:19,246
The dome started shrinking
some time after that.

420
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:24,082
We should have the whole town
relocated in a couple of days.

421
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,761
I think I'm going to miss this garden.

422
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:30,601
- How much longer'll the force field last?
- It's difficult to say.

423
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:35,124
Even with less surface area to maintain,
power would have failed eventually.

424
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:39,405
And in the meantime,
more of us would have disappeared.

425
00:40:39,487 --> 00:40:42,160
You still don't remember her, do you?

426
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:43,646
No.

427
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,206
You know, in a way, I envy the others.

428
00:40:47,287 --> 00:40:52,236
They all must have lost somebody,
but I'm the only one who knows for sure.

429
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:56,843
How do you mourn someone
when you can't even picture her face?

430
00:40:56,927 --> 00:41:00,124
I'm sorry, Pallan. I wish I could help.

431
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:04,241
Maybe you can.

432
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:06,124
How?

433
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,436
Tell me about her.

434
00:41:16,447 --> 00:41:18,358
