1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,999
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,537
Where the hell are they?

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,606
(GRUNTS)

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:12,075
We've been investigating the Goa'uld
infiltration of the Trust for two years now.

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,975
I'm telling you it's a global conspiracy.

6
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,775
What are you guys saying?

7
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:17,143
You think that I've been brainwashed.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,243
The technology is readily available
to the Goa'uld who infiltrated the Trust.

9
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,395
You made good time, Colonel.

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:38,164
Yes, sir. Well, it's a good thing I left early.
I took a wrong turn at the post office,

11
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,172
I was driving for about an hour before
my Special Forces training kicked in

12
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,265
and I realized I was lost.

13
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,775
That, and the road ended.

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,937
Wiser men than you have done worse.

15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,277
So, this is General O'Neill's place?

16
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,179
Actually, Jack hasn't been able
to use it much,

17
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,445
now that he spends a lot of time
in Washington.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,787
His loss.

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,855
Come on in.

20
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,521
Looks like I beat the others up here.

21
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:02,025
Walter just called. Colonel Reynolds'
team has been delayed offworld.

22
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,618
Teal'c's gone to assist.

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,697
Is there a problem?

24
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,493
Nothing they can't handle.

25
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,796
Unfortunately, it also means
that Colonel Carter will be delayed

26
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,633
until Reynolds gets back
to take command of the SGC.

27
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,899
What about Jackson?

28
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,201
Still in England.

29
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:19,301
Seems he's met some lord or earl
with a private library

30
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,505
of ancient reference material on Merlin

31
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,811
and Morgan Le Fay.
He's obviously quite excited.

32
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,946
Yeah. Like a fat kid in a candy store.

33
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,182
I was a big boy in my youth.

34
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,186
Never did appreciate comments like that.

35
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,689
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

36
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,025
Anyway, Vala's hitching a ride
with the others,

37
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,621
so until then, it's just you and me.

38
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:43,766
I'll be sure to stay out of your way, sir.
You won't even know I'm here.

39
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,962
Nonsense!

40
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,002
Getting to know each other
a little better outside of work

41
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,202
and the pressure of the SGC
is what this is all about.

42
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,939
Kick back. Put our feet up for the day.

43
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,138
Well, that's kind of hard to do
with the fate of the galaxy

44
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,910
hanging in the balance, sir.

45
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:01,475
Well, if anyone is going to make
a difference in this battle, Colonel,

46
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,453
it's you and your team.

47
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,059
Yes, sir. I see what you mean
about escaping the pressure.

48
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,855
We all need to stop for air now and then,

49
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,455
or we'll burn out.

50
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,690
That's the one thing you people
don't know how to do,

51
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,628
so I'm making it an order.

52
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,266
Yes, sir.

53
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,997
I'm sure it'll be fun, sir.

54
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,073
You're damn right it'll be fun.

55
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,675
Come on in.

56
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,408
LANDRY: I've got the coffee on.

57
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,991
REYNOLDS: The first villager went missing
sometime yesterday morning.

58
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,755
Another by nightfall.

59
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:47,060
They sent out search parties, armed men.
These people are capable hunters.

60
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,226
By all accounts, they've lived
on this planet for generations

61
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,396
and never encountered an animal they
perceived as an unmanageable threat.

62
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,633
Perhaps it was not an animal.

63
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,743
So if an animal didn't tear these people
apart, what did?

64
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,257
The people of P9J 333
have never before encountered

65
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,160
an indigenous creature they believe
capable of such an act.

66
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,524
So, you think this is some sort of
motivational tool meant to strike fear?

67
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,863
An Ori bogeyman?

68
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,403
It seems to be working.
The people are terrified.

69
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,200
Any chance the Prior knew
you were there?

70
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,366
I doubt this was a message directed at us.

71
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,843
Our mission was to covertly observe
if the planet went Origin or not.

72
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,379
We didn't make contact
with the population

73
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,039
until after people started going missing.

74
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,108
Okay. Well, if this is some new Ori threat,
chances are the Prior will show up

75
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,346
to take responsibility.

76
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,888
On the other hand, if it's not,

77
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,016
and it's just some vicious creature
hell-bent on eating the whole village,

78
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,392
shouldn't we use our superior technology
to help track it down?

79
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,730
You think I don't really care about
the plight of some innocent people

80
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,100
I've never met
on some planet somewhere.

81
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,330
CARTER: I'm sorry, but...

82
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,729
Well, yes.

83
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,934
It just so happens
I do have vast experience

84
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,376
hunting rare deadly creatures of all kinds.

85
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,474
Let me guess, the rarer they are...

86
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,742
Please. I am here to be helpful.

87
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,915
If you don't think these boys
can use my expertise, that's fine.

88
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,784
I'll just stay here, and we can start
on that quality time

89
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,450
General Landry wanted us
to spend together.

90
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,393
I've actually come up
with a list of suggestions.

91
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,591
Teal'c, you and Vala head to 333
with SGs 3 and 25.

92
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,757
See if you can figure out
what we're dealing with

93
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,563
without being detected by the locals.

94
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,795
Good plan, boss.

95
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,933
Vala's experience notwithstanding, I want
everyone to exercise extreme caution.

96
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,341
We should find out
whether this is Prior related or not.

97
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,241
Is General Landry not expecting us
at his cabin?

98
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,817
I'll let him know we're going to be
delayed a little bit.

99
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,149
I'm sure Colonel Mitchell will be
very pleased to hear

100
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,882
he's got more special "alone time"
with the General.

101
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,358
- Hey...
- Colonel.

102
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:07,528
If this is a rare and deadly creature,
we have to try and catch it alive, okay?

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,024
That is not our mission.

104
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,399
Do you have any idea what this could
be worth on the open market?

105
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,369
- I do not.
- Okay, okay, wait.

106
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,270
I propose a fifty-fifty split.
I think it's only fair.

107
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,709
I'm the one with all the contacts
to unload something like this.

108
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,178
Anything less than that
would just be, well, plain wrong.

109
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,278
Okay, name your price.

110
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,789
Well, say something.
It's called negotiating?

111
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,417
They're not coming.

112
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:43,801
Something is eating people on P9J 333.
Teal'c and Vala are checking it out.

113
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,166
- Really? Maybe I should...
- At ease, Colonel.

114
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,002
They've got SG-3 and 5 with them.
They'll be fine.

115
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,236
Still, this was supposed to be
a group thing, sir.

116
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,333
Maybe we should reschedule.

117
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,310
And put away that laptop.

118
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,848
You can't possibly
still be writing mission reports.

119
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,941
And if you are, I don't want to read
anything that long.

120
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,882
To be honest, sir, I finished an hour ago.

121
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,046
I thought so.

122
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:08,255
You don't have to be so uncomfortable
around me, Mitchell.

123
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,193
Sir, no matter what, you're still my boss.

124
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:15,629
I just wish you'd relax and enjoy
the peace and quiet of the great outdoors.

125
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,929
(GUN FIRING)

126
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,401
Ignore it.

127
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,066
That was a large caliber, .300 or.338.

128
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,871
They're hunting elk. It's one
of the only drawbacks around here.

129
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,404
Not a fan, sir?

130
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,536
Running around the woods with a gun

131
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,946
never seemed to me
like a good way to unwind.

132
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,982
Looking to kill some innocent creature
just going about its day?

133
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,454
No, I suppose not, sir.
Not if your day job involves

134
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,855
running around the woods carrying a gun.

135
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,245
Recognize the tracks?

136
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:07,886
I do not.

137
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,082
What we need to do first is dig a deep pit.

138
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,650
This looks like a very good spot.

139
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,760
Why don't you boys get started?

140
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,726
What?

141
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,962
Don't tell me you didn't bring shovels.

142
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,299
(GUN FIRING)

143
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,998
<i>(ON RADIO) This is SG-25 leader!</i>
<i>We need back...</i>

144
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,169
(MEN SCREAMING IN DISTANCE)

145
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,593
It came out of nowhere.

146
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,828
Never seen anything like it.

147
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,181
Remain calm. You will be fine.

148
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,375
(ROARING)

149
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,484
Come.

150
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,523
(THUNDER CRASHING)

151
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,324
Checkmate.

152
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,921
Yep. Too good for me, sir.

153
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,529
Pandering to the ego
of a senior officer, Mitchell?

154
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:33,868
No, truthfully, I always hated the game,
but if you happen to have a PlayStation,

155
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,703
I will happily kick your ass at SOCOM 3.

156
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:37,776
Good.

157
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,875
I want you to feel
like you can be honest with me.

158
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,947
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,607
But I suppose that's easier for me
than it is for you.

160
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,242
I am the General.

161
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,719
No, I think it's probably harder
for you in some ways.

162
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,455
Lonely at the top and all that, huh?

163
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,353
No. More not knowing what people think
of your decisions.

164
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,631
Relax, son.

165
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:06,165
I was thinking
about what you said to me last week,

166
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,968
about not being in charge of anything.

167
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,339
I'm just used to a clearer
chain of command.

168
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,309
You could have picked
any team you wanted.

169
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,607
You chose to make it
your personal mission

170
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:20,046
to get Colonel Carter, Dr. Jackson
and Teal'c back together.

171
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,143
That's true, and I wouldn't change that
for the world.

172
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,154
You said you wanted to learn
from the very best.

173
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,690
Yes, I did. It's just...

174
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,025
After almost dying, like I did,

175
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,692
there was a part of me that figured

176
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,198
I could do anything.

177
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,038
Now, since coming to the SGC,
I have learned

178
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:45,539
that I can't handle any of this
without the rest of SG-1.

179
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,306
I believe in you, Colonel.

180
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,404
- Thank you, sir.
- But we're getting our asses kicked.

181
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,005
- Yes, we are.
- We're not going to get medals

182
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,516
- for participation.
- No, sir.

183
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,609
We win or we die.

184
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,411
I prefer winning.

185
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,887
Now, you started by bringing SG-1
back together.

186
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:06,192
I need you to continue working together
if we're going to have any hope.

187
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,662
Your job is to make sure that happens.

188
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,431
Very good, sir.

189
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,807
(GROWLING)

190
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,585
Okay.

191
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,158
You want some dessert?

192
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,891
Come and get it.

193
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,566
You could have warned me.
I nearly shot you.

194
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,367
Then you should not have run off
by yourself.

195
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,409
I'm perfectly capable
of looking after myself.

196
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,977
I was trying to get help.

197
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,874
Then why are you not dialing the gate?

198
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,448
Because I thought
I heard something growling.

199
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,710
I hear nothing.

200
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,649
That's probably because
you scared it away. That's good.

201
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,723
(GROWLING)

202
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,085
Now we can...

203
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,074
Well, I'm flattered, but I don't think
we have time for this.

204
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,164
Are you injured?

205
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,243
No, I'm fine.

206
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,514
Thank you.

207
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,592
So much for taking it alive.

208
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,127
Shame, too.

209
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,023
I've never seen anything like this before.

210
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,162
(THUNDER CRASHING)

211
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,074
Sir?

212
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:19,989
Sir!

213
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,123
Son of a bitch!

214
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,417
Mitchell! What are you doing?

215
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,627
I thought I heard a noise.

216
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,925
Me, too.

217
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,362
(MITCHELL LAUGHS)

218
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,200
Well, that would have been
a hell of a story, sir.

219
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,272
Yeah!

220
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,166
Shotgun, huh?

221
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,973
Thought you didn't like to hunt.

222
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,873
I was up here last summer.

223
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,773
Had a black bear come
right through the kitchen door.

224
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,808
Phones are down.

225
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,042
That happens.

226
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,153
Power could be out for a while, too.

227
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,222
That's quite a storm out there.

228
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:19,891
Thank you.

229
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,494
Well...

230
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,095
Night, sir.

231
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,263
Night, Mitchell.

232
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,836
General.

233
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,205
Listen,

234
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,903
maybe I'm not the only one around here
who needs to relax.

235
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,744
I'll try not to shoot you before morning.

236
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,242
Thank you, sir. Same here.

237
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,088
What's up, sir?

238
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,896
Going somewhere, Mitchell?

239
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,233
Yes, sir.

240
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,699
The phones are still down, power's out.
I figured we'd head back to reality today.

241
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,773
Unfortunately, the storm washed out
the road into town.

242
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,179
- The road...
- It's the only road in and out of here.

243
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,340
Looks like we're roughing it
until they get it cleared.

244
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,314
Yes, sir,
but you're a powerful Air Force General.

245
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,783
You could order us up a chopper.

246
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,218
We don't use helicopters for our own
personal transportation, Mitchell.

247
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,782
Right, sir.

248
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,952
Besides, I already checked.
There wasn't one available.

249
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,762
We'll be fine.

250
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,828
Just another day or so.

251
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,099
Okay. Thank you.

252
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,400
So, you'll be pleased to hear
that all four members of SG-25

253
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,979
are going to be fine,

254
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,413
thanks in part to my handiwork
with a Goa'uld healing device.

255
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,883
I'm sure Dr. Lam appreciates the help.

256
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,287
I see you haven't gotten over
your phobia of sitting

257
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,416
in General Landry's chair.

258
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,318
What are you doing?

259
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,565
I think it's about time a woman sat here.

260
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,468
Actually, Dr. Elizabeth Weir sat there
all the time when she ran the SGC.

261
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,833
She did?

262
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,768
Good for her.

263
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:26,712
So, now that the deadly creature
of P3-whatever has been dealt with,

264
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,843
when do we go?

265
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,012
I just got a call from
the Silver Creek Sheriff's Department.

266
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,987
Apparently, there was a bad storm
up there last night,

267
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,649
and the road leading up to the area
where the cabin is

268
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,250
washed out
and won't be reopened till tomorrow.

269
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,422
How unfortunate.

270
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,123
I'm sure Colonel Mitchell agrees.

271
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,495
I'm sure the boys are having
the time of their lives,

272
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,126
getting up to all sorts of mischief.

273
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,769
Oh, yeah, I can just imagine.

274
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,363
You're in for a treat, Colonel.

275
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,500
Yes, sir. I can see that.

276
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:57,104
The fulvous whistling duck. Very rare.
Endangered, actually.

277
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,275
Only spotted one once in my life.

278
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,287
And as good fortune would have it,
their mating season is right now,

279
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,548
and they love to come out
after a good rain.

280
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,656
That's a good one, sir.

281
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,058
You know what? The hat really sells it.

282
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,965
Oh, you're serious.

283
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,598
Well, sir, as tempting
as a duck that whistles sounds,

284
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,010
I was thinking about going for a run,
work off some of that beer from last night.

285
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,013
You're missing the opportunity
of a lifetime, Mitchell.

286
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,275
Are you making it an order?

287
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,979
Birding isn't something you have to have
in your soul, son.

288
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,088
You have to come to it on your own.

289
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,892
Well, I gotta be honest with you, sir.

290
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,262
I don't know that I have it in me.

291
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,126
The plaintive mating call of this duck

292
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,724
is unlike anything you've ever heard.

(IMITATES MATING CALL)

Permission to leave, sir?

295
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,722
Granted.

296
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,987

Dr. Redden has just begun
her examination.

299
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,712
She appears to be quite knowledgeable.

300
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,683
She should be. She's been heading up
the xenology unit at Area 51

for several years now.

And there goes my need for lunch.

mammal-like organs.

Unnatural-looking tumors
appear prevalent.

00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,829

Scans are picking up low levels
of radiation coming from within the body.

309
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,368
The location is somewhere
in the stomach lining here.

310
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,748
It looks like there's some kind of
extraneous sac or abscess

311
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,616
attached to the stomach wall itself.

REDDEN: So it seems our large dead friend
up in the lab used to look like this.

327
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:53,876
Native to P9J 333.
A docile herbivore, very shy,

328
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,011
and completely harmless,
according to the locals.

329
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,612
Well, it seems one of them, at least,
has had an identity crisis.

330
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,583
Yes, well, something caused
rapid and extensive mutation.

331
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,026
That something, I take it,
was creature number two.

332
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,097
Exactly.

333
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,492
This little fellow

334
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:11,198
apparently gives off a type of radiation
we've never encountered before.

335
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,897
It lodged itself in the stomach lining
of the host creature

336
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,974
and began altering the host's DNA.

337
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,976
Yet the inhabitants of P9J 333
claim to have never seen or heard

338
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,638
of any such mutation to any of the animals
on their planet.

339
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,782
Oh, well, I strongly doubt
that our smaller friend there

340
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,612
is indigenous to the planet.

341
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,850
So the question is,

342
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,581
how did it get there?

343
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,590
It was an animal, most likely a grizzly,
protecting its young.

344
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,253
The witness is pretty freaked out.

345
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,526
His friend just got mauled to death.
He said it was a bear.

346
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,894
He said "a bear or something."

347
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,866
I know it can get boring up here, Wade.

348
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,460
It doesn't mean
you have to go making up things

349
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,766
that are gonna get the locals all excited.

350
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,599
(CARS HONKING AND MEN HOOTING)

351
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,343
Guess it's a little late for that.

352
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,506
Seal off the park before the place
turns into a shooting gallery.

353
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,585
Look, I only got three deputies
working for me,

354
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,620
plus half a dozen volunteer rangers.

355
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,450
This is hunting season.

356
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:08,048
If I got a mad grizzly on the loose,
I need it dealt with.

357
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,716
Best that I can hope for

358
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,729
is that somebody kills whatever did this
before it kills again.

359
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,036
Lieutenant. You reported an emergency.

360
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,012
What happened?

361
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,204
Colonel, we've got a problem.

362
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:44,619
There have been no attacks of this nature
reported by any Jaffa settlements.

363
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,755
None of our other offworld allies
are reporting any such contacts, either.

364
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,964
Except we now have an attack
by yet another predatory creature,

365
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,060
this time on a completely different planet.

366
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,662
Not to mention a world
that's already been converted by the Ori.

367
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:59,301
If the inhabitants of P2R 866
have already accepted Origin,

368
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:03,040
there would be no need for the Priors
to inflict this creature upon them.

369
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,048
Exactly. Which means that the Ori

370
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,277
may have absolutely nothing to do
with these creatures.

371
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,650
- So where are they coming from?
- I don't know.

372
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,313
But so far, to the best of our knowledge,

373
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,584
they're only showing up
on worlds we visit.

374
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,896
This sheriff doesn't think we've got
a Bigfoot on our hands, does he?

375
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,056
He's a decent enough guy.

376
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,259
Probably just watches
too much television.

377
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,467
On the other hand, we have seen

378
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,602
real, live alien monsters.

379
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,435
He doesn't know that.

380
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:30,775
True.

381
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,570
But he could just be looking
for his 15 minutes.

382
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,647
He's not that sort of man.

383
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,550
Well it certainly would bring
some publicity to the area.

384
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:40,618
Bump up tourism.

385
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,346
Whatever his motivation is,
he sure got everyone's attention.

386
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,821
We've got a bunch of drunken hunters
out there, all hyped up,

387
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,824
looking for revenge and glory.

388
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,019
So are we siding with the hunters?

389
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:51,629
Or the bear?

390
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,732
I don't want to see anyone else get hurt.

391
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,367
Just checking, sir.

392
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,494
This I like, sir.

393
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,197
A man is dead, Colonel.

394
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,736
Yes, sir, I know, and I do sympathize.

395
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,003
It's just, you keep telling me to relax.

396
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,716
It has nothing to do
with being here with you, sir.

397
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,120
Truth is, if I sit around
with nothing to do, I get antsy.

398
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,483
I'm much more at ease offworld,
in the thick of it.

399
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,753
I was flying air support out of Bien Hoa.

400
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,388
Caught some triple-A in my left engine
and I had to eject.

401
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,693
Ended up landing somewhere
near the Laotian border,

402
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,668
well north of the DMZ.

403
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,268
Cut my knee up pretty good
in the process.

404
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,441
I was lost,

405
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:44,671
bleeding badly, no food, no radio.

406
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,651
Half a battalion
of North Vietnamese regulars

407
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,812
were combing the jungle looking for me.

408
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,647
Tracked me day and night.

409
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,818
Followed my blood trail.

410
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,464
Obviously, you got away, sir.

411
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,594
Took me eight days.

412
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,704
So that's why you don't like to hunt.

413
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,097
I never felt more alive.

414
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,733
Yes, sir.

415
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,776
But I wouldn't call it relaxing.

416
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,805
Well, I'm kind of twisted that way, sir.

417
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,621
<i>MAN ON RADIO: Sheriff Stokes, come in.</i>

418
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,029
<i>We're about a mile northwest</i>
<i>of Silver Creek Junction.</i>

419
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,863
<i>We found another body.</i>
<i>It's been torn to shreds.</i>

420
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:39,461
Colonel, respond.

421
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,902
I hear it, sir.

422
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,726
Colonel?

423
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,019
Victim number two.

424
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,972
The first mission, to P9J 333,

425
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,907
was simply to observe
and initiate first contact with the locals

426
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,671
should they reject the Ori.

427
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,408
The second mission, to P2R 866,
was purely covert surveillance

428
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,313
of an already converted planet.

429
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,783
Two completely different missions,

430
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,582
both to worlds not inhabited
by scary creatures of any kind.

431
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:34,455
Right. However, there was one single
common element to both missions.

432
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,995
Both required teams to remain
inconspicuous. Stealth was key.

433
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,294
Then both teams would have been
required to use a Sodan cloaking device

434
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,196
- in order to remain hidden.
- Exactly.

435
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:46,395
And we tested them for safety and started
deploying them on missions such as these

436
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,732
just over a week ago.

437
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,239
You think there's some sort of malfunction
with the devices?

438
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,003
Yes, but we have another problem.

439
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,742
I requested a complete recall
of all the Sodan cloaking devices,

440
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,940
including the ones still at Area 51.

441
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,110
Turns out one of them is missing.

442
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,060
No abnormal energy readings,
no power spikes.

443
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,131
All systems appear to be normal.

444
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,961
Looks like that one checks out, too.

445
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,559
How's it going?

446
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,638
Nothing yet.

447
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,301
Any word from Area 51?

448
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,535
Yeah. Agent Barrett called in
about an hour ago.

449
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,168
Said his team has detained everyone

450
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,270
<i>who had security clearance to the lab</i>
<i>where the devices were being held.</i>

451
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,046
We should have more answers
after he's finished questioning them.

452
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,945
So he's made a full recovery, then?

453
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,884
Well, he's cleared for duty,
but he still feels

454
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,478
<i>responsible for what happened.</i>

455
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,649
<i>VALA: Well, he was brainwashed.</i>
<i>It's hardly his fault.</i>

456
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,751
Still, he's determined
to find out how it happened

457
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,329
and catch those responsible.

458
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,897
<i>It is ironic that, not so long ago,</i>

459
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,966
the mere presence of the Goa'uld on Earth

460
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,398
would have been cause for great concern.

461
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:51,736
Seriously.

462
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,067
Who'd ever think
that we'd have bigger fish to fry?

463
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,173
Or that you'd use the word "ironic"
in a sentence?

464
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,104
Indeed.

465
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:04,306
<i>I am ready.</i>

466
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,508
Okay. Go for it.

467
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,750
Nothing.

468
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,979
(BEEPING)

469
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,524
Wait a second.

470
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,253
There's elevated radiation coming

471
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,226
<i>from within the area of the cloaking field.</i>

472
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,790
<i>Levels are climbing.</i>

473
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,212
A lot of activity out here, sir.

474
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:49,817
I told you. The last thing we need is
for this place to turn into the O.K. Corral.

475
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:50,895
(GUNS FIRING)

476
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,463
Or a vice-presidential bird hunt.

477
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,460
Hold fire!

478
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,831
Cease fire!

479
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,665
You boys want to tell me
what you're shooting at?

480
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,503
We saw something moving in there.

481
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,443
Hey, man, you crazy?
Where the hell's he going?

482
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,567
Turn that thing off.

483
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:37,805
Help me.

484
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,143
So you're sure you're okay?

485
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,408
I am fine, Colonel Carter.

486
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,313
No headaches? No nausea?
Nothing that might indicate

487
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,750
early symptoms
of sudden onset monsterism?

488
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,177
I am fine.

489
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,519
Actually, you are.

490
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:58,418
There's no signs of radiation poisoning,
no evidence of genetic manipulation...

491
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,395
I'm guessing this creature, whatever it is,

492
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,991
requires sustained close contact
in order to affect its victim's DNA.

493
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,230
Well, that's reassuring, for all of us.

494
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,805
Well, we're running some tests on it
right now,

495
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,008
but I would like to know more
about what actually happened.

496
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,270
But I would like to know more
about what actually happened.

497
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,004
You said it just appeared
inside the cloaking field?

498
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,773
And then it just sat there like a lump.

499
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,907
The one inside the stomach
of the mutated creature was quite active.

500
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,218
Yeah, I noticed. It practically attacked me.

501
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,914
And this one has actually been more
active recently in its containment tank.

502
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:29,720
I suppose it's possible it was temporarily
stunned by its transition to our dimension.

503
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,795
I'm sorry?

504
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,954
Well, that would explain
why the people using the cloaks

505
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,725
haven't been attacked by the creatures.

506
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,563
No, no, I meant
the "transition to our dimension" part.

507
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,271
The Sodan cloaking device emits
an energy field around the wearer

508
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:45,365
that puts them slightly out of phase
with our normal dimension of space-time.

509
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,934
Essentially, whoever is in the field
is accessing a pocket of subspace,

510
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,776
making them virtually undetectable.

511
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,851
So you think this creature
is from an alternate dimension,

512
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,011
and is essentially bleeding through?

513
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,417
Yeah. It's definitely possible.

514
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:01,117
Ancient technology has allowed us
to see extra-dimensional life forms before.

515
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:04,627
The Sodan were using these devices
for hundreds of years.

516
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,725
You'd think there'd at least be a label

Or, at least "Danger"

520
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:19,566
Perhaps the Sodan were not aware
of such a flaw in the technology.

521
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:23,780
CARTER: It's possible this wasn't even a
problem until we started using the devices.

522
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,316
I think I know why this is happening.

523
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,013
Actually, it went straight through.

524
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,989
Congratulations. You're going to be fine.

525
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,924

526
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,362
Yeah, you have. Hurts, don't it?

527
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,727
Don't worry, I had worse.

528
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,731
I'm bleeding to death here!
I need an ambulance.

529
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:48,301
Yeah, I can do that, as soon as I find out

530
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,637
what you're doing running around in
the woods with a Sodan cloaking device.

00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,705

533
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,917
you're connected to the Trust.

Evil snakes,

543
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,932
Do you know you're working for one?

544
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,341
That's who's running the Trust these days.

545
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,710
- You're crazy, man.
- Yeah.

546
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,682
That's what they keep telling me.

547
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,351
You know, they really should give you
a personal shield

548
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,421
to go with that cloaking device.

549
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,084
And half a brain.

550
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,458
We found a car filled with surveillance
and recording equipment

551
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,654
about half a mile from here.

552
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,789
I figure the most he learned
is that Mitchell is terrible at chess

553
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,596
and has some form of sleep apnea.
What else have you learned?

554
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,336
Well, sir, the reason the creatures
are entering our dimension is our fault.

555
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:57,574
How's that?

556
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,470
<i>When we first started using</i>
<i>the Sodan devices,</i>

557
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:00,566
<i>we noticed that they emitted</i>

558
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,407
a significant amount of radiation.

559
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,514
This is different from the radiation
given off

560
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,173
by the inter-dimensional creatures?

561
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,115
<i>Yes, sir, but not unrelated.</i>

562
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,813
We made modifications
to shield the radioactive emissions

563
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,288
in order to make the devices
safer for human use.

564
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,724
I'm guessing there was a practical reason
for the radioactive output.

565
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,863
<i>Dr. Redden tested the creatures</i>
<i>for a reaction to the radiation</i>

566
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,398
given off by the unshielded
cloaking devices.

567
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,858
They're repelled by it.

568
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,302
And the Sodan would have been protected
from the radioactivity

569
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,066
because of their symbiotes.

570
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,038
<i>Exactly, which is why they never had</i>
<i>this problem.</i>

571
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,107
We thought the radiation was
a coincidental byproduct

572
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,270
of the technology.

573
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:38,047
<i>When it was actually performing</i>
<i>a vital function.</i>

574
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:43,080
Do we have any idea how frequent
this dimensional breach might be?

575
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,856
No, sir. It appears to be
a random occurrence.

576
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,888
But given how long the Trust operative

577
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,984
was using the Sodan device
to stay hidden,

578
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,729
<i>I'd say that whatever's on the loose</i>
<i>in the woods around the cabin</i>

579

Then why am I not being allowed
to question him?

a bear in the name of national security?

In a nutshell.

600
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,880
Nice. How do we find it?

601
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,888
Well, I've calibrated a number
of handheld scanners to pick up

602
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,856
the creature's radioactive
energy signature.

603
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,827
We should be able to track it
within a 300-meter range.

604
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,827
We've also devised
a radioactive isotope package

605
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,092
that gives off an energy wave

606
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,828
similar to the ones emitted
by the Sodan cloaking devices.

607
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,664
We're air-dropping them in a perimeter
around the park.

608
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,773
It should stop the creature
from getting too far.

609
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,172
Isn't that dangerous for us?

610
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,210
Only if you come within 100 meters
of the package.

611
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,040
They have a decay rate
that will leave them inert

VALA: Right, so obviously, rule number one
when hunting savage beasts like this

616
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,390
is to never actually crawl
through the forest looking for them,

617
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:05,360
especially at night.
Always find a way to lure them to you.

618
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,722
So I suggest the best plan of attack

619
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:12,335
would be to plant these isotope packages

00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,109
A queen.

690
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,344
General, good timing. Colonel Mitchell
is about to run out of chips.

691
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,945
We need new blood.

692
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,190
Any word, sir?

693
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,851
Final ground sweeps have come up empty,

694
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:07,191
and although it is a big park,
our scanners do have a limited range,

695
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,492
so we're dropping a fresh
radioactive perimeter

696
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,934
and sealing off the area for another week
as a precaution.

697
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,768
I think it's unlikely
that there's a third creature, sir.

698
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,136
Care to place odds on that?

699
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,037
I'm not much of a gambler.

700
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,611
That is obvious.

701
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,274
Okay!

702
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,216
River comes up...

703
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,475
King of spades.

704
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:32,784
Possible Royal Marriage or King Kong
in the works.

705
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,824
There's way too much Poker Channel
going on here.

706
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,059
I'm out.

707
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,396
I'm all in.

708
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,972
I'm out.

709
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,907
A true warrior

710
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,484
knows when to fold 'em.

711
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,055
Really?

712
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,456
I won?

713
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,491
I was totally bluffing!

714
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,150
Well played, Colonel!

715
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:11,461
Thank you, sir.

716
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,688
A true warrior knows when to hold 'em.

717
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,287
She took you downtown, homeboy.

718
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,264
I'm glad to see
you're all having a good time.

719
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,666
Yes, sir. Last night was the best time
I've had since...

720
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:23,203
I don't know when, the look on your face
when I said, "Sir! Get down!"

721
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,379
What?

722
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,248
A hundred times,
the man has told me to relax.

723
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,609
Not that much.

724
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,255
Yes, sir.

725
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,420
Well, it's good to see you relaxing, too, sir.

726
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,889
Right. Now...

727
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,229
Deal me in.
