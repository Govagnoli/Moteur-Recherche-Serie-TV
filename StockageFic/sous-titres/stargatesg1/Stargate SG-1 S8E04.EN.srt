1
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:07,784
Previously on "Stargate SG-1".

2
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:10,905
- I am Baal.
- As in "boccie"?

3
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:12,144
Argh!

4
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:14,981
The city we're looking for
is under the ice of Antarctica.

5
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:18,219
We came all this way to find out
we have to go all the way back?

6
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:20,299
No.

7
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,583
Power source.

8
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:26,502
This ancient weapon -
such an advanced piece of technology.

9
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:29,022
The power requirements
must be enormous.

10
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:32,942
I wish to request asylum. My fleet
was destroyed before I came here.

11
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:36,737
Perhaps I could be
of some use to you here.

12
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:40,867
- General Hammond is being promoted.
- Any idea who we'll be stuck with?

13
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:43,508
Brigadier General Jack O'Neill.

14
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:47,024
I've spent my whole life
sticking it to the man.

15
00:00:47,108 --> 00:00:49,906
I don't think I can be the man.

16
00:00:54,028 --> 00:00:56,861
- Morning, sir.
- Walter.

17
00:00:56,948 --> 00:01:00,941
At 0730 this morning, SG-8 made
scheduled contact from P6J-908.

18
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:04,498
They requested permission
to bring an alien life form back to base.

19
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,579
Sir, it's just a plant.

20
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:11,059
Your 0830 debriefing is SG-2,
regarding their recent mission to P8F-809.

21
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:15,585
Folder's on your desk, along with
the personnel files you have yet to review.

22
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:18,341
How many do I have left?

23
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:21,067
All of them.

24
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,945
Right.

25
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:27,502
Colonel Rudnell has asked me
to show you some bunting samples.

26
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,297
Captain Corrigan's still awaiting
approval on the buffet menu.

27
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:33,538
Bunting?

28
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:35,664
- John.
- General.

29
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:40,868
You are aware that this is the most secure
military facility on the face of the planet?

30
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:43,508
There are still a number
of issues to be resolved.

31
00:01:43,588 --> 00:01:45,579
1000 hours, sir.

32
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:48,424
Thank you.

33
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,696
- Walter?
- Sorry, sir. General O'Neill, Mark Gilmor.

34
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,256
- He's your new administrative aide.
- General.

35
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:04,747
- Did I order...
- No.

36
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:07,661
- Do I really need...
- Yes, sir.

37
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:11,582
- Civilian?
- I've been a CIA analyst for eight years.

38
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:15,138
Mostly background checks,
but I did have top-level clearance.

39
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:20,382
- He was assigned by General Hammond.
- Ah. Well, in that case...

40
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:23,418
welcome aboard.

41
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:29,386
- How about if I give you a tour around?
- Ah. Had one, sir.

42
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:32,938
- Dang.
- Very exciting to finally see it all in action.

43
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,861
General. Your 0830.

44
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,745
Yes.

45
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:41,857
You're here to assist me.
How about if you...

46
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:46,260
Sir, sir, sir.
You really need to read the file yourself.

47
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:48,259
Yeah. Yeah.

48
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:50,339
Thank you, Walter.

49
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,300
- Does Mr Gilmor have...
- Follow me.

50
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:07,137
- Well, he's not like other generals.
- Actually, he's not like other people.

51
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,422
Ah.

52
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:10,976
I take it I've got some catching up to do.

53
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:15,061
Yeah, and those are just the files
pertinent to today's agenda, so...

54
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:17,821
I'd better get started.

55
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:21,457
I can't tell you how happy
we all are to have you here.

56
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:26,340
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Really, really happy.

57
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:29,304
Thank you, Sergeant.

58
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:40,979
I'm in position.

59
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:45,458
No, sir, he does not suspect a thing.

60
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:54,058
- Nothing in peridot?
- This event calls for red, white and blue.

61
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:57,140
Excuse me, sir.
General Hammond is on the phone,

62
00:04:57,228 --> 00:05:00,106
and SG-1 is here for the 1300 briefing.

63
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:02,937
Thank you.

64
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:09,458
Walter, I just don't have
the decorating gene. Would you mind?

65
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,539
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:15,226
Sir.

67
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:17,424
General, how are you?

68
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:24,816
I know, but every time I open my mouth
to say "George", "General" comes out.

69
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,939
- OK.
- General.

70
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:45,098
Colonel. You've all met?

71
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:48,419
- We know each other's life stories.
- Is that snippiness?

72
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:51,466
- Is that a word?
- What do you got?

73
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:55,302
A gate address of a planet in Anubis'
domain that Baal hasn't discovered.

74
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,538
It may be home
to an abandoned base.

75
00:05:57,628 --> 00:06:01,337
- Chock-full of abandoned weapons?
- One can hope.

76
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,625
This device was procured from Jaffa
formerly loyal to Anubis.

77
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,780
It should allow us access to the base.

78
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:12,297
When's the next opening?

79
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:16,146
- 0800 tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow?

80
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:18,822
I got 14 teams out there.

81
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:21,058
I'm sorry. Operations protocol?

82
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,661
Is it?

83
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:25,023
The MALP showed
no sign of Goa'uld activity.

84
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:29,181
- I still want SG-3 to cover your flanks.
- It's just recon.

85
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:32,783
All the more reason you can wait a day.

86
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:35,257
Incoming wormhole.

87
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:40,980
SG-5 and the representatives from Amra
to discuss the pending trade agreement.

88
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,899
Love to stay and chat.

89
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:46,185
If those Jaffa know about it,
soon Baal will know about it.

90
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:49,465
One day, Daniel. One day.

91
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:09,746
Here comes one negotiation
I'm glad I'm not part of.

92
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:15,346
- It's a plant.
- Exactly.

93
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:18,022
20 minutes ago, it was a seed.

94
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:20,622
Excuse me, sir.
If you don't mind my asking,

95
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:26,180
is it really wise to be bringing
alien life forms through the gate?

96
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:28,666
- It's a plant.
- Yeah.

97
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:34,141
Offworld teams follow strict protocols in
determining what to bring back to Earth.

98
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:38,301
You know, if humankind is gonna benefit
from what we find out there,

99
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:42,700
we have to be able to study it
in controlled situations.

100
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:45,177
- It's a plant.
- I know. I know.

101
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:48,578
And I know our mandate is
to seek out new weapons and technology

102
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,785
to defend the planet
from our enemies, but...

103
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:55,747
wouldn't it be cool to exploit the galaxy
for other beneficial purposes,

104
00:07:55,828 --> 00:07:58,023
like curing disease,

105
00:07:58,108 --> 00:07:59,860
or, well...

106
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:03,827
in this case,
possibly solving world hunger.

107
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:07,419
Speaking of which...

108
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,939
Dr Lee speaking.

109
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:17,181
General?
They want you in the briefing room.

110
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:21,464
- Hey. You wanna get some lunch?
- No, I'm fine.

111
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:24,540
- You gonna sit in here all day and...?
- I'm not sulking.

112
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:26,619
Working. Gonna say "working".

113
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,268
- O'Neill merely believes...
- Guys, I'm fine.

114
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:32,784
You can't blame him for wanting backup.
Nothing to do with you.

115
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:36,417
I understand. He's just being cautious.

116
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:42,138
Thanks, guys.

117
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:55,096
General, if I might have a moment
with you. We're completely stalled.

118
00:08:55,188 --> 00:09:00,706
The Amrans can't agree with each other,
let alone us. They're bickering children.

119
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:03,177
Maybe they need a time-out.

120
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:08,066
The Plains of Goran are sacred ground!

121
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:11,697
- To the plainsmen.
- I am a plainsman.

122
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:13,782
I know.

123
00:09:13,868 --> 00:09:17,338
- I take offence at that.
- A fence. Now, there's an idea.

124
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:20,386
- Hi, folks.
- General, I think it would be best...

125
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:25,906
What do you say we take a little break?
All this negotiating, it's just exhausting.

126
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:29,776
And you've been at it
a whole... hour already.

127
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:35,863
We've prepared special quarters for you.
You can relax, get a massage,

128
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:40,385
room service, whatever you need.
Come on. I'll show you.

129
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,061
Huh?

130
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:46,740
Fellas.

131
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:49,739
What do you think?

132
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:55,827
All right, so it's not the Ritz,
but we do what we can around here.

133
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:58,183
Knock when you're ready
to talk like adults.

134
00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:00,987
- Wait!
- You don't expect us to share one room?

135
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,538
Not amicably, at first.

136
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:07,426
But I have great hope for you boys.

137
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:11,467
- You can't do this.
- Open this door at once!

138
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:13,140
Nobody gets out.

139
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:32,541
Dear General Hammond.

140
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:34,698
Wish you were here,

141
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:37,348
and that I was not.

142
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:45,299
O'Neill.

143
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:49,700
Good morning.
The delegates from Amra are furious.

144
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:55,146
They demand to be released and say
there's no chance of a trade agreement.

145
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:59,301
Did they try the doughnuts? You made
sure they were Krispy Kremes, right?

146
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:02,858
- Shall I release them, send them home?
- Give them another day.

147
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:04,904
- But, sir, I...
- No coffee?

148
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:07,866
- Sorry, I can get some...
- What's next?

149
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:12,021
Well, Dr Lee needs to see you right away
concerning the plant from P6J-908.

150
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:15,305
SG-1 and 3 are in the gateroom
preparing to embark, and...

151
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:20,143
Oh, it turns out that the red,
white and blue bunting is unavailable.

152
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:23,106
- No bunting?
- They can get some blue and white,

153
00:11:23,188 --> 00:11:25,065
and mix in some red.

154
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:30,657
It just won't be the same.

155
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:39,064
- Sir.
- Good morning, people.

156
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:43,941
I sure wish I was going with you,
but I got a big day planned.

157
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:47,623
Tasting menu items for the buffet.

158
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,587
- Have fun, sir.
- You know I will. Watch your backs.

159
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,147
We will.

160
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,219
Mind the curfew.

161
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:08,345
SG-3, hold here.

162
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,827
Colonel?

163
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:11,307
Colonel.

164
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:13,982
Bosco and Peterson can watch the gate.

165
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:19,062
We're fine. It's simple recon.
We'll stay in radio contact.

166
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:24,859
Standard perimeter.

167
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,939
Well, the good news is
it hasn't eaten anybody yet.

168
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:35,258
Well, thank you, Seymour.

169
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:38,658
Yeah. Obviously, we underestimated
its growth properties.

170
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:44,539
It seems to respond really dramatically
to any kind of visible light.

171
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:55,460
Yeah, well, I thought of that.
I just thought you might like to see it.

172
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:59,700
Don't worry.
We'll get it under control.

173
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:01,585
Sir...

174
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:18,338
There are signs of recent
Jaffa activity in the area.

175
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:20,578
Try the wrist device again.

176
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:23,136
I have tried it several times.

177
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:27,338
I'm getting some faint energy readings.

178
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:36,738
SG-1 leader, this is SG-3 leader. Come in.

179
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:41,903
Peterson, you're with me.

180
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:47,338
Bosco, if we don't make radio contact
in ten minutes, dial Earth and report in.

181
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,419
Take cover!

182
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,739
Son of a bitch.

183
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:08,062
Sir, Colonel Reynolds has dialled in
from P2X-887. He's lost contact with SG-1.

184
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:12,938
One al-kesh. It buzzed the gate and flew
off. No sign of the enemy since that, sir.

185
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:16,941
I"ve been unable to make radio contact
with SG-1 going on 19 minutes.

186
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:19,588
Requesting backup
and permission to search.

187
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:21,659
SG-10 and 12.

188
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:23,784
Backup on the way.

189
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:26,382
Thank you, sir.

190
00:14:26,468 --> 00:14:29,062
We have to close down
the entire level, seal it off.

191
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:35,144
It not only has amazing growth properties,
it's proving very difficult to eradicate.

192
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:44,459
We think it's using the ventilation shafts
to spread airborne spores.

193
00:14:57,508 --> 00:15:00,341
We looked everywhere.
No sign of them. I'm sorry, sir.

194
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:04,057
- You were there to watch their backs.
- Yes, sir.

195
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:06,662
Colonel Carter insisted
we secure the gate.

196
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:09,899
Unauthorised incoming wormhole.

197
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:14,099
No IDC yet, sir.

198
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:22,139
Stand down, boys.

199
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:26,467
And what do you want?

200
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:28,664
I have your friends.

201
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:31,706
- And?
- I propose an exchange.

202
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,142
- For what?
- Not what. Whom.

203
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:37,105
Whatever.

204
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:39,748
Camulus.

205
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:43,662
- Who?
- I'll transmit the gate address.

206
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:48,947
You will send him to me
if you want to see your friends alive again.

207
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:52,063
Let me think about it.

208
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,665
You have one day.

209
00:15:54,748 --> 00:15:56,739
Is that, like...

210
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:59,422
one Earth day, or...?

211
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:10,425
Nothing to report from the field.

212
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:14,103
Rebel Jaffa, Tok'ra -
no one seems to have any intel on SG-1.

213
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:17,976
Camulus is being transferred here
from the facility where he was held.

214
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:20,184
He should be here shortly.

215
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:28,107
Even if we sent Camulus to Baal, we can't
risk opening the Iris to let SG-1 through.

216
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:32,067
- This could be a trick to get us to do that.
- I know.

217
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:35,220
Any exchange would involve
a Stargate on another planet.

218
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:37,663
I made some suggestions.

219
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,707
Are you really considering
turning Camulus over to Baal?

220
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:46,501
It's on the table.

221
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:52,144
He's here.

222
00:16:53,988 --> 00:16:57,583
- Colonel, have your team ready.
- Yes, sir.

223
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,302
Isn't it already too late?

224
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:07,103
General O'Neill
was once captured by Baal.

225
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:12,057
He was tortured, killed and brought
back to life using a sarcophagus

226
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:15,140
more times than you
would care to imagine.

227
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:19,301
SG-1 never gave up then,
and General O'Neill won't now.

228
00:17:20,228 --> 00:17:24,221
There isn't a man or woman
on this base that would.

229
00:17:35,908 --> 00:17:41,107
Baal has three of my people,
and he's offered up an exchange.

230
00:17:41,188 --> 00:17:43,622
- For me.
- Any idea why?

231
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:48,503
- There are many possible reasons.
- Pick one.

232
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:53,658
Nothing?

233
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:57,184
You offered to help us
if we granted you asylum.

234
00:17:57,268 --> 00:17:59,828
I did not expect
to be treated like a prisoner.

235
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:01,944
You're a Goa'uld.

236
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:09,185
- What are you going to do?
- Give me one reason not to turn you over.

237
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:12,018
Baal cannot be trusted.

238
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:14,147
Yeah.

239
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:19,825
No matter what you do,
he will never return your friends to you.

240
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:26,300
- I thought you were questioning him.
- He had no right answers.

241
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:29,266
This goes against policy
on prisoner exchanges.

242
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:33,136
He's not a prisoner.
He requested asylum. I'm ungranting it.

243
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:37,221
- You could be court-martialled.
- If it gets my team back, I don't care.

244
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:42,177
But you know it won't.
You're sacrificing him for nothing.

245
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:45,502
Go, go, go.

246
00:18:57,068 --> 00:19:00,140
Let's take a walk, you and me. Come on.

247
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,656
I've done everything I can.

248
00:19:17,748 --> 00:19:20,820
It's up to you. Last chance.

249
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:26,187
In spite of what you think,
I am not a coward.

250
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:31,423
I think you are.

251
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:42,223
Well, it was worth a try.

252
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:45,698
Take him back to his cell.

253
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:51,142
It... it was a bluff?

254
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,984
You could've told me, sir.

255
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:03,582
How can I do my job
if you don't trust me?

256
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,818
Not my problem.

257
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:08,376
Wait. Camulus would like to talk to you.

258
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:18,821
I cannot stay here. If Baal is determined
to have revenge, he won't stop at this.

259
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:21,468
- It is not safe for you to harbour me.
- So what?

260
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:23,823
I am saying I am willing to leave.

261
00:20:23,908 --> 00:20:28,106
- Out of the goodness of your heart?
- Of course not.

262
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:32,185
When I asked for asylum,
I did not expect to rot in a cell.

263
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:37,217
Well, work with me. Give me something.
I'll see what I can do.

264
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:43,826
I can tell you of a planet where there is
a device created by the Ancients.

265
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:46,263
- What's it do?
- I do not know.

266
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:50,421
I never could discover its secrets.
Perhaps you can.

267
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:53,545
You think this is what Baal's really after?

268
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,859
While I never disclosed its location,
I once made the mistake

269
00:20:56,948 --> 00:21:02,466
of bragging that I found the device
at a meeting of the System Lords.

270
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:05,540
Hard to believe, you bragging.

271
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:10,346
I knew it wasn"t easy for you,

272
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:12,817
but had I known

273
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:15,342
what it was really like,

274
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:21,378
I would have tried
to be less of a pain in the ass.

275
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:24,698
At least, I would have tried harder.

276
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:27,746
Unscheduled offworld activation.

277
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:37,741
- Walter?
- Receiving SG-3's IDC, sir.

278
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:40,023
- Open it.
- Yes, sir.

279
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:56,027
It's just like he said. Some sort of
Ancient device, size of a large room.

280
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,905
Any idea what it does?

281
00:21:57,988 --> 00:22:03,904
I'll leave that up to the tech guys, but
I can tell you why he couldn't turn it on.

282
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:10,103
- It wasn't plugged in.
- What... what is it?

283
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:12,827
It's a ZPM.

284
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:16,583
- What is that?
- A zero-point module.

285
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,138
It's an Ancient power source
that draws its energy from subspace.

286
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:26,019
The only thing with the power to activate
the weapons SG-1 found in Antarctica.

287
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:30,306
- The one we have is pretty much dead.
- Well, this one sure isn't.

288
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:32,500
How good is it?

289
00:22:32,588 --> 00:22:35,182
I'll have to do
some more detailed analysis,

290
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:39,898
but these preliminary readings
indicate at least 50% capacity.

291
00:22:39,988 --> 00:22:42,548
Well, that's good, isn't it?

292
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:49,342
Excuse me.

293
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:51,783
It's that damn plant.

294
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:03,143
We've lost power to all control systems.

295
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:04,456
Yes, sir.

296
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:09,140
We paid the electric bill. I checked.

297
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:12,618
The plant is in the wall,
interfering with power lines.

298
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:16,701
- There's no light in the walls.
- As long as part of it is exposed to light,

299
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:19,666
it seems like it can feed
the unexposed areas.

300
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:22,899
I recommend we keep the base
on minimal emergency lighting

301
00:23:22,988 --> 00:23:25,218
until we get the problem under control.

302
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:28,505
- How long?
- Well, that's a little difficult to say,

303
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:34,424
because first we have to figure out
how to get the problem under control.

304
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:46,465
- Where are we?
- The dialling computer's off line.

305
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:50,666
There must be a circuit board that
got fried when we tried to restore power.

306
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:54,900
Incoming wormholes connect. We still
receive radio communication and IDCs.

307
00:23:54,988 --> 00:23:57,377
- The Iris?
- Manual control.

308
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:00,940
What about dialling the gate manually?

309
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:04,987
Uh, that's a problem. The inner ring
seems to be locked in place.

310
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,787
We tried disconnecting the interface, but...

311
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:10,780
A gate diagnostic was running
when the power went down.

312
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:14,747
Could be something to do with the
commands being exchanged at the time.

313
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,501
- Bottom line?
- We can't dial out.

314
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:22,619
OK.

315
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:48,496
- What? Oh, God.
- Sorry to wake you, sir.

316
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:54,817
Feels like it's been ten minutes.

317
00:24:54,908 --> 00:24:57,024
Yeah. It has.

318
00:24:57,108 --> 00:25:00,896
Uh, there's an incoming wormhole.
Baal wants to talk.

319
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:05,823
Baal. Sorry to keep you waiting.
I was taking a little nap.

320
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:08,217
- The deadline has passed.
- Yeah, look.

321
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:11,186
We're having a little
technical difficulty here.

322
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:13,577
Are your friends' lives
meaningless to you?

323
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:16,421
Hey. This is not a stall tactic.

324
00:25:16,508 --> 00:25:19,261
I would've called you sooner,
but we can't dial out.

325
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:21,987
Why not?

326
00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:25,458
Well, I'm not really sure.
Here's some irony for you.

327
00:25:25,548 --> 00:25:29,177
Carter would have this thing
fixed like that.

328
00:25:32,668 --> 00:25:36,661
- No offence there, Siler.
- Uh, none taken, sir.

329
00:25:37,468 --> 00:25:39,857
So, why don't you just
send her on through?

330
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:43,463
Before you know it, you'll have
Camel Ass back in your grubby mitts.

331
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:46,779
- You dare mock me?
- Baal, come on.

332
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:50,622
You should know.
Of course I dare mock you.

333
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,862
You have one more day.

334
00:25:58,748 --> 00:26:01,820
Is it really wise to provoke him?

335
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:09,383
It's what I do.

336
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:17,098
Two years ago, the Tok'ra provided us
with the formula to their Goa'uld poison.

337
00:26:17,188 --> 00:26:19,941
We've been manufacturing
as much as we can use

338
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:22,986
as a defensive option
in the event of an attack on Earth.

339
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:26,822
Area 51 confirms that there is enough
to negate a sizable enemy force.

340
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:31,220
We think we can neutralise and invade
three Goa'uld-occupied planets.

341
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:35,779
It's nonpersistent. There'd be limited time
before reinforcements become a factor.

342
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:39,099
Determining which planets to target
is an educated guess.

343
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:42,100
We're still gathering intel
on where SG-1 is held.

344
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:43,940
This poison...

345
00:26:44,028 --> 00:26:49,261
- Does it kill Jaffa, as well as Goa'uld?
- That's right.

346
00:26:49,348 --> 00:26:51,862
How many casualties
are we talking about?

347
00:26:51,948 --> 00:26:54,781
- Thousands.
- Tens of thousands.

348
00:26:54,868 --> 00:26:59,180
So it's not really a rescue plan.
It's a full-scale attack.

349
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:02,419
That would provoke a reaction,
possibly an attack on Earth.

350
00:27:02,508 --> 00:27:07,059
But, as we now have a ZPM to power
the Ancient defences, I don't think...

351
00:27:07,148 --> 00:27:13,144
Sorry to interrupt, sir, but Camulus is
insisting that he speak with you again.

352
00:27:14,988 --> 00:27:17,707
Did you not find something of value
on the planet?

353
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:21,576
- Oh, yeah. We did.
- Then why have you not released me?

354
00:27:22,828 --> 00:27:27,026
Or do you still believe
you can trade me for your friends?

355
00:27:27,108 --> 00:27:28,860
Gamma radiation works.

356
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:32,907
We're preparing to deliver a strong level
to the entire base all at once.

357
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:35,786
Now, nonessential personnel
have to be evacuated.

358
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:38,257
Everyone else
has to wear protective suits.

359
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:41,579
You have to get General O'Neill
to sign off on this right away.

360
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:44,023
You know, he hasn't slept
in over two days.

361
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:46,542
Yeah. That's why I'm asking you to do it.

362
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:47,777
Right.

363
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:51,099
I'm cancelling the president's visit.

364
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:53,748
Really? Why would you do that?

365
00:27:53,828 --> 00:27:58,424
- How can you joke at a time like this?
- That's about all I can do at the moment.

366
00:27:58,508 --> 00:28:00,738
Your flagship team is in enemy hands,

367
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:05,458
you can't dial the Stargate,
and the base is overrun by an alien plant.

368
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:07,778
We did find a ZPM.

369
00:28:07,868 --> 00:28:09,665
True.

370
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:12,905
Give it another day.

371
00:28:12,988 --> 00:28:16,025
You think you can get
everything resolved by then?

372
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:18,144
Wait a minute.

373
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:22,187
I think there's a joke in there somewhere.

374
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,259
No. Got nothing.

375
00:28:25,508 --> 00:28:29,660
And so I regretfully
submit my resignation.

376
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:34,299
And, to be clear, the regret is not
so much about the resigning part,

377
00:28:34,388 --> 00:28:39,223
but the fact that I was deluded enough
to think I had possessed even one iota

378
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:44,302
of the ability needed
to fill your sizable and shiny shoes.

379
00:28:47,908 --> 00:28:50,342
Dr Lee just called down, sir.

380
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,943
He feels confident
the plant has been fully eradicated.

381
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:57,987
- I wish I did.
- The dialling computer is back on line.

382
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,903
Chevron four encoded.

383
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:15,827
You're releasing him?

384
00:29:15,908 --> 00:29:19,025
I made a deal. We got a ZPM.

385
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:23,784
I know we can finally dial Pegasus again
and still defend Earth if we have to, but...

386
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:27,144
Chevron five encoded.

387
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,057
Control room.

388
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:36,026
It's Dr Lee. He says it's important.

389
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,905
Yeah.

390
00:29:39,468 --> 00:29:42,699
Abort the dialling procedure.

391
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:49,986
Basically,
it shouldn't be glowing like this.

392
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:52,502
- Why is it?
- It's funny, really.

393
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:55,341
- I like funny.
- No. This isn't the good kind of funny.

394
00:29:55,428 --> 00:29:58,977
It was the radiation we used
to kill the plant that revealed this.

395
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:00,057
What?

396
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:05,506
It illuminated a substance foreign to
the normal molecular make-up of a ZPM.

397
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:06,782
And?

398
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:11,100
Well, we managed to scrape some
microscopic fragments from the casing

399
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:13,577
and run some tests, and...

400
00:30:15,268 --> 00:30:17,862
You're gonna want these.

401
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:31,541
This is what happens when you
introduce a constant electric charge.

402
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,823
The ZPM is booby-trapped?

403
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:46,906
We were gonna send it to Antarctica.

404
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:51,140
Can you imagine if someone had plugged
it into the chair in the Ancient outpost?

405
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:55,346
I can't even imagine
the magnitude of the explosion.

406
00:30:55,428 --> 00:30:57,988
A charged ZPM detonating that?

407
00:30:58,068 --> 00:31:01,583
I don't know.
It could've destroyed the whole planet.

408
00:31:01,668 --> 00:31:04,785
That's why Camulus
was so eager to leave.

409
00:31:04,868 --> 00:31:06,665
Well...

410
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:09,465
Can you undo it?

411
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:13,342
Uh... well, you know,
we haven't actually...

412
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:15,419
Yes or no?

413
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:23,498
I don't know what you're talking about.

414
00:31:23,588 --> 00:31:27,661
You couldn't figure out what it was for,
so you tampered with the power source

415
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:30,820
- so nobody else could.
- I did nothing of the kind.

416
00:31:30,908 --> 00:31:32,580
Cammy...

417
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:36,938
Worth a try.

418
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,417
Here's the deal.

419
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:42,978
How'd you like a chance to kill Baal?

420
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,504
In exchange, you want me
to use the Ancient device

421
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:49,500
to trade for the lives of your friends.

422
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:51,977
Exactly.

423
00:31:52,068 --> 00:31:54,104
Amusing.

424
00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:08,178
All right?

425
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:12,056
- Coming with me?
- We're taking you to another planet first.

426
00:32:12,148 --> 00:32:14,742
We'll wait for SG-1 there.

427
00:32:33,348 --> 00:32:36,943
- Receiving SG-3"s IDC, sir.
- Open it.

428
00:32:48,628 --> 00:32:53,418
- You're late.
- We thought we'd give it an extra hour.

429
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:56,102
We knew it was a long shot.

430
00:32:57,868 --> 00:33:00,382
Thank you, Colonel. Dismissed.

431
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:17,498
Sir. Uh, Colonel Reynolds
would like a moment.

432
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:20,946
- Fine.
- He's in the gateroom, sir.

433
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:41,905
- What's going on?
- General, we just wanted you to know,

434
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:45,697
whatever you decide,
we're behind you 100%.

435
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:50,979
You just need to give the order
and we're ready to go.

436
00:33:51,068 --> 00:33:53,457
I know you are, Colonel.

437
00:33:54,948 --> 00:33:57,064
Thank you.

438
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:08,221
All of you.

439
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:14,104
Dismissed.

440
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:52,899
Good night, sir.

441
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:56,459
Good night, Siler.

442
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:08,985
Unscheduled offworld activation.

443
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:16,901
It's SG-1's code. O'Brien transmitted
a hold signal back through the gate

444
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:19,866
and is awaiting your instruction.

445
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:24,018
- O'Brien?
- We have audio contact.

446
00:35:24,108 --> 00:35:26,099
It's Colonel Carter.

447
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:31,421
- Carter?
- We"re under heavy fire, sir. Open the Iris.

448
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:32,657
Negative.

449
00:35:38,508 --> 00:35:43,218
- Can you reroute?
- No. The DHD is no longer accessible.

450
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:50,507
- Jack, what's going on?
- You"ve been in enemy hands.

451
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:54,820
You know the protocol. We have no way
of knowing if your Iris code is secure.

452
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:58,025
- What are you talking about?
- You were captured by Baal.

453
00:35:58,108 --> 00:36:02,101
Baal? We're on P2X-887.
We were trapped in Anubis' secret base.

454
00:36:02,188 --> 00:36:04,782
When we came out,
we had a Jaffa ambush at the gate.

455
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:10,226
- These Jaffa are loyal to Baal.
- The gate will shut down.

456
00:36:10,308 --> 00:36:13,300
We won't be able to dial out again.

457
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,307
Open it.

458
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:24,216
You're clear.

459
00:36:35,388 --> 00:36:37,185
Nice.

460
00:36:44,548 --> 00:36:46,584
- Hey, guys.
- Thank you, sir.

461
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:48,021
So...

462
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:52,147
Trapped in a secret base all this time.

463
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:54,537
- Go figure.
- The wrist device gave us access.

464
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:57,301
- We couldn't get out.
- You thought Baal captured us?

465
00:36:57,388 --> 00:37:00,061
- He said so.
- How'd he know we were missing?

466
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:03,777
- Reynolds saw an al-kesh.
- Baal had his Jaffa looking for the base.

467
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:07,178
- Probably intercepted radio chatter.
- That explains the ambush.

468
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:10,340
They couldn't find the base,
but figured if we turned up...

469
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:16,663
It's a great story. More importantly,
did Anubis leave anything cool behind?

470
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:19,540
Not really, no.

471
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:22,381
Nuts.

472
00:37:26,868 --> 00:37:29,428
Colonel Carter.

473
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:31,976
- How are you?
- I'm good. Thanks for asking.

474
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:35,538
You're not going to dress
for the occasion, sir?

475
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,064
Well, you know me.
I love dressing up. I was just on my way.

476
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:41,139
Sir.

477
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:45,301
- I wanted to talk to you...
- Carter, your evaluation is done.

478
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,027
And I think you'd be very pleased.

479
00:37:48,108 --> 00:37:50,702
- Really?
- You had doubts?

480
00:37:50,788 --> 00:37:55,816
I was wondering if you were completely
confident in my leadership skills.

481
00:37:55,908 --> 00:37:57,546
Aren't you?

482
00:37:57,628 --> 00:38:01,303
I'm second-guessing myself
for ordering SG-3 to remain at the gate.

483
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:03,458
Oh, pshaw.

484
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:05,459
It was standard recon.

485
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:08,984
Your tactics in dealing
with the ambush: perfect.

486
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:12,663
You should read what Teal'c and Daniel
wrote about your conduct under fire.

487
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,737
- Can I?
- No.

488
00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:16,581
- Damn.
- Teal'c said you were an animal.

489
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:20,707
- He's such an exaggerator.
- Yeah, isn't he?

490
00:38:20,788 --> 00:38:24,258
Well, this is where I go
to take off the clothes I prefer

491
00:38:24,348 --> 00:38:27,943
and don the clothes I abhor.

492
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:31,941
Uh, sir, quickly, I wanted
to talk to you about something else.

493
00:38:32,028 --> 00:38:35,179
I read Dr Lee's report
about the tainted ZPM.

494
00:38:35,268 --> 00:38:38,260
He may have underestimated
the explosive potential.

495
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:42,466
It could've actually destroyed
the entire solar system.

496
00:38:42,548 --> 00:38:47,064
- What's the difference?
- If we figured it out, so could Baal.

497
00:38:47,148 --> 00:38:50,504
- He could use it as a weapon against us.
- All true, Carter.

498
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:54,217
Which is exactly why
I didn't give Camulus the tainted one.

499
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:58,188
- Sir?
- I gave him the dead one.

500
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:01,066
It's worthless, right?

501
00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:04,584
Baal's gonna be pretty pissed at Camulus.

502
00:39:04,668 --> 00:39:05,987
Yeah.

503
00:39:18,748 --> 00:39:20,704
The president's motorcade is here.

504
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:24,701
He should be getting
on the elevator momentarily.

505
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:26,221
Uh...

506
00:39:26,308 --> 00:39:31,063
Sir, I... I think you should know
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

507
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:32,820
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

508
00:39:33,348 --> 00:39:39,617
The truth is, I've been here on a temporary
special assignment from the president.

509
00:39:40,868 --> 00:39:45,146
- Oh?
- Sort of a civilian audit, if you will.

510
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:48,142
Of the SGC?

511
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:50,219
Of you.

512
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,268
I know.

513
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:06,942
- You do?
- General Hammond told me.

514
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:12,538
- Well, he wasn't supposed to.
- Well, don't tell anyone.

515
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:16,382
Then you know the president
wanted to make sure you were settling in

516
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:21,496
before he came and shook your hand and
endorsed you as the leader of this base.

517
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:22,782
Uh-huh.

518
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:25,507
Obviously, he's here, so...

519
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:28,705
What I mean is, I just want you to know

520
00:40:28,788 --> 00:40:31,905
how much respect I have
for what you do here.

521
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:36,745
- And for you.
- Thanks.

522
00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:42,379
Shall we?

523
00:40:43,428 --> 00:40:48,024
Oh, by the way,
did you let those Amran delegates go?

524
00:40:48,108 --> 00:40:54,547
I did, sir. Yes. Major Davis said they seem
much more willing to negotiate now.

525
00:40:54,628 --> 00:40:58,701
- D'you think they liked the fruit basket?
- I think so, sir. Yes.

526
00:40:58,788 --> 00:41:01,780
I put a lot of thought into that.

527
00:41:17,548 --> 00:41:19,425
