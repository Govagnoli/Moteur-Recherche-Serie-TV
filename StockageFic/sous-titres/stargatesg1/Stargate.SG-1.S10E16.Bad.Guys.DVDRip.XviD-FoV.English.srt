- The code to an Ancient tablet.

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,367
- Do I know you?
- You did a long time ago.

4
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:14,376
Athena, Greek goddess of war.

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,880
Qetesh double-crossed her

6
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,042
when they partnered up to search
for the Clava Thessara Infinitas.

7
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,552
Now, according to legend,
it would allow he who possesses it entry

8
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:25,613
to a vast storehouse of riches hidden away
by the Ancients prior to their Ascension.

9
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,389
The Clava Thessara Infinitas,
"The key to infinite treasure,"

10
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,397
a cache of Ancient wealth and weapons.

11
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:36,196
You do realize the last cache
of Ancient stuff we picked up

12
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,167
is what got us in trouble
with the Ori in the first place.

13
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,865
So, what, just leave it out there
for someone else to find?

14
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,501
I thought you believed the Clava Thessara
Infinitas to be a hoax, Daniel Jackson.

15
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,375
I did, yes, but the research Athena did
is actually quite compelling.

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,971
Now, after cross-referencing her research
and our cartouche,

17
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,550
I was able to generate a gate address.

18
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,084
Possible location of the treasure?

19
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,950
I'm not sure,
but we sent a MALP to P4M-328,

20
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,752
and the images it sent back
are particularly interesting.

21
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,723
Now, the hieroglyphs on the wall
are all out of order

22
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:01,816
and from various different dynasties.

23
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,589
At first glance, they don't make any sense.

24
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,061
It's a code.

25
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,497
Sounds like it's worth checking out.
Go ahead.

26
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,127
Should we not wait until Colonel Carter
returns from Washington?

27
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,105
She's still there briefing the President
on the scenario that played out

28
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,473
in the alternate reality,
where the stargate was made public.

29
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,375
That's taking longer than
it was supposed to.

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,914
Well, it could be a good way to examine
what might happen here.

31
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,314
Sounds like President Hayes
is having a hard time

32
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,683
just getting past the fact that
he wasn't President.

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,759
Well, I'm going to set up my camera and
take some high-res stills of these glyphs.

34
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:58,006
Give Ansel Adams there a hand.
Teal'c and I will check out the perimeter.

35
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,210
Right.

they most likely found a DHD, no?

We didn't.

73
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,462
Well, they knew enough to build
a pretty convincing replica,

74
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,632
so they must have one lying around here
somewhere, no?

75
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,438
No, they could have just fabricated it
from drawings.

76
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,604
If indeed they did possess
an authentic DHD,

77
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,944
would they not display it
near the authentic gate?

Well, when we fail to make the scheduled

at which point we'll ask him
to send a naquadah generator

00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,892
and a laptop with the dialing program,
and that's that.

We knew that.

84
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,292

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,368
that you would know that
I meant until then.

86
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,902
Well, then you should say what you mean.

we don't need the dialing computer.

90

Then release the hostages.

172
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,293
That's not a bad idea.

173
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,322
It's a terrible idea.

174
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:44,970
Why?

175
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,834
Well, it doesn't matter
what we say to them.

176
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,703
They think we're rebels.
We shot a security guard.

177
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,833
We took hostages.

178
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:55,113
If we let those people go,
they're going to come in here and kill us.

179
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,613
The lady's making a lot of sense.

180
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,741
This is not how you make first contact
with people.

181
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,115
Not intentionally, no,

182
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,782
but all we've got to do is stall
for five and a half hours till Landry dials in.

183
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,382
Then we bolt, and those people can
believe what they want to believe.

184
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,586
And no one gets hurt.

185
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,493
I, too, believe that to be
the best course of action.

186
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,894
Okay, do you understand
how dangerous this could be?

187
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,527
This is an alien culture
of which we have no knowledge.

188
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,629
We don't know how they're going
to handle a situation like this.

189
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,369
We don't know
if they're going to wait six hours.

190
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,342
Once we start posing as kidnappers,
there's no turning back,

191
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,072
and if we get captured, we are hooped!

192
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:34,050
Jackson, I hear what you're saying,
but I don't think we have a choice.

193
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,452
As far as I can see, these people
are not going to be open to the idea

194
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:41,219
that we are peaceful aliens
out on a jolly jaunt just to look around.

195
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,691
I can't free them quite yet.

196
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,732
<i>MALA Y: If this is some kind of mistake,</i>
<i>I suggest you release them now.</i>

197
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,969
Listen, one of your people
has been seriously injured.

198
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,702
I suggest you send in medical personnel
to take him out of here.

199
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,473
You've sealed off the museum.
How do you expect us to get in?

200
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,822
I managed to stop the bleeding,

201
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,692
but you should get him to a facility
as soon as possible.

202
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,890
(YELLS)

203
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,399
Let him go.

204
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,080
- Jackson?
- He's okay.

205
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:44,657
Are you people out of your minds,
or are you just plain stupid?

206
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,457
Are you people out of your minds,
or are you just plain stupid?

207
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,155
<i>Do you know anything about</i>
<i>hostage negotiations?</i>

208
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,630
This is no way to gain our trust.

209
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:59,170
My name is Quartus.
I've taken command of this operation.

210
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:04,202
Look, we have one of your people here
who needs help.

211
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,406
We're willing to let him go,
and this is how you repay us?

212
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,607
<i>QUARTUS: I am</i>
<i>the Chief Negotiation Officer</i>

213
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,274
<i>for the Federal Security Council.</i>

214
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,181
I promise you, things will be different.

215
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:21,225
My only concern is meeting your demands
and freeing the hostages.

216
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,318
See, that's funny.
That's what the last guy said.

217
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:31,225
I can offer you many things,
but if any of the hostages die...

218
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,568
Just don't try any more stupid stunts.

219
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,408
We don't want to hurt anyone.

220
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,574
Good. Good.

221
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:46,310
If that changes, you should know
that there's no escape.

222
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,886
We have you completely surrounded.

223
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,817
Hey, Mitchell.

224
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,562
Jackson.

225
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:03,192
- You okay?
- VALA: They zapped you.

226
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,134
Oh, I got that, thank you. What did I miss?

227
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,403
Well, the real negotiator got here
and wants to know what our demands are.

228
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,943
Any ideas?

229
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,208
- A jet to Algeria?
- How about a real DHD?

230
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,543
No, we need these demands
to make sense.

231
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,880
I mean, something these rebels
would actually say.

232
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,282
Excuse me?

233
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,183
- Did you really come through the ring?
- Yes, we did.

234
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,088
It's a portal, isn't it, to other worlds?

235
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,160
Yeah, I'd be happy to show you
how it works,

236
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,024
once we get it up and running again.

237
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,598
You want them to free your friends.

238
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,063
- I'm sorry, what?
- Your demands.

239
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,899
If you want to pose as the rebels, the first
thing they usually do in situations like this

240
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,473
is ask for the freeing
of their imprisoned compatriots.

241
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,099
- WOMAN: Don't talk to them.
- No, it's okay.

242
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,974
- What's your name?
- Cicero.

243
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,914
I'm a researcher here at the museum,
and I believe you.

244
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,451
You want to get on the radio
and explain that to the folks outside?

245
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,680
Oh, I've tried.
I've suspected as much for years.

246
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,156
I've published dozens of papers,
written a book. No one listens.

247
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,124
My colleagues think I'm a bit of a joke.

248
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,491
Oh, Daniel, you've found a kindred spirit.

249
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:08,032
On most planets, found along with the ring
is what we call a DHD.

250
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,069
It's a dialing device, similar to the one
you have back in the exhibit.

251
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,399
Do you have the real one here?

252
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,632
We've found fragments of it,
but the one in the pyramid room

253
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,107
is a reconstruction
from some diagrams we found.

254
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,201
Yeah, we know. That's why we're stuck.

255
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,304
Well, if one of the fragments
is the power source...

256
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,410
Cicero?

257
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,315
Stand up.

258
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,356
I need you to take us to your lab.

259
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,450
Of course.

260
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,087
Wait a second. I'm going to need
a primer on these rebels first.

261
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,861
<i>JACKSON: And after they're freed,</i>
<i>we'd like the Viceroy to call a referendum</i>

262
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:47,268
<i>on dissolving his government, and finally,</i>
<i>we want to make a public statement</i>

263
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:51,776
on the Gainord transmitters,
to address the people of this proud nation.

264
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,107
That's unacceptable.

265
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,073
<i>Excuse me?</i>

266
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,981
Believe me, I want this
to end well for both of us,

267
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:04,818
but as you should know from previous
attempts at political terrorism like this,

268
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:11,321
the Viceroy would rather sacrifice the
hostages before bowing to such demands.

269
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,922
Remember to thank Cicero
for his wonderful intel.

270
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,592
What about freeing the imprisoned rebels?

271
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,428
That'll take time.

272
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,666
<i>Oh, absolutely.</i>

273
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,710
<i>We recognize that, sir.</i>
<i>You take all the time you need.</i>

274
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:26,800
<i>(LAUGHS) Yeah.</i>

275
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,904
<i>You run that through the proper channels,</i>
<i>you talk to whoever you need to talk to.</i>

276
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,039
<i>We're in no rush.</i>

277
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,584
I'm sure the hostages would disagree
with that.

278
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,880
They're fine. We're not going to hurt them.

279
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,791
Unless you get cute, in which case
there's gonna be killing and whatnot.

280
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,193
All right.

281
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,895
I'll see what I can do.

282
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,365
Sir?

283
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:53,302
We have a man on an auxiliary channel
who claims to be inside the museum.

284
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,498
Says he's a security guard.

285
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:58,910
Who am I talking to?

286
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,139
Jayem Saran, sir.

287
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,882
Night guard, second-class.

288
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,248
<i>QUARTUS: And you're inside</i>
<i>the museum right now?</i>

289
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,615
Yes, sir.

290
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,385
How did you escape the initial attack?

291
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,360
I wasn't there, sir.

292
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,859
I was doing my rounds.

293
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,592
By the time I got on the scene,
the fight was over.

294
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,099
There was nothing I could do, sir.

295
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,170
No need to apologize.

296
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,965
Engaging them
would have been a mistake.

297
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,266
I always wanted to serve
on the Council's Guard, sir,

298
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:35,176
but some mistakes I made
when I was a kid messed up my record.

299
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,882
- Listen...
<i>- I've been a guard at this museum</i>

300
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,177
<i>for 10 years now.</i>

301
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,911
<i>I know it like the back of my hand.</i>

302
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,079
We have a complete set of schematics
out here. Not to worry.

303
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,627
Yeah, well, I'm sure you do,
but I am on the inside.

304
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,692
I can be your ears, your eyes.

305
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,993
You know what would be the most help?

306
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,900
Standing by for your orders, sir.

307
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,530
<i>Find a safe place, stay there,</i>

308
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,633
<i>- and wait until this whole thing is over.</i>
- What are you going to do?

309
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:10,406
That's not your concern, Guardsman.
Our plan just doesn't involve you.

310
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:15,147
<i>- Don't get in the way.</i>
- Very well. Jayem out.

311
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,496
Our radios must be compromised.

312
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,468
He doesn't want me to stand down.

313
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:38,743
He just needs it to look
like I'm standing down.

314
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,511
The Viceroy's attempt to separate
the governing council

315
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,644
from the Circle of Heavens
is controversial,

316
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,723
but the majority of the people
are on his side.

317
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,085
Hang... Hang on.

318
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,626
They think we're some kind
of radical religious sect?

319
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,025
That's right.
The rebels are growing stronger every day.

320
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,894
Unfortunately, you couldn't have picked
a worse time to be mistaken for them.

321
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:01,988
How's that?

322
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,398
They've had a string of successes
against the Council and its members.

323
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,904
The Viceroy needs a win
to show his might.

324
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:06,893
The Viceroy needs a win
to show his might.

325
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,372
If this is handled badly, it could turn
into a bloody mess very quickly.

326
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,842
Keep that positive thinking going, Cicero.
Anything?

327
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:14,935
No.

328
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,311
My co-worker has an archive
on the other side of the building.

329
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,544
It's possible other pieces
we found are stored there.

330
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,119
Lead the way.

331
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,628
What were you and Heren doing
in the hallway?

332
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,894
- What?
- In the hallway.

333
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,835
Before you came out screaming,
what were you doing?

334
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,838
Looking at some of the other exhibits.

335
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,908
But the museum is closed.

336
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,206
We were told everything outside
the lobby is off-limits.

337
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,678
- We were?
- Did she kiss you?

338
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,012
- Me? No...
- You did, didn't you?

339
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,210
You hardly spoke to him all night.

340
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,752
I didn't think you were
interested anymore.

341
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,685
Why do you always do this?

342
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,848
Why must you always try
to take everything that is mine

343
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,118
and try to make it your own?

344
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,215
He was hardly yours.

345
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,726
I hate you!

346
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,327
(BOTH SCREAMING)

347
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,366
What the hell are you doing? Stop it!

348
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,769
She started it.

349
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,031
I think you started it
when you kissed Heren...

350
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,664
Shut up! Shut up!

351
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,305
You're hostages.

352
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,744
This is, like,
a life-and-death situation here.

353
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,406
Start acting like it.

354
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,780
Oh, please, you're no rebels.

355
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,319
We're not deaf, you know.
Everyone in this room knows it.

356
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,412
That doesn't matter.

357
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,684
You're hostages! We're your...
We're your captors.

358
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,123
We're heavily armed!

359
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:39,163
There's rules.
There's a whole school of etiquette to this.

360
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,331
Don't eyeball me.

361
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,032
An artificial stable wormhole. Fascinating.

362
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,471
Yeah, pretty darn nifty, huh?

363
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,236
And the galaxy is populated,
other people on other planets?

364
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,541
- A couple of galaxies, as a matter of fact.
- Amazing.

365
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,946
Hey, when you guys found
the gate and the pyramid,

366
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,645
there wasn't a stash of advanced
alien weapons, was there?

367
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:05,189
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Yeah, just a shot in the dark anyway.

368
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,623
You know, if we...
Well, will you look at that?

369
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:16,133
- Is that what I think it is?
- No, it's a Goa'uld naquadah bomb.

370
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,532
For the record,
that's what I thought it was.

371
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,764
Yes, I'm sure you did.

372
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,705
Well, it seems in pretty good shape.

373
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,209
If it's real,
and if the naquadah core is intact...

374
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,610
I assume these cases are connected
to the security system?

375
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,909
Yes.

376
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,347
So we can't get into the case?

377
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,045
You won't be able to access it
without a security card.

378
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:38,884
- And you have one of those, no?
- Not for these exhibits, no.

379
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,625
Well, not to worry.

380
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,923
You happen to be standing next to
one of the best thieves in two galaxies.

381
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,589
No, not him.

382
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,794
So, if anyone can get this bomb out
with no security card, it is me.

383
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,199
Watch and learn, boys.

384
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:56,104
Removal of treasure from
a sealed glass enclosure.

385
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,067
(INHALING)

386
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:04,312
Step one, identify the tamper circuit
and try to bypass it.

387
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,680
When circuit proves inaccessible,
go to step two.

388
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:12,848
Cut a treasure-sized hole in the glass.

389
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,262
You just happen to carry one
of those around with you?

390
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,355
One must always be prepared
to liberate treasure, Cameron.

391
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,937
Step three, examine the base of the object
for pressure switch.

392
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,442
When found, bypass it.

393
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:38,247
And finally, we reach in...

394
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,882
(SIGHS)

395
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:51,753
All right. Removal of treasure
from a sealed metal enclosure.

396
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:52,830
No.

397
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,160
MITCHELL: You rushed it.
VALA: I did not.

398
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,330
You were showing off, and you rushed it.

399
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,705
This is an alien security system
that I've never experienced before.

400
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,870
And the fact that I got this far
is very impressive.

401
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,913
- How do we get one of those cards?
- Oh...

402
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,710
SARAN: You don't.

403
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,843
Throw your guns on the floor. Now.

404
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,817
(SIGHING)

405
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,421
And the little ones on your legs.

406
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,898
- Well, don't just stand there, Cicero.
- Huh?

407
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,164
Pick them up.

408
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,705
Oh! Right.

409
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,408
Good, now come stand over here.

410
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,845
Thanks. They tried to make me
get them a key card.

411
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,474
Yeah, I heard.

412
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,717
- Toss over your communicator.
- Okay. Relax.

413
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,619
You got us. You're in control.

414
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,490
That's right. I am.

415
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,973
- You press the big button to talk.
- Yeah. I know how to use it.

416
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,039
Murderous rebels, come in, please.

417
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:19,884
Speaking.

418
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,684
I have your two friends.

419
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,950
Let the hostages go,
or I'm going to kill them.

420
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:29,994
Excuse me?

421
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,921
Your friends, I have them at gunpoint.
If you don't let the rest of the hostages go,

422
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,330
I'm going to kill them.

423
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,369
- Who's calling?
<i>- SARAN: Who I am is of no importance.</i>

424
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,531
Oh, I disagree.

425
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,437
Tell him.

426
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,741
- Jackson?
- Mitchell, what's going on?

427
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,081
Well, we got ourselves a bit of
a John McClane here.

428
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,116
- What? What are you talking about?
<i>- Die Hard.</i>

429
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,125
<i>A security guard got the drop on us</i>

430
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,590
and I think he wants to trade.

431
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,458
How do you want to play this?

432
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,929
Well, the two of us for all those hostages,
doesn't seem quite fair now, does it?

433
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,973
Now, that's enough. Slide it over.

434
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,437
<i>SARAN: Okay, there.</i>
<i>You've got proof that I've got them.</i>

435
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,480
<i>Now let the hostages go.</i>

436
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,516
No.

437
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,585
You heard me, right? I'm...
I'm going to kill them.

438
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:35,485
Yeah, but if we let the hostages go,
we're all dead, so, no.

439
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,220
But...

440
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,758
Oh, I see.

441
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,035
What is it?

442
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,632
They must know where we are.

443
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,575
They've probably sent someone
to come rescue them already.

444
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,180
They're quick. I'll give them that.

445
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,874
- Really?
- Yeah.

446
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,885
I've just got to stay one step
ahead of them.

447
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,348
- You any good with a gun?
- I've never fired one.

448
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:11,658
No. No, of course not. Uh, okay. Okay...

449
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,533
Yes. Okay.

450
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,629
I'm going to go get into position
down the hall,

451
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,140
and when their friends come
looking for us,

452
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,507
I'll "get the drop on them," as they say.

453
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,375
CICERO: Seems like the smart thing to do.

454
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,573
Yeah.

455
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,650
All right, if those two try anything,
shoot them.

456
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,550
Of course, yeah.

457
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,099
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right.

458
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,140
Happens all the time.

459
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,836
He's a night security guard.
Has been since I started working here.

460
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,707
- He would never have killed you.
- Yeah, we got that.

461
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:02,939
He means well.

462
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:06,745
Yeah, I'm sure he does, but we can't have
him running around out there.

463
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,113
We'll be right back.

464
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,345
Can I do anything?

465
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:13,515
No, we got it covered. Just stay here.

466
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,561
Halt.

467
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,663
Disarm, rebel dogs.

468
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:40,545
He left himself wide open from behind.
That was a mistake.

469
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,923
One of the hostages is a nurse.

470
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,220
She was able to stabilize
the wounded guard.

471
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,192
Oh, finally, some good news.

472
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:58,799
It is my belief these men
in fact are not rebels,

473
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,894
but common thieves.

474
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,269
Now, if we rise up against them and...

475
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,134
(SCREAMS)

476
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,650
Please remain calm,

477
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:18,712
as we attempt to rectify
this most unfortunate circumstance.

478
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,993
What have you done with Cicero?

479
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,260
- You killed him, didn't you?
- No, he...

480
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:33,165
- Actually, where is Cicero?
- I don't know.

481
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,370
- What did you do with his body?
- He's fine.

482
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,136
He probably just went to the bathroom
or something.

483
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:43,442
Try selling your lies to someone else,
filthy rebel scum.

484
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:48,110
Okay. This display case,
we need to get into it.

485
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,186
You're security. Where's your access card?

486
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,723
It's safe.
Hidden away in a place you'll never find.

487
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,226
No, no, no... No!

488
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,136
(BEEPING)

489
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,410
Enter your access code, please.

490
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,985
That is a rare, priceless artifact,

491
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,213
and if you think I'm just going
to stand here and let you steal it,

492
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,789
you're out of your minds.

493
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,552
Do whatever you want to me.
I'll never tell.

494
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,027
It is not a rare and priceless artifact.

495
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,995
It's a bomb.

496
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,500
Now, we don't want to hurt anyone,
but we need its power source to get home,

497
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:42,198
and the sooner we do that,
the sooner everyone can leave.

498
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:46,004
- So, what do you say?
- You'll have to kill me first.

499
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,272
(SIGHING)

500
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,820
- What are you doing?
- I'm activating it.

501
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:00,284
(STAMMERING) Why?
Why would you do that?

502
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:05,158
Well, if we can't have this device,
we have no reason to live.

503
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:09,427
Agreed. So, what, you think
it'll take down the whole building?

504
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,195
Well, absolutely.

505
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:15,102
I mean, anyone within a few miles
will probably be incinerated.

506

Maybe more.

507
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,472
And all because he wouldn't give us
the code. Shame.

508
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,671
- You're crazy.
- You ever meet a sane rebel?

509
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,543
You make a good point.

510
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,083
Make your peace with your maker.

511
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,149
Okay, okay. I'll do it.

512
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,925
You made the right choice.

513
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,543
That's interesting.

514
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,005

515
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,046
Well, I'm not sure I can turn this off.

516
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,677
- You actually turned it on?
- Yes.

517
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,381
Why would you do that?

518
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,582
Well, a number of reasons.

519
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:10,627
Firstly, to see if it was real, and secondly,
we needed to make it look convincing.

520
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:13,754
- We did?
- We needed to fool him.

521
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:19,129
What does he know? He wouldn't
have been able to tell the difference, Vala.

522
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,034
Actually, I probably would have.

523
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,198
Oh, please! You didn't know
it was a bomb until I told you so.

524
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,502
I had suspected it.

525
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,372
- No, you didn't.
- Check my service logs.

526
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,672
- Stop talking.
- I specifically made a note...

527
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,146
What's the countdown clock set to?

528
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:38,714
An hour, give or take a few minutes.

529
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,993
- It's not that big a deal.
- Oh, really?

530
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,396
Once we interface it with the gate,

531
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,367
establishing a secure connection should
completely deplete its power source,

532
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,869
which would mean it won't explode.

533
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,931
We now have less than 50, give or take
a few, minutes to get that done.

534
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,771

- Count on less.

but were unable to activate it, to prove it.

They aren't rebels. They don't know
anything about our world.

552

Their demands would prove
otherwise, Cicero.

553

I told them what to say.
I told them what to demand.

554

- You did what?
- All they need is time.

555

Our ring is broken, and once
their friends realize they're stuck here,

556
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,247
they'll send help.

557
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,556
Their friends? Others are on the way?

558
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,432
Yes. They just needed to stall a bit,
so I told them what to say.

559
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,057
Yes. They just needed to stall a bit,
so I told them what to say.

the best thing to do,

There's a 70% chance that
if we dial manually,

574
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,665
we'll be able to establish a connection,

575
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,532
and a 50% chance
the bomb will just go off.

That's 120%.

we establish a wormhole and it blows up.

Jackson, did you catch any of that?

579
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,610
Yeah, 100% chance
we should have brought someone

So they just stuck their heads in the sand?

673
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,479
Even after everything you told them?

674
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,523
Maybe they figure they've got
their own issues to deal with

675
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,455
before they start dealing
with the ones out here, sir.

676
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,620
Unfortunately, we don't have that option,
do we?
