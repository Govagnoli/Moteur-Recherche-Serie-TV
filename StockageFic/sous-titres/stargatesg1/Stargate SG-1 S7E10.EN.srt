1
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:16,846
All right, hold it! Right there!

2
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:24,318
Hi.

3
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:26,716
I am Ryk'I, Goa'uld Moloc.

4
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:30,518
Shal kek nem Ron.

5
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:33,167
I too will die for you, brother.

6
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:38,800
Teal'c of the Tauri, your legend
precedes you. Thank you for meeting me.

7
00:00:38,887 --> 00:00:44,007
We were told that there are a great many
here who believe in freedom for all Jaffa.

8
00:00:50,127 --> 00:00:51,719
Go, go!

9
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:18,398
More rebel Jaffa?

10
00:01:18,487 --> 00:01:21,479
There is only one way to be certain.

11
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,797
Shal kek nem Ron!

12
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,922
Shal kek nem Ron!

13
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:48,157
Warriors of the Tauri...
we mean you no harm.

14
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:02,405
Please, come with us.

15
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:16,198
Shal krek tel kree.

16
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:22,602
The Stargate will not be accessible
for long. We must hurry.

17
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:37,084
- What's she doing?
- There is no time to explain. Come.

18
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,998
- Kel, ma lek.
- Cree, shak nel.

19
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:43,877
- They are outsiders.
- They are SG-1 of the Tauri.

20
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:46,807
Hey, what's going on?

21
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:49,481
This one believes
we should return to our planet.

22
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:53,037
That one does not believe
it would be wise.

23
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:57,845
Please. We knew you'd be here.

24
00:03:58,687 --> 00:03:59,483
How?

25
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:03,560
Our intelligence network runs deep
within the Jaffa of Moloc.

26
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:06,241
We came to ask for help.

27
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:12,238
I promise you will be safe.

28
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:14,636
Well, they did save us.

29
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:40,077
Welcome to Hak'tyl.

30
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:43,845
- Independence?
- Liberation.

31
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:47,681
- Our dwellings are this way.
- We really should call home first.

32
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,998
Let the folks know where we are.
It's past our curfew.

33
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,317
By all means.

34
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:57,604
- Why have we brought them here?
- That was our mission.

35
00:04:57,687 --> 00:05:00,884
- Why was I not told?
- We knew you would disagree.

36
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:04,959
Go ahead, tell Ishta of our success.

37
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:21,160
So, Teal'c, who are they?

38
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:24,125
My knowledge of
the Goa'uld Moloc is limited.

39
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:28,644
However, I am unaware of any Goa'uld
that permits women Jaffa to be warriors.

40
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,718
They seem to be well trained.

41
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:33,367
All females receive training.

42
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:38,286
They have to defend their home world
when their men are called to battle.

43
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:41,040
Can't help but think of
the Greek Amazon mythos.

44
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:43,118
Yes, me too

45
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:48,520
Female warriors captured men from
other tribes in order to mate with them.

46
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:53,920
They sometimes removed their right
breasts in order to fire a bow and arrow.

47
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:56,282
I see neither bow nor arrow.

48
00:05:57,327 --> 00:05:59,124
No.

49
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:02,597
Wait. You don't suppose
that's why they want us, do you?

50
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:05,281
I mean, you know, the three of us.

51
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,359
To mate with?
No. No, I don't think so.

52
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:10,677
Cos you know me.
I'm all for helping people.

53
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,758
Oh, God!

54
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:34,647
Forgive them. For many of the young,
this is the first time they have seen men.

55
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:41,762
This is Ishta, our leader.

56
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:48,725
Howdy, ma'am.
It's nice to meet you.

57
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:53,881
I've heard so...
Actually, I've heard nothing about... you.

58
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,122
Teal'c, of Chulak.

59
00:06:57,207 --> 00:07:01,917
Former first prime of Apophis.
Shol'va, and who has become a legend.

60
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:05,399
That's a bit thick, don't you think?

61
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:11,196
I am no legend. I fight as any true-hearted
Jaffa for the freedom that we deserve.

62
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:19,840
This is Daniel Jackson,
Major Carter and Colonel O'Neill.

63
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,558
Hello.

64
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:28,002
I have asked you here
so that I may propose an alliance.

65
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:31,477
That's a fine idea.
We should sit, talk, nosh.

66
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:35,879
No alliance can form between us and
those who steal symbiotes from a brother.

67
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:39,880
He was no brother of mine.
Just a murderer of innocent children.

68
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:42,003
Shal kree!

69
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,637
There is much to discuss.

70
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:52,838
This is Syn'ac.

71
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:58,639
This morning she laid on her deathbed.

72
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:02,001
She reached the age of Prata
three days ago.

73
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:04,399
- Hm?
- Puberty.

74
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:05,761
Ah.

75
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:10,602
Without the symbiote we procured
this morning, she would be dead now.

76
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:17,235
This is Nesa.

77
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:19,318
Younger sister to Neith.

78
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:25,043
She is next to reach the age.
Without a symbiote, she will die.

79
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:36,081
As will all of our children.

80
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:48,399
30 years ago Moloc decreed that only
male children would be allowed to live.

81
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:52,480
Only they could strengthen his armies
and lead him to victory.

82
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:56,037
Aside from the obvious immorality,
that doesn't make sense.

83
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:59,483
How do you sustain a population
of any gender without women?

84
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,922
The Jaffa life span is longer than humans'.

85
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,362
This could go on for a hundred years.

86
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:09,805
Any female child has to be sacrificed
in a ceremony of fire after they are born.

87
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,560
- They're burned to death?
- Yes.

88
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:19,766
Well, this is... odd.

89
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:23,526
Maybe they feel more comfortable
talking to Sam.

90
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:26,075
Why? Because we have penises?

91
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,087
- Power bar?
- Yeah, thanks.

92
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:37,243
So how did you start bringing them here?

93
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:41,525
As a temple high priestess, part of
my duty is to keep record of births

94
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:44,804
and to preside over
the ceremony of fire itself.

95
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:49,881
I could not sit back and watch my sisters
be murdered and do nothing.

96
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:53,164
As high priestess, I, along with
my seconds Mala and Neith,

97
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:57,445
are allowed access to the Chaapa-ai
of the worlds under Moloc's rule.

98
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,677
No one outside this camp
knows you do this?

99
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:04,636
No. Our duties require us to attend to
missionary matters on various planets.

100
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:08,163
So you offer the parents a chance
for their daughters to live.

101
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:12,525
All but a few Jaffa under Moloc
worship him religiously.

102
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,724
Not even the parents can be trusted.

103
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:20,597
Children have to be spirited away, for fear
we'd be reported to the Imperial Guard.

104
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,804
It is punishable by death
to even question the laws of a god.

105
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:27,357
We have succeeded in saving many
from their birthright of death.

106
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:30,086
So you want our help
to overthrow Moloc?

107
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:36,836
- We may have underestimated you.
- We've gone after Goa'ulds before.

108
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,158
Moloc is very powerful.
His armies are vast.

109
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,443
We have our ways.
And some very powerful allies.

110
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:48,443
Our immediate goals
are somewhat less ambitious.

111
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:52,679
It is a struggle to procure the symbiotes
needed for our young to survive.

112
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:55,235
We've lost many warriors in these raids.

113
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:58,797
It has been said your weapons
are formidable.

114
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:01,276
We also require sustenance.

115
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,325
Supplies among our growing population
are scarce.

116
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:10,164
We are proud warriors. We offer you
our services, and our knowledge in return.

117
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:14,081
We have an extensive intelligence
network among the Jaffa under Moloc.

118
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:17,603
What if I were to offer you an alternative?

119
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:22,283
- An alternative to what?
- To your reliance on the Goa'uld.

120
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,796
Tretonin?

121
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:34,562
- We've had success with it so far.
- On all two test subjects.

122
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:38,242
It hasn't been easy. The Jaffa
won't give up their symbiotes,

123
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:42,206
- despite the fact it could free them.
- They believe they would be weaker.

124
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:44,517
Centuries of Goa'uld brainwashing.

125
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:47,485
- Will these women do it?
- They're thinking about it.

126
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:51,685
They've suffered atrocities
at the hands of the Jaffa who serve Moloc.

127
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:54,600
They don't have a problem killing
a few to survive.

128
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:57,565
A Jaffa is taught
it is more noble to die than to kill.

129
00:11:57,647 --> 00:12:01,481
These children have been genetically
altered to depend on symbiotes,

130
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,400
then had all access to them taken away.

131
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:08,799
Their guardians believe this is
the only way for them to survive.

132
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:12,197
Then they will have to see
that there is another way.

133
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,681
Give'em the old Teal'c charm!

134
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:44,478
It means courage.

135
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:52,041
Each design represents an ideal
that no warrior should ever forget.

136
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:55,756
Impressive that I did not
sense your approach.

137
00:12:55,847 --> 00:13:00,557
Is not stealthiness one of the first talents
taught to a Jaffa soldier?

138
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,525
With varying degrees of success.

139
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:06,883
You wish to talk me into
succumbing to this experiment?

140
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:08,798
Indeed.

141
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,638
Come.

142
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:14,718
Walk with me.

143
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:23,926
Have you really the belief that
this Tretonin is our way to freedom?

144
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:26,965
If it is successful,
it may be the first step.

145
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:32,280
For, as long as Jaffa require symbiotes,
we will be enslaved by the Goa'uld.

146
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:36,883
The benefit a symbiote provides
is not a Jaffa's true strength.

147
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:40,277
We as a people must realise
that sacrifices must be made

148
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,835
if we are to ever truly be free.

149
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:57,805
This is where I come to kelno'reem.

150
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:08,202
Much of our way of life has been designed
to instil our dependence on the Goa'uld.

151
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:12,485
You believe it is wrong that we kill Jaffa
that our children would live.

152
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:15,286
But what is war for
but to preserve our children?

153
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:18,325
We do not engage
the defenceless or the weak.

154
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:22,286
We always fight with honour,
and those that die do not die in vain.

155
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:26,724
One day you will meet a Jaffa scout party
that will not so easily be ambushed.

156
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:29,116
Then you doubt our abilities.

157
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:31,641
Is that what this is about?

158
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:34,605
You speak of progress
and shedding of the old ways,

159
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:38,282
and yet you still think
a woman needs your protection.

160
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:49,364
May your limbs be more nimble
than your tongue.

161
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:52,717
For your sake.

162
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:14,363
Urgh!

163
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:24,365
Do not hold back.
You will only anger me further!

164
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:52,439
You have proven yourself
a worthy adversary. Now hear me!

165
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:56,918
If you say no to Tretonin, you have
an unquenchable thirst for bloodshed,

166
00:15:57,007 --> 00:16:01,319
and that does not serve
those who follow your leadership.

167
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:07,686
- I sense no symbiote in you.
- You are correct.

168
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:13,925
You take this drug yourself,
and yet you conceal it?

169
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,521
Your actions betray your words. All right.

170
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,758
That one means pride.

171
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:41,202
No longer will we need
to lose our sisters in battle.

172
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:45,280
No longer will our daughters
be dependent on symbiotes.

173
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:50,004
Teal'c... has taken the drug.

174
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:53,443
He stands here before you as evidence.

175
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:59,797
I am asking for four volunteers
to travel with me to the Tauri,

176
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:02,841
to test its effectiveness.

177
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:10,557
Was that a pin dropping?

178
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:15,118
- You must not go.
- Mala, I have made my decision.

179
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,198
Hak'tyl needs you.

180
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,482
You are our leader.

181
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:21,637
I will go in your stead.

182
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:24,241
It is my right as Kin'dra.

183
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:26,124
You cannot say no.

184
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:35,723
- You are brave and true.
- I too will go.

185
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,880
- Nesa is of the age.
- She is a child.

186
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,606
I am told that it's not without risk.

187
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:09,406
- But if there is one among us...
- Never!

188
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:12,524
That you even consider this
is an affront to all of us.

189
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,644
Your words are disrespectful.

190
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:26,518
I cannot force her hand.

191
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:34,281
I wish you well.

192
00:18:50,287 --> 00:18:52,517
Dr Jackson? Teal'c?

193
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:57,965
As Teal'c would say, undomesticated
equines couldn't drag him away.

194
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:01,600
The Hak'tyl wanted to learn
about the rebel Jaffa.

195
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:05,919
We can send updates on the progress of
the Tretonin treatment through the MALP.

196
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:08,316
Kind of a PR thing, sir.

197
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:13,241
I'm General Hammond. Welcome to Earth.

198
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:22,403
When you rose up against Apophis,

199
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:25,638
did you leave behind
someone that you loved?

200
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:28,321
My son and I have been reunited.

201
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:33,765
He has become a great warrior, travelling
with my mentor Bra'tac, spreading word.

202
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:39,524
And what of his mother? Does she sit
at home, pining away for her hero?

203
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,158
No, she is dead.

204
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:46,998
I am sorry, Teal'c.

205
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,157
You could not have known.

206
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:54,757
She died when her symbiote matured
and was unable to procure another.

207
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:56,246
I see.

208
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:02,643
- What of my symbiote?
- It's being sustained.

209
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:05,639
We have methods of keeping
a symbiote alive for some time.

210
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:11,120
As far as the Tretonin, finding the right
amount is going to be trial and error.

211
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:15,962
We'll keep increasing the dose
until we get the desired effect.

212
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,718
You're very brave.

213
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:29,843
Not so much as you think.

214
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:32,646
The rebellion that I have helped fuel

215
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:37,323
has caused the Goa'uld
to mistrust the Jaffa with their young.

216
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:39,523
You are making a point?

217
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:42,246
I am speaking only of Drey'auc.

218
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:45,922
She refused to take the life of another
Jaffa, even to preserve her own.

219
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:48,521
No matter what their beliefs
may have been.

220
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:53,957
What are your memories of her?

221
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:57,164
She could be as fierce as the wind...

222
00:20:57,247 --> 00:20:59,238
or as gentle as the sunshine.

223
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:01,841
And she never feared to be either.

224
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:06,166
You still love her.

225
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:09,080
I will always have a place
in my heart for her.

226
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:12,082
You are close to Colonel O'Neill.

227
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:15,364
Yeah. I like to think we have
a special relationship.

228
00:21:15,847 --> 00:21:18,236
I hope to someday have
a special relationship.

229
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:21,239
Oh! No. No, it's not like that.

230
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,079
Like what?

231
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:25,840
We aren't... I mean, we don't...

232
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:29,124
I was speaking of
the mutual respect you share.

233
00:21:29,207 --> 00:21:31,357
I knew that.

234
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:36,004
I am from a world unlike yours, Teal'c.

235
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:39,443
Where women aren't held
in such high regard.

236
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:46,004
My husband was a warrior of high station
in Moloc's Imperial Guard.

237
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,203
I was but one wife of many.

238
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:50,357
Still, as temple priestess,

239
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:54,804
I was afforded many luxuries
to make up for my mistreatment.

240
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:57,196
What has become of your husband?

241
00:21:57,287 --> 00:22:00,757
He was killed in battle,
against a rival Goa'uld.

242
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,558
I was once a temple handmaiden.

243
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:07,357
I fell in love with a young palace guard.

244
00:22:07,447 --> 00:22:11,440
Our relationship was forbidden
because of our station.

245
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:15,566
When it was discovered
that I was to have his child,

246
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:18,719
Moloc sentenced my beloved to death

247
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:21,275
and sacrificed our daughter
before my eyes.

248
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:25,483
I'm so sorry.

249
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:30,357
When will the Goa'uld thirst
for conquest and bloodshed end?

250
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,758
When they are all dead.

251
00:22:41,687 --> 00:22:44,326
Are you OK?

252
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:47,843
- My sister says I shouldn't talk to you.
- You don't have to.

253
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:54,395
I'll just sit here for a while.

254
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:02,238
I'm Daniel.

255
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:06,761
I wasn't talking to you.

256
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:10,044
- Who were you talking to then?
- No one.

257
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:15,358
So how are you?

258
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:19,603
I feel tired.

259
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:22,360
- Who are you talking to?
- No one.

260
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:28,443
What are those on your face?

261
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:32,566
They're called glasses.
They help me see better.

262
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:37,721
- Why would you need to see better?
- Cos my eyes don't see too well.

263
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:41,357
- How do they work?
- Here.

264
00:23:46,607 --> 00:23:48,484
These make your sight worse.

265
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:51,923
Yeah, well, they work differently
for different people.

266
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:54,805
Perhaps you are in need of a symbiote.

267
00:23:54,887 --> 00:23:57,640
Yeah, I'll just stick with the glasses.

268
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:03,243
Neith told me your people do not approve
of our use of symbiotes for healing.

269
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:07,161
It's more complicated than that.
I just think there's a better way.

270
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:10,284
Neith does not want me to participate
in your experiments.

271
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,358
I know.

272
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:19,919
Soon I will require a symbiote.

273
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,761
You don't sound very happy about that.

274
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:26,407
I will become a great warrior like Neith.

275
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:29,479
You know, you can do that
without a symbiote.

276
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:31,603
I can?

277
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,166
Mm-hm.

278
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:35,442
But, uh...

279
00:24:35,527 --> 00:24:37,995
you didn't hear that from me.

280
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,318
Have you nothing to say?

281
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:05,800
I have spoken more in two days
than I have in many years.

282
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:08,117
And so you are done?

283
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,961
Perhaps I should take my leave.

284
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:22,318
Thoughts of your wife still linger.

285
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:24,477
That's understandable.

286
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:29,038
But she's been gone now for over a year.

287
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:33,439
There is no sin in taking comfort
in another lonely soul...

288
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:35,643
if you wish.

289
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,356
Mala's the only one not responding.

290
00:25:57,447 --> 00:26:01,918
Her white blood cell count is way down.
If this keeps up, she'll go into sepsis.

291
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:05,966
- What can you do?
- Continue to increase the Tretonin levels.

292
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:10,120
But she's already at double the dose
that's working in the others.

293
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:14,447
I want to move her to Isolation.

294
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:17,438
We had no guarantees, going in.

295
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:21,361
Some would say an 80 per cent
success rate isn't bad in a trial like this.

296
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,563
Not in the minds of the Jaffa.

297
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:25,558
We're not done yet.

298
00:26:25,647 --> 00:26:29,526
We haven't begun to explore the reasons
why it might not be working.

299
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:32,075
- We need this to work.
- I know.

300
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:08,002
- Morning.
- You had no right to speak to her!

301
00:27:08,087 --> 00:27:10,317
- Sorry.
- I saved her from her birthright.

302
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:14,161
And it will be the symbiote I procure
that will save her once again.

303
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:16,886
I have lost two sisters,
and I will not lose another!

304
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,923
OK. OK.

305
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:21,282
You lost two sisters. I'm sorry.

306
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:23,927
Ishta was able to save me.

307
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:27,283
But she couldn't save
the next two girls sired by my father.

308
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:31,155
He was a Jaffa stationed
high in the Imperial Guard.

309
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:36,116
I swore that when I came of age
no more of my sisters would die.

310
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:42,480
When I heard my mother had given birth
to another female, I knew what I had to do.

311
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,122
You should be proud of that.

312
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:50,440
My father discovered the ruse Ishta and I
used to keep Nesa away from the fire.

313
00:27:50,527 --> 00:27:53,439
I had to kill him... so we could escape.

314
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:58,766
Well, don't you want to give Nesa
a chance to live free of the Goa'uld?

315
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:02,202
Not your way.

316
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:25,876
You have moved me away from the others
because you didn't wish to frighten them.

317
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:28,527
The truth is, you're not doing so well.

318
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:31,360
You're more susceptible to infection.

319
00:28:31,447 --> 00:28:34,280
How are the others responding
to treatment?

320
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,517
Good. Very good.

321
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:40,480
Janet?

322
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:46,360
Her BP is 60/40.

323
00:28:46,447 --> 00:28:48,324
Give her a bolus.

324
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:54,121
We have to put her symbiote back.

325
00:28:54,207 --> 00:28:56,846
- Do not.
- If we don't, you could die.

326
00:28:56,927 --> 00:29:00,636
This must work
if my people are to be free.

327
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:06,482
If I continue to be enslaved
by the Goa'uld I carried,

328
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:09,001
I am as good as dead.

329
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:13,918
Please.

330
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:29,880
You challenge Ishta?

331
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:32,162
She is no longer fit to lead us.

332
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:35,319
She consorts with Teal'c.
Her judgment has been clouded.

333
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:39,923
Our sisters risked their lives for
the experiment. Do you see no benefit?

334
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:44,080
Even if the Tretonin works, it merely
places our dependence on the humans...

335
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:46,806
Whom you also do not trust.

336
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:50,323
Who is to say their intentions are pure?

337
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:54,559
Their leaders are men. They wish to
sap our strength with this drug.

338
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:59,004
We are safe here now, but if Moloc learnt
we were behind the raids on his Jaffa...

339
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:03,239
Our freedom lies in dominance
over the Goa'uld.

340
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:06,797
We must fight, so that we may use
their symbiotes to our advantage.

341
00:30:06,887 --> 00:30:10,163
Only then will we control our own destiny.

342
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:14,002
I wish to know,

343
00:30:14,087 --> 00:30:18,524
if I am to challenge Ishta's leadership,
who will follow me?

344
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:21,878
Neith!

345
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:27,125
You must come quick.
It is Nesa.

346
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:31,244
I'm not waiting any longer.

347
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:53,521
How long before
we see some improvement?

348
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:55,245
Not long, I hope.

349
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:01,086
She's coding. Assert CPR.

350
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:04,079
Give me one milligram epi. Prep for defib.

351
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:13,158
Be strong, sister.

352
00:31:15,087 --> 00:31:17,078
I will not fail you.

353
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:31,326
- What is happening?
- Neith has claimed Joma Secu!

354
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:33,637
Daniel. Teal'c.
This is Sam. Come in.

355
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:38,002
Daniel. Teal'c.
This is Sam. Come in.

356
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:41,124
- Go ahead, Sam. It's Daniel.
- We have some bad news.

357
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:43,767
Things aren't going well here either.
What's up?

358
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:46,240
It's Mala.

359
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:53,964
Ishta!

360
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:58,165
- Ishta!
- You dare interfere!

361
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:00,363
She challenged me. It is my right.

362
00:32:00,447 --> 00:32:02,483
It is your right to grant mercy.

363
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,558
Excuse me!

364
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:11,125
Look, I know this is
not a good time for this...

365
00:32:11,207 --> 00:32:13,357
Speak!

366
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:16,007
Mala's dead.

367
00:32:16,087 --> 00:32:18,123
What?

368
00:32:20,687 --> 00:32:23,201
I'm sorry.

369
00:32:23,287 --> 00:32:25,323
How?

370
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:27,796
The Tretonin wasn't working.

371
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:31,084
They tried to reintroduce her symbiote...

372
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,727
I just want you to know
the other women are fine.

373
00:32:33,807 --> 00:32:37,038
See what your weakness has brought?

374
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:39,595
Nesa is in need of a symbiote!

375
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,083
She shall have one.

376
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:56,203
Do not make this mistake.
Moloc will not allow this to continue.

377
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:59,484
- You give me no choice.
- How many warriors have to die?

378
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:04,846
Our sisters in your care will be returned
safely, or the two of you will be sacrificed.

379
00:33:05,327 --> 00:33:07,318
Kree, sha Mel lak!

380
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:33,436
I know you wanna stop them, but even if
we got out, we don't know where they are.

381
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,283
Come with me.

382
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:02,761
She insisted.

383
00:34:02,847 --> 00:34:07,477
I do not wish for someone else to die
so that I might live.

384
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:10,161
I do not want to take a symbiote.

385
00:34:15,247 --> 00:34:18,478
Did you talk to your sister?

386
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:21,478
She would not listen.

387
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,322
It is my right to decide, is it not?

388
00:34:26,127 --> 00:34:28,118
I'm not sure.

389
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:31,358
It should be.

390
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:34,644
What happened to Mala?

391
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:37,799
We don't know. It was partly
a reaction to her own symbiote.

392
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:41,004
It shouldn't happen to someone
who was never implanted.

393
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:43,965
And the Tretonin worked in others,
did it not?

394
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:45,799
Yes.

395
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:51,921
I wish to try it.

396
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:55,278
OK.

397
00:34:57,367 --> 00:35:00,245
Do you know where
Ishta and Neith have gone?

398
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:03,484
No.

399
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:05,922
I do.

400
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:23,004
Sel ma-ka nee!

401
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:30,843
We have been fortunate here this day.
More have died than needed to.

402
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:33,805
We have saved the life of my sister.

403
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:49,838
Shal...

404
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:51,997
kek nem Ron.

405
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:57,685
Is the symbiote too near maturity?

406
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,805
- What is wrong?
- This Jaffa...

407
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:08,003
has the same wish for freedom as do we.

408
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:11,284
Then he should not have fought with
those that follow Moloc.

409
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:15,838
How many others... that might have been
our allies have we killed this day?

410
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:18,122
I'll do it myself.

411
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:23,802
No!

412
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:35,243
- Are you OK?
- She's severely wounded.

413
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:38,000
Her symbiote is damaged as well.

414
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:41,527
Ishta, you have a choice.

415
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,521
I don't know how much longer
I can keep her alive.

416
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:08,397
If I'm going to administer the Tretonin,
it's now or never.

417
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:12,878
You must speak to her.

418
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:30,598
Neith.

419
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:37,038
Your symbiote is dying.

420
00:37:40,527 --> 00:37:42,995
You must procure another.

421
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:47,243
No. Those ways are over.

422
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:51,639
- You sentence me to death.
- I ask you to choose life.

423
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,558
She will not listen to me.

424
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:09,845
Well, maybe she'll listen to her sister.

425
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:16,324
Please, Neith.

426
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:24,045
- You betrayed me.
- No, you betray me.

427
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:29,523
Since before I can remember, you have
taught me to believe in our freedom.

428
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:34,123
You said you would do anything
so that you might protect me.

429
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:37,995
One day I will be a great warrior like you.

430
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:40,878
But I am not yet.

431
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:44,397
I still need you.

432
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:49,722
I have chosen to live free.

433
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,477
You must choose to take the Tretonin

434
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:57,355
if you are to continue
to teach and protect me.

435
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:01,278
Please.

436
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:04,757
I do not wish you to die.

437
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:39,115
- Will you come and visit?
- Yes, of course.

438
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:42,882
My sister's developed
quite an affection for you.

439
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,958
Neith!

440
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:49,202
We are grateful to our new friends.

441
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:53,439
On behalf of the Hak'tyl,
I'd like to express our thanks.

442
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:56,121
Our medical team
will be checking in regularly.

443
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:59,836
Take note of any symptoms that could be
side effects of the Tretonin.

444
00:39:59,927 --> 00:40:02,361
You trained us well
in the use of the medicine.

445
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:05,007
And the supplies
you have provided will go far.

446
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:10,639
If there's anything else you need -
anything - call us. Send us an email.

447
00:40:10,727 --> 00:40:14,561
Just let not so many moons go by
before we see you again.

448
00:40:14,647 --> 00:40:17,684
Don't worry, I'm sure we'll be in...

449
00:40:21,647 --> 00:40:23,638
touch.

450
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:58,767
