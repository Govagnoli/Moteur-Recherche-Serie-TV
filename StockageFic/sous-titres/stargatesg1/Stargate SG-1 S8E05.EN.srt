1
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:09,464
It's time.

2
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:11,698
Wait.

3
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:13,779
It's OK.

4
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:19,739
Just relax.

5
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:28,386
Give your vision a moment to adjust.

6
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:30,982
You haven't used it for a while.

7
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:36,419
- How's that?
- Better.

8
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:38,665
Your eyes...

9
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:41,182
It's nice to finally see them.

10
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:44,219
Leda.

11
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:46,784
Welcome back.

12
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:50,344
Where am I?

13
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:55,984
Many miles from the city. This house
belonged to my uncle. We're safe here.

14
00:00:56,068 --> 00:00:58,059
The city.

15
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:01,867
I remember being there.

16
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:04,701
Something terrible happened.

17
00:01:07,428 --> 00:01:09,623
Many people died.

18
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:15,906
- There's food, if you feel strong enough.
- It's our fault, isn't it?

19
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:18,661
None of this would have happened
if we hadn't come.

20
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:20,545
You're alive.

21
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:25,827
And considering what you've been
through, that alone is a miracle.

22
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:38,817
First discovered in the Kirellian
wastelands over 150 years ago,

23
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:44,904
and the highlight of our antiquities
collection, the Great Ring of Avidan.

24
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:54,699
Researchers estimate the Ring to be
at least several thousand years old.

25
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:57,985
And while its origin
remains a subject of debate,

26
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:02,220
many believe it was created by
ancient worshippers to honour their gods.

27
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:06,904
It's thought that the peculiar symbols on
the Ring represent the names of the gods.

28
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:11,300
But no one has been able to decipher...

29
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:21,425
..exactly what they mean.

30
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,268
Get back!

31
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:05,779
Commander Gareth.

32
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:09,622
In the name of the people
of the Rand Protectorate, I welcome you.

33
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,303
- You're Colonel Carter?
- This is Teal'c and Dr Daniel Jackson.

34
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:16,937
It is a pleasure to finally
meet you all face to face.

35
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:18,586
But, please, come.

36
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,581
We have many questions,
as I'm sure you do as well.

37
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:26,263
Sorry we scared the tourists.
We've made contact with a lot of planets,

38
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:29,260
but this is the first time
we've come out of a museum piece.

39
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:32,465
One of our artefacts
coming to life was surprising,

40
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:35,858
but that pales in comparison
to its purpose.

41
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:38,143
It is almost beyond imagining.

42
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:42,506
- As is the fact that you're human.
- My chief aide, Jared Kane.

43
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:45,739
Believe it or not,
there's a good reason for us being human.

44
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,864
Which we'll get to in due time.

45
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:50,985
Colonel, I hope that
once we gain each other's trust,

46
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:54,856
you'll shed some light on the technology
that powers the Great Ring.

47
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:57,178
It is unlike anything we have seen before.

48
00:04:57,268 --> 00:05:00,897
We call it the Stargate. Our people
share the same hope, Commander.

49
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:02,944
Of course. In due time.

50
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:06,384
I take it the Great Ring
is a recurring motif in your culture.

51
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:10,302
It is a reminder of traditions
that predate our age of enlightenment.

52
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:13,858
Most people wear them
more for fashion than for religious belief.

53
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:18,180
Our history tells of an age when
all-powerful gods ruled our world.

54
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:20,657
The Ring was supposedly
their source of power.

55
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:23,501
These are merely legends
from our ancient past.

56
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:26,500
However, the activation
of the Ring may cause a stir

57
00:05:26,588 --> 00:05:30,103
amongst those few
who still follow the old ways.

58
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:49,780
Sorry.

59
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:52,302
I didn't mean to wake you.

60
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:53,901
It's all right.

61
00:05:58,548 --> 00:06:00,539
For the pain.

62
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:12,344
I wish I could give you more,
but our medicine is in short supply.

63
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:14,419
Thank you.

64
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:19,376
- I'll leave you alone.
- No. No, please stay.

65
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:29,021
- How did it go with the...
- Caledonians? Not so well, actually.

66
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:33,097
My time with their representatives
was limited by Rand security.

67
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:38,899
Gareth had concerns that we'd tell the
Caledonians too much about the Stargate.

68
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:42,067
Let me venture a wild guess.

69
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:45,708
They don't get along so good.

70
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:50,179
The Rand Protectorate and the Caledonian
Federation are locked in a cold war.

71
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:53,465
Each has enough weapons
to wipe the other off the planet.

72
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,379
Sounds familiar.

73
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:58,187
There's a third element
which has me more concerned.

74
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:01,499
A group of religious fundamentalists
led by a man named Soren.

75
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,421
These people think that life
was created by gods

76
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,262
and that these gods will return
and reward them for their faith.

77
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:11,704
By coming through the Stargate,
we confirmed their beliefs.

78
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:16,737
Because it was in public, the government
has been unable to prevent the rumours.

79
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:21,618
These people were considered zealots
who took the ancient texts too literally.

80
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,337
The gate being activated has given them
proof that they were right.

81
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:29,023
- Their numbers will grow.
- That's terrible.

82
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:33,179
And yet, not our problem.

83
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,100
Let me go back.

84
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:42,340
If what you say is true, things are gonna
get a little out of hand over there.

85
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:46,216
- Because of us. If we hadn't...
- They'd be far better off, I know.

86
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:50,062
We're always sticking our noses
where they don't belong. It's what we do.

87
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:52,867
I could make them see
it's not the end of the world.

88
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:56,338
If we leave now,
who knows what could happen?

89
00:07:56,428 --> 00:07:59,500
We have to help them. You know that.

90
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:06,141
Regular contact. No exceptions.
The second things get squirrelly...

91
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:08,219
- Thank you.
- Daniel.

92
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,543
- Squirrelly.
- Squirrelly.

93
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:25,498
You shouldn't be standing.

94
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,706
Don't let appearances fool you.
I still feel terrible.

95
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:35,061
- Leda, everything you've done for me...
- Has been for my sake as well as yours.

96
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,264
So much has happened.

97
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:40,704
Caring for you
has helped me continue on.

98
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:45,098
Yeah, what has happened, exactly?
I mean...

99
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:49,943
I remember being in the bunker with
Commander Gareth. We were attacked.

100
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:53,623
- The rest is a fog.
- Jared is away searching for survivors.

101
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,906
He should be back in a few days. It would
be best if he answered your questions.

102
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:00,343
Jared Kane.

103
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:04,138
I remember him. He was in the bunker.

104
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:06,822
My husband was chief aide
to Commander Gareth.

105
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:08,546
Husband? Was?

106
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:11,825
He insisted I move here
when the fighting reached the capital.

107
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:15,184
He felt you would be safest in my care.

108
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:21,385
I've got to get back to my own world, or
contact them and let them know I'm OK.

109
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:23,538
Reaching the Ring would be impossible.

110
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:28,907
Rebel patrols have been sighted. To leave
the estate grounds would be dangerous.

111
00:09:28,988 --> 00:09:32,583
Not to mention the fact
that you are far from healed.

112
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:35,307
You must rest, Daniel.

113
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:38,858
Leda, what happened
to Commander Gareth?

114
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:49,467
- Give me good news, Colonel.
- I wish I could, sir.

115
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:53,700
We met with Soren, leader of the rebels.
It was less constructive than we'd hoped.

116
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:55,744
How much less?

117
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,183
We were only allowed to see him
for 15 minutes.

118
00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:02,500
- After keeping us waiting for hours.
- Important matters of state, no doubt.

119
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:07,742
He's united the fundamentalist factions in
the Protectorate. That puts him in control.

120
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:11,059
He was unwilling to allow us
to search for Daniel Jackson.

121
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:16,063
Before he insisted we leave, he promised
he would look into it on our behalf.

122
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:19,106
- Whatever that means.
- Right.

123
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:22,578
- What about a UAV?
- He won't give us access to the surface.

124
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:28,618
Plus, he claims it would interfere with
their own radio communication systems.

125
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:34,704
I'm sorry, sir, but at this point we have
no way of knowing if Daniel's still alive.

126
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,541
And what does blue mean?

127
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:51,257
It's our second-highest level
of military alert status.

128
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:54,943
There's been civil unrest
in urban centres across the country.

129
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:58,907
Over a dozen municipalities have
fallen into the hands of Soren's troops.

130
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:03,061
- Our forces are pacifying those areas.
- Pacifying?

131
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:05,616
Reclaiming our cities
from religious madmen.

132
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:10,099
- So civil unrest means you go to blue.
- Under normal circumstances, no.

133
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:15,057
Unfortunately, the situation
has caused other problems.

134
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:27,097
What's going on?

135
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:30,180
We heightened our alert status
to match the Caledonians'.

136
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:35,467
I promise you we will share this
technology once we fully understand it.

137
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:39,097
<i>Once you've assessed</i>
<i>its advantages to your security.</i>

138
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:42,942
<i>You have refused to allow</i>
<i>our scientists access to the Great Ring.</i>

139
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:45,861
<i>You have limited our access</i>
<i>to the offworlders.</i>

140
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:48,940
<i>We do not feel as much a part</i>
<i>of this discovery as you do.</i>

141
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:52,577
Had the Ring been activated in Caledonia,
you would have done the same.

142
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:55,740
Minister Treydan,
I am asking your government for patience.

143
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:59,457
Stand down your high alert.
We will do the same.

144
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:02,616
<i>You trust your people too much,</i>
<i>Commander.</i>

145
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:08,260
<i>Caledonia has been under strict martial</i>
<i>law since news of the offworlders' arrival.</i>

146
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:11,420
<i>Our domestic security remains intact.</i>

147
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:14,705
The citizens of this world are not children.

148
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:18,542
They just need time
to come to terms with this information.

149
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:23,019
<i>Soren and his followers have already</i>
<i>seized more than a dozen of your cities.</i>

150
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:26,987
<i>Your people are panicked.</i>
<i>Your country is on the verge of collapse.</i>

151
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:30,424
<i>I urge you to deal with this</i>
<i>in a swift and decisive manner.</i>

152
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:33,944
<i>Should control of the Rand Protectorate</i>
<i>fall into Soren's hands,</i>

153
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:36,701
<i>we'll consider it an act of war.</i>

154
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:42,863
<i>This is Daniel Jackson calling</i>
<i>Stargate Command. Come in, please.</i>

155
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:47,741
This is Daniel Jackson calling
Stargate Command. Please respond.

156
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:55,141
This is Daniel Jackson calling
Stargate Command. Come in, please.

157
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:59,460
This is Daniel Jackson calling
Stargate Command. Please respond.

158
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:01,539
Any luck?

159
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:05,023
No. Nothing yet.

160
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:08,542
You've been trying for days.

161
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:12,064
Something seems to be jamming
all the signals I'm picking up.

162
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:15,458
There's people there,
but nothing clear enough to respond to.

163
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:18,585
But you think your friends
will be able to hear you.

164
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:23,583
It's kind of a timing thing. If the Stargate's
open they'll be able to pick up my signal.

165
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:26,819
If your gate isn't buried in rubble,
or worse.

166
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:32,301
Well, while you're waiting to be rescued,
you could use some fresh air.

167
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:34,697
If you think you're up to it.

168
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:43,420
How can you be sure Soren
and his followers aren't right?

169
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:46,102
How can you know that their gods aren't...

170
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:49,624
Benevolent?
Cos I've met more than a few of them.

171
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,986
Trust me, they're the opposite.
And they're definitely not gods.

172
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:57,378
- Then what are they?
- The short form?

173
00:13:57,468 --> 00:14:02,337
They're a parasitical alien race
that steals advanced technology

174
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:08,025
and rules via fear and intimidation
and has a penchant for melodrama.

175
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:11,623
Trust me, if Soren ever met one,
he'd be singing a different tune.

176
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,825
You said you've fought them and won.

177
00:14:14,908 --> 00:14:18,696
Yeah. We got lucky a few times, that's all.

178
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:21,586
But there's hope, isn't there?

179
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:26,825
You think what happened was your fault,
don't you?

180
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:31,299
It was better that your people activated
the Great Ring than the Goa'uld.

181
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:35,904
- You think so? Right now, I'm not so sure.
- You didn't know what would happen.

182
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:40,106
When the fighting began, you could have
gone back to your planet, but you stayed.

183
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:41,462
- Yeah.
- To help us.

184
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,381
- For all the good it did.
- Daniel...

185
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:48,347
There has been distrust between our
country and Caledonia for generations.

186
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:51,659
It was only a matter of time
before something set it off.

187
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:54,785
We did this to ourselves.

188
00:14:54,868 --> 00:15:00,864
And since you've come here, I've begun
to think we may have a chance to undo it.

189
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:03,587
To rebuild.

190
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:07,377
This is Stargate Command
calling Dr Jackson. Do you read me?

191
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:12,820
- Can you boost the signal?
- We're at maximum gain, Colonel.

192
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:16,662
This is Stargate Command
calling Daniel Jackson. Do you copy?

193
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:18,978
- Anything?
- Not yet, sir.

194
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:23,903
We're picking up transmissions, but none
are clear enough to tell if they're Daniel.

195
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:28,106
Both sides may have employed radio-
jamming measures prior to the attack,

196
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:32,420
meaning any signals coming from
outside the command bunker are a mess.

197
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:35,227
- We're working on it.
- Anything from SG-9 yet?

198
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:39,301
They just reported in. Sounds like
the negotiations are going nowhere.

199
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:42,983
Soren is still refusing to allow us
to send teams to look for Daniel.

200
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:47,664
He said our presence on the planet
would only cause more panic and fear.

201
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:49,420
Well, OK.

202
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:53,387
Sounds like I should
meet these people myself.

203
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:15,941
Kane.

204
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:17,859
Dr Jackson.

205
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,857
We got as close
to what was left of the capital as we could.

206
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,941
Soren is conducting full sweeps
of the region, searching for survivors.

207
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:31,943
Any suspected of remaining loyal to the
old government are executed on the spot.

208
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:34,417
Haven't enough people died?

209
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:38,467
I don't think that matters to him.
It's about continuing chaos, not peace.

210
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:40,539
You're right.

211
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:45,905
People are too afraid to fight back.
Most have given up hope.

212
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:49,867
It's just a matter of time
before they pledge loyalty to Soren.

213
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:53,145
Kane, what the hell happened that night?

214
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:57,824
I remember being in the bunker
and then waking up here.

215
00:16:57,908 --> 00:16:59,580
It was the end.

216
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:12,580
I'm sorry, Dr Jackson,
you really can't be in here right now.

217
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:15,341
I heard something about
the Stargate being moved.

218
00:17:15,428 --> 00:17:19,626
Rebels have seized Rand's major cities,
including sections of the capital.

219
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,826
We had the Stargate moved into
the bunker complex for security purposes.

220
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:26,297
What are the Caledonians doing?

221
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:30,745
Their missile systems are deployed and
primed. As a result, we've done the same.

222
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:34,821
It might be best
if you return to your planet now.

223
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:40,896
Commander.

224
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:44,867
Minister Treydan
for you on a coded frequency.

225
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,498
Put him through.

226
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:57,228
<i>We've monitored your country</i>
<i>and we're most concerned.</i>

227
00:17:57,308 --> 00:18:02,666
I understand, Minister. Rest assured,
we are close to reclaiming vital areas...

228
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,023
<i>Now is not the time for rhetoric.</i>

229
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:09,386
<i>Our reports indicate large elements of</i>
<i>your military are on the brink of mutiny.</i>

230
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:12,380
<i>Your civil unrest has become a civil war.</i>

231
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:16,345
<i>Should any of your weapons</i>
<i>fall into the wrong hands,</i>

232
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,988
<i>no one in my country would be safe.</i>

233
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:21,741
That will not happen. I can promise you.

234
00:18:21,828 --> 00:18:25,343
<i>Just as you promised our scientists</i>
<i>full access to the Stargate.</i>

235
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:28,101
<i>You hide information</i>
<i>about the alien device,</i>

236
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:31,066
<i>and now you deny</i>
<i>your country has slipped into chaos.</i>

237
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:34,345
We respected the guidelines
of our treaty to the letter.

238
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:36,896
Our report outlined everything we know...

239
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:41,061
<i>Except what you deemed</i>
<i>advantageous to your national security.</i>

240
00:18:41,148 --> 00:18:43,218
One moment, Minister.

241
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:50,098
Rebel forces just detonated an explosive
device near one of our missile facilities.

242
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:55,467
As of this moment we understand
the facility to be compromised.

243
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,941
Forgive me.
I must cut our conversation short.

244
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,747
<i>My intelligence advisers</i>
<i>have just informed me</i>

245
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:15,025
<i>of a massive explosion</i>
<i>near one of your missile facilities.</i>

246
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:16,780
<i>Is this true?</i>

247
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:19,587
We are gathering information.
We will contain...

248
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:22,341
<i>The time for containment</i>
<i>is long past, Commander.</i>

249
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:25,625
<i>We cannot allow your missiles</i>
<i>to fall into Soren's hands.</i>

250
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,417
Treydan, give us time.
This need not escalate.

251
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:31,658
<i>We are targeting your missiles only.</i>

252
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:34,820
<i>If you do not wish a full-scale war,</i>
<i>you will not retaliate.</i>

253
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,261
Treydan!

254
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:41,297
Commander, we've detected multiple
launch signals from Caledonian positions.

255
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,858
It could've been contained

256
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:03,624
if Soren hadn't gained control of one of
our sites and counterattacked Caledonia.

257
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,745
After that it devolved into a full-scale war.

258
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:11,379
Within a matter of days,
all our cities were levelled.

259
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:14,221
Only a fraction
of our population has survived,

260
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:17,380
existing mainly in outlying areas.

261
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:21,586
As for the Caledonians, I've heard
they're trying to rebuild what they can.

262
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:25,900
It won't be much. They struck first, but
our missiles were much more accurate.

263
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:27,216
And Soren?

264
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:30,698
He used the chaos
to make his move on the bunker.

265
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:33,382
Then how did you save me?

266
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:37,978
Actually, from what I understand,
it was you who saved me.

267
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:44,660
Kane.

268
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:51,866
- This is insane.
- Soren's forces are moving in.

269
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:56,021
I can get you to the Stargate,
but we have to go now.

270
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:37,859
This way.

271
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:45,187
Here, through that door.

272
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:13,178
Get down!

273
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:23,147
Loyalist soldiers found us first
and got us out of the city.

274
00:22:23,228 --> 00:22:27,858
Your wounds were worse than mine.
Bringing you here was the only option.

275
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:30,860
What happened to Commander Gareth?

276
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:35,021
He was executed
shortly after the bunker fell.

277
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:38,062
Since he took power,
Soren has set up a government -

278
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,867
not that there's much
of Rand left to govern.

279
00:22:40,948 --> 00:22:46,500
However, we do know he does control
whatever's left of the bunker complex.

280
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:48,897
Including the Stargate.

281
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,023
I'm sorry, Dr Jackson.

282
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:02,545
Howdy, fellas.

283
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:05,146
Welcome to Earth.

284
00:23:05,228 --> 00:23:08,459
General O'Neill, it is an honour.

285
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:12,780
I greet you in the name
of our great nation - Avidan.

286
00:23:12,868 --> 00:23:17,464
- You changed the name?
- "Avidan" speaks to our people's beliefs.

287
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:20,699
It is from an ancient Goa'uld dialect.

288
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:23,700
It means "the gods are just".

289
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:30,339
Good choice.

290
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:40,426
So, you're saying that Soren is still
using the bunker as a command centre?

291
00:23:40,508 --> 00:23:43,466
Damage in the city would be too severe.

292
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:47,985
Then he hasn't totally
consolidated his power yet, has he?

293
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:51,538
If we could retake the bunker,
we'd effectively overthrow Soren.

294
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:56,144
The bunker's heavily fortified and I have
only a dozen men. It'd be suicide.

295
00:23:56,228 --> 00:24:00,824
Not with help. If I could reach my friends,
we could regain control of the gate.

296
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:03,900
If you could reach them.

297
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:07,697
I know that you've been trying
to make radio contact with your planet.

298
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:12,908
Without success. I understand your wish
to return, but it simply isn't possible.

299
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:15,456
This isn't about that.
My people can help you.

300
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:18,540
Like you helped us before?

301
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:24,225
I admire your passion, but too much has
happened to fix with one heroic action.

302
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:27,778
We have to accept the fact
that Soren has won.

303
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:30,098
Rand belongs to him now.

304
00:24:38,908 --> 00:24:43,663
It is obvious you revere the Great Ring
as much as we do, General O'Neill.

305
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,101
Oh, yeah.

306
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:50,182
We love the old gal. Quite possibly
for different reasons than you.

307
00:24:50,268 --> 00:24:56,264
We both seek to defend our way of life, do
we not? To protect their very existence.

308
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:59,499
You do not represent
the people of your world.

309
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:01,977
You kill those who believe differently.

310
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:06,186
You speak what is on your mind.
I admire that.

311
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:08,463
Actually, in your case...

312
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,221
he's holding back.

313
00:25:12,148 --> 00:25:14,264
Carter?

314
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:19,103
We're prepared to offer aid in exchange
for help in locating Daniel Jackson.

315
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:23,978
Food and medical supplies, plus support
personnel to help stabilise the situation.

316
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:27,738
You cannot truly believe
that your friend is still alive?

317
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:30,581
Oh, he's a resourceful fella.

318
00:25:31,788 --> 00:25:35,337
Your offer is most generous,
but I'm afraid we must decline.

319
00:25:35,428 --> 00:25:41,139
We are, however, particularly interested
in your weapons technology.

320
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:44,140
Your people are facing
starvation and disease.

321
00:25:44,228 --> 00:25:47,379
What has happened
to our world is most unfortunate.

322
00:25:47,468 --> 00:25:49,186
And yet vital.

323
00:25:49,268 --> 00:25:53,307
Those who refused to believe
needed to be purged from existence

324
00:25:53,388 --> 00:25:56,107
so that we could begin anew.

325
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,578
You know, in these parts,

326
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:03,263
we like to call that
"crimes against humanity".

327
00:26:04,268 --> 00:26:10,423
If all you care about is spiritual salvation,
what do you need the weapons for?

328
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:14,103
The revolution is not yet complete.

329
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:16,463
You want to take over Caledonia too.

330
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:21,668
As I said,
the revolution is not yet complete.

331
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:34,544
- Leda, you have to talk to your husband.
- What am I supposed to say to him?

332
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:39,099
That it's not too late to regain control,
to rebuild - everything you told me before.

333
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:41,543
Daniel, I can't.

334
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:44,461
- Why?
- Because I'd be lying.

335
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:46,379
Jared is right.

336
00:26:46,468 --> 00:26:51,542
Those unlucky enough to live through
what's happened will die soon enough,

337
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:56,463
either through disease or one of
Soren's purges. There is no future.

338
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,221
Leda, you were right.

339
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:03,142
There is hope. Don't doubt that, please.

340
00:27:05,068 --> 00:27:08,185
- You believe your people can help us?
- Yes.

341
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:12,667
And what if you do overthrow Soren?
What then?

342
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:14,898
You simply leave?

343
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:22,816
When Jared became part of
Commander Gareth's inner circle, he...

344
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,466
changed.

345
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:26,539
He became remote...

346
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,419
and distant.

347
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:35,782
I'd forgotten what it was like
just to talk to someone.

348
00:27:38,188 --> 00:27:39,985
To feel.

349
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:42,218
Leda.

350
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:46,821
I'll speak to him, Daniel.

351
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:49,627
But he won't hear me.

352
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,586
Waste of time. Waste.

353
00:28:00,108 --> 00:28:04,101
I think the fact he hasn't left yet
could mean he's still willing to deal.

354
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:09,103
He has no need for humanitarian aid. The
chaos has only strengthened his position.

355
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,497
Well, we can't just give up.

356
00:28:11,588 --> 00:28:14,148
Yes, I know that.

357
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:18,858
We're continuing to monitor radio signals
from the planet. One could be from Daniel.

358
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,860
- If we can find a way to contact him...
- Find it!

359
00:28:27,948 --> 00:28:29,620
Yes, sir.

360
00:28:38,148 --> 00:28:43,506
It's madness. It will wipe out any chance
to mount a unified resistance in the future.

361
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:47,547
But what if he's right? What if this
is our best opportunity to defeat Soren?

362
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:49,778
You would have me throw away my life,

363
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:52,860
and the lives of my men,
so Daniel can return to his world?

364
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:56,827
It's not about that.
It's about rebuilding our world.

365
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:59,980
His friends can help us do that.

366
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:03,663
Jared, our people need this.

367
00:29:03,748 --> 00:29:06,706
You mean he needs this.

368
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:11,020
- I'm not blind. I know you've grown close.
- Jared, it's not what you think.

369
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:13,099
Let me speak.

370
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:19,942
If I could live the last few years differently,
Leda, I would. I would make the time.

371
00:29:20,028 --> 00:29:23,703
But we no longer
have the luxury for regrets.

372
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:27,421
I need to know. Do you love him?

373
00:29:28,748 --> 00:29:30,340
Leda?

374
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:35,977
I trust him.

375
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:44,823
Once order is established, the people
of Avidan will live differently than before -

376
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:49,459
simply, humbly,
waiting for our gods' inevitable return.

377
00:29:49,548 --> 00:29:54,463
You know, we've met
these gods upon whom you're so hot,

378
00:29:54,548 --> 00:29:57,381
and, trust me,
they're not what you think they are.

379
00:29:57,468 --> 00:30:00,062
They will reward your worship
with enslavement.

380
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:02,821
You are not the first
to try to sway our beliefs,

381
00:30:02,908 --> 00:30:06,617
but I can assure you
our faith is unshakable.

382
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:12,784
This is not about faith.
This is about a means to power.

383
00:30:31,508 --> 00:30:33,578
That went well.

384
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:36,421
Sir, you better get up here.

385
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:51,740
- What?
- By implementing new spread-spectrum...

386
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:53,898
Carter. Carter, Carter.

387
00:30:53,988 --> 00:30:56,821
<i>Hello? Guys?</i>

388
00:30:56,908 --> 00:30:59,547
- We found him.
- Sweet.

389
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:04,222
- Daniel?
- <i>Jack?</i>

390
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:07,618
- <i>Nice to hear your voice.</i>
- Likewise.

391
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:09,585
Coming home, or what?

392
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:13,661
<i>Trying to. As soon as I find my kel tesh.</i>

393
00:31:15,108 --> 00:31:16,985
- What?
- <i>Uh...</i>

394
00:31:17,428 --> 00:31:20,306
<i>Looks a lot like my rin kol nok.</i>

395
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:25,701
<i>You know, I lent it to you</i>
<i>for, uh, grel-kar kree-nor day.</i>

396
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:29,227
- He's changed.
- Sir, he's speaking Goa'uld.

397
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:32,106
<i>Rin kol nok</i> means strategy.

398
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:35,100
<i>Kel tesh</i> speaks
of a well-known Jaffa battle tactic -

399
00:31:35,188 --> 00:31:37,986
a flanking attack from two sides.

400
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:47,663
Yes, Daniel.

401
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:51,138
I remember exactly where I put it.

402
00:31:51,228 --> 00:31:53,822
Any other thoughts?

403
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:59,904
<i>No, just that I hope someone's been</i>
<i>feeding my lo assak while I've been away.</i>

404
00:32:02,668 --> 00:32:05,660
We've pieced together
all the Goa'uld words.

405
00:32:05,748 --> 00:32:09,741
If Teal'c's translations are correct,
he's suggesting a strategy.

406
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,023
He's proposing a coordinated attack.

407
00:32:12,108 --> 00:32:16,021
We come through the gate at the same
time as Daniel enters from the surface.

408
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:19,066
I'm thinking we take
SGs 3, 6, and 12 as backup.

409
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:22,220
We go in hot, secure the gate,
then extract Daniel.

410
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:26,859
He supplied an estimate of Soren's forces,
as well as a date and time for the assault.

411
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:29,542
Our next communication is in five hours.

412
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:33,541
All we need to do is confirm everything
and, of course, get a go from you.

413
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:37,382
All right.
Well, not to nitpick or anything here, T,

414
00:32:37,468 --> 00:32:41,017
but... are you sure you got it right?

415
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:42,860
I am certain, O'Neill.

416
00:32:45,108 --> 00:32:46,700
OK.

417
00:32:47,948 --> 00:32:49,745
Go.

418
00:32:50,228 --> 00:32:53,379
15 men? That's hardly enough.

419
00:32:53,468 --> 00:32:59,259
These are some of the best on my planet,
trained for missions like this. Trust me.

420
00:32:59,348 --> 00:33:04,706
If we're gonna do this, we have to set it up
now. They're waiting for your response.

421
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:08,019
Jared, a rebel patrol is approaching.

422
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:09,939
- Hide in the cellar.
- Leda...

423
00:33:10,028 --> 00:33:11,859
I know what to do.

424
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:32,256
In the name of Soren, open the door.

425
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,619
Inspection.

426
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:46,587
- Stand aside.
- Please, tell me what you're looking for.

427
00:33:46,668 --> 00:33:48,260
- Who owns this house?
- I do.

428
00:33:48,348 --> 00:33:50,908
- And who else lives here?
- No one.

429
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:53,742
You're hurting me.

430
00:33:53,828 --> 00:33:56,422
We know
loyalists are in the area.

431
00:33:56,508 --> 00:33:59,102
Collaboration is punishable by death.

432
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:01,383
Search the house.

433
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:10,341
There's no one else here,
but we found men's clothes and boots.

434
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:13,340
- Who else lives here?
- My husband did.

435
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,943
He died last month from wounds
suffered during the bombings.

436
00:34:17,028 --> 00:34:23,024
Please... I only wish to lead a simple life,
as it is written in the ancient texts.

437
00:34:27,988 --> 00:34:31,537
There's nothing here. Let's move.

438
00:34:45,908 --> 00:34:50,345
Once we're close, use the city's tunnels to
get to one of the bunker's access points.

439
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:54,421
We'll wait for Dr Jackson's people
to make their move, then we make ours.

440
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:56,180
Understood?

441
00:34:59,868 --> 00:35:04,339
Let's hope your friends
keep their end of the bargain.

442
00:35:33,628 --> 00:35:37,143
- If this works...
- You'll be going home.

443
00:35:38,508 --> 00:35:40,658
- Leda, I...
- No.

444
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,699
Go.

445
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:36,581
Several posts are no longer reporting in.

446
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:39,740
Loyalists have managed
to take several key sections.

447
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:41,898
- Then take them back.
- We cannot.

448
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:46,266
They've coordinated their attack
with offworlders. We are losing control.

449
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:50,102
If you're suggesting
that we evacuate, think again.

450
00:37:13,788 --> 00:37:15,983
Cease fire!

451
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:22,186
- Daniel, are you guys OK?
- Yeah, we're fine.

452
00:37:50,188 --> 00:37:53,021
All stations are dark.

453
00:37:53,108 --> 00:37:55,576
The loyalists have us surrounded.

454
00:37:55,668 --> 00:37:58,819
- They are calling for our surrender.
- Engage them.

455
00:38:33,108 --> 00:38:35,906
Any chance he'll just surrender?

456
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:40,983
Commander,
we are hopelessly outnumbered.

457
00:38:57,388 --> 00:39:00,266
We are all here for one purpose -

458
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:03,260
to honour the will of our gods.

459
00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:05,464
In their names, we rose up.

460
00:39:05,548 --> 00:39:08,938
In their names,
we purged the nonbelievers,

461
00:39:09,028 --> 00:39:11,781
and in their names we will die,

462
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:13,938
if necessary.

463
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:21,058
We will not
dishonour them with cowardice.

464
00:39:22,588 --> 00:39:24,419
Now engage them.

465
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:34,099
Engage them.

466
00:39:38,228 --> 00:39:40,822
You question your faith?

467
00:39:43,028 --> 00:39:45,747
I will show you faith.

468
00:39:56,988 --> 00:39:59,377
Drop your weapon.

469
00:40:00,748 --> 00:40:04,104
I said drop your weapon now!

470
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:14,778
There's the command centre.
Let's go!

471
00:40:14,868 --> 00:40:17,018
All right, this way.

472
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:19,747
- Drop all your weapons!
- Surrender!

473
00:40:19,828 --> 00:40:22,137
- It's over.
- I hope so.

474
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:25,668
You may have just made a martyr.

475
00:40:25,748 --> 00:40:27,978
I had no choice.

476
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:32,098
- You can return to your world now.
- Kane...

477
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:35,100
What happened to us was not your fault.

478
00:40:35,188 --> 00:40:36,906
I know.

479
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:41,337
We made a promise
and we intend to keep it.

480
00:40:41,428 --> 00:40:44,386
We'll be back to help you rebuild.

481
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:57,660
Daniel, are you ready to go home?

482
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:59,545
Yeah.

483
00:41:14,628 --> 00:41:17,586
