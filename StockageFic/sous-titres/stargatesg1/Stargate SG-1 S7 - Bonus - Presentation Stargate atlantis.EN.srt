1
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:09,558
Every one of you volunteered for this
and you represent over a dozen countries.

2
00:00:09,647 --> 00:00:12,559
You are the world's best and brightest.

3
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:20,278
And in light of the adventure we are about
to embark on, you're also the bravest.

4
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:23,525
I hope we all return one day
having discovered

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,280
a whole new realm
for humanity to explore.

6
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:33,200
But as all of you know,
we may never be able to return home.

7
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:40,037
I'd like to offer you all one last chance
to withdraw your participation.

8
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:49,599
Begin the dialling sequence.

9
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:22,486
OK, Atlantis.

10
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:26,003
It started with, obviously,
the movie Stargate.

11
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:30,160
There was a ring,
it took you to other places.

12
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:33,159
There was the show Stargate SG-1.

13
00:01:33,247 --> 00:01:36,319
There was a ring,
it took you to other places.

14
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:41,845
Now there's Atlantis and there's a ring
and it takes you to other places.

15
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:45,920
At the end of Season 7 of Stargate SG-1,

16
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:54,045
the heroes of that show find an alien
outpost in Antarctica, under the ice.

17
00:01:54,127 --> 00:02:02,239
And it reveals the location of the
long-sought-after lost city of the Ancients.

18
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:09,085
The Ancients are the race of aliens
who, we believe, built the Stargates

19
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:12,523
and deposited them all over the galaxy.

20
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:15,405
Since Season 1,

21
00:02:15,487 --> 00:02:20,766
we introduced the concept
that the original Stargate on Earth

22
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:24,635
was in Antarctica -
that was the episode "Solitudes".

23
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:32,686
So, in a way, I've been planting the seeds
for this spin-off series since then.

24
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:35,918
The original premise for Stargate Atlantis

25
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:40,603
was that the city that we find
was indeed under the ice of Antarctica.

26
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:43,520
When Sci-fi approached us with MGM

27
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:47,043
and said that they wanted to do
both series simultaneously,

28
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:51,200
Robert and I had to go and come up
with a variation on that concept,

29
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:54,359
which was that, yes,
we find an outpost in Antarctica

30
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:56,722
but that leads us
to where the real lost city is

31
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:59,116
which is, in fact, in the Pegasus galaxy.

32
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:02,119
The whole city upped and flew away
and went somewhere else.

33
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:10,046
The Ancients' city, which is actually sorta
more of a ship-city than a city, or a ship,

34
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:12,357
it's kind of a city that flies.

35
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:17,237
It takes off and goes
to another whole galaxy.

36
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:20,842
Once they're there,
they basically do what they do,

37
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:25,717
and that is, build Stargates, put them
on a whole bunch of other planets, then,

38
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:31,518
kind of like a big, galaxy-wide
science experiment, start life, human life,

39
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:36,397
on all the planets
capable of supporting human life.

40
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:39,559
And this changed
the series concept significantly.

41
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:42,764
Originally, it was going to be set
in our galaxy.

42
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,077
But the beauty of setting it
in another galaxy

43
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:49,126
is that we're essentially resetting
the whole adventure back to zero.

44
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:52,358
We're starting in Pegasus
in a place very similar

45
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:56,440
to where SG-1 started in our galaxy.

46
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,518
- What have we missed?
- Not much.

47
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:01,997
Here, as before,
we built a system of Stargates,

48
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:05,796
so that fledgling civilisations
could travel between the stars,

49
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:08,242
exchange knowledge and friendship.

50
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:12,115
But it wasn't a perfect place.
It wasn't Eden, after all.

51
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:17,122
Eventually, they found out that there was
a sleeping enemy there called the Wraith.

52
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:22,156
These were sort of super-bad guys
who were equally as powerful,

53
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:24,636
even more so than the Ancients.

54
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:31,280
As it turns out, these Wraith kind of
liked to suck the life energy out of things.

55
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:35,360
They grew to kinda like the taste
of the life energy of humans

56
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:39,679
and started to feed on the humans
that were in that galaxy.

57
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:44,283
Initially, the words
that came down the pipe were gothic,

58
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:50,158
and dark, and that the Wraith
were a breed of vampires,

59
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,203
not in the standard sense of the word

60
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:56,041
because they didn't suck blood,
they were essence stealers.

61
00:04:56,127 --> 00:05:00,040
Then we had
to physically flesh these guys out.

62
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:04,480
Quite honestly, it was very wide open
from a creative standpoint.

63
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:08,162
At that point, the Wraith had wings.

64
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:14,561
We were looking at them more
as animalistic rather than human form.

65
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,798
But after initial drawings
started going out,

66
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:23,678
it became very evident that their view
of the Wraith was that they were dark,

67
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:28,318
they were evil and yet they had
an underlying beauty to them.

68
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:31,956
We went through
a multitude of stages after that

69
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:37,758
where the look changed subtly
from drawing to drawing to drawing.

70
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:42,079
The wardrobe concepts
went back and forth.

71
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:47,400
Ultimately,
it was gloriously hideous on the day.

72
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:50,797
The Ancients were undermanned,

73
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:54,675
completely overwhelmed
by this terrible enemy.

74
00:05:54,767 --> 00:06:02,117
The survivors of that siege
that went on for maybe 100 years

75
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:06,405
decided that the only thing they could do
was to sink the city under the water

76
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,081
on this alien planet in the Pegasus galaxy.

77
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,078
That's the story Plato heard.

78
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,158
He heard the story that 10,000 years ago

79
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,762
this ancient city
that was great and powerful

80
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:19,520
sank into the ocean during a great war.

81
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:22,280
So it did happen,
it just didn't happen on Earth.

82
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:27,882
And now we go there
kind of seeking new power sources

83
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:31,516
for our own Ancient technology
that we've discovered,

84
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:36,158
that we're using in the defence of Earth
and to fight the Goa'uld,

85
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:38,761
and also to possibly meet
some of those Ancients

86
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,805
and, you know, see what's going on
in this other galaxy.

87
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:47,837
We end up getting trapped there
and have to deal with the scary Wraith.

88
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:58,800
That's just the short version.

89
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:04,280
The old saying, if I ever had a chance
to do this again, we're getting that chance.

90
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:08,042
Everything, hopefully,
that we learned in those seven years,

91
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:13,042
now going into eight years, of SG-1,
we're applying to Atlantis.

92
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:14,685
Things like the puddle jumper.

93
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:20,524
This framework in the set represents
the dimensions of a puddle jumper.

94
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,440
Now we can have a vehicle,
because we didn't build it,

95
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,677
because it was of Ancient construction,

96
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:31,125
that can fly through the Stargate and take
us wherever we need on the alien planet.

97
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:35,120
It's something that we just simply
couldn't have purpose-built

98
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:37,038
anywhere in the early years of SG-1.

99
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:42,645
Of course, by the time we were thinking
of Atlantis, I wanted to save it for that.

100
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:46,163
- Gate ship one ready to go, sir.
- Gate ship one?

101
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:51,685
- No, no, no, that's all wrong.
- What do you mean?

102
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:54,759
It's a ship. It goes through the gate.
Gate ship one.

103
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:56,997
A little puddle jumper like this?

104
00:07:57,087 --> 00:08:00,124
It's the first series
I've ever had a hand in creating.

105
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:06,964
You know, I started as a story editor
on Stargate SG-1 in the first season.

106
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:10,926
I was at the read-through of that pilot.

107
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,761
I have sort of moved my way up
to being an exec producer.

108
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:19,599
This opportunity to sort of spin off

109
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:22,645
from what has been
an incredibly successful run on SG-1

110
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:29,200
is an opportunity
that I think nobody could've passed up.

111
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:31,562
When Brad and Robert first came to me

112
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:37,199
about doing the end of Season 7,
the Lost City two-parter,

113
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:41,565
I was thrilled because I thought, this is a
great way to set up whatever comes next,

114
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,684
possibly a movie, possibly a new series.

115
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:48,237
I had no idea it was going to be
what Atlantis has turned into.

116
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:55,563
Atlantis is absolutely an amazing way
of continuing the Stargate saga.

117
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:59,925
I think when you're trying
to create a spin-off you have two choices.

118
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:04,637
One is that you can take a character
or two from the established series

119
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:06,524
and throw them into a new situation

120
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:13,080
and it all becomes about the characters
carrying on their own story.

121
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,283
Or you can take the idea, the mythology,

122
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:19,280
that you have in an established series
like Stargate SG-1

123
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:22,803
and then you spin
that mythology off in a different way.

124
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:25,003
This is what Brad and Robert do well.

125
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:29,160
This is why when you do a spin-off with
the same creators, you do the best thing,

126
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:34,799
which is you hold the integrity
of the series, of SG-1,

127
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:38,436
and you put it into a brand-new package.

128
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:42,202
The danger is that your fans
will be disappointed when they see that.

129
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:45,643
They're looking for SG-1 and
they're not gonna find it in a new series

130
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,356
unless that continuity
of the mythology is there

131
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:54,567
and you find interactions with characters
that will take them onto the next level.

132
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:59,323
So they still get the idea of Stargate SG-1,
still get the mythology of Stargate SG-1,

133
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:03,525
that they're very familiar with,
and you get it in a new package,

134
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:06,599
and the new package
is absolutely astounding.

135
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:11,442
Cut! Very nice. Print that one.
Print both of them, please.

136
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,963
We had planned, pitched and talked
about Atlantis for some time.

137
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,242
It just took a long time
to get the deal done.

138
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:20,558
When it finally did get done
in late November,

139
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:28,281
the Sci-fi Channel asked us if we could
deliver the show so it could air in July.

140
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:34,556
July '04, this year. That was a very short
window to get a series up and running,

141
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:39,323
especially while we're doing
Season 8 of SG-1.

142
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:44,003
Even though we had pitched the show,
Atlantis,

143
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:46,317
we had not started writing a script.

144
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:49,843
We didn't have a deal.
Writers don't write without deals.

145
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:52,646
So Brad and I thought it over
and talked about it at length.

146
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:54,877
But because of the really short window

147
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,720
and the fact that such a massive set
needed to be built,

148
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:01,595
and so many aspects
of the production needed to get going,

149
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:05,316
we actually started development
before the script even began.

150
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:10,356
Brad and I were looking at plans for
the set before we'd even typed "Fade in".

151
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:14,520
I remember I had actually sat down
to start typing

152
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:20,040
in early December, on the scenes
I was supposed to be working on,

153
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:24,882
and Brad called and said, "I just went into
the stage and the floor is in on the set."

154
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,527
"Type faster!"

155
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:33,036
Literally, the script was evolving
as the set was going up.

156
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:39,366
Granted, we finished faster than they did,
but they had a lot more to build.

157
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:45,363
We had roughly seven weeks of prep after
everyone had the script in their hands,

158
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:47,881
which is a very, very frightening thing

159
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:51,039
when starting up a series,
especially science fiction,

160
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:56,042
that depends so much
on props and sets and visual effects.

161
00:11:57,087 --> 00:12:00,045
The visual effects are already going.

162
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:05,724
We have four people working on
computers and doing what we call pre-vis

163
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:11,279
and actually doing the visual-effects
shots before we shoot the actual footage,

164
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,198
which seems a little bit backwards

165
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:19,078
but is the only way we're ever gonna get
everything complete and together

166
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:24,195
in order to air the show on July 16th
the way we had promised we would.

167
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:28,122
- A warm welcome.
- How did you manage to...?

168
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,641
Keep my ass
from getting blown out of the sky?

169
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:33,685
The exceptional flying
of Major John Shepherd.

170
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,440
- He likes it here.
- You like it here?

171
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:39,963
Shepherd is a pilot like Jack O'Neill is.

172
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:46,842
He has the same "we don't leave people
behind" core belief that Jack O'Neill has.

173
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:50,920
He uses humour to disarm a situation

174
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:54,363
just like Jack O'Neill does,
or Richard Dean Anderson does.

175
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:59,680
But it comes from, and I think Rick would
back me up on this, a less cynical place.

176
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:04,158
Rick is naturally a cynical person
and that's why he is so funny.

177
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:13,761
In Joe Flanigan, we found that magic
quality that I think you have to have

178
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:16,315
in the person
who is the centre of your show.

179
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:20,320
He is very personally charming,
very personally witty.

180
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:23,956
But he is also a smart actor.
All those things are on the surface.

181
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:28,359
He's also adding a layer of complexity
to his scenes,

182
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,484
finding those things that you didn't
even know were in there

183
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:34,445
because he's added them,
and that's what stars do.

184
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,677
I'm playing the part of Dr Elizabeth Weir,

185
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:42,319
and she is, like myself, new to all of this.

186
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:46,161
She sort of comes from
a much more political background.

187
00:13:46,247 --> 00:13:48,124
She fought against the military.

188
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:51,563
From what I understand,
that's also an interesting turn.

189
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:54,286
I believe that Stargate
is very military-based.

190
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:58,599
I don't think she even was aware
of interplanetary relationships

191
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:01,884
until a few months
before all this happened.

192
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:05,164
The first time you meet her in,
I think, Season 7 of Stargate,

193
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:08,364
that's her first introduction
to the idea of aliens.

194
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,165
So she has a crash course

195
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:15,196
and all of a sudden finds herself
in charge of a whole new Stargate.

196
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:21,760
I wanted, from the get-go, to have the
leader of the Atlantis team to be a woman,

197
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:25,726
because I didn't want a general
to be at the heart of this.

198
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:30,881
I wanted a civilian leader.
You cannot militarise Antarctica.

199
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:37,357
So, I thought, well, why not extend that
to the expedition to find Atlantis?

200
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:41,520
It is an international team
that is essentially not and cannot be led

201
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:45,441
by any one military commander
from any given nation,

202
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:49,156
so that's why Dr Weir
is the perfect candidate.

203
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:52,523
She is a negotiator.

204
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:54,996
We wanted somebody
who was a negotiator

205
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:59,365
at the heart of the leadership of Atlantis
because that is that role.

206
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:04,965
Then Torri came and did this part and she
was spectacular. She nailed the character.

207
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:09,882
What Torri gives is a strength to Weir
that is a natural strength.

208
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:12,925
Cos she just comes across
as a strong person.

209
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:18,604
Without being supported with overly
heavy-handed dialogue, she's just strong.

210
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:21,679
I did sci-fi when I first left
theatre school years ago.

211
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,565
I didn't get it
and I don't think I had the joy of it

212
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:27,115
cos I didn't understand how to play with it.

213
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:29,198
So it's something I'm excited about now.

214
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:32,085
I've worked as an actor
for the last ten years,

215
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:35,443
and I've learnt a lot about this medium,
television medium,

216
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:39,202
which is different from theatre,
and I've learnt how to have fun with it.

217
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:44,236
And just that's very exciting. The amount
of play that's gonna be involved in this.

218
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:48,560
Yeah, I'm gonna be playing
the character of Teyla.

219
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:53,198
She has become the leader
of her people, in a sense.

220
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:58,680
Her father was the leader
and he was killed a number of years ago.

221
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:02,726
Her mother was taken away
by the Wraith.

222
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:09,360
They've forced my civilisation
into a kind of mediocrity, in a way.

223
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:12,883
We used to be this great,
powerful, beautiful civilisation.

224
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:19,725
Now we're kind of living in tents
and our settlements are very temporary

225
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:23,402
because we have to pick up
and leave at a moment's notice.

226
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:29,084
My character, she's very intelligent.
She is very strong.

227
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:33,080
She has a wonderful physical ability.

228
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:38,366
She can run faster
than any of the other people on the team.

229
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:41,439
And she's a great fighter.
She's a very good warrior.

230
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:44,997
Here's a tough task.

231
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,318
I mean, here we're trying
to find a particular feeling.

232
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:54,004
The character Teyla is supposed
to be a leader among her people,

233
00:16:54,087 --> 00:17:01,402
so we need someone with strength
and passion and the ability to lead people,

234
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:07,881
but also a soulfulness
and a little bit of sadness

235
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:10,640
because of what her people
have been through.

236
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:16,085
I honestly think she was all round
the best actress we saw.

237
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:20,001
It was a nice bonus for us
that she's also a Canadian.

238
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:25,002
I'm thrilled. I have never really had
a chance to do sci-fi.

239
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:31,560
And yeah, I'm kind of a sci-fi girl.
I love reading fantasy. I eat that stuff up.

240
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,558
I am very excited about it.

241
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:37,401
I know my dad will be a big fan regardless
of whether or not I'm on the show.

242
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:41,958
He's a huge sci-fi guy.

243
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:45,357
He's probably the one
that instilled it in me.

244
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:47,836
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.

245
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:54,765
I'm Rainbow Sun Francks and I play Ford
on the old Stargate Atlantis.

246
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:58,601
I'm just overwhelmed. I'm actually
getting my first look at the sets now.

247
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:00,757
I've only been here a couple of hours.

248
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:04,157
It was an interesting time
at home in Toronto.

249
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:07,637
Out of nowhere,
I guess about three or four days ago,

250
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:11,322
I got a call like,
"You've got a chance to do this."

251
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:13,796
"All right, agent, just calm down."

252
00:18:14,487 --> 00:18:17,160
"Give me these four pages.
Tell me what I've gotta do."

253
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:20,956
I went and put myself on tape
and I guess I got a blessing,

254
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:23,720
something that rarely happens
in this industry

255
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:27,117
where I got cast for this role
solely on tape.

256
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:31,920
Now I'm here playing Ford
and I hope they give me two guns.

257
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,475
I'm coming for you. I'm coming for you.

258
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:38,444
High energy when I'm here.

259
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:41,121
Am I ever high energy?

260
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:47,524
I think that it may be slightly unique
that Brad and I tend to have a philosophy

261
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:49,723
that we want to put the best actor
in the role.

262
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:57,039
If we have to alter our idea of what that
character is in order to do that, we will.

263
00:18:57,127 --> 00:19:02,042
We felt that we maybe hadn't found
the exact right guy yet for Ford.

264
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:04,402
The deadline was getting real close.

265
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:07,718
I watched the tape of the first kid
who I'd asked for.

266
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:10,799
Then there was this other audition
on there afterwards.

267
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:15,085
I said, this guy's great. I showed it
to Brad and he agreed immediately,

268
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:18,716
and everybody loves him
and he gets the part.

269
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:22,680
Literally, Thursday night
he flies up, gets the part,

270
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:26,442
and is at the read-through on Friday,
and we shoot on Monday.

271
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:28,245
You might take him the wrong way.

272
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:30,921
You might look at him
and think he's a young boy.

273
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:35,239
He doesn't know what he's doing but gets
the job done. That's the important thing.

274
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:38,399
The coolest thing for me
being on this that I look forward to

275
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:40,762
is going through the gate.
It's teleporting.

276
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:45,363
I'm a big sci-fi head so for me to be on
a series like this is gonna be a lot of fun.

277
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,438
Oh, I can't... This is overwhelming.

278
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:52,125
David Hewlett played
the Dr McKay character

279
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:54,482
on Stargate SG-1 on Seasons 5 and 6.

280
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:59,641
He was the scientist, the core guy,
that we were looking for.

281
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:03,800
- We need the Zed-PM to power the gate.
- What?

282
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:07,084
Zee-PM. He's Canadian.

283
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,165
- I'm sorry.
- Zero Point Module, General.

284
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:16,844
The Ancient power source we recovered.
It's now powering the outpost defences.

285
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:20,761
I have determined that it generates
its enormous power from vacuum energy

286
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:24,078
derived from a self-contained region
of subspace-time.

287
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:28,638
That was a waste
of a perfectly good explanation.

288
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,763
The answer's no.

289
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,285
So, our core team now
is Joe Flanigan as Shepherd,

290
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,562
Torri Higginson as Dr Weir,

291
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:43,846
Rainbow Francks as Lieutenant Ford,
and surprise, surprise,

292
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:51,885
set today, on the second day of shooting,
David Hewlett as Dr McKay.

293
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:55,357
It's very exciting. We're finally cast.

294
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,961
Welcome to Atlantis.

295
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:02,279
Lieutenant Aiden Ford.
Welcome to Atlantis.

296
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:04,927
And kiss her.

297
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:06,998
Cut! Nice!

298
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,800
I love it, this Stargate show.

299
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:16,359
We're just about to look
at the previous shots for the Athos gate.

300
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,438
Cut, cut, cut!

301
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:22,884
Coffee runs this set.

302
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:28,485
It's the only way I can perform.
Liquorice. All right.

303
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:31,400
I may not look like a peanut-butter guy.
I am one.

304
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,919
Get that out of here.

305
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:44,921
Now that we're in the home
of the Ancients, what does it look like?

306
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:50,320
This is what it looks like. Here we are,
this the main room for Stargate Atlantis.

307
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:55,527
It's what we call a gatrium. This is a new
gate, new and improved gate, mind you.

308
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,996
Instead of actually rotating the gate,

309
00:21:58,087 --> 00:22:00,840
it's a series of lights
that have been programmed in.

310
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:04,806
It took them, I don't know,
20 years to make this thing.

311
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:09,642
You can actually wiggle the Stargate. It's a
problem for us that we have to figure out.

312
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:12,480
We have to spray it
with some anti-wiggling stuff.

313
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:17,595
This one here says, "Welcome to Atlantis.
Please, no smoking."

314
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:20,360
It's all in Ancient,
so it doesn't matter what it says.

315
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,359
Nobody on Earth
actually speaks Ancient any longer.

316
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:26,996
This is the control room.
Here we've got the controls.

317
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:29,043
Unfortunately, they're plastic.

318
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:33,245
You know what? We couldn't get away
from the blinky light units that we love.

319
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:36,922
