1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:04,128
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,899
BRA'TAC: All you have to do
is prick him, once.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,337
The effect will be immediate.

4
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,137
He'll believe you
to be his loyal slave, Jarren.

5
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,337
Whoa! No violence.

6
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,882
- Your name?
- Cam Mitchell. Bounty hunter.

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,947
Don't worry about SG-1 and Earth.

8
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,721
They are of little consequence.

9
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,360
Approaching the coordinates now, sir.

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,097
Drop us out of hyperspace.
Maximum shields.

11
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,507
Colonel?

12
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,482
We should have a visual.

13
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,511
If the second supergate is here,
we should be able to see it.

14
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,986
EMERSON: Anything on the sensors?

15
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,581
There seems to be
a powerful gravitational field nearby.

16
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,826
Supergates use black holes for power.

17
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,989
Oh, this is not a black hole,
it's a neutron star,

18
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:09,728
and the field is powerful enough
to weaken our shields and cause...

19
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,867
Damage report!

20
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,305
Reporting hull damage
on decks two and seven.

21
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,969
Battle stations! Get us out of here, Major.

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,740
Hyperdrive will not engage.

23
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,405
Hull integrity has been compromised!

24
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,382
- Who the hell is shooting at us?
- MARKS: I can't tell, sir.

25
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,383
Detecting three ships.

26
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,149
Ori?

27
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,985
Based on size,
I'd say Goa'uld mother ships.

28
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,821
Their shields should be weakened as well!

29
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,060
Fire all forward rail guns. Arm missiles.

30
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,888
Major, transfer auxiliary power
to sublight engines

31
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,126
and set a course hard right.

32
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:54,005
Sir, detecting multiple
small objects dead ahead.

33
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,412
Oh, my God.

34
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,086
It's a minefield.

35
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,620
Full reverse thrust!

36
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,560
Damage report!

37
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,533
EMERSON: Marks!

38
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,246
Emergency subspace communication
from the <i>Odyssey,</i> sir.

39
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,647
Put it onscreen.

40
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,413
<i>Stargate Command, this is</i>
<i>Colonel Paul Emerson of the</i> Odyssey,

41
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,751
<i>authentication code, delta-six, alpha-five.</i>

42
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,950
<i>We're under attack.</i>
<i>We've suffered extreme damage.</i>

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,794
<i>Intel about the second supergate</i>
<i>was false.</i>

44
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,456
<i>We've been ambushed</i>
<i>by as many as three Goa 'uld mother ships.</i>

45
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,692
<i>We've lost hyperdrive, shields are down.</i>

46
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,361
<i>Several decks without life support.</i>
<i>We're being boarded!</i>

47
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,041
That's it, sir. That's all we got.

48
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,266
We began receiving telemetry
from the emergency transponder

49
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,676
approximately 30 minutes
after the distress call came in.

50
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,145
Unfortunately, it doesn't tell us anything

51
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,581
about the condition
of the ship or the crew.

52
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,413
Sounds like it was badly damaged.

53
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,646
Anything on who might
have been behind this?

54
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,919
We were acting on what we thought
was reliable intel from the Jaffa.

55
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:24,090
Bra'tac is investigating
the source of the false intel,

56
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,927
but the Jaffa nation is in disarray
and many have reverted back

57
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,933
to old warring factions.

58
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,765
Tracing such betrayal
may prove virtually impossible.

59
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,305
There must be a lot of Jaffa out there
who are pretty angry

60
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,136
about the destruction of Dakara.

61
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,732
The Ori were responsible for that.

62
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,779
And there are more than a few
who think it was us who led them there.

63
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,873
Angry enough to set up an ambush?
For what, revenge?

64
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,815
Well, we have a signal.
Let's go check it out.

65
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,319
Yeah, one tiny snag there.

66
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,549
We have no vessels in which to travel.

67
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,353
The <i>Daedalus</i> is on its way to Pegasus.

68
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,485
And it will be days before a Jaffa ship
becomes available to us.

69
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,791
Well, you only have to ask.

70
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,058
You must know by now

71
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,033
that I can get you
pretty much anything you want.

72
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,967
Yeah, for a price.

73
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,471
Nothing comes for free, Daniel.

74
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,770
Of course, in this instance,
I would naturally waive my fee,

75
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,471
but I will need some front money,
so to speak.

76
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,876
Be careful.

77
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,711
We still have no idea who's behind this.

78
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,058
(CREW CHATTERING)

79
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,635
Glad to see you're awake, Colonel.
How's your head?

80
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,299
It's fine, sir.

81
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,934
- What's our status?
- They towed us out of the minefield.

82
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,481
Most of the crew is accounted for.
We're still missing three.

83
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,685
Which one of you
is Colonel Samantha Carter?

84
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,454
I'm Colonel Paul Emerson,
commander of this ship.

85
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,048
If you have any questions, you ask...

86
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,490
If any of you try to be heroes,

87
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,494
I assure you
my commander will think nothing

88
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,292
of venting this hold of all atmosphere.

89
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,558
I will not ask again.

90
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,860
I'm Carter.

91
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,575
Bring her. Him, too.

92
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,017
Colonel Carter,

93
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,320
I had heard you were quite attractive.

94
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,761
I'm Colonel Paul Emerson,
commander of this ship.

95
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,159
- What do you want?
- Nothing you can do for me.

96
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,200
Now, Colonel Carter, on the other hand...

97
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,872
- Can I call you Samantha?
- No.

98
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,978
You're Lucian Alliance.

99
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,172
(CHUCKLES)

100
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,873
The uniform.

101
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,612
Pathetic, isn't it?
Pretending to be something we're not.

102
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:07,891
Anateo is my name, and believe me,
I am part of no alliance of any kind.

103
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,129
Now, we don't know much
about this ship yet,

104
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:17,328
but we have found a subspace beacon
that is giving away our position.

105
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,629
I need you to shut it off.

106
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:26,206
- I'm not going to help you.
- I don't see what choice you have.

107
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:34,279
You are going to do
whatever it is I want you to do.

108
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,014
Don't do it, Sam.

109
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,121
Oh, I suggest you should do it, Sam.

110
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:57,501
It's not designed to be shut off.
It activates automatically and stays on.

111
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,100
Then remove it.

112
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,772
Don't help them, Colonel. That's an order.

113
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,149
ANATEO: I believe that now makes you the
ranking officer on this ship, Colonel Carter.

114
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,387
I suggest you get to work,

115
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,829
unless there's something else
you'd rather do.

116
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,435
Yeah, she's a real beauty.

117
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,909
Stabilizers are a bit wonky, I'm afraid.

118
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,810
Makes for a bumpy ride,
but it's all perfectly safe.

119
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:36,939
Really?

120
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,140
(CRASHING)

121
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,178
Not exactly.

122
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,256
We gave you as much raw naquadah
as you needed,

123
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,951
and all you came up with
was this piece of junk?

124
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,583
People's lives are at stake, Daniel.

125
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:53,597
Do you honestly think that I cheaped out
on the ship and pocketed the difference?

126
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,723
(ALARM SOUNDING)

127
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,861
- What's that?
- Life support seems to be failing.

128
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,434
Can you take over?

129
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,053
Great, you fixed that.
How about fixing the stabilizers?

130
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,215
I didn't fix anything,
I just disabled that annoying alarm.

131
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,384
Our long-range sensors
indicate that the signal coming

132
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,054
from the <i>Odyssey</i> transponder
is changing location.

133
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,289
It's moving?

134
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,798
TEAL'C: It appears to be traveling
at sublight speed.

135
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,595
Altering course to intercept.

136
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,131
- Are you cloaking?
- I am attempting to.

137
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,767
It does not appear the cloak is responding.

138
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:54,652
The signal now appears
to be originating from that planet.

139
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,856
Sensors are picking up
numerous life signs.

140
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,124
If life support were compromised,

141
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,529
they could have landed the ship
for repairs.

142
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,194
They are not responding to our hails.

143
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,498
There appears to be a small civilization
on the surface.

144
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,232
I knew I recognized this planet.

145
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,110
More friends of yours?

146
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,578
The Goa'uld used to have
a shipbuilding facility here.

147
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,582
It's now been taken over
by the former human slaves.

148
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:22,381
From what I know,
they have ties with the Lucian Alliance.

149
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,388
You know, that doesn't sound too good.

150
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,117
We talking chop shop here?

151
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,283
I have a contact here.

152
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,985
He might get skittish if we all show up,

153
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,121
so it could be a good idea for me
to go in alone.

154
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,756
You know, it could be a trap.

155
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,495
All the more reason
why we shouldn't all go.

156
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,037
Trust me, if he knows anything,
I'll be able to get it out of him,

157
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,236
but the key is to be as inconspicuous
and as non-threatening as possible.

158
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,881
If you like, I can take Daniel.

159
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:01,483
Colonel, what happened?
You've been gone for hours.

160
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,186
Where's Colonel Emerson?

161
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,568
BORZIN: Vala Mal Doran.

162
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,197
Never thought
you'd show your face in these parts again.

163
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,707
Borzin, you slimy,
two-faced grease peddler.

164
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,176
Come on, give us a hug.

165
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,475
(GROANS)

166
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,877
And what poor loser have you conned
into your company this time?

167
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,045
Oh, this is my apprentice, Seamus.

168
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,247
- You must be learning a great deal.
- More than I'd like to.

169
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,225
Actually, I only took him on
as part of a bet. He's mentally disabled.

170
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,761
<i>BORZIN: Don't trust her.</i>
<i>She will sell you out</i>

171
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,833
<i>for a bad lunch the first chance she gets.</i>

172

if you haven't already stolen it from me?

175

About a Tau'ri ship that was attacked
not far from here.

Any information you can give us...

178
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,144
Okay, my friend,

179
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,521
here's the thing.

180
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:07,058
- He's not my apprentice. He's a mark.
- No!

181
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,492
A very rich, very gullible one,
who's eating right out of my hands.

182
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,824
Give us something, anything,

183
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,092
and he'll make it
very much worth your while.

184
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,135
- You know, I've heard that before.
- All right, try this.

185
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:21,195
We traced the signal from
the ship's emergency transponder here.

186
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,670
I know you can't possibly
have the whole ship,

187
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,904
but I know you must have some parts.

188
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,649
Borzin, I don't know what's going on,
but you're in way over your head.

189

I've recently made some contacts
high up in the Lucian Alliance

190
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,915
that'd be very interested
in knowing exactly

191
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,491

skimming off this operation.

194
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,037
While we're at it, why don't we get him
to throw in some parts for our cargo ship?

195
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,935
One thing at a time.

Is this what you're looking for?

197
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,907
That's <i>Odyssey's</i> data recorder.
The transponder's still broadcasting.

198
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,677
- Where did you get this?
- A man brought it a few hours ago.

199
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,686

overseeing operations

extortion, racketeering,

261

269

Besides the fact that he's a brutal killer
with a notorious temper...

We only know of him by reputation, sir.

273

if ever, leaves his command ship.

Very few, if any, of Netan's inner circle
have ever met the guy.

No, sir. I think
he's the perfect candidate to impersonate.

the perfect candidate, sir.

Dr. Jackson used it a few years back
to infiltrate a System Lord summit.

284
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,361
One jab of that,
and Netan will believe I am who I say I am

regardless of what I look like.

because no one else has ever seen him.

- No, but without the transponder,

00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,066
and this is going to ensure
the downfall of Netan.

339
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:18,134
But why was it necessary
to also bait a trap to capture SG-1?

340
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,701
Because everyone knows
that they have caused us more grief

341
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,714
than any other adversary,
including the Ori.

342
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,942
All the seconds, including me,
have begged Netan to go after them,

343
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,749
but he refused.

344
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,346
He's a coward,

345
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,689
choosing to run and hide
rather than face the wrath of the Tau'ri.

346
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,160
Will we not?

347
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,196
We have brought their battleship
to its knees.

348
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,791
What are they going to do?

349
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:49,067
After I present <i>Odyssey</i> and SG-1
to the others,

350
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,576
Netan's stuffed corpse
will be a trophy on my wall,

351
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,341
and control of the Lucian Alliance
will be mine.

352
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,117
It's been a disappointing season,
my friend.

353

Drought and floods have ravaged
our highest-yielding Kassa plantations,

354

to usurp the planets

356
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,667
- and, of course, there's the Tau'ri.
- Yes.

357
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,764
Committing our ships to co-operate
in the fight against the Ori incursion

358
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,807
was a strategic mistake.

438
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:38,305
they were already at war with us,

For the time being.

Even with locators,
beaming a person from one room

456

00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,762
Tenat, welcome.

510
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,601
This is my good friend, Kefflin.

511
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,404
It is my pleasure.

512
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,242
I have heard a great deal
about you, Kefflin.

513
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,981
Yeah, likewise.

514
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,789
Tell me what you have learned, Tenat,
and perhaps I will spare your pathetic life.

515
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,020
(LAUGHS) Funny as always, Netan.

516
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:53,125
As you suspected,
the <i>Odyssey</i> was never destroyed.

517
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,557
Anateo betrayed you
and kept it for himself.

518
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,061
- Where is it?
- Half a day's journey, maybe less.

519
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,068
I have transmitted the coordinates
to your bridge.

520
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,069
- Get to your ship. We'll travel together.
- Of course.

521
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,475
Wait just a moment,

522
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,474
Cam Mitchell.

523
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,818
Look, I don't know who you think I am...

524
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,685
You are Cam Mitchell, bounty hunter.

525
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,956
You double-crossed me
and my partner, Jup.

526
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,966
What do you want?

527
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,565
I do not know how you've managed
to convince Netan that you are Kefflin,

528
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,167
but you are obviously
up to something big here.

529
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,040
I will take half.

530
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,582
And what about your loyalty to Netan?

531
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:49,278
He would kill me the instant
I am no longer of use to him.

532
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,212
And Jup, your old partner, where's he?

533
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:56,692
He is working elsewhere at the moment.
We need not worry about cutting him in.

534
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,159
Fine, 10%.

535
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,559
It'll be big, trust me.

536
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:03,591
30%, or I tell Netan you are not
who you say you are.

537
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,827
25%, no more.

538
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,937
I'll ring over to your ship
before this one jumps to hyperspace

539
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,270
and fill you in on the details.

540
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,577
Unchain the prisoner.
He's coming with me.

541
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,326
(GRUNTS)

542
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,199
Teal'c! Teal'c!

543
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,265
(GRUNTS)

544
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,871
I have grown weary of this torture,
Colonel Mitchell.

545
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:52,672
That's pretty obvious,
but right now, we got to go.

546
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,328
You remember Tenat?

547
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,297
Yeah, as in Jup and Tenat.

548
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,331
Well, he somehow weaseled his way
into commanding an Alliance mother ship,

549
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:17,567
and check this out, the incompetent twit
actually found the <i>Odyssey.</i>

550
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,632
Did he see you?

551
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,144
Yeah, recognized me as well,
but he's keeping his mouth shut

552
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:25,682
'cause he figures I'm scamming Netan
and he wants a piece of the action.

553
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,616
We have to get over to his ship
before this one jumps to hyperspace.

554
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,152
What is your plan?

555
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,189
I'm making it up as I go along.

556
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,494
- Tenat. Netan is here to see you.
- What?

557
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,765
Netan.

558
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,340
- I know of your intention to deceive me.
- Well, how did you...

559
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:53,604
I knew Colonel Mitchell was
impersonating Kefflin all along.

560
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,008
Colonel Mitchell?

561
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,613
Of SG-1.

562
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,378
I caught him and Teal'c
trying to leave my ship.

563
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,779
No, Netan, you are mistaken.

564
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,845
It's true, I knew he wasn't Kefflin,

565
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:10,326
but I was merely trying to lure him here,
so I could turn him over to you.

566
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,189
That is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard!

567
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,561
Please, don't kill me.

568
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,267
Get up, you pathetic excuse for a...

569
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,141
Whatever you are.

570
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,268
- What are you going to do to me?
- Nothing for the moment.

571
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,902
Oh, thank you.

572
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,640
You are a generous and gracious man.

573
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,546
I say that all the time, don't I, men?

574
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,120
Tell him how honored you are
to finally meet him in person...

575
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,086
Shut up. Stop sniveling.

576
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,922
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

577
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,291
Dr. Jackson.

578
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:54,932
If these sensors are working properly,
two Goa'uld mother ships just emerged

579
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,030
from hyperspace and are closing in.

580
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,052
- Sam?
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

581
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,322
We may need that hyperdrive
a little ahead of schedule.

582
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,862
How ahead of schedule?

583
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,432
<i>In about 10 seconds would be good.</i>
<i>We've got company.</i>

584
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,726
We need more time. Can you stall?

585
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:28,230
We're about to find out.
What's our shield status?

586
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,705
- Less than 30%.
- Weapons?

587
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,641
Rail guns are online,
but we don't have missiles yet.

588
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,374
One of the ships is hailing us.

589
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,377
(CLEARS THROAT)

590
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,951
On screen.

591
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,590
<i>Dr. Jackson.</i>

592
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:50,024
Oh, right. Hi. Hi, how are you?

593
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,356
<i>I was expecting Anateo.</i>

594
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:56,229
Yes, he was here for a while,
but then he had to go.

595
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,631
<i>Your ship is battered.</i>

596
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,760
<i>My scans tell me your</i>
<i>shield strength is low,</i>

597
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,532
<i>and if you had hyperdrive,</i>
<i>you would have left long ago.</i>

598
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,131
<i>Surrender now, or be destroyed.</i>

599
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,438
Right. Okey-dokey.

600
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,548
We surrender.

601
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,040
<i>- Prepare to be boarded.</i>
- Yeah, see, that's where

602
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,311
you're going to run into a bit of a problem.

603
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:19,412
You see, our rings are damaged,
and as you yourself pointed out,

604
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,686
our shields are down,
which means atmosphere in the 302 bays

605
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,385
is unsustainable.

606
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,225
(STUTTERS) I mean, I just don't see how
we're going to get your guys over here,

607
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,631
unless you want me to try
beaming you over?

608
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,434
They're powering weapons.

609
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,741
Sam, I think I've stalled as long as I can.

610
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,447
- We need more time.
<i>- Too late.</i>

611
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,185
You should probably prepare to return fire.

612
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,280
For the record, I'm always prepared.

613
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,750
I just have to press this button here.

614
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,562
Right. I just... I thought that's what you're
supposed to say, so I...

615
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,994
I know.

616
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,763
Open fire on the other Ha'tak vessel.

617
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,392
- What?
- You heard me.

618
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,631
- But...
- You dare question my tactics?

619
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,230
There's a ship full of traitors out there
waiting to unseat me as leader

620
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:12,309
of the Lucian Alliance.

621
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,877
Fire now!

622
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:17,672
You shall be richly rewarded
with vast territories to command.

623
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,646
Fire on the other Ha'tak vessel.

624
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,761
One of the mother ships is firing
at the other.

625
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,996
Receiving radio signal.

626
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,959
(ON RADIO) Odyssey,
<i>this is Teal'c. Do you copy?</i>

627
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,300
- Teal'c?
<i>- Daniel Jackson.</i>

628
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,304
<i>It is good to hear your voice.</i>
<i>Colonel Mitchell and I are onboard</i>

629
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,737
<i>one of the mother ships.</i>

630
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:46,639
<i>Request that you beam us aboard</i>
<i>the</i> Odyssey <i>immediately.</i>

631
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,133
Yeah.

632
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,076
Locking on their locator beacons.

633
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,705
<i>What are you doing?</i>

634
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,780
Netan? What?

635
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,144
TENAT: How?

636
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,014
I thought this was Netan.

637
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,132
Jackson, what are you doing sitting there?

638
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,898
- What are you wearing?
- It's a long story.

639
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:18,975
<i>You are the biggest fool in two galaxies!</i>

640
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,170
But Netan, I...

641
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,443
I screwed up.

642
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,979
It's the wrong one. You can't just jam it in.

643
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,191
- How did you do that?
- Honestly, I don't know.

644
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,660
That almost never normally works.

645
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,255
Daniel, try it now.

646
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,566
(EXPLOSION)

647
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,298
Shield failure is imminent.

648
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,770
Damn you, Cam Mitchell.

649
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,960
You know, you're very lucky that no one
else on the bridge of that ship

650
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,359
knew what Netan looked like.

651
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,330
Yeah, it was a gamble,
but I figured if I got made,

652
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,630
or if the chemical jab on Tenat didn't work
after half an hour,

653
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,728
I'd take the bridge by force.

654
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,365
I had a pissed-off Jaffa
waiting to help me out.

655
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,107
- Where's Teal'c?
- Oh, he's in the infirmary.

656
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,441
Yeah, big boy got banged up a bit.

657
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,645
Hey, what happened?
How did you get the Lucian Alliance

658
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:34,740
to fire on each other?

659
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,183
Oh, you'll love this.

660
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,646
Before you tell us, I got long-range
communications back online,

661
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,487
and sent a message to Earth
telling them that we'll be coming home.

662
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,790
Yeah. You should probably add
that we have officially declared war

663
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,591
on the Lucian Alliance.

664
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,667
I did.
