00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,045
MITCHELL: They canceled it? Really?

2
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:18,140
I didn't even know
the new season had started.

3
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,712
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,048
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,522
(GROANS)

6
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,924
It's a nice outfit.

7
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,699
- It's very...
- Civilian?

8
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,397
Well, yeah, that's one way of putting it.

9
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,939
So, what is this, girl's day out?

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,703
Well, yes, if I'm gonna integrate
into Earth society,

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,539
we thought it was very important
that I immerse myself

12
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,840
in the local cultural offerings.

13
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,472
And by "cultural offerings," you mean...

14
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,484
Pedicures, mochaccinos
and Victoria's Secret.

15
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,590
Well, we're scheduled to go offworld
in about an hour,

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,682
and, though you both look fantastic,

17
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,354
I suggest you might want
to lose the heels.

18
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,761
<i>HARRIMAN ON PA: Unscheduled</i>

19
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,298
Ladies first.

20
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,330
Sir, we're receiving a video transmission.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,873
Let's see it.

22
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:20,669
<i>Hello? Hello? Is this thing working?</i>

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,180
This is General Landry
of Stargate Command.

24
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,808
<i>General! It is a pleasure.</i>

25
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,910
<i>I don't get out to your end</i>
<i>of the galaxy much,</i>

26
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:32,219
<i>but I have a friend who lives in the area</i>
<i>and he speaks very highly of your people.</i>

27
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,886
<i>Maybe know him? A funny little guy</i>
<i>with a beard, lives on a planet</i>

28
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,623
<i>formerly occupied</i>
<i>by a female System Lord.</i>

29
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,564
- I don't...

30
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,102
<i>Robak? Does the name sound familiar?</i>

31
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,570
No, it doesn't. Now, what's this about?

32
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,834
<i>Sir, I have some information for you,</i>

33
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:53,208
<i>information that could impact</i>
<i>the very survival of your world.</i>

34
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,439
Jasec?

35
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,975
You know this man?

36
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,847
A little. He's my father.

(SIGHS)

38
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,853
<i>Vala! Is that you?</i>

39
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,084
Yes, it is.

40
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,559
<i>Sweetheart, how is life treating you?</i>

41
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,357
Certainly better than you ever did.

42
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,864
<i>Ouch. I suppose, for the benefit</i>
<i>of your friends there,</i>

43
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:24,630
<i>you're going to want to list all the reasons</i>
<i>why I was such a bad father.</i>

44
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:28,571
I wish I could, but a wormhole
can only be maintained for 38 minutes.

45
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,871
<i>You've got your father's wit.</i>

46
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,411
It's hardly enough time to cover
your inadequacies as both a parent

47
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,003
and a human being in general.

48
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,311
<i>And your mother's uncanny ability</i>
<i>to hold a grudge.</i>

49
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,353
You said you had some information for us?

50
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,584
<i>Yes. Let me through, and we'll discuss.</i>

51
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,825
All right. Provided Vala will vouch for you.

52
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,020
I most certainly will not.

53
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,960
<i>You'll want to hear this.</i>

54
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:56,900
<i>The information I have has to do</i>
<i>with Arkad's plot to attack your planet.</i>

55
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,997
Arkad is dead.

56
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:03,769
<i>Well, he may be dead,</i>
<i>but the threat he set in motion still exists.</i>

57
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,843
<i>Take your time. There's no pressure.</i>

58
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:11,576
<i>Just that your whole planet</i>
<i>could very well blow up at any moment.</i>

59
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,053
HARRIMAN: Chevron six encoded.

60
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,519
MITCHELL: So, what's the deal
with the accent?

61
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,716
Or, in your father's case, the lack thereof?

62
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,817
Well, the accent, like most of my other
good qualities, I got from my mother,

63
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,452
my charm, my wit, my good looks.

64
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,657
- What'd you get from your dad?
- Some minor food allergies.

65
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,290
HARRIMAN: Chevron seven locked.

66
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,219
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- JASEC: Of course you do.

67
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,083
That's because I raised you
to be cautious, wary.

68
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,388
- Mother raised me.
- Which one?

69
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,524
My mother.

70
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,123
Right. Hug for Daddy?

71
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,129
You're lucky I'm not allowed to kill you.

72
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,967
Well, so much for happy family reunions.

73
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,042
What do you know about Arkad
and the attacks he was planning?

74
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,873
Quite a lot. And I'm prepared
to tell you everything I know

75
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,573
in exchange for sanctuary on Earth.

76
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,944
There's the angle.

77
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,315
Okay, I was a terrible husband
and, admittedly,

78
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,322
probably not the best father figure,
although I've seen worse.

79
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,858
But I've put all that behind me
because I'm trying to change,

80
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,396
trying to better myself,
which is why I'm here now, risking my life,

81
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,022
to tell you that before Arkad died

82
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,625
he sent out several
naquadah-loaded cargo ships

83
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,467
in preparation for an attack on Earth.

84
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:48,108
And those cargo ships, my friends,
are still out there, waiting to be launched,

85
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,047
and I know their location.

86
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,684
Can't you see what he's doing?

87
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,691
He's spent an entire lifetime
taking advantage of people,

88
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,761
and now that they're finally
catching up with him,

89
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,660
he thinks he can use us
to hide from his enemies.

90
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,528
But that's not really the issue here.

91
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,863
No, Sam's right.
If Jasec is telling the truth

92
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,130
and there's still a bunch of
naquadah-loaded cargo ships out there,

93
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,364
then this deal is a no-brainer.

94
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,065
If he is telling the truth.

95
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:19,110
Thus far, the Jaffa have been unable
to corroborate any part of his story.

96
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,409
Well, they wouldn't, if Arkad
was careful enough to cover his tracks.

97
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,541
If the threat is real, we can't let
any of those cargo ships blow up.

98
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,516
Time is of the essence.

99
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,087
Well, there is one way to find out
if he's being straight with us.

100
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,091
All right, check it out.

101
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,685
If his intel is good,
then Jasec has himself a deal.

102
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,933
Dr. Lam?

103
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,771
As you were, Sergeant.

104
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,173
Excuse me.

105
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,946
Carolyn, I've been thinking...

106
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,042
See, now, whenever you preface
what you're about to say

107
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,987
with "I've been thinking,"
what you're actually doing is preparing me

108
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,254
for some revelation you've just had,
so should I be sitting down for this?

109
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,330
It's been a while
since I last spoke to your mother.

110
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,958
- Yeah, a little over five years.
- We were married for 12.

111
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,427
What brought this on all of a sudden?

112
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,734
Well, I've been thinking about it
ever since you came to work here,

113
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,206
about reaching out to your mother,

114
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,642
at least opening up
some kind of communication with her.

115
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:32,213
Okay. So, how do you want to do this?

116
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,786
Well, I was thinking about
giving her a call.

117
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,515
- Just like that? Just out of the blue?
- No.

118
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,219
She's in Europe for a couple of weeks,

119
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:46,162
so when she gets back, why don't I call her
and put in a good word for you?

120
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,091
Thank you.

121
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,125
You're welcome.

122
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,550
We've come all this way for nothing.

123
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,492
The cargo ships won't be there, my father
will have played you all for fools,

124
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,291
and this will have been
a giant waste of time.

125
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:21,833
Not entirely. If the ships aren't there,
we'll have called his bluff,

126
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,198
and you can tell us
that you were right all along.

127
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,032
You bet I will.

128
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,881
Entering high orbit. Scanning.

129
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,683
What've we got?

130
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,516
We're picking up only 12 life signs
on the planet's surface.

131
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,749
That's it?

132
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,519
We're also picking up a significant
concentration of naquadah.

133
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,151
These readings are through the roof.

134
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,923
Looks like the intel is good.

135
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,058
MARKS: Sir, we're picking up movement.

136
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,429
We've been detected.
They're making a break for it.

137
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,469
Those ships must not be allowed
to escape.

138
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,334
- Lock onto their position and fire.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,738
Missiles are tracking.
Impact in five seconds.

140
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:13,746
Four, three, two, one, impact.

(EXPLOSION)

142
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:22,123
Sir? I'm reading a massive
secondary explosion.

143
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,130
How much naquadah was down there?

144
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,570
VALA: General,
you're making a terrible mistake,

145
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:35,072
but with all due respect,
it's not too late to change your mind.

146
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,665
I made a deal.
I'm not going back on my word.

147
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,644
Then might I suggest a more liberal
interpretation of the agreement?

148
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,611
For instance, the word "sanctuary"
could mean anything

149
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,979
from accommodations
in an idyllic tropical setting,

150
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,847
to, say, a lifetime's incarceration

151
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,285
in one of these planets'
more unpleasant penal facilities.

152
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,719
Forget it.

153
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,239
Okay, I'll go back for
the rest of my stuff later.

154
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,801
I tell you, travel is becoming more
and more difficult every day.

155
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,940
I'm General Landry.
Jasec, welcome to Earth.

156
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,216
A fresh start on a brand new world.

157
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,654
I have a feeling
I'm going to like it here very much.

158
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,383
Vala.

159
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,591

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

161
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,965
Come in.

162
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,304
General.

163
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,847
This came for you today.

164
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,213
Since when did you assume
mail delivery duties at the base?

165
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,344
- It's from your father.
- Oh.

166
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,927
I'll just file that away for later.

167
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,024
It's been three weeks
since he came to Earth,

168
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,466
and you've ignored every attempt
he's made to get in touch with you.

169
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,766
Well, I've been terribly busy.

170
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,539
I think family should always come first.

171
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,340
I learned that the hard way.

172
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,510
How?

173
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,815
Were you absent for the first three years
of your daughter's life

174
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,822
because you were too busy running scams
out of the Nylus sector?

175
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:36,623
No, but I did allow my career
to take precedent over the things

176
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:42,065
that should have been more important
to me, birthdays, anniversaries,

177
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,767
my daughter's graduation.

178
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,998
No offense, General,
but there really is no comparison.

179
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,805
You had a legitimate occupation.

180
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:57,110
My father's career choice
was decidedly less noble.

181
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,383
He'd be gone for months at a time,

182
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,183
only to return to lay low or to hide
from the people he had swindled.

183
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,383
What were things like
when he was at home?

184
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, I actually looked forward
to the times

185
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,127
that he would grace us with his presence.

186
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,603
I was young and he was my father.

187
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,735
Sometimes he'd return late
in the middle of the night,

188
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,406
and I would wake to find him asleep
at the foot of my bed.

189
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,315
I was so excited
I couldn't wait until morning,

190
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:38,721
and I would prod him awake and make him
tell me all about his great adventures.

191
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,991
He'd always have something for me, too,
a fancy ring, a pretty necklace,

192
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,462
things that he'd bring back
from his many travels.

193
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,624
I treasured those keepsakes,

194
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,505
memories of my father
that I kept stored away under my bed,

195
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,337
until I was old enough
to see them for what they really were,

196
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,810
worthless trinkets
meant to curry my favor.

197
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,774
He might feel differently about that.

198
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,883
You don't know him.

199
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,881
No. I don't.

200
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,593
But I do know that he spent every day
of the last three weeks

201
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,132
trying to get in touch with you,

202
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:25,670
which tells me that you must be
very important to him,

203
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,571
possibly much more than you know.

204
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,941
You have some good memories
of the times you spent together

205
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,145
when you were a little girl.

206
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,322
Those times count, too.

207
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:02,233
Colonel Mitchell. Dr. Jackson.
Thanks for <i>coming. Entrez.</i>

208
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,442
- We interrupting something?
- No, we're just enjoying a quiet little...

209
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,013
- B 10!
- Bingo!

210
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,376
WOMAN: B 10.

211
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:14,543
All right, ladies. We've got to call it a day.
Come on.

212
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,787
Pay the winner. Read them and weep.

213
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,620
All fair and square.

214
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,853
Every Tuesday and Thursday,

215
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,658
I host a little bingo afternoon
for some of the seniors in the building.

216
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:30,531
Gets them out of their apartments.
Thank you. No running in the hall.

217
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,501
You know, it gives them
a chance to socialize.

218
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,836
It's good for them.
No loud parties after midnight.

219
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,709
Bless their decrepit little hearts. That's it.

220
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,780
Be careful.
A lot of cross-traffic in the halls today.

221
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,679
Whoa, whoa, Hazel. You're a little light.

222
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:49,083
Money confuses her when it's going out.

223
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,825
See you next time. Same time, Thursday.

224
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,225
And to make up for today,
I'm waiving the cover charge.

225
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,025
Yeah, settling in quite nicely, thanks.

226
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:04,262
Yeah, we heard you haven't exactly
been a model citizen.

227
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,500
- I'm not sure what you're referring to.
- The charity phone scam.

228
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,770
- Little Pepito needs a new set of kidneys...
- Right.

229
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:15,711
Well, see, the Air Force provides me
with a mere pittance.

230
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,750
It's hardly enough to live on.
I'm just looking to supplement my income.

231
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:25,248
Okay, there've been a few lapses
in judgment, but darn it, I'm working on it,

232
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,292
and I just wish Vala could see that.

233
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,760
That's where you guys come in.

234
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,058
Yeah, we figured that's why
you asked us over.

235
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,861
Well, you're her friends. She trusts you.

236
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,630
You want us to talk to her for you?

237
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,103
Well, I was going to suggest tricking her
into coming here,

238
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,004
but if you really think talking will work...

239
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,876
Please, guys.
I really need to see my little girl.

240
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:57,518
If it's a matter of expenses, we can talk
about that later, if you get my drift.

241
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,356
We're not putting anything on paper,
of course, but give it some thought.

242
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,688
I appreciate it.

243
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:10,966
Good news. I got a call from Mom, and
she'll be in Colorado Springs on Friday.

244
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,659
She will?

245
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:16,798
Yes, she's passing through,
and she's agreed to have dinner with you.

246
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:17,898
She has?

247
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,478
Well, so long as I come along, yeah.

248
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,874
- Okay, I thought you'd be thrilled.
- No, I am. No, that's...

249
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,311
No, it's great news.

250
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:35,053
Okay. So I'll make a dinner reservation
for Friday night, somewhere nice?

251
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,319
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

252
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,524
And you know that brown sports jacket

253
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,158
that you have with the patches
on the sleeves?

254
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,861
Don't wear that.

255
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,407
- Where have you been?
- Your father's place.

256
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:02,078
So, he wanted you to talk to me
on his behalf, didn't he?

257
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,553
- Yeah. Look, he really wants to...
- You needn't bother.

258
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,647
Look, you two obviously
have some unresolved issues.

259
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,455
I've already decided to pay him a visit.

260
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,253
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

261
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,525
Coming.

262
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,428
Oh, no.

263
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,631
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

264
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,472
I'm coming.

265
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,048
Well, this is a surprise.

266
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,486
I have not come seeking reconciliation
or some deeper understanding

267
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,818
of your contemptible behavior
in my formative years.

268
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,154
I have come for one thing
and one thing only.

269
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,888
Well, if it's chicken casserole,
you're in luck because I just...

270
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,464
Catharsis. To that end.

271
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,199
(SIGHS)

272
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,498
How dare you implicate yourself in my life
after all these years?

273
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,866
You were never there for Mother,

274
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,406
even though you always expected us
to be there for you

275
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,533
whenever you needed a place to hide,

276
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,511
or capital to help set up
one of your latest scams.

277
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,275
My life has been a constant struggle

278
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,749
against the personal issues
that you seeded.

279
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,379
And now that I am at Stargate Command,
and I am finally happy with who I am,

280
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,514
you think you can come along
and jeopardize everything

281
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,092
I've worked so hard to achieve.

282
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,354
I've worked so hard to achieve.

283
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,362
Under no circumstances
will I allow you to screw that up for me.

284
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,833
Wow. Did you rehearse that?

285
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,370
A little.

286
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:34,344
- Right. I'm done.
- That's it? You're gonna leave?

287
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,141
But I made pie.

288
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,842
Well, I've said everything I needed to say.

289
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,613
But if it was just a matter of getting
all that off your chest,

290
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,211
you could have just as easily
sent me a letter,

291
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,121
but you went to the effort to come see me.

292
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,927
Coming here was only to please
my friends at Stargate Command

293
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,193
and stop them from giving me
any more unsolicited advice.

294
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,235
Yes, it must be wonderful to have friends
who care about you,

295
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,864
who support you in times of need,
who believe in you.

296
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,737
I earned their trust.

297
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:08,304
At least you had the opportunity.
You won't even give me that.

298
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,171
You don't deserve it.

299
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,615
I don't suppose there's anything
I could say or do

300
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,453
that would convince you that I'm not lying,
that I'm honestly trying to change.

301
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,591
No, there isn't.

302
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:31,461
Well, then, before you go, this is for you.

303
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,002
I got it from a trader on Meronat.

304
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,075
You know, that little world
with the twin suns

305
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,007
I used to take you to.

306
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,647
- I remember Meronat.
- Do you still have your little treasure box?

307
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,649
Where you would store all the gifts
I used to bring you

308
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,117
when you were just a little girl?

309
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:52,353
No. I threw that away a long time ago.

310
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:57,556
I understand. Well, thanks for coming.

311
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:03,758
And even though it's too late,
I want you to know I'm sorry.

312
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,646
- Having second thoughts?
- No.

313
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:21,482
- I think the door is locked.
- It sticks a little.

314
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,157
- There you go.
- Goodbye, Jasec.

315
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:32,386
For once in the last 20 years,
could you call me Dad?

316
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,099
You haven't earned that right yet.

317
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,029
Yet.

318
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,365
I'll be in touch.

319
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,750
Vala. I think you're gonna wanna see this.

320
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,189
I found this on the Internet.

321
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,333
<i>It's time to tap into the source</i>

322
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,901
<i>by unlocking the power of stardust.</i>

323
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,368
<i>Yes, genuine stardust!</i>

324
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:19,467
<i>The very same stardust</i>
<i>celebrities and professional athletes use</i>

325
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,638
<i>to tap into the power of the alpha force,</i>

326
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,648
<i>the core energy of the universe.</i>

327
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,183
<i>Tap into the source.</i>

328
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:31,416
<i>Each specially treated vial contains</i>
<i>four full grams of authentic stardust</i>

329
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,889
<i>for only $19.95!</i>

330
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:39,953
<i>That's only $19.95</i>
<i>for a vial of genuine stardust.</i>

331
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,731
<i>Tap into the source.</i>

332
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,842
It wasn't real stardust.

333
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,173
That's the point. You're running a scam.

334
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,180
Well, now,
that's a matter of interpretation.

335
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,877
The way I see it, I'm selling people hope.

336
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,922
No. You're selling glitter shavings
in a tube for 20 bucks a pop.

337
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,082
Plus shipping and handling.

338
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:14,694
Look, you are a guest on this planet,
and as long as you are a guest,

339
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,129
you're gonna follow some rules.

340
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:21,399
Come on, a guy's got to make a living.

341
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:26,410
The next thing you know, you're going
to tell me I can't publish my diet book.

342
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,844
It's an "Eat For Your Eye Color" diet.
I just lined up a publisher.

343
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,973
We're killing the book deal,
and if you keep this up,

344
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:35,110
the next deal we kill
is going to be the one with you.

345
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,051
Fine, no more scams.

346
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,953
Teal'c is waiting to escort you out.

347
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,790
Yes, I...

348
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,925
I appreciate this second chance.

349
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,661
Third chance.

350
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,165
Are you sure? I could've sworn it was...

351
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,132
Right. Pepito.

352
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:59,368
Come this way. Do you play poker?
Are you familiar with the game 21?

353
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,447
- May I offer you a word of advice?
- Hello. Hi.

354
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,579
Any input that would help me better
myself would be greatly appreciated.

355
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,887
Perhaps three words. Be less annoying.

356
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,093
And if you have no intention
of reforming your ways,

357
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,131
which I suspect that you do not,

358
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,861
perhaps it is best that you have nothing
more to do with your daughter.

359
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,870
Let me tell you something, big boy,
my daughter and I have an understanding,

360
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,997
an unspoken bond that...

361
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,203
She'll get over it.

362
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,674
Vala! Are you free on Friday night?

363
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,307
Say yes, I got two tickets to this
"Virginia Dialogues" show.

364
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,818
I don't know much about it,
but the tickets are very hard to get.

365
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,252
To think I was just starting
to believe in you.

366
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,757
I'm trying to change.
It's an ongoing process.

367
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,986
(EX CLAIMS)

368
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:53,865
(SIGHS)

369
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,268
So, what are you doing Friday night?

370
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,936
- That's the last of them.
- Thank you. Vala?

371
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,875
Have a seat, please?

372
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,851
- How're you doing?
- Fine.

373
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:22,486
- Why wouldn't I be?
- Well, you're obviously disappointed.

374
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:27,354
Right, yeah. No, not in Jasec.
His actions didn't really surprise me.

375
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,991
More in myself
for even considering the possibility

376
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,092
that he might be telling the truth.

377
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,001
- Maybe he was.
- No, he lied.

378
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,403
He said he was trying to change.

379
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,238
Well, change isn't easy.
I think you of all people should know that.

380
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,245
Right, so you want to draw parallels
between him and I,

381
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:47,478
our equally disreputable pasts,
our similar desires to reform.

382
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,716
Yeah, there's that.

383
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,982
Daniel, I'm a different person
than I was two years ago

384
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,684
because I genuinely wanted to change.

385
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,554
I didn't see it as a means of escape.

386
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,830
No? So, you're telling me
your decision had nothing to do

387
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:03,628
with the desire to stop running
and live a semi-normal life?

388
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,838
- You don't know Jasec the way I do.
- No, you're right.

389
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,841
In fact, you probably know him
better than you think.

390
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,571
After all, you, better than anybody,
must know what it's like

391
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,740
to have to resist the temptation
of falling back on your old ways.

392
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,087
I'm sure it hasn't been easy for you, either.

393
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,388
Jasec, it's Vala.

394
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,694
Should we come back?

395
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,295
No.

396
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,502
Excuse me.

397
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,907
Too easy.

398
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,043
Jasec?

399
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,445
Dad?

400
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,156
Hello? He's not in here.

401
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,726
I knew it.

402
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,594
He's removed his ankle monitor.

403
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,135
I told you he's been playing you
for fools all along.

404
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,898
Actually, you were starting
to believe him, too.

405
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,235
If he's decided to leave,
it's unlikely we'll find him again.

406
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,740
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

407
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:18,831
During his initial physical,

408
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,469
Dr. Lam implanted him
with a subcutaneous transmitter.

409
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,047
Just in case.

410
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,479
You didn't trust him, but you talked me
into coming here anyway?

411
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,149
Hey, he's not my father. Sam, it's Daniel.

412
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,466
- What's going on?
- Jasec's on the run.

413
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,968
His locator signal places him
approximately six miles

414
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,504
west of Colorado Springs.

415
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,940
- Have we dispatched a team to the area?
- Yeah, Daniel and Vala just got there.

416
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,032
Daniel?

417
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,910
We've parked
and we're proceeding on foot.

418
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,348
You're headed right for him.

419
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:15,092
One, let's start over again.
There's seven total.

420
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,728
Three for you, three for me, one for me,
it's for the house, as we call it.

421
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,669
I didn't know your father had any friends
here on Earth.

422
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,035
Neither did I.

423
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,941
You can't go back on this deal.
We had an arrangement.

424
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,206
Look, do you have a superior
I could talk to?

425
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,440
Jasec?

426
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:46,823
Jaffa.

427
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:53,931
CARTER: Jasec was carrying that with him.

428
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,839
It's a short-range communicator
he probably used to contact the Jaffa.

429
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,137
No doubt he snuck it in
with his personal effects.

430
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:04,341
Turns out we didn't destroy all of the ships
intended for the attack.

431
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:08,442
One of them was dispatched early, and
it's been sitting somewhere here on Earth

432
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,521
waiting for the order to strike.

433
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,453
And he knew this all along?

434
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,286
He got his intel from some
heavily-involved Jaffa

435
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,950
who were having second thoughts
about the whole thing.

436
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,087
Apparently, he knew them
from some weapon-smuggling operation

437
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,721
he used to run.

438
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,857
He found out about the cargo ships
and made a deal with us

439
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,127
so he could come to Earth.

440
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,669
Where he made a deal with the Jaffa,
they'd give him the naquadah,

441
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,864
he would sell it,
and they would split the proceeds.

442
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,804
Nice and tidy.

443
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,334
Where's this cargo ship located?

444
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:37,074
He doesn't know. The Jaffa he was with
was his contact, and he's gone, so...

445
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,582
Can't we just locate this cargo ship
the same way we did the others?

446
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:40,776
No, that won't work this time.

447
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,375
This particular cargo ship is cloaked,

448
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,115
so doing an orbital scan
won't reveal any trace of the naquadah.

449
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,657
But Jasec claims
that Arkad marked the naquadah

450
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,421
to make sure that none of his men
would try to double-cross him.

451
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,587
He says he can calibrate
our detection systems

452
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,097
to pick up its unique energy signature.

453
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,432
Just out of interest,
what did he ask for in return?

454
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,568
We recover the naquadah,
we give it to him, he sells it,

455
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,972
and we split the profits 50-50.

456
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,812
And what was your counter-offer?

457
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,973
He gets zero, and we don't lock him away
for the rest of his life.

458
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,977
He took the offer.

459
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,054
See, you've cast too wide a variance.

460
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,556
- Lf you just narrow the parameters.
- Narrow the parameters?

461
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,263
That's genius.

462
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,329
I don't know about genius.
It's just marginally brilliant.

463
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,409
Now, if I can just figure out
how to sync it up.

464
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,774
I'm sure it'll come to you.

465
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,406
- So how are the readings coming along?
- Slowly.

466
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:49,782
It's no wonder. I don't mind telling you,
I'm a bit disappointed in this facility.

467
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,219
I was expecting more.

468
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,381
Well, at times, so do we.

469
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,857
But the truth is, the Stargate program
just doesn't get the support

470
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,326
it used to from the people in charge.

471
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,556
- Why not?
- Eureka!

472
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,961
One down, 12 to go.

473
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:08,031
That's too bad,
because after all your Stargate program

474
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,937
has accomplished
for this network of planets,

475
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:14,345
I would think the decision-makers
would show it the respect it deserves.

476
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,403
I would think the decision-makers
would show it the respect it deserves.

477
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:16,905
Yeah.

478
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:24,912
Say, how would you like to go out
to dinner with me once this is all over?

479
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,217
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

480
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:32,888
Well, I'm an incredibly busy person
with very little free time.

481
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,659
And you're a jerk.

482
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,327
Of course there's that.

483
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:42,331
Look, I'm sorry I had to trick you,
but if you'd known what I had planned,

484
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,601
you would have never
let me on this planet.

485
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,700
I'm talking about the way
you treated Vala.

486
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,041
To think that for the first time
since she was a child

487
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,877
she was actually beginning to trust you.

00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:58,711
Hello?

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,715
Hi. Just calling to remind you
about dinner tonight.

No, no. No. It's just that something
very important has come up.

<i>rescheduling.</i>

We can't reschedule.

I'm dealing with a major situation here.

498
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,341
Okay. What do you want me to tell her?

499
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,048
Tell her I'll be there.

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,456
Sir, we've finished calibrating the device,
and we've got a lock on their location.

501
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:43,295
They're approximately 30 miles
outside of Cheyenne Mountain.

502
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,802
It seems that one of the targets
was their stargate.

503
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,980
Tell them I'll send in some tactical units.

504
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,542
I wouldn't.

505
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,119
If the Jaffa suspect
they're about to be compromised,

506
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,121
I have no doubt
they'll detonate the naquadah.

507
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:10,217
I would suggest using a little stealth
and cunning to take them off-guard,

508
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:13,126
- and I'd be happy to help out.
- No, thanks.

509
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,291
Well, like it or not,
you're going to need my help.

510
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,199
Some of these Jaffa know me.
They trust me.

511
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,706
And there's also the matter
of the rigged cargo ship.

512
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,577
This is the first I've heard of it, sir.

513
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,477
Are you sure? I thought I'd mentioned it.

514
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:34,142
According to Te'rak,
the cargo ship is rigged to blow

515
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,812
in the event anyone tries to move it.

516
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:41,221
Now, fortunately for you,
I have the override code.

517
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,786
Please, General, let me help.

518
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:49,230
Give me this one final shot at redemption.

519
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,295
This is nice.

520
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:58,864
It reminds me of that afternoon
we spent on Serras-Dia.

521
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,502
Running for our lives from the authorities?

522
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,410
You've got to admit
it was great daddy-daughter time.

523
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,483
As I recall,
we would not have been on the run

524
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,609
had you not been greedy
and gone back for seconds.

525
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,847
I couldn't help myself.

526
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,753
You know, you couldn't even pull off
this simple naquadah deal

527
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,725
without complicating things
with your silly little side scams.

528
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,763
- You always were so sloppy.
<i>- CARTER ON RADIO: Vala?</i>

529
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,522
Yes, Sam?

530
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,234
The naquadah signal is emanating

531
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,804
approximately a half-mile north
of your position.

532
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,341

535
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,150
Good.
Keep me apprised of any developments.

536
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,554
Sir, do you have to be somewhere?

537
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,060
Whatever happened to that boy
you used to like?

538
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,893
The one whose father was a merchant?

539
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,092
I always thought you two
would end up together.

540
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:01,069
Veron Karn?
We were 10 and he moved away.

541
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,608
That's too bad.
I saw a lot of potential in him.

542
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,199
Can you stop trying
to endear yourself to me?

543
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,005
As far as I'm concerned,
you're a lost cause,

544
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,136
and I wouldn't be surprised

545
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,306
if you were somehow involved
in Arkad's plot against Earth.

546
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,441
That would be low, even for me.

547
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,111
I have no idea what you're capable of.

548
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,517
(ENERGY SURGING)

549
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,254
Hey, fellows. It's me, Jasec.

550
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:30,597
Me and my partner, actually, my daughter.
Isn't she pretty?

551
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,465
We're here to check out the merchandise.
Is that okay?

552
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,334
There's been a change of plans, Jasec,

553
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,206
and unfortunately, you're no longer part
of this new arrangement.

554
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,650
<i>VALA ON RADIO: Jasec, you idiot.</i>

555
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,951
- That's the signal.
- Let's go.

556
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,826
There's no need for you
to carry on with your attack,

557
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,837
because Arkad is dead and
there's no need to sacrifice yourselves.

558
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,908
Or the naquadah. Let's talk deal.

559
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:14,910
I believe that was Te'rak's intention
before he disappeared.

560
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:19,044
Really? I hope he's all right.
He probably just got lost.

561
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,916
These woods are very confusing.
You can get turned around so easily.

562
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,180
Enough!

563
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,247
Wait. I can't watch my daughter die.

564
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,822
I can't watch me die, either.

565
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,041
Thanks, honey.

566
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,401
Vala! Get to the ship!

567
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,618
(GROANING)

568
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,895
I've located the cargo ship.

569
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,629
Hold it.

570
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,299
The naquadah on that ship
is rigged to blow

571
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:22,106
unless I input the override code
Te'rak gave me.

572
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:26,673
- All right. I'm coming with you.
- No, I'm not going to risk your life, too.

573
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,415
Listen to your father for once.

574
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:36,052
Here. In case I don't make it.

575
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,661
(GROANS) Drat!

576
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:28,838
Jasec?

577
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,915
Sorry, sweetheart.
There never was an override code.

578
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:38,549
Take care of yourself. Daddy loves you.

579
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,192
Hey.

581
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:02,846
- You okay?
- Yes. Did everything go as planned?

582
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,881
It did on our end. Sam?

583
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,012
The real cargo ship is secure.

584
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,381
I guess we won't be needing
that override code?

585
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,956
- No, you won't.
<i>- Sorry, Vala.</i>

586
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,823

Good job, SG-1, and... Landry out!

589
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:52,093

- I got away as soon as I could.

591
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,524
And that's what counts.

592
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:01,564
Please.

- Dad.

We have a lot to talk about.

596
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,324
We do, Kim.

597
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,596
Well, you've had long enough
to look over the merchandise.

598
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:39,609
What are you offering for this cargo ship
full of weapons-grade naquadah?

599
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:46,010
You mean a cargo ship full of lead bars
and these things?

600
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,451
This is a surprise.

601
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,250
They've included
the Jibbaran virility enhancers.

602
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:57,760
Well, that's a bonus.
Go ahead, try a sample.

603
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,865
I understand they're very powerful.

604
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,307
Can you feel it working?

605
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,109
Yes, I can.

606
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,245
Let's talk deal.

607
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,617
I may keep a couple of these for myself.

608
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,315
Better to have them and not need them,

609
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,519
than to need them
and not have them, right?

610
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,500
We talk the same language, right?

611
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,302
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

612
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,874
Just a minute.

613
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,813
Come in.

614
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:34,385
- Hi.
- Hi. What's this?

615
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,188
- Girl's night in.
- Nice.

616
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,259
- So, how're you doing?
- Great.

617
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,733
Yeah, wonderful.
Everything went according to plan.

618
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,399
We led Jasec to the decoy ship
while you secured the real one.

619
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,205
He scammed us,
but we scammed him better.

620
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,441
Cheers.

621
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,145
So where are the boys tonight?

622
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:07,048
Cameron has a date, Daniel's exhausted,
and Teal'c got tickets to some show.

<i>Why don't we talk about vaginas?"</i>

<i>than our own vaginas?</i>

629
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:35,784
<i>And I didn't have an answer,</i>
<i>so I took it upon myself to find out.</i>

630
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,117
<i>I started to talk about vaginas at work,</i>
<i>at home,</i>

<i>sometimes even at fancy restaurants.</i>

632
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,926
<i>Soon, my friends started to talk</i>
<i>about vaginas as well,</i>

633
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:47,862
<i>and it was only a matter of time</i>
<i>before it became a hot conversation topic.</i>

634
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,366
