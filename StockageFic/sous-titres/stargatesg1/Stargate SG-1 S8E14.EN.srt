1
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:07,879
Previously on "Stargate SG-1".:

2
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:10,354
So, you guys are ex-NID.

3
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:14,156
Calling yourselves "the Trust" now.

4
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:16,201
You tried to shut down the SGC.

5
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:19,402
You make this big speech
about hating secret organisations,

6
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:21,316
then jump in bed with the NID?

7
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:24,761
- Consider your resignation accepted.
- You can't do that.

8
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:27,439
Oh, please.
I got enough on you to have you shot.

9
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:30,437
We got all the exits covered.
There's no way they could have got out.

10
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:32,595
How is that possible?

11
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:40,884
- This is the ship Osiris left behind.
- You gave us this opportunity.

12
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:43,604
- They're trying to run, sir.
- Damn it.

13
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:39,917
Bad news. You're out of Scotch.

14
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:45,233
Well, if I'd known you were coming,

15
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:48,123
I'd have hidden the good stuff.

16
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:54,564
If you'd known I was coming,
I doubt I'd made it through the door.

17
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:02,916
- Who are you calling?
- Local sheriff's a friend of mine.

18
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:07,681
I may be disgraced,
but I'm not wanted for any crimes.

19
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:11,283
Breaking and entering?

20
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,674
- Jack.
- Shh.

21
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:15,756
It's ringing.

22
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:22,482
Now you can listen to what I have to say.

23
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:31,716
For God's sake.

24
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:37,322
You need to start trusting me, Jack.

25
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:42,240
- No, I really don't.
- Yes, you really do.

26
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:46,999
The fate of the planet depends on it.

27
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:54,041
Hello?

28
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,161
Andy, it's Jack.

29
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:57,724
Hey. What's up?

30
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:01,917
Jack?

31
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:03,199
Hello?

32
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,322
I was checking on Friday,
making sure we're on for poker.

33
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,794
- Yeah, you bet.
- I'll bring the beer.

34
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:10,876
See you then.

35
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:15,640
Wise decision.

36
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,920
You've got three minutes...

37
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:27,478
before I shoot you
as an intruder in my home.

38
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:32,757
Same old Jack O'Neill.
Although I hear you're a general now.

39
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:35,564
Congratulations.

40
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,764
All right, then. Straight to the point.

41
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:43,440
You wanna take down the Trust.
I can help you.

42
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:47,677
I'm sorry. I must have missed an episode.
I thought you were working together.

43
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:53,362
After I was forced to resign,
my relationship with them changed.

44
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:57,720
Meaning you were no longer useful,
so they kicked you out on your ass.

45
00:04:57,805 --> 00:05:01,878
That's a rather crude way
of putting it, but...

46
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:03,193
yes.

47
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:07,715
- Why didn't they shoot you?
- Believe me, that was a consideration,

48
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:10,922
which is why, when they
requested a meeting a few days ago,

49
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:14,042
I suggested a nice public venue.

50
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:22,284
They made me a very interesting offer.

51
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:28,324
In exchange for a large cash payment,

52
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:33,195
the Trust wants me to arrange a meeting
with General Miroslav Kiselev,

53
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:35,435
the Russian defence minister.

54
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:38,597
I thought they had connections
with the Russian military.

55
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:40,676
This isn't just a connection.

56
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:45,600
Kiselev exercises operational authority
over all of Russia's armed forces,

57
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:48,961
including their nuclear arsenal.

58
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:52,924
And he just happens
to be a good friend of yours.

59
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:59,082
After the fall of Communism,
he was one of a number of officers

60
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:04,956
assigned to pursue secret talks with
the West, aimed at military cooperation.

61
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:08,879
He was a hardliner, even then.
His country was falling apart,

62
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:13,322
but he came at us as though
we were the ones at a disadvantage.

63
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:17,675
He and I developed a mutual respect.

64
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,682
- Why does the Trust want him?
- They wouldn't give specifics,

65
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:26,075
but they know we entered into a deal
for control of the gate.

66
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:31,114
They know there's a sentiment in Moscow
that we've not kept our end of the bargain.

67
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:34,356
You think they're trying
to turn the Russians against us?

68
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:36,515
It's ambitious, I know, even for the Trust,

69
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:40,757
but from what I hear,
after you put a crimp in their little plan

70
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:45,760
to use symbiote poison to wipe out the
Goa'uld, there's been a change of attitude.

71
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:49,997
They're no longer willing to stay
in the shadows and bide their time.

72
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:53,157
They want to make
a direct grab for power.

73
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,554
That's why I came to you.

74
00:06:57,645 --> 00:07:01,433
Yes, you've always
struck me as the hero type.

75
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,554
You may question my methods,

76
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:12,479
but everything I did
was for God and country.

77
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:17,161
For the Trust to ally themselves
with a foreign power against the USA,

78
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:21,602
- that's just something I can't condone.
- Kinsey, please.

79
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:24,438
Spare me the diatribe.

80
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:29,235
They kicked you when you were down
and you want revenge. Simple as that.

81
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:32,237
The truth is, my motives are irrelevant.

82
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:37,604
The Trust has become an imminent threat
to the sovereignty of this nation.

83
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:39,562
Now...

84
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:42,796
what are you going to do about it?

85
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:48,835
What ifthe Trust
convinced the Russians to back out?

86
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:51,803
It would be a problem.
The gate's only here on loan.

87
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:54,399
If they want it back,
things could get sticky.

88
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:59,400
- Is it possible Kinsey is simply lying?
- That is always possible.

89
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:03,443
Has he asked for anything
in return for the information?

90
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,844
Protection.

91
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:08,076
Makes sense. If he doesn't cooperate,
the Trust will kill him.

92
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:12,761
Maybe he should. This could be our
chance to get somebody on the inside.

93
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:15,439
Infiltrate the organisation.

94
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:22,399
You want me to wear a wire?

95
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:25,283
That's the deal.

96
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:27,640
I am not a spy.

97
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:29,716
Think of it this way.

98
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:34,117
If you don't do what they want,
they'll kill you.

99
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:36,673
If you don't do what we want,

100
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:39,959
we'll let 'em.

101
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:45,642
That's as good as you pulling the trigger.
I thought Stargate Command didn't do that.

102
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,523
We're under new management.

103
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,920
All right, let's test it.

104
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:54,838
- How's it looking?
- We've got picture.

105
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:57,519
- Let's have your belt.
- Why?

106
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:00,073
Because you'll be
wearing this one instead.

107
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,794
The buckle contains a GPS receiver unit
that'll allow us to track you.

108
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:06,763
When we're done, I want that back.

109
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:11,202
They've arranged to meet you at a remote
location. My guess is you'll leave your car

110
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,357
and they'll drive you
to a second location for the meeting.

111
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:17,801
We're gonna have to keep back
so as not to arouse suspicion.

112
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:20,035
We will be monitoring your conversations

113
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:24,038
by means of this listening device
that we've fitted into your shirt collar.

114
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:28,516
We've got a strike team. They'll be ready
to move in at the first sign of trouble.

115
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:33,042
In the event that something goes wrong,
I suggest we come up with a signal.

116
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,640
Preferably a codeword
that'll let us know you're in trouble.

117
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:40,400
How about something simple like "help"?

118
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:44,273
How about something
a little less obvious like "red"?

119
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:49,315
- Whatever.
- Don't be too direct fishing for info.

120
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:52,715
- Let them do the talking.
- Get out of my way.

121
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,194
I know what to do.

122
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,036
You're late.

123
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:18,722
- You're kidding, right?
- Afraid not.

124
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:38,115
- He's on the move.
- Understood.

125
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:48,003
So how long
is this sightseeing trip gonna last?

126
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:50,235
We'll let you know.

127
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:07,039
They've turned off the main road.

128
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,716
They've stopped.

129
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:49,756
This way.

130
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:07,274
Bob. Good to see you again.

131
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:09,640
Sorry about the blindfold.

132
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:16,644
What can we get you to drink?

133
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:19,398
- What are you having?
- Vodka tonic.

134
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,755
In that case, I'll have a Scotch. No ice.

135
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:26,838
We're glad you finally agreed
to a private meeting.

136
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:32,440
We were afraid you might be
holding a grudge against us.

137
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:37,804
You mean because you abandoned me
at the moment I needed you the most?

138
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:40,558
You were a liability, Bob.

139
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:42,124
An embarrassment.

140
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,439
I think you've got that backwards.

141
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:49,996
I was only forced to resign because they
found out about my relationship with you.

142
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:53,157
Either way,
you were no longer useful to us.

143
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:58,083
You would have done the same.

144
00:12:58,165 --> 00:12:59,883
Maybe.

145
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:05,244
But when I cut someone loose, I don't
go back to them grovelling for favours.

146
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:07,793
You say what's on your mind,
I'll give you that.

147
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:11,275
Under other circumstances,
I might be worried about

148
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:14,801
winding up like
one of your trophies on the wall.

149
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:20,994
But you've made it clear you need me, so
I don't have anything to worry about, do I?

150
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:27,117
- We're losing video.
- We need you, but not for what you think.

151
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:29,878
- They jamming us?
- I don't know.

152
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:34,238
- What are you talking about?
- Show him.

153
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:55,324
This... is why we need you, Bob.

154
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:01,124
What the hell is going on here?

155
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:06,280
They are definitely jamming us.
Teal'c, we've lost audio. Move in.

156
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:17,519
- Can you get the signal back?
- I can't get past the interference.

157
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:36,522
Clear.

158
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,201
Clear over here, sir.

159
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:49,560
They beamed out.

160
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:52,523
This is starting to become a habit.

161
00:14:55,565 --> 00:15:00,081
If the Alkesh is in orbit, they've fixed
the cloak - SSN hasn't picked them up.

162
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,678
What about the locator beacons?

163
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:04,404
We're searching through
the NSA satellite system.

164
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,921
But all they'd have to do to avoid
detection is change the frequency.

165
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:11,077
Odds are we're not gonna find anything.

166
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,554
The Pentagon's been apprised
of the situation.

167
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:16,637
They're launching Prometheus
in about four hours.

168
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:21,355
I want you on board.
There's a C-17 waiting for you at Peterson.

169
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:23,117
Understood.

170
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:27,721
I've gone over sensor logs from the last
meeting Prometheus had with the Alkesh.

171
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:32,481
There were anomalies emanating from
the ship's position before it decloaked,

172
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,840
not registered
because we didn't look for them.

173
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:38,679
I could create a program that
would key the sensors to those readings.

174
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:41,837
I was just going to suggest that.

175
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:43,995
So we'd be able to detect a cloaked ship?

176
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:48,124
It's not that simple. These anomalies
are very difficult to detect.

177
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:51,197
It might have been a fluke
we picked them up the first time.

178
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,402
The effect is also mimicked
by types of cosmic radiation.

179
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:57,045
But I still think it might improve our odds.

180
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,117
So instead of a million to one...

181
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:02,673
Maybe 10,000 to one.

182
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,802
- Improvement.
- Yeah.

183
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:09,560
I'll need a few hours
to create the program.

184
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:19,879
- I have to pick up my dry-cleaning.
- You're flying to Moscow in half an hour.

185
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,274
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

186
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:25,038
Colonel Chekov's people
will meet you there.

187
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,401
Will you please try to find out
what the hell's going on?

188
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:32,956
And if you get a chance,
hook up with this General Kiselev.

189
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:36,082
They know we're on to them.
They may just abort the mission.

190
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:40,397
No, the way Kinsey was talking, it sounds
like they're looking for a big score here.

191
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:43,795
And what if he won't
cooperate with them?

192
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:46,274
Kinsey will do what's best for Kinsey.

193
00:16:46,365 --> 00:16:47,878
Yeah.

194
00:17:02,685 --> 00:17:07,042
Download is complete. Colonel Carter's
sensor program is online and operational.

195
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,958
- All right. Begin search pattern Alpha.
- Yes, sir.

196
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:24,156
Hi. I'm here to see Captain Voronkov.

197
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:27,237
There is no Captain Voronkov here.

198
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:32,562
- That's strange. The guy in the hall said...
- I am Captain Voronkova.

199
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:35,955
Daria Voronkova.
You must be Daniel Jackson.

200
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:40,675
I'm sorry. I was told I'd be meeting
Colonel Chekov's right-hand man, so I...

201
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:45,316
For my part, I expected a drab,
pasty-faced, middle-aged academic.

202
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:48,522
I, too, am pleasantly surprised.

203
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:50,197
Oh.

204
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:53,204
Your English is excellent.

205
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,320
How is your Russian?

206
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:04,077
OK, we stick to English, then.

207
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:07,794
I will be your guide. Whatever
you wish to do while you are in Moscow,

208
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:10,319
you will ask me first, I will take care of it.

209
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:14,159
If you desire to meet with anyone,
I will arrange it for you.

210
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:17,078
If you go out on your own,
I cannot protect you.

211
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:20,999
Lie to me, or attempt to mislead me,
and I will not protect you.

212
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,234
OK.

213
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:26,957
- Have you eaten a proper lunch?
- I had something on the plane.

214
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:29,354
Then the answer is no. Good.

215
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:32,596
I know a restaurant
that serves the best salo in Moscow.

216
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:38,043
- I'm not a big fan of salo.
- Don't worry. You will acquire a taste.

217
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,320
- Sir, what's going on?
- The Russians went into a state of alert.

218
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:51,680
- Why?
- We're trying to find out.

219
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,598
The president's called a meeting
for the Joint Chiefs.

220
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:57,279
We're at DEFCON three.

221
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:12,885
So where exactly are we going?

222
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:17,277
You wish to meet with General Kiselev?
That is where we are going.

223
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:21,802
You must be pretty well connected
to get me to see him this quickly.

224
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:25,082
- What do you know about him?
- General Miroslav Kiselev.

225
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,714
Graduated with a gold medal
from Malinovskiy Tank Academy.

226
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:32,195
Received the Hero of Russia
for his leadership in Chechnya.

227
00:19:32,285 --> 00:19:34,879
Commanded the Carpathian District's
Iron Division.

228
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,082
Then the 14th Army
in the Transcaucasus Military District.

229
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:43,523
Head of the General Staff Academy
for five years before his present position.

230
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:46,244
So you've heard of him.

231
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:48,714
He's suspicious
of American global influence,

232
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:53,242
and highly critical
of what he calls "NATO expansion plans".

233
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,795
You may not receive
a very warm welcome.

234
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:33,634
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

235
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:38,597
Nyet.

236
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:44,236
Don't worry, Daniel.
I'll find out what's happening.

237
00:20:53,925 --> 00:20:55,722
All right.

238
00:20:56,645 --> 00:21:00,274
OK, get back to me
when you know something.

239
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:04,358
- Colonel Chekov's here to see you.
- Send him in.

240
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:09,476
- General.
- Colonel.

241
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:12,796
I was hoping you could shed some light
on the situation here.

242
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:16,673
We can't seem to get a straight answer
from your government.

243
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:21,156
The information coming out of Moscow
is guarded at best.

244
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:26,114
But my sources in the Kremlin tell me the
Russian military is increasing alert status

245
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:31,484
because they think the American
administration has been compromised.

246
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:35,634
- Dr Jackson. Sorry to keep you waiting.
- No problem.

247
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:40,435
- You wanna tell me what's going on?
- All in good time. Roll up your sleeve.

248
00:21:40,525 --> 00:21:43,403
We need a sample of your blood.

249
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:51,804
- You're kidding.
- Cooperate, or we will take it by force.

250
00:21:56,045 --> 00:22:00,641
- This a normal part of your interrogation?
- Depends what you wish to know.

251
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:03,956
In this case,
it will answer a very specific question.

252
00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:05,842
What question?

253
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:06,755
Ow.

254
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:22,282
- What's going on?
- Why do you wish to see the general?

255
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:25,562
- It's complicated.
- Surely you can explain it to me.

256
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:29,160
- I'd rather explain it to General Kiselev.
- That's not going to happen.

257
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:33,397
Earlier today, we managed to uncover
a plot against the general's life.

258
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:38,320
Luckily we captured the assassin
before he could make his move.

259
00:22:42,925 --> 00:22:45,075
I believe you know him.

260
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:48,077
- Kinsey?
- Robert Kinsey.

261
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:50,599
Former vice president of the USA.

262
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:53,483
That's insane.
Why would Kinsey wanna kill Kiselev?

263
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:57,956
I'm afraid Mr Kinsey
isn't exactly himself these days.

264
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:03,119
By stopping me,
you have only delayed the inevitable.

265
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:05,878
Your world is doomed.

266
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:12,075
Now you begin to appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

267
00:23:17,685 --> 00:23:19,994
How could Kinsey
become a Goa'uld?

268
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:23,077
Five bucks says Carter has a theory.

269
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:25,876
As a matter of fact, I do.

270
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:29,878
According to Tok'ra intelligence,
the Trust launched at least two attacks

271
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:33,037
against Goa'uld-occupied worlds
after we took the gate.

272
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:36,481
That means they had to leave
the safe confines of the solar system

273
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:42,720
and head out into the galaxy, where they
ran the risk of being killed or captured.

274
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:45,683
- What are you suggesting?
- Any Goa'uld who caught them

275
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:49,041
would have discovered they belong
to a top-secret organisation

276
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:53,801
with high-level connections to the most
powerful governments and institutions,

277
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:59,960
including the SGC, Area 51, and maybe
even the Ancient outpost in the Antarctic.

278
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:04,197
My God. You think they have been
taken as hosts and sent back to Earth.

279
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:09,882
It's possible. They could have brought
dozens of symbiotes back with them.

280
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:12,479
The entire Trust
could have been taken over.

281
00:24:12,565 --> 00:24:16,080
But why would the Goa'uld
want to assassinate General Kiselev?

282
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:19,555
We don't know for sure that was the plan,
but if Carter's right,

283
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:22,762
Kinsey may have been trying
to get a snake into Kiselev's head.

284
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:27,157
It makes sense. From Kiselev,
it's one step up to the president of Russia.

285
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:30,317
- How do we know he didn't succeed?
- He never met the general.

286
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:33,556
He was arrested
before he had the chance.

287
00:24:33,645 --> 00:24:37,354
My government feels
that it is the American administration

288
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:40,801
that has been infiltrated by the Goa'uld,
and they are insisting

289
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:46,881
that everyone in key positions, including
the president, must submit for testing.

290
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:50,316
Not gonna happen.

291
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,078
Then we have a problem.

292
00:24:56,925 --> 00:25:01,555
- Thank you for getting me out of there.
- It wasn't easy.

293
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:05,684
Even after your blood test came back
negative, they still wanted to hold you.

294
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:10,122
Yeah, not a lot of trust and good will
to spare right now, I guess.

295
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:14,596
Listen, I need to talk to the Goa'uld.
You have to get me in to see Kinsey.

296
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:17,483
- Impossible.
- We have to question him.

297
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:21,877
- He is being questioned by intelligence.
- And he's feeding them a pack of lies.

298
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:26,083
He says the US administration has been
infiltrated cos he wants a confrontation.

299
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:29,282
- To what end?
- I don't know. That's why we need to talk.

300
00:25:29,365 --> 00:25:32,994
Language.

301
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:36,436
Daria, please.

302
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:41,393
I'll see what I can do.

303
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:43,555
In the meantime, stay here.

304
00:25:52,765 --> 00:25:55,643
Sir, just received another report.

305
00:25:55,725 --> 00:26:00,799
As of 0912, the Chinese military have
joined Russia in an elevated state of alert.

306
00:26:00,885 --> 00:26:02,682
Naturally.

307
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:07,394
General, I have been talking
to my contacts in the Kremlin.

308
00:26:07,485 --> 00:26:10,443
They tell me the president
is not happy with the situation,

309
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:13,835
but is under considerable pressure
from his military advisers.

310
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:17,713
In other words,
Kiselev is running the show.

311
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:20,524
Any idea how to keep this
from going to total forces?

312
00:26:20,605 --> 00:26:24,757
Yes, I have many friends
in the general staff.

313
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:29,043
If I can convince enough of them
to take a united stand against escalation,

314
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:32,959
it could give our presidents
leverage to consider other options.

315
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:37,561
And if Kiselev finds out you're going
around him, it could make things worse.

316
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:42,161
At this point,
I don't believe we have much choice.

317
00:26:42,245 --> 00:26:44,281
Right.

318
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:16,879
- So what should I call you?
- You are unworthy to speak my name.

319
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:18,956
Maybe.

320
00:27:19,045 --> 00:27:22,082
So I'm guessing you work
for the System Lords. Am I right?

321
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:27,114
It's not Baal. He's too busy conquering
the galaxy to bother with Earth.

322
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:30,993
Gotta hand it to you. Your territories
are falling, troops are in retreat,

323
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,157
and you still find the time
to try and destroy little old us.

324
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:36,440
The question is, why?

325
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:42,754
Captain Voronkova thinks
it's revenge for the trouble we caused,

326
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:45,723
an attempt to take us with you
before Baal finishes you off.

327
00:27:45,805 --> 00:27:50,242
- But System Lords aren't that pathetic.
- You are the one who is pathetic.

328
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:54,159
You will die
never knowing our true purpose.

329
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,559
So there is a hidden agenda.

330
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,798
Making progress now, aren't we?

331
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,557
Yep.

332
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,761
All right. Keep me posted.

333
00:28:10,845 --> 00:28:15,282
Well, the Chinese refuse to back down,
and gosh and golly, go figure,

334
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:18,084
we're picking up
increased chatter from Russia.

335
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:24,035
- I'm waiting to hear from my contacts.
- And I just talked to the Joint Chiefs.

336
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:27,240
We're going to DEFCON two.

337
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:34,443
If we put our heads together, we'd find
reasons why you'd wanna wipe us out.

338
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:37,995
Most important being the Ancient weapon
that you know we possess.

339
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:42,078
The System Lords think if they get us
to wipe ourselves out, they can take it.

340
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:45,043
But what I don't understand is you.

341
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:49,038
- Why sacrifice yourself?
- I assure you,

342
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:53,038
I have no intention of dying
on this miserable planet.

343
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:56,640
You're in Russian defence headquarters.
Primary target.

344
00:28:56,725 --> 00:29:02,561
If you do succeed in starting a nuclear
war, you're gonna die with the rest of us.

345
00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:10,277
- Unless there's something I'm missing.
- Return home, say farewell to loved ones.

346
00:29:10,365 --> 00:29:13,243
Your gods have
deemed you to be unworthy,

347
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:16,442
and the hour of reckoning is at hand.

348
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:19,323
Air Force Space Command
has its missile wings on alert.

349
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:21,919
The first B-2 left Whiteman at 0940.

350
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:24,917
FLSATCOM sent out
an emergency action message.

351
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:29,044
Nine of our missile submarines are at sea
and the rest are preparing for sortie.

352
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,241
The president is on the way to Andrews

353
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:36,797
where the National Airborne Command
Post is awaiting his arrival.

354
00:29:36,885 --> 00:29:40,798
General Kiselev found out we were
trying to rally support against him.

355
00:29:40,885 --> 00:29:44,514
He's already arrested several officers
on trumped-up charges.

356
00:29:44,605 --> 00:29:47,597
I'm afraid Dr Jackson may be in danger.

357
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,277
Come on.

358
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:52,960
Next to slaughtering innocents,
gloating is what you guys are about.

359
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:59,041
Must be killing you, just sitting there
not bragging about your brilliant plan.

360
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:07,839
- We have to get out. They're coming.
- Who?

361
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:13,240
You are too late.

362
00:30:18,805 --> 00:30:21,035
Sorry, guys. Gotta go.

363
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:35,960
- What is the meaning of this?
- Welcome aboard the Prometheus.

364
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:38,400
- Any luck finding the Alkesh?
- None.

365
00:30:38,485 --> 00:30:40,680
Maybe he can help us.

366
00:30:40,765 --> 00:30:44,314
- I think not.
- If you do not cooperate, I will kill you.

367
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:46,794
Don't you realise what you have done?

368
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:51,163
The Russians already suspect that you
have been compromised by the Goa'uld.

369
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:54,396
As far as they know,
you helped me to escape.

370
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:58,763
You've done more to convince them
than I ever could.

371
00:31:04,285 --> 00:31:06,276
Listen up, people.

372
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:11,803
I just got word. The Russians have gone
into a state of full military preparedness.

373
00:31:11,885 --> 00:31:14,877
As of this moment, we're at DEFCON one.

374
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:26,200
The Russians will view my abduction
as an attempt to hide evidence

375
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:30,119
that your government
has been infiltrated by the Goa'uld.

376
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:33,914
You have no choice
but to return me immediately.

377
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:38,920
Yeah, that's the part I don't understand.
You were trying to start a nuclear war,

378
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:44,125
even though you were right in
the line of fire. Now you wanna go back?

379
00:31:44,565 --> 00:31:46,715
He has a way out.

380
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:50,514
He knows someone on the inside
who can protect him.

381
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:54,242
- Who is it?
- I have nothing more to say to you.

382
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:57,601
We can start this again
when he's had some time to think about it.

383
00:31:57,685 --> 00:32:00,916
Take him to the brig.

384
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:10,075
All our naval forces have been deployed,
and we've got some big birds in the air.

385
00:32:11,085 --> 00:32:15,237
Radio chatter suggests
that both your people and the Chinese

386
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:18,556
- have alerted their missile regiments.
- They're posturing.

387
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:23,002
Kiselev knows that even if he launches
a strike against your land-based forces,

388
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:26,760
your sea-based missiles are
in a position to exact extreme retribution.

389
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:32,363
That's only if he doesn't completely lose
his mind. And I'm not discounting that.

390
00:32:32,445 --> 00:32:35,118
As acting commander in chief
of Russian forces,

391
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:37,400
President Mikhailov is our only hope.

392
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:42,240
We can't get through to him. He's not
even taking calls from the White House.

393
00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:47,797
He is convinced the Goa'uld
now control the American administration.

394
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:53,196
I know a few people on his personal staff.
I may be able to get the direct line.

395
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:57,244
But if we do make contact, we will only
have a few minutes to convince him

396
00:32:57,325 --> 00:32:59,998
that General Kiselev
has been misled by the Goa'uld.

397
00:33:00,085 --> 00:33:04,078
Right now, I don't see
how we're going to do that.

398
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:15,237
We are in position.

399
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:18,203
- Have they detected our presence?
- No.

400
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:23,279
- Very well. Destroy the ship.
- They have superior shields.

401
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:26,357
If the first salvo does not succeed,
we'll be disadvantaged.

402
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:31,235
So long as he is in their hands,
he remains a liability. We have no choice.

403
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:33,475
Understood.

404
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,479
What the hell was that?

405
00:33:48,725 --> 00:33:51,398
- We're under attack.
- Shields up.

406
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,560
Shields are 40 per cent.
Lost starboard engines.

407
00:33:54,645 --> 00:33:58,479
Transfer to port engines. Evasive
manoeuvres. Weapon batteries online.

408
00:33:58,565 --> 00:34:01,602
- Bridge, this is Sergeant Larson.
- Go ahead.

409
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:06,520
- Sorry, sir. The prisoner escaped.
- The ring room.

410
00:34:12,765 --> 00:34:15,916
Please tell me you have something.

411
00:34:16,005 --> 00:34:18,155
Yes, sir. I think I do.

412
00:34:18,245 --> 00:34:23,035
I've been going over everything we have
on General Kiselev, and I found this.

413
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:25,116
Colonel Ruslan Chernovshev.

414
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:27,958
He was Kiselev's chief of staff,
his right-hand man.

415
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:31,117
Three years ago, he was involved
in a plot to sell a symbiote

416
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:35,403
to elements of the Trust,
then operating within the NID.

417
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:38,443
That means the Trust
had a direct connection to Kiselev.

418
00:34:38,525 --> 00:34:42,643
They didn't need Kinsey. He was just
a pretext to justify this confrontation

419
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:45,000
by making them think
we'd been compromised.

420
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:49,124
So if the Trust had access to Kiselev,
he could have been compromised as well.

421
00:34:49,205 --> 00:34:51,241
Exactly.

422
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:56,524
This is a file photo
of General Kiselev taken three years ago.

423
00:34:56,605 --> 00:35:01,884
This was less than a week ago during
his speech at the General Staff Academy.

424
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:04,559
Notice the difference?

425
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:08,075
Glasses?

426
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:10,156
May I see that?

427
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:12,520
We know that symbiotes
have healing power.

428
00:35:12,605 --> 00:35:18,601
They can cure a host body of physical
shortcomings, including bad eyesight.

429
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:23,523
That's it? Did it occur to you
that he might be wearing contacts?

430
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:25,835
Sir, I realise it's not a lot to go on.

431
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:28,041
- Have you heard of laser surgery?
- Sir...

432
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:33,677
Colonel Carter is right. Kiselev suffered
from glaucoma. His vision was poor.

433
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:38,634
There is no possibility he could have read
a prepared statement without his glasses.

434
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:41,193
Sir, I think Kiselev's a Goa'uld.

435
00:35:41,285 --> 00:35:43,674
I think he has been all along.

436
00:36:20,165 --> 00:36:21,962
Crap.

437
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:29,963
We've almost got it, sir. Stand by.

438
00:36:30,045 --> 00:36:31,364
Hey.

439
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:35,277
How do we know Mikhailov
hasn't been infected too?

440
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:39,517
We don't. But at this point,
we hardly have anything to lose.

441
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:42,881
- Good point.
- We got it, sir. You're on.

442
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:48,677
- Mr President, can you hear me?
- Colonel Chekov, this is highly irregular.

443
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:53,202
Yes, sir, but these
are highly unusual circumstances.

444
00:36:53,285 --> 00:36:55,879
Agreed. Is General O'Neill there with you?

445
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:58,798
- I'm here.
- It's good to speak with you again.

446
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:02,719
Although you understand, at the moment,
I cannot trust anything you say.

447
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:05,524
Yeah. About that.

448
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:09,564
It's true,
there has been a Goa'uld infiltration.

449
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:12,842
But it's not on our side, it's on yours.

450
00:37:17,565 --> 00:37:20,841
What is it exactly that you are saying?

451
00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:23,644
Let me put it this way, sir.

452
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:26,922
The last time you saw General Kiselev,

453
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:30,714
did you happen to notice
if he was wearing his glasses?

454
00:37:32,885 --> 00:37:35,353
Shields are holding.
40 per cent and steady.

455
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:39,324
Then we got him.
Prepare to fire on my signal.

456
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:48,404
I'm pleased you used my diversion
to free yourself.

457
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:50,840
Do you think I'm a fool?

458
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:55,203
You tried to destroy the ship because you
thought I'd reveal information about you.

459
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:57,719
Of course not. We were merely...

460
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:02,678
- Open fire. All batteries.
- Yes, sir.

461
00:38:21,285 --> 00:38:24,482
We're sending you the relevant
documents now, Mr President.

462
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:28,035
Proof of Colonel Chernovshev's
prior relationship with the Trust.

463
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:32,516
Plus a list of generals who are willing to
support you if you move against Kiselev.

464
00:38:32,605 --> 00:38:36,120
I must say,
I'm not sure what to make ofall ofthis.

465
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:39,038
Well, you could start by trusting us.

466
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:41,514
Ifyou have been
compromised by the Goa'uld,

467
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:46,474
I'd be standing down my forces with the
Americans in position to launch an attack.

468
00:38:46,565 --> 00:38:51,719
Sir, we both know neither side
can win outright with a first strike.

469
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:55,195
That's the whole point.
The Goa'uld don't want a winner.

470
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:58,118
- They want us to destroy each other.
- Why?

471
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:03,359
We believe their goal is to get their hands
on the Ancient weapon in Antarctica.

472
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:08,519
Sir, NPIC is reporting visuals
from Russian missile site 537.

473
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:11,324
Silo doors are open.
Evidence of a fire fight.

474
00:39:11,405 --> 00:39:15,193
Oh, my God. Kiselev is trying
to launch without authorisation.

475
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:19,244
Mr President, you are about
to lose control of your own forces.

476
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:22,044
- You have to do something right now.
- I am...

477
00:39:24,805 --> 00:39:29,401
- What happened?
- We lost the connection. The line is down.

478
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:34,882
The Alkesh is no longer
making evasive manoeuvres or firing.

479
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:38,037
We have a clear shot.

480
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,116
Stand by.

481
00:39:44,245 --> 00:39:46,713
Why are we not returning fire?

482
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:57,441
They're powering weapons.

483
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,800
Take 'em out.

484
00:40:08,845 --> 00:40:10,836
Target destroyed.

485
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:36,996
- Get me Washington.
- General, wait.

486
00:40:37,085 --> 00:40:39,235
We're out of time, Colonel.

487
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:41,122
Please.

488
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:51,477
Sir, NPIC is reporting new visuals at 537.

489
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:58,037
- Silo doors are closing.
- Russian bombers are returning to base.

490
