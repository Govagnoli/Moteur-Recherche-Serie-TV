Oh, my God. Cam! Medic!

00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,786
It's Teal'c.

14
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,632
The Ori are taking our planets by force.

00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:21,701
Dividing our people
through religious ideology and fear.

16
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,839
We must fight back now.

17
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,707
We all agree, Nisal.

00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,181
That is why we are here.

But entering into a war
without leadership,

20
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:37,016

would merely be mass suicide.

Never once did we plan for what we would
do with that freedom after it was ours.

24
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,611
The resulting infighting and weakness
after our victory over the Goa'uld

25
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:07,277
is what leads us to this vulnerability
at the hands of the Ori now.

You've been out for quite a while.
About two weeks.

It was pretty touch and go there.

worried that you wouldn't walk again,

you're gonna pull through this.

- the Jaffa that organized the summit.
- And?

71
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,659
It is believed that a Jaffa named Arkad
is responsible.

72
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,619
I have knowledge of him.

73
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,960
We once engaged in battle,
as opposing First Primes.

74
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,930
He is a warrior without honor.

75
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,663
Which would explain why he chose
to bomb a peaceful leadership summit.

76
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,865
It is believed that
Arkad has slowly and quietly

77
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,875
been building support for himself
as a new leader.

78
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:28,936
A leader that would deliver
the Jaffa nation into the hands of the Ori.

79
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,848
So, he would obviously be opposed
to the organizing of a council

81
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:39,222

to unite them against the Ori.

00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,691

and must be eliminated.

- General Landry,

00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,958
Arkad must be found and killed

85
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,034

are senselessly slaughtered.

that had been killed in that bombing?

right now,

91

so I'm going to let that pass.

92
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,353

In the past, he has existed solely
on the fringes.

to use fear and tyranny

to gain control of a significant Jaffa army
and a fleet of ships, believe me,

96
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,837
he will become as much an issue for Earth
as anyone else in the galaxy.

00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,706
and Teal'c's right about him
being a bad man...

105
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,540

to all teams

106

a top priority.

107
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,117

as far as Teal'c is concerned, sir.

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,711
I take it you've tried to talk him out
of leaving?

00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:20,622
Yes, sir. Like sticking my foot out

I can't say that I blame him, sir.

I don't either.

an embarrassing victory

172
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,790
over Arkad's fleet.

173
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,918
The murder was never resolved.

174
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,792
For no apparent reason,
someone slipped into her village

175
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,298
and slit her throat in the night.

176
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:32,262
And Teal'c believed
it was Arkad's revenge for the defeat?

177
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,736
It was never proven.

178
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,833
But still, knowing Teal'c, I mean,
why didn't he go after Arkad immediately?

179
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,970
He was First Prime of Apophis at the time.

180
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,675
Teal'c's actions were chosen for him.

181
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:50,879
Now, given what Arkad has done,

182
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,187
Teal'c will stop at nothing
to bring an end to him.

183
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,455
Yeah, and that doesn't sound like
any great loss.

184
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,899
As long as it is Teal'c that is the victor.

185
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,463
LANDRY: Where's your confirmation
coming from?

186
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,438
REYNOLDS: SG-22 recon, sir.

187
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,040
I thought you should hear this.

188
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,977
We've been maintaining contact
with anti-Ori rebels on P8T-365.

189
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,044
That's a predominantly Jaffa planet that's
already succumbed to Ori control, right?

190
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:25,920
Right. This group we've been monitoring
opposes Ori occupation, quietly so far,

191
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,289
but is keeping us apprised
of their intentions.

192
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,421
Anyway, they say several hundred Jaffa,
including a few of their inside men,

193
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:36,729
are regularly being ferried by mother ship
to another planet to mine raw naquadah.

194
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:42,171
That makes sense. The Ori warriors will be
able to make ships, weapons, supergates.

195
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,265
Yes, but here's the interesting part.

196
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,402
The Jaffa say
this is not being done for the Ori.

197
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,448
- At least, not directly.
- Well, how is that possible?

198
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,609
It's an Ori planet. Somebody's building
weapons right under their noses?

199
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,153
Apparently, a Jaffa named Arkad

200
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,122
has muscled his way into
a relationship with the Ori.

201
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,193
Says he'll police the planet,
get even more Jaffa planets to fall in line.

202
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,353
Well, that's in line with the intel we have.

203
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:09,992
Yes, it seems Arkad is planning a fairly
major play to impress his new friends.

204
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,899
Word's floating around that
this weapons-grade naquadah

205
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,371
is being stockpiled in various locations
for use by Arkad,

206
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,840
in a coordinated attack on Earth.

207
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,868
(GROANS)

208
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,419
Torture me all you want.
I'll tell you nothing.

209
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,823
Though you hide among humans,
I know you are Jaffa.

210
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,863
That is your symbiote
lying on the ground in front of you.

211
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,195
That is your symbiote
lying on the ground in front of you.

212
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,262
I serve the Ori.

213
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:25,772
When I die, I will ascend
and join them in everlasting glory.

214
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,703
That is untrue.

215
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,781
You will not convince me otherwise.

216
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,674
That is most unfortunate.

217
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,683
I have medicine that would save your life,
should you tell me what I wish to know.

218
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,021
Never.

219
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,621
Then there are some things
that you should know.

220
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,092
The Ori do not ascend their followers.

221
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,970
Arkad is a coward
who will die by my hand.

222
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,601
Also, I have implanted an explosive device
within your symbiote pouch.

223
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:04,005
It is set to detonate
within a matter of moments.

224
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,552
It is the same explosive
that you used to kill 12 warriors,

225
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,817
18 innocent bystanders, and two children
who had gathered for a peaceful summit.

226
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,758
They were sinners all,
who chose the path of evil.

227
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,163
Ten seconds.

228
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,764
Where are you going?

229
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,632
I am leaving.

230
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,705
You are about to explode.

231
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,107
(SCREAMS)

232
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,122
So, what does this Arkad
have to gain by attacking Earth?

233
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,820
Maybe he's trying to up his street cred.

234
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,020
Well, it could be revenge.

235
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,121
It's possible he blames us for
what happened at Dakara.

236
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,257
For all we know,
it was the Ori who instructed him

237
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,460
to try to weaken our resolve.

238
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,799
They must know a direct attack
on Earth is risky

239
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,668
because of the Antarctic defense system.

240
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,798
Well, right now,
we have no way of detecting,

241
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,275
let alone stopping, a cloaked cargo ship.

242
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,243
They could go after
whatever targets they want.

243
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,440
Not to mention the countless casualties
that would be created

244
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,380
that would throw the rest of the planet
into chaos.

245
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,611
Primed and ready for an Ori attack.

246
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,415
I thought the Jaffa were all about honor

247
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,422
and meeting their enemy
on the battlefield.

248
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,652
- Yeah, apparently not this guy.
- So, what do we do?

249
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,858
It sounds to me like Teal'c
has the right idea.

250
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,261
<i>HARRIMAN: Unscheduled</i>
<i>offworld activation!</i>

251
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,398
(ALARM SOUNDING)

252
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,330
Receiving a transmission, sir.

253
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,734
On screen.

254
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,709
<i>ARKAD: Warriors of the Tau'ri,</i>
<i>I bid you greetings.</i>

255
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,146
This is General Landry
of Stargate Command.

256
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,612
To whom am I speaking?

257
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:47,674
<i>My name is Arkad.</i>
<i>I am the leader of the Illac Renin.</i>

258
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:51,153
It's Ancient. Loosely translated,
it means "kingdom of the path."

259
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,917
What can we do for you?

260
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,858
<i>I wish to be granted safe passage</i>
<i>to your planet</i>

261
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,258
<i>so that we may meet in person</i>

262
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,922
<i>and discuss certain issues</i>
<i>that concern us both.</i>

263
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,229
<i>By now, you have undoubtedly learned</i>
<i>of a plot</i>

264
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,236
<i>to brazenly strike at your planet</i>
<i>in a most cowardly manner.</i>

265
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,535
<i>I want to offer my assistance, as I believe</i>

266
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:13,577
<i>I am uniquely capable of stopping</i>
<i>this most dishonorable attack.</i>

267
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,079
He no doubt fed you
the information about the attack

268
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,489
so that he could then claim to be
the one who could prevent it.

269
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:32,030
Yeah, we figured that.
But what we don't know is why.

270
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,654
And given the very real threat
that's out there,

271
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,598
the IOA wants us to
hear what he has to say.

272
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,263
He is a serpent. You must not trust him.

273
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,466
- I'll let you know how it goes.
- I already know.

274
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,900
Nothing good will come of it.

275
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,086
Arkad, I'm sure you know of SG-1.

276
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:03,059
Lieutenant Colonels Mitchell and Carter,
Dr. Daniel Jackson, and Vala Mal Doran.

277
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,994
It's an honor to finally meet you all
in person.

278
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,725
I have looked forward to this day
for some time.

279
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,801
Let's sit down, shall we?

280
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,440
A shame Teal'c is not here.

281
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,977
We have not had the pleasure
of seeing each other in many years.

282
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,242
We couldn't guarantee your safety
if he was here.

283
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,877
Surely, he does not still hold a grudge
for past battles we once waged

284
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,887
in the name of former false gods?

285
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:34,220
No, I think it has more to do
with recent events.

286
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,352
I assume you are referring
to the tragedy at Dar Eshkalon?

287
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:42,365
Yeah, in which your good buddy Teal'c
came this close to dying.

288
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,560
Bra'tac sends his regards, as well.

289
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,230
I don't think he'll mind me
speaking for him when I say that

290
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,706
he'd love to stab you in the eye
with a really big knife.

291
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,138
Thirty-two other Jaffa
weren't nearly as lucky as they were.

292
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:57,340
You must understand, all of you,
that there are those out there

293
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:01,078
who would have me falsely accused
of such cowardly actions.

294
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,847
So, you're saying
you had nothing to do with it?

295
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,979
I fully admit I was against a gathering.

296
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,888
But those in attendance were assembling
to form a council

297
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,554
that would directly oppose my campaign
to lead all Jaffa.

298
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,221
Into the arms of the Ori.

299
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,199
The reason we fought for freedom is so
we could believe in what we want

300
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,701
and not be subjugated by anyone.

301
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:22,137
And you don't see the Ori
as forcing their beliefs on you?

302
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,266
I see Origin as the organized religion
and the source of salvation

303
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,208
all the Jaffa has always sought.

304
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,371
I think we're getting a little off point here.

305
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,675
I agree.

306
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:35,948
I assure you, no matter what
our philosophical differences,

307
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:40,855
I would never authorize the type of attack
that befell the summit at Dar Eshkalon.

308
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,725
But you just happen to know some guys,
less respectable,

309
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,698
less honorable than yourself,
who took matters into their own hands.

310
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,427
As a matter of fact, yes.

311
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,197
And I have learned of similar attacks
against your planet being planned

312
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,897
by a radical sect of Jaffa,

313
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,634
who see the Tau'ri
as a powerful force in the galaxy,

314
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:01,839
who oppose our peaceful movement
toward embracing Origin.

315
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,939
- And you can stop them?
- Yes, I believe I can.

316
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,950
I do not agree with their tactics,

317
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,213
but at least we see eye to eye
in basic beliefs.

318
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,779
I can use my influence and my resources

319
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,223
to choke off their ability
to function effectively.

320
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,090
Or you can fund them

321
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,858
and allow them to do your dirty work for
you while you take the political high road.

322
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,833
Let's cut the crap!
We all know you're here for one reason.

323
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,870
- Make your demands.
- I have no demands.

324
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:31,306
I understand your mistrust,
but, please, I implore you.

325
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:36,109
Believe me when I say I will use
all of my vast resources at my disposal

326
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,342
to thwart this most heinous threat
to your world.

327
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:44,281
All I ask in return is you allow the Jaffa
people to believe in what they choose.

328
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,881
If they decide to follow
in the ways of the Illac Renin,

329
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,321
that should be up to them.

330
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,592
If you feel it is your responsibility
to do battle with the Ori

331
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:58,635
on behalf of the humans of this galaxy,
then that is your prerogative.

332
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,467
Stay out of your way
and you won't attack us?

333
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,370
General, my fleet is more powerful

334
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,773
than any Goa'uld
has ever marshaled by tenfold.

335
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,276
If I was to attack this planet,

336
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:11,713
it would not be in the manner
currently being planned by these radicals.

337
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,851
And it would not end well for you.

338
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,380
MITCHELL: Really?

339
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,489
You don't say.

340
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,757
Whether or not our people
ever see eye to eye,

341
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,592
I would like to believe that
they could coexist peacefully.

342
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,495
Your planet has played
an instrumental role

343
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,433
in the very reshaping of the nature
of the galaxy.

344
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:35,233
I merely wish to avoid
any unpleasant conflicts

345
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,400
between our two respective nations,
before they arise.

346
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,271
I take my leave.

347
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,327
LIZAN: I told you where to find Bak'al.

348
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:05,132
He's the Jaffa scum that I sold
the explosives to. That's all I know.

349
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,137
I do not believe you.

350
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,605
I don't know anything about Arkad.

351
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,802
You despise Jaffa. Why protect him?

352
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,606
I'm not afraid to die.

353
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:19,412
I have no intention of killing you.
Not until you tell me where to find Arkad.

354
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:23,578
Why should I tell you anything,
knowing death is my reward?

355
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,679
That may sound sensible for the moment,

356
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:31,092
but, believe me, in time
you will change your mind.

357
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:42,906
The IOA is taking the threat of
these attacks against Earth very seriously.

358
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,669
So, what do they want us to do?

359
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:48,473
- Nothing as far as Arkad is concerned.
- Sir?

360
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,880
They want us to leave him alone for now.
Let him go about his business.

361
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,112
We're supposed to let him muscle us?

362
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,088
Obviously, we need to
assess his capability,

363
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,785
determine if these threats are credible
and who's really behind them.

364
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,624
If we can prove that Arkad does pose
a direct threat to our security...

365
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,689
I'm sorry, sir. We're supposed to, what?
Find WMDs in his back pocket?

366
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,565
Right at the moment,
we need to play the intelligence game,

367
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,662
not get into an all-out war with an enemy

368
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,436
that may have the capability
to inflict severe damage on us.

369
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,443
We need to find out what we can.

370
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,979
- We're on it, sir.
- Not so fast, Colonel.

371
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,311
I plan to put a number of teams on it
right away,

372
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,080
but, at the moment,
I have another mission for you.

373
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:36,018
In his mind, Teal'c may have severed
his connections with us

374
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,924
when he set out to kill Arkad.

375
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,291
But he's been part of the SGC,

376
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:42,025
so he'll still be perceived
as acting on our behalf.

377
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,796
If he succeeds in killing Arkad,
even if he tries and fails,

378
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,271
it will be hard to convince people
that he was acting alone.

379
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,865
So you want us to try and stop him?

380
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,343
The IOA is adamant

381
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:59,213
that Earth, and specifically the SGC,
take no action against Arkad.

382
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:04,583
I've been charged with ordering you
to find Teal'c

383
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,016
and stop him at all costs.

384
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,009
Hey, no one really thinks
that Arkad gave the SGC

385
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:31,708
the whereabouts of his home base
of operations out of diplomatic courtesy?

386
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,977
What, you think he did it
to draw us into a trap?

387
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,416
I doubt that.
It's more likely that he knew that

388
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,579
if anyone was determined enough
to find him, they could,

389
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,156
and he wanted to make sure
we'd be blamed

390
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,781
in the event of any attack against him.

391
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,087
Regardless of whether we were behind it.

392
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,422
MITCHELL: Speaking of determined,

393
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:48,397
has anyone thought about the speech
they're going to give to Teal'c?

394
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,235
No, I didn't think so.

395
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,314
<i>Odyssey,</i> this is Mitchell. We are down.

396
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,013
All right, everybody knows what to do.

397
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,554
Field generators are in place.

398
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,732
Trip sensors are ready.

399
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,601
I'm glad you're so sure about this plan.

400
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,106
One way or the other,
you know he's coming.

401
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,844
He'll want the element of surprise,

402
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:38,507
so I figure he'll use a cloaked ship,
try to sneak in the back way.

403
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,948
- Well, that's what we would do.
- Exactly.

404
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,621
He just doesn't know
we're going to try and stop him.

405
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,920
You know, regardless of
who's going to try and stop him,

406
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,494
this is Teal'c we're talking about.

407
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,862
You know, Bra'tac seems to think that
if it suits Arkad to attack Earth,

408
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,734
he'll do so
no matter what his agreement with us.

409
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,469
It's possible he just didn't want us
coming after him yet.

410
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,408
So, he leaks the information
about the plot,

411
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,413
pretends to act towards
stopping the attack,

412
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,540
and, with the time that he's bought,
gets his chicks in a row.

413
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,448
That's a pretty good theory.
And it's ducks, by the way.

414
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,283
The only problem is,
we have to prove it to the IOA.

415
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:24,487
Well, what would be the harm in us just
failing to stop Teal'c from killing Arkad?

416
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,427
It wouldn't be entirely on purpose,

417
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:30,023
and not out of accidental incompetence
either, if you catch my drift.

418
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,796
Yes, nudge nudge, wink wink.

419
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,495
But if Arkad is the one
planning these attacks,

420
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,301
then I think our best chance of
stopping them is keeping Arkad alive.

421
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,431
Why's that?

422
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,170
He may be the only one that
knows all the pieces to the puzzle.

423
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,143
- Good point.
- Thank you.

424
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,711
How do we get Arkad to tell us
all the pieces of the puzzle?

425
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,149
Oh, that's the easy part.
See, we capture him, lock him in a room,

426
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,847
and threaten to let Teal'c kill him.

427
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,616
- Genius.
- Thank you.

428
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,071
It has occurred to you that
it could take days before Teal'c shows up?

429
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,239
Yeah.

430
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,950
He could also have been here already
and killed Arkad, for all we know.

431
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,453
Half of SG-3 is watching the gate.

432
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,351
We'll get some activity,
one way or the other.

433
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,188
Speaking of which...

434
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,957
Colonel Reynolds, come in.

435
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:43,535
SG-3, you've missed your scheduled
check in. Please respond.

436
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,245
Stay here.

437
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,755
<i>MITCHELL: Hey, somebody got to</i>
<i>Baker and Reynolds.</i>

438
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,801
They're unconscious, but they're still alive.

439
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,575
Hey, Teal'c?

440
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,740
Teal'c, I know you're out there, buddy.

441
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,276
If you can hear me, I don't know
what you think is going on here,

442
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,183
but we're here to help.

443
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:38,392
<i>MITCHELL: Okay, that was a lie,</i>
<i>and I feel terrible about it. I hate myself.</i>

444
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,789
<i>TEAL 'C: Why have you set a trap for me,</i>
<i>Colonel Mitchell?</i>

445
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:44,893
Trap?

446
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,594
That's crazy talk, man.

447
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,536
<i>Why would we set a trap for you?</i>

448
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:53,042
I intend on killing Arkad.
Do not try and stop me.

449
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,477
Teal'c, it's Daniel.
Listen, now just hear me out.

450
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,379
Now, apparently, there's a radical group
of Jaffa poised to attack Earth.

451
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,509
Arkad claims to have
the means to stop them,

452
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,849
<i>and he says he'll help us</i>
<i>if we leave him alone.</i>

453
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,287
It is likely Arkad is behind those attacks.

454
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,722
<i>Yes, I know, I know. We figured as much.</i>

455
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,726
But we just think
it's best for ourselves and you

456
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,388
if we all just step back
and consider all the angles.

457
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,996
I am not acting on behalf of Earth.

458
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,631
The IOA is worried
it may still look that way.

459
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,262
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>that is no longer my concern.</i>

460
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,973
I will avenge the deaths
of the Jaffa at Dar Eshkalon.

461
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,102
Arkad must die,
no matter what the consequences.

462
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,574
<i>I do not wish to harm any of you.</i>

463
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,810
But if you try and stop me, I will.

464
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,723
So, now what?

465
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,697
Well, he's got to be
headed for the pyramid.

466
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,634
Drop the stick.

467
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,239
Drop the stick.

468
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,242
I do not wish to harm you,
Colonel Mitchell.

469
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,081
Then drop the stick.

470
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,655
You know, I don't think anyone here
wants to get harmed.

471
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,785
Probably me more than you.

472
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,786
Look, Teal'c...

473
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,001
(GRUNTING)

474
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,928
(GROANS)

475
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,362
Okay, all right. We can talk about this.

476
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,374
The time for talk is over, Colonel Mitchell.

477
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:57,583
ARKAD: After all these years,
still as predictable as ever.

478
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,715
Leave.

479
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:44,829
You've gotten old and slow. Get up.

480
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,837
(GROANS)

481
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,714
I remember when you were a true warrior,

482
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,874
the pride of Apophis,

483
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,646
feared by all those who opposed you.

484
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:06,519
Do you remember, Teal'c,
how powerful you were then?

485
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,749
Do you remember Co'rak?

486
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,124
You had us on the run.

487
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,030
You bombarded the planet from space
and you left no survivors!

488
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,060
I lost my parents that day,

489
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,603
my sister,

490
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,142
yet I still admired you.

491
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:29,778
One day, I thought...
I thought I would be so brave.

492
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,247
I would have the courage
to bring my enemies to their knees,

493
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,945
like the great Jaffa warrior, Teal'c.

494
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,814
Fight!

495
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,298
Look at you now.

496
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,370
A legend.

497
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,345
You defeated
the mighty Goa'uld themselves.

498
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,680
You brought freedom to all Jaffa.

499
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:14,588
You gave us the chance to seek salvation,
but you, you rejected it yourself.

500
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:21,932
Your punishment must be
to have gotten so soft and frail.

501
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,969
Have you spent so long with humans
that you've become so much like them?

502
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,103
It's a shame

503
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:32,869
you won't live to see me
bring the Tau'ri to their knees.

504
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,954
(GRUNTING)

505
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:40,901
Before you die,
I want you to know the truth.

506
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,571
I had my revenge for the day
that you attacked Co'rak

507
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,911
and you slaughtered my family.

508
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,750
I killed your mother.

509
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:55,916
(GROANS)

510
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:27,751
Teal'c!

511
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,003
There was a time when you would have
come away from such a battle

512
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,912
without a scratch.

513
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:56,578
I'm alive. Arkad is not.

514
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,382
Indeed.

515
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,760
Just finished reading your report, Colonel.

516
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,998
Everything in order, sir?

517
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:11,124
Arkad set a trap for you,
took you prisoner,

518
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,829
and you were fortunate
Teal'c was there to rescue you.

519
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:17,874
Arkad was killed
and Teal'c injured in the process.

520
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,068
Yes, sir, that's what it says.

521
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,237
This is going to be a tough pill
for the IOA to swallow, son.

522
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,407
I believe I also mention that
Arkad admitted to planning the attacks

523
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,575
and they were going to
go through with them

524
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,982
regardless of what we'd do.

525
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,987
Yeah, it's too bad
you weren't able to learn more.

526
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:38,752
Arkad took credit
for the murder of my mother.

527
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:46,569
If he was responsible, he was too much
a coward to do it himself.

528
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,305
The one who did died by my hand.

529
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,870
You never told me.

530
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:59,548
Still, Arkad got what he deserved.

531
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,712
There are many more
as corrupt as he was.

532
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,483
And we will hunt them
until they are no more.

533
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,830
I would not like to be
the one who opposes you.

534
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,131
I have learned from the best, old friend.

535
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:25,168
I have not said this to you before,
and I should have.

536
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:34,207
You are the son I never had.

537
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,213
I could not be more proud.
