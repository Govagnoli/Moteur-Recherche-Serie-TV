1
00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:03,653
<i>Previously, on Stargate SG-1</i>

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:07,999
Gerak emerged as spokesperson for the more
traditional ways of the Jaffa High Council.

3
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:10,110
Which he could control.

4
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:11,369
<i>It's symbiote poison.</i>

5
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:17,042
<i>The trust launched at least two poison attacks against
Goa'uld occupied worlds, after we took back the Gate.</i>

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,286
<i>That means they had to leave
the relatively safe confines</i>

7
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:21,872
of the solar system and head out into the galaxy,

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,566
<i>where they ran the risk of being killed or...</i>

9
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:25,784
<i>captured.</i>

10
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:28,229
You think they have been taken
as hosts then sent back to Earth?

11
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,240
Any Goa'uld who got his hands on them
would have discovered pretty quickly,

12
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,409
<i>that they belong to a top secret organization</i>

13
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:38,314
<i>with high level connections to some of the most
powerful Governments and institutions on this planet.</i>

14
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:40,925
By now, the entire Trust could have been taken over.

15
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,435
Season 9 - Episode 7
Ex Deus Machina

16
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:23,606
The body was discovered this morning on a
remote road of interstate 77 in Virginia.

17
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:27,592
He was spotted by a passing motorist.
Local authorities say he's been dead about a day or so.

18
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:29,353
Probably the victim of a hit and run driver.

19
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:33,700
So what do we figure? This guy got lost
and he was hitching a ride back to Chu'lak?

20
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:36,203
His presence on Earth is a mystery to me.

21
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:37,757
He was found literally in the middle of nowhere

22
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:40,905
about three miles north of a little
town called Edison. Population 3012.

23
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,332
The symbol on his forehead indicates
that he was a servant of Lord Yu.

24
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,444
Many of whom now follow Gerak.

25
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:49,433
And Gerak might be able to shed some light on this.

26
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:51,663
I will speak to him.

27
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:52,581
Very well.

28
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:54,532
Colonel Mitchell, you're with Teal'c.

29
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:58,517
Dr Jackson, I want you to dig up all
the information you can on Edison, Virginia.

30
00:02:58,757 --> 00:03:01,108
Colonel Carter will join you
as soon as she's settled in.

31
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:10,034
Sam! Hey! Come on. Let me,
let me give you a hand.

32
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:11,030
Thank you.

33
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:15,772
So, General Landry briefed me on the
circumstances surrounding our mystery Jaffa.

34
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,446
Yeah, I think I got something on that.

35
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:21,272
Farrow-Marshall?

36
00:03:21,352 --> 00:03:23,265
Yeah. You're familiar with them?

37
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:27,129
They're an aeronautics firm headquartered in Bethesda.
The Department Of Defence is their biggest client.

38
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,963
Yeah, it turns out that their plant
in Virginia employed about

39
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:31,593
eight hundred residents at Edison, until
it closed down six months ago.

40
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:33,904
Now, it's located just outside the town, and about a...

41
00:03:34,103 --> 00:03:36,852
a mile and a half from where our dead Jaffa turned up.

42
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:38,088
Really?

43
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:41,395
Pardon the mess, I'm still unpacking.

44
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:45,500
Farrow-Marshall...

45
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:47,851
Let's see what they've been up to lately.

46
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,122
<i>Here we go.</i>

47
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,628
Their Chief Financial Officer
went missing yesterday morning.

48
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:54,765
Interesting timing.

49
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:55,621
Yeah.

50
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,766
According to his wife, he left for a business
meeting in Richmond, Virginia and never came back.

51
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,178
Make no mistake, brothers.

52
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:09,887
The Tok'ra only wish to meet
with us because they fear us.

53
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:14,051
We defeated the Goa'uld and
took their motherships and strongholds.

54
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:17,359
Now, we are our own masters.

55
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:22,957
I needn't remind the Council that the Tok'ra did
battle with the Goa'uld for just as many years.

56
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:26,146
Their efforts were instrumental
in securing our freedom.

57
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:27,739
Let us all be clear.

58
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:32,242
The only motivation that the Tok'ra have,
is their own selfish needs.

59
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:33,937
<i>Not to help any of us!</i>

60
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:36,307
Then what do you suggest, Gerak?

61
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:41,925
That we use our new found strength
to take what we want?

62
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,750
That we emulate our former oppressors?

63
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:50,493
Brothers and sisters.

64
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,561
We finally have the opportunity to govern

65
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,133
with authority, and respect!

66
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,239
Years ago, that seemed unthinkable.

67
00:04:59,518 --> 00:05:03,942
But now we are in a position to help others
who are in need of our support and guidance.

68
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,297
Why should we help them?

69
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,930
<i>How about because,</i>

70
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,923
<i>it's the right thing to do?</i>

71
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,422
Look, whatever your differences with
the Tok'ra in the past, it's time to move on.

72
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:17,012
Teal'c is right, you kicked ass,
you're sitting pretty.

73
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:18,366
Don't get hung up on...

74
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:22,392
Outsiders are not permitted to address the Council.

75
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,039
Never mind.

76
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:34,226
I caution you.

77
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,893
We have fought too long and too hard,
to entrust our future to the Tok'ra.

78
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:40,762
Or the Tau'ri, for that matter.

79
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:46,221
Brothers and sisters.
I suggest we bring this assembly to an end.

80
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:48,293
Let us consider what we've discussed

81
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:50,126
and reconvene in the morning.

82
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:52,277
Very well.

83
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:07,261
Gerak.

84
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:09,134
A word.

85
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:12,003
Teal'c,

86
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,833
welcome back to Dakara.

87
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,941
Your presence is sorely missed.

88
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:19,495
What...

89
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:23,002
draws you away from your Tau'ri home?

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,708
A Jaffa was discovered on Earth, dead.

91
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:28,620
Oh, strange.

92
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:31,569
But, what has that got to do with me?

93
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:35,474
He was a servant of Lord Yu's and
I assumed a follower of yours.

94
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,865
Well that may be, but,

95
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:39,977
I don't seem to recognise him.

96
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:45,475
Nor do I know what he is doing on Earth.

97
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:53,347
My obligation to the Council
requires my presence elsewhere.

98
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:55,399
I'm sure you understand.

99
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,263
He is lying to us.

100
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,355
No kidding.

101
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:29,011
It was about six months ago,
when he started acting strangely.

102
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:30,864
What do you mean, strangely?

103
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,136
Cold, distant.

104
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:34,451
You've gotta understand.

105
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:37,878
Alex has always been incredibly
focused when it comes to his job and

106
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,149
at first I just assumed
he had a lot on his plate,

107
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:43,855
but after a couple of weeks
it became clear that it was more than that.

108
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:46,884
I started to suspect
he might be having an affair.

109
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:52,383
So I hired a private investigator
and I had him followed.

110
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,770
And what did the investigator find out?

111
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:59,516
I'm not sure exactly, but

112
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:02,345
a couple of days after accepting the job, he quit,

113
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:06,032
returned all of my money and
strongly suggested that I drop the matter.

114
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:08,383
He didn't offer you any kind of explanation?

115
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:11,052
No.
But it was obvious he was scared.

116
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:15,635
He did some surveillance in his first two days.
These are the photos that he took.

117
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:19,182
He asked for them back after a couple of days,

118
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,529
well after he dropped the case, but I refused.

119
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:27,550
I offered them to the police, but they didn't think
that the photos were pertinent to their investigation.

120
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:29,981
My husband wasn't having an affair,

121
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:33,926
but he was clearly involved in something
that he wanted to keep secret.

122
00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:35,599
Do you mind if we hold onto these?

123
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:37,353
No, go ahead.

124
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,349
He still refuses to speak?

125
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:01,341
The prisoner is strong.

126
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:04,210
Then we must be stronger, Yat'yir.

127
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:13,215
It was through instruments like this
we were oppressed.

128
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:16,125
Then how appropriate would it be then,

129
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,153
for it to be used to serve our cause.

130
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:30,589
You will surrender your secrets.

131
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,024
Of that,

132
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,531
I am sure.

133
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:53,744
Colonel Carter?

134
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:56,493
Charlotte Mayfield. VP here at Farrow-Marshall.

135
00:09:56,573 --> 00:09:57,729
How can I help you?

136
00:09:57,928 --> 00:10:00,797
I wanted to ask you a few questions
about your plant in Virginia.

137
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:03,228
It was shut down six months ago.

138
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:04,463
Officially, yes.

139
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,897
But we went by to check it out

140
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:08,010
and it looked like it had been
cleaned out very recently.

141
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:10,261
I'm not sure where you're getting at.

142
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:13,528
Some of the residents of Edison
claim they saw trucks,

143
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,899
travelling to and from the plant,
a couple of nights ago.

144
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:17,573
They're mistaken.

145
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:20,323
So you're saying,
no one's been in the area for several months?

146
00:10:20,362 --> 00:10:22,116
Well, I can't speak for the locals,

147
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:25,184
but certainly, no one from Farrow-Marshall
would have any reason to go there.

148
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,296
How about Richmond?

149
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,599
Anyone from Farrow-Marshall have reason to go there?

150
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:37,576
According to his wife, Alex Jameson was on his way
to Richmond, Virginia when he went missing.

151
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:40,924
We've cooperated with the local authorities
on Mr Jameson's disappearance.

152
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:42,478
You may want to consult with them.

153
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:44,311
Who was Mr Jameson meeting with that day?

154
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,188
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:48,415
Company policy prevents me
from discussing that with you.

156
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:53,118
Your CFO is missing.

157
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:56,744
Now I would think that you would want to do
everything within your power to help find him.

158
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:57,741
Oh, I do.

159
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,690
As I said, we're cooperating with the authorities.

160
00:11:02,124 --> 00:11:04,236
Now if you'll excuse me, I think we're done here.

161
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,333
These gentlemen will show you out.

162
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:13,242
If you have any further questions,
feel free to fax them to the head office.

163
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:35,079
You can be sure that's not the end of it.

164
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:36,514
<i>Of course not.</i>

165
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,461
We've only just...

166
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,996
begun.

167
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:51,378
Now I coordinated with Kerry Johnson and the
CIA's investigation into the NID-Trust connection,

168
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,110
we've done a little digging and managed to put names

169
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,841
to some of the faces from the
photographs Sheila Jameson provided.

170
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,450
Steven Ballard. Chairman of the Stark Consortium.

171
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:01,639
This is Mesato Hiro, CEO of Far East Mercantile.

172
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:06,340
James Lowry and Tony Trand, President and
Chief financial officer, Aleraf Pharmaceuticals.

173
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:11,242
This one is Michael Northrup,
CEO founder of Hamill Technologies.

174
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,234
Now all the individuals we've
managed to identify so far are major

175
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:15,645
players in the areas of business and high finance.

176
00:12:15,665 --> 00:12:18,455
Very powerful, very influential
and in the case of these two,

177
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,129
very missing.

178
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:21,085
Missing?

179
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:24,790
Terence Evans and William Blalock.
Founding partners of Persian Media Enterprises.

180
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,564
They went missing about six months ago.

181
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:29,393
Coincidentally, around the same time
we managed to destroy the Osiris ship.

182
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:31,605
You see a possible Goa'uld connection here?

183
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,474
Well, we already know that sometime last year,
the Goa'uld successfully infiltrated the Trust.

184
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:37,462
And that the Trust has connections to
Government Agencies and Corporations worldwide.

185
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:39,853
There's a good chance we didn't get them all.
If that's the case,

186
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:41,327
Goa'uld are still on Earth

187
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:42,802
and they're gaining strength.

188
00:12:57,446 --> 00:12:59,598
Let me guess. They didn't know anything either.

189
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:04,221
As Gerak grows stronger, fewer Jaffa
risk defying him for fear of retribution.

190
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,747
We must leave Dakara and seek our answers elsewhere.

191
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:09,780
<i>The answers you seek are on Earth.</i>

192
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,260
What do you know of the Jaffa we discovered?

193
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:23,328
He lost his life trying to secure Gerak's prize.

194
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:24,922
Of what prize do you speak?

195
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,277
Ba'al.

196
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,027
Ba'al is on Earth?

197
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:33,968
That is where he sought refuge, immediately
following his defeat in the battle for Dakara.

198
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:36,039
He has been there ever since.

199
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,651
You're telling me a member of the Jaffa High Council
claims that Ba'al has been here on Earth

200
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:45,664
for the better part of the last nine months?

201
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:46,701
Yes Sir.

202
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,314
Is there any chance she may be right?

203
00:13:48,772 --> 00:13:51,880
My information suggests that Ba'al
has been hiding in the Arkeba System.

204
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,430
He has been sighted there as recently as a week ago.

205
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:59,312
So the Council member is either lying
or she's a victim of bad intelligence.

206
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:00,866
Not all bad, Sir.

207
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:03,735
They knew enough, to look for
Ba'al at a Trust operated facility.

208
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:06,405
If he were on Earth,
that would be the best place to start.

209
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:09,832
If the Jaffa genuinely believe Ba'al to be on Earth,
they will continue to search for him.

210
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:11,585
Well that's obviously unacceptable.

211
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:15,690
Tell the Council we've begun our own
investigation and if he's here, we'll find him.

212
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:18,757
It would not be in Gerak's best interests
to allow that to happen.

213
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:19,675
Why?

214
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:23,579
Ba'al's capture would be a big moral victory as well
as a huge political gain for whoever brings him in.

215
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:27,484
Should Gerak be successful, he would win
the hearts of many undecided Jaffa.

216
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:30,513
Thereby assuring undisputed influence over the Council.

217
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:32,964
So all we have to do is find Ba'al before they do.

218
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,717
Yeah, but Gerak has a head start.

219
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:39,021
The fact that the company CFO went missing
around the same time that the Jaffa was killed.

220
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:41,750
You think Jameson was at the plant
when they came looking for Ba'al?

221
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:43,903
In which case, he may well have been captured.

222
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:57,652
He has revealed Ba'al's location.

223
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:00,242
And the locations of his various shelters on Earth.

224
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,417
You should never have invented
such an effective means of torture.

225
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:31,682
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

226
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:36,105
Yes!

227
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:46,347
Where is the false God, Ba'al?

228
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,522
We've been compromised.

229
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:26,016
They're five floors above us.

230
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:28,009
I know. We're leaving.

231
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:39,245
Hello? C'mon hurry.
There's people here!
They're shooting up the all place!

232
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:44,827
So?

233
00:16:44,864 --> 00:16:47,892
Those offices were a war zone.
Staff weapons versus semi automatics.

234
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:48,769
Who won?

235
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:51,419
Hard to say. There was no bodies and
all the security footage was missing.

236
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,396
Witnesses?

237
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:56,380
One. Some guy who was working overtime.
Spent most of the firefight under his desk,

238
00:16:56,421 --> 00:16:58,772
but was able to provide a
description for three individuals.

239
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,964
Big, tattooed, chainmail pants.

240
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:04,151
So it's either our Jaffa, or Kiss is back on tour.

241
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,539
I have something to show you.
We've just received this.

242
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:16,604
Although it's a far cry from some of the
better world's I've conquered in my days,
this planet is not without it's charms.

243
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:17,839
That's?

244
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,513
<i>In retrospect, I'm actually glad</i>

245
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:21,545
<i>we never succeeded in destroying it.</i>

246
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:24,653
That said, Earth is not without it's drawbacks.

247
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:28,319
The foremost being, an alarming lack of privacy.

248
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,428
<i>My ships have been seized, my armies vanquished.</i>

249
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:34,177
<i>I no longer present a threat to this galaxy.</i>

250
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:37,086
All I ask is to be left alone,
without having to worry about you,

251
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:41,331
the Jaffa, or any of
my former enemies coming after me. So,

252
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:43,761
I'd like to offer the following deal.

253
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:49,220
<i>Allow me to live out the rest of my days
here on Earth in peace, without interference.</i>

254
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:54,679
In exchange for my freedom, I will follow your laws.

255
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:57,150
<i>You will never have cause to fear me again.</i>

256
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:00,876
<i>I hope we can put the past behind us.</i>

257
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:05,259
<i>I certainly have no desire to harm
you or anyone else on this world.</i>

258
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:11,636
That said, you should know that I've placed
a Naquadah bomb, somewhere in the United States.

259
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:16,178
<i>Consider it a precautionary measure.</i>

260
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:23,191
If another attempt is made to capture me,
I promise you the consequences, will me most dire.

261
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,365
Of all the retirement destinations he could choose,
he has to pick our planet?

262
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:47,100
We have teams outfitted with Naquadah detectors
in several major urban centers, but there's
no way we can cover the whole country.

263
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,227
The Prometheus has instruments which can
detect Naquadah from orbit, does it not?

264
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,659
Yes, but so far the scans have come up empty.

265
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:53,735
So it could be a bluff?

266
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:56,723
Or, Ba'al may have found a way to
shield the bomb from our sensors.

267
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:58,158
<i>Bluffing or not, he's still a threat.</i>

268
00:18:58,197 --> 00:19:02,103
As defacto head of the Trust operations, he has
the resources and capabilities to do a lot of damage.

269
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,059
Naquadah bomb or not.

270
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:08,140
So, problem number one, how do we find him.
Problem number two, how do we take him
out without inflicting collateral damage?

271
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:10,451
Good point. Ba'al is probably surrounded by security.

272
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:13,420
No doubt, most of them human, with no knowledge
of his true identity. If we go after him,

273
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:15,133
we risk injuring innocent people.

274
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:17,644
Not if we use the symbiote poison
the Tok'ra developed.

275
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:20,074
We already know it won't harm human physiology.

276
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:23,461
And with the right delivery system,
nothing but that. Nice.

277
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:25,493
I'll contact R and D, see what they can put together.

278
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:27,805
Which leaves us with problem number one.

279
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:31,552
The NID's running surveillance on the individuals
identified in the photograph's with Jameson.

280
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:33,544
Hopefully, eventually,
one of them will lead us to Ba'al.

281
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:35,815
Of equal concern, are Gerak's Jaffa.

282
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,569
We have no control over them.

283
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:41,712
If they decide to move on Ba'al,
Earth will face Ba'al's full reprisal.

284
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:43,267
And I'm guessing,

285
00:19:43,426 --> 00:19:46,773
those Jaffa aren't exactly kicking
it back at the local Denny's. Plus, isn't it a

286
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,483
long, stinky ride from Dakara, in a cargo ship?

287
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,400
Indeed.

288
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,624
It is more likely that Gerak has a
mothership, somewhere in the vicinity of Earth.

289
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:59,804
Well if the Prometheus was going to detect the
naquedah from orbit, it would have done it by now.

290
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:03,032
Alright.
I'll send them out to look for the mothership.

291
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:05,283
Colonel Mitchell? I want you and Teal'c onboard.

292
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:08,750
Colonel Carter, Dr Jackson,
you coordinate with the NID.

293
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:12,396
In the event they locate Ba'al, I want you there.

294
00:20:18,573 --> 00:20:19,768
Hey! Wait up!

295
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:46,267
Alright. That's better.

296
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,511
Gentlemen, welcome aboard.

297
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,234
Thank you Sir. Any word from NORAD?

298
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:04,838
SSN came up empty.

299
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:06,590
Could the ship we're looking for be cloaked?

300
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,941
Motherships do not possess cloaking capabilities.

301
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:11,452
Well then, could we be looking
for another type of craft?

302
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:12,448
It is possible.

303
00:21:13,444 --> 00:21:16,154
Whatever the target ship.
If it's out there, we'll find it.

304
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:26,754
Agent Barrett! Thanks for the lift.

305
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:30,061
Well, I couldn't exactly have you guys catching
a cab to the stake-out now, could I?

306
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:31,356
So what's the latest?

307
00:21:31,396 --> 00:21:33,428
<i>Well, one of our agents following the Jameson lead,</i>

308
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:37,254
spotted an individual matching Ba'al's description
at the Gilroy Hotel on Fifth Street,

309
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:38,370
about an hour ago.

310
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:41,757
Looks like we got him.

311
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,567
Picking up anything at all?

312
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:52,287
Unusual variances?
Anomalous energy readings?

313
00:21:52,297 --> 00:21:53,094
No Sir.

314
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,179
You know, it's possible what we're
looking for, isn't even out there.

315
00:21:57,218 --> 00:21:59,051
It is possible, but unlikely.

316
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:00,984
If Gerak believed Ba'al to be on Earth,

317
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:04,571
he would undoubtedly establish
a base of operations in planetary orbit.

318
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,563
Great, so where is it?

319
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,692
Hiding in plain sight.

320
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:16,127
<i>What was that?</i>

321
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:18,238
Right.

322
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:23,299
Colonel Pendergast.
Plot a course for the far side of the moon.

323
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:25,093
Do it.

324
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:39,838
What's the situation?

325
00:22:40,036 --> 00:22:42,547
They're still inside. In 1602.

326
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:44,818
All the exits are covered,
we're just waiting for the green light.

327
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:46,332
Dr Jackson, you go with Williams.

328
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:01,753
How've you been?

329
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,746
Pretty good. You?

330
00:23:03,786 --> 00:23:05,977
Yeah, pretty good. Can't complain.

331
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:10,122
What's new?

332
00:23:12,114 --> 00:23:15,502
Let's see. I was leading R and D for a while there.

333
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:19,287
Well, I never figured you the type
to settle for a desk job.

334
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:21,677
I needed something with more flexible hours.

335
00:23:21,718 --> 00:23:24,268
Janet's adopted daughter, Cassie,
was going through a hard time.

336
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:25,104
Oh, I see.

337
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:28,252
I spent some time on the Prometheus,
away on deep space reconnaissance.

338
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:32,636
Helped stop a dangerous new enemy
from getting a foothold in the galaxy.

339
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:34,708
Yes. Yeah, I heard about that.

340
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:38,295
How's Pete?

341
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:41,503
We broke up.

342
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,093
Really?

343
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:47,678
I mean sorry to hear that.

344
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:49,671
Oh, it's the best thing for both of us.

345
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:52,859
So you're single again?

346
00:23:54,254 --> 00:23:55,450
Not exactly.

347
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:08,798
Sir, I'm picking up a large energy signature.

348
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:16,370
- Lock on target.
- Target locked.

349
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:19,160
Sir, we're receiving a communication
from the mothership.

350
00:24:20,555 --> 00:24:21,550
Let's see it.

351
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:29,720
Withdraw! Or we will be forced to defend ourselves.

352
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,111
Sorry, we're not going anywhere.

353
00:24:46,656 --> 00:24:48,090
Come on, where are they?

354
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:50,202
<i>Abort. All agents, abort!</i>

355
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:52,194
What's going on?

356
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:56,019
<i>He's not inside. If we move now,
we risk compromising the operation.</i>

357
00:25:13,056 --> 00:25:14,748
Barrett, you'd better be damn sure about this.

358
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:17,340
<i>We're sure. Let them go and come to the van.</i>

359
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:25,508
Sam?

360
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:26,703
It wasn't him.

361
00:25:26,903 --> 00:25:27,660
How do you know?

362
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:29,892
Because he can't be in two places at once.

363
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:33,877
Ba'al is across town right now, doing
a live television interview.

364
00:25:34,177 --> 00:25:34,672
What?

365
00:25:34,712 --> 00:25:36,267
<i>Thank you. That's a very good question.</i>

366
00:25:36,606 --> 00:25:41,826
My acquisition of Hammel Technologies and
it's subsidiaries is just a first step...

367
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:45,931
<i>in a long range venture that
will ultimately see a consolidation...</i>

368
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:50,274
and a streamlining of what is
presently a dissolute market.

369
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:53,541
No doubts, most of you have never
heard of me before today. Well,

370
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:58,204
I can assure you that over the next few months,
you will all get to know me very well...

371
00:25:58,244 --> 00:26:00,874
<i>and I look forward to it.</i>

372
00:26:08,923 --> 00:26:13,307
This is Colonel Pendergast of the Earth ship
Prometheus, asking you to stand down.

373
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:18,407
We have no desire to engage in battle,
but we will not withdraw our forces.

374
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:21,117
Look, we know why you're here.

375
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:25,540
Then you also know that I have no choice,
but to maintain my present position.

376
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,600
OK, FYI, we're not going to let you put
anymore men on the planet's surface.

377
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,828
If you fire on our ship, we will defend ourselves.

378
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:36,298
<i>Yat'yir, hear me.</i>

379
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:39,267
You and your Jaffa are at a disadvantage.

380
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,898
Knowing neither territory, nor it's inhabitants.

381
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:44,687
Allow us to assist you in apprehending Ba'al.

382
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:47,078
We can both lay claim to his capture.

383
00:26:47,277 --> 00:26:50,664
Then all Jaffa can declare freedom
and celebrate as one.

384
00:26:50,704 --> 00:26:55,048
I am afraid we are past the point where are
differences can be settled so readily.

385
00:26:56,044 --> 00:26:57,239
I am sorry Teal'c.

386
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,810
Meanwhile, they've still got boots on the ground.

387
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,245
Nothing we can do about that.

388
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:08,995
Perhaps we can.

389
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,625
Can how?

390
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,957
By forcing Gerak's hand.

391
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:23,242
Yes Sir.

392
00:27:24,237 --> 00:27:26,629
Our orders are to stay put for the time being.

393
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:27,843
You've gotta be kidding me?

394
00:27:27,883 --> 00:27:29,517
Come on, we know where he is, we've got him.

395
00:27:29,557 --> 00:27:32,286
Yes, Ba'al has made it easier
for us to pinpoint his location,

396
00:27:32,326 --> 00:27:37,028
but unfortunately, by going public, he's made it more
difficult for us to take him down quickly and covertly.

397
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:40,216
We make a move against him now
and we risk a media circus.

398
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:43,862
Unless of course you feel like giving
the American people a Stargate primary.

399
00:27:43,902 --> 00:27:47,688
There's also the little matter of a Naquadah bomb
sitting somewhere in the continental United States.

400
00:27:47,728 --> 00:27:51,434
Yeah, OK. OK, we'll stay.

401
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:54,900
The General's consulting with the Pentagon,
to determine what our next move should be.

402
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,316
If there is one thing a Jaffa values
above all else, it is his pride.

403
00:28:01,356 --> 00:28:06,736
When the other Council members discover that
Gerak has not been completely forthcoming, they
will turn against him and force his hand.

404
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:10,322
Gerak must be shamed into removing
his forces from Earth. It is the only way.

405
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,553
Your turf, your rules, brother.

406
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:18,172
No matter how far we must travel.
No matter how long it will take,

407
00:28:19,607 --> 00:28:25,663
our former enemies must pay for their crimes.
This I promise you and we will destroy them.

408
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:33,314
Not only just in memory of those who have fallen, but
in honour of those who survived to enjoy their freedom.

409
00:28:33,354 --> 00:28:35,904
You speak of honour, Gerak.

410
00:28:36,144 --> 00:28:39,849
Yet you disrespect this Council
by dishonouring it with your lies.

411
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:45,667
I have not lied to this Council.
It is you that I have purposely misled.

412
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:49,533
For fear, that your commitment to the cause is suspect.

413
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:53,716
Even as we speak, Gerak's followers
are hunting Ba'al, on Earth.

414
00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:55,271
Of this we are well aware.

415
00:28:55,868 --> 00:29:02,045
I had wished to inform the Council sooner, but I dared
not, for fear that elements sympathetic to the Tau'ri

416
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:04,077
would learn about Ba'al's whereabouts.

417
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:06,748
You dare question my loyalty!

418
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,940
<i>Your loyalty is not under question, Teal'c.</i>

419
00:29:09,418 --> 00:29:14,479
You have done more than anyone to help secure our
freedom, and for that we are ever grateful. However,

420
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:18,862
your allegiance to the Tau'ri
presents you with a difficult dilemma.

421
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:24,043
Even as we speak, the Tau'ri ships
prevent us from pursuing the enemy.

422
00:29:27,908 --> 00:29:30,219
As you have said Ka'lel,

423
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:34,722
I accomplished much in our long struggle
against our former oppressors.

424
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:36,953
But only because of the
support of the Tau'ri.

425
00:29:38,188 --> 00:29:41,416
Their commitment was as unwavering as my own,

426
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:44,684
and now you would repay them by
surreptisiously stealing upon their world.

427
00:29:44,924 --> 00:29:48,471
Putting their people, to say nothing
of the Stargate program, at risk!

428
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,211
They are our allies.

429
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:58,790
Rather than dishonour them by trespassing onto their
world, respect them enough to tell them the truth!

430
00:29:59,428 --> 00:30:03,373
Ask for their assistance in capturing Ba'al!
They will help us!

431
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:05,803
But... will they?

432
00:30:06,043 --> 00:30:09,430
They are as determined to have Ba'al
answer for his crimes, as are we.

433
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,901
But if they succeed...

434
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:15,965
Then he will be brought before this Council,
where he will face his proper punishment!

435
00:30:16,005 --> 00:30:18,237
You have my word!

436
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,877
What the hell are you thinking? There's no guarantee
that the US government is going to give them Ba'al.

437
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:33,221
It was only to give Gerak pause before
his next attack against Ba'al on Earth.

438
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:37,763
Even so, we may have only gained a brief respite.

439
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:50,276
Satellite tracking has placed Ba'al on a remote
heavily guarded compound, west of the city.

440
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:52,387
From the site of the press conference,

441
00:30:52,627 --> 00:30:58,844
directly to his present location, he took no evasive
maneuvers, made absolutely no attempt to
disguise his movements.

442
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:05,360
Clearly, he is emboldened by the belief that you
would not dare attack him, now that he has made
himself a public figure.

443
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:09,065
I've had Walter patch in
Colonel Carter and Doctor Jackson.

444
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:11,137
Everybody up to date?

445
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:15,082
We have a cruise missile prepped with symbiote
poison and ready to launch on your command.

446
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:18,470
General, I recommend we launch now.
It may be the last chance we get.

447
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,382
What if he isn't bluffing about the Naquadah bomb?

448
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,892
Then we'll have stopped him before
he has a chance to plant any more.

449
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:25,323
We'll have to come up with a cover story.

450
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:27,276
Wouldn't be the first time.

451
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:31,978
We must strike now, before Ba'al realises
his strategy has backfired.

452
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,532
And the Council?

453
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:37,437
I merely promised he would be delivered if captured.

454
00:31:37,477 --> 00:31:40,346
If he is killed, then there is no difficulty.

455
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:56,205
Right, good work.

456
00:31:58,117 --> 00:31:59,313
What's the news?

457
00:31:59,632 --> 00:32:01,823
Stargate Command intends to attack.

458
00:32:02,301 --> 00:32:03,736
How can you be certain?

459
00:32:03,776 --> 00:32:11,626
The humans that set up the Trust were in a
position to infiltrate much of the secure
communications network employed by this government.

460
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:14,774
How clever of them.

461
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:20,631
Have you got something else for me, Walter?

462
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,262
Yes Sir. We just got this sent to us.

463
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,092
You have chosen not to heed my warning.

464
00:32:26,131 --> 00:32:27,645
Sort of forced my hand.

465
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:31,436
There is a bomb in the Helsian tower
in downtown Seattle.

466
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:35,236
It will detonate at exactly 1:30pm, local time.

467
00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:40,376
Call off your strike at my location
and I will diffuse the device.

468
00:32:40,576 --> 00:32:46,155
Defy me and this will be just the first
of many such demonstrations.

469
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,403
45 minutes.

470
00:32:49,443 --> 00:32:53,428
The building's being evacuated.
Mobile units have been dispatched.

471
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:01,397
Yes Sir. Understood, Sir.

472
00:33:01,556 --> 00:33:05,900
Agent Barrett, have your men tighten the
perimeter around the compound. No one in or out.

473
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,088
Daniel, once the missile hits, you'll have to
go in and make sure we have a confirmed kill.

474
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:10,523
Why, where are you going to be?

475
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:11,758
Seattle.

476
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:13,232
How the hell you gonna get there?

477
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:17,855
Prometheus.

478
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,365
Beats, flying coach.

479
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,796
Colonel Carter.

480
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:44,912
Have you located the bomb?

481
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,423
We're unable to get a fix on it's location.

482
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:51,229
Multiple signals. Is it possible
there's more than one device?

483
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:52,942
Well, we're not sure.

484
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:08,642
Wipe the hard drives
and destroy the equipment. I want nothing left.

485
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:10,635
The Jaffa, they've found us.

486
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:12,228
Time to go.

487
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:20,756
Colonel Carter and her team are still searching.
No sign of the bomb, yet.

488
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:28,048
Sir, Dr Jackson reports Jaffa at the target site.
They've engaged the compound guards.

489
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,831
You must not hesitate General Landry.

490
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:37,811
Launch the missile.

491
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,685
Yes Sir.

492
00:34:39,764 --> 00:34:41,279
Launching Alpha Two.

493
00:34:50,683 --> 00:34:53,472
It doesn't make any sense.
It's like there's Naquadah everywhere.

494
00:34:54,947 --> 00:34:56,660
How old is this building?

495
00:34:56,939 --> 00:34:59,011
It's brand new. It just went up last month.

496
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:01,841
Give me a secure line to Stargate Command, now.

497
00:35:05,587 --> 00:35:07,221
Sir, we've got Colonel Carter.

498
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,774
Colonel, did you find the bomb?

499
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:09,790
<i>Sort of.</i>

500
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:10,946
What's that supposed to mean?

501
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:14,413
Readings indicate, the entire superstructure
of the building is laced with Naquadah.

502
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,182
It was built that way.
Ba'al's been planning this for a long time.

503
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:19,314
I'm not sure I understand, Colonel.

504
00:35:19,354 --> 00:35:22,183
The bomb isn't in the building, Sir.

505
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:25,092
The bomb is the building.

506
00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:27,987
Missile is locked on.

507
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,056
Sir, we have a confirmed hit on the location.

508
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:34,962
Agent Barrett and his team
are moving in to secure the area.

509
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:48,670
Sam! That Naquadah ain't gonna go off on it's own.
There's gotta be a detonator there.

510
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:53,532
I agree, but it could be anywhere. Inside a
wall, under a floor. We'd never find it in time.

511
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:55,923
How much progress have you made on the evacuation?

512
00:35:55,963 --> 00:36:00,466
We've cleared a five block radius, but when this thing
goes off, a five mile radius isn't gonna be enough.

513
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:02,259
<i>There's not much you can do about that now.</i>

514
00:36:02,299 --> 00:36:05,447
I'll contact Prometheus, have them
beam you and your team outta there.

515
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:08,475
Wait, that's it. Prometheus. Sergeant!

516
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:09,671
Sir.

517
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:12,780
Patch me through to Colonel Pendergast.

518
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,004
Cam, what can I do for ya?

519
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,235
I need a little help moving.

520
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:52,309
<i>It worked. The building detonated at a safe distance.</i>

521
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:54,342
Sir, I've got Doctor Jackson.

522
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:55,019
<i>General?</i>

523
00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:56,254
What's happening out there, Doctor?

524
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,920
<i>I'm sorry to report Sir, it looks like Ba'al escaped.</i>

525
00:37:11,077 --> 00:37:17,414
The old ways will no longer serve us.
Gerak's ways are not the ways of the future.

526
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:27,217
How dare you?

527
00:37:27,814 --> 00:37:30,883
How dare you step foot in this Council chamber?

528
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:34,748
Why should I pause to return?
Tell me Teal'c?

529
00:37:34,788 --> 00:37:36,741
Because you disregarded my warnings.

530
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:41,682
Because your rash actions, not only allowed Ba'al
to escape, but cost the lives of many of our brothers!

531
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:44,511
They did not die in vain.

532
00:37:56,545 --> 00:37:59,494
My rash actions were neccessary.
I'm sure you'll agree.

533
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:03,678
Yes, you may muse about what might have been.

534
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:06,946
But the fact remains, it was my men who captured Ba'al.

535
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:11,728
Enjoy your shortlived taste of freedom.

536
00:38:12,803 --> 00:38:17,745
You were born slaves and slaves you will die!

537
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:43,327
Ba'al did not escape.
He was captured by Gerak's forces.

538
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,714
Well yes and no.

539
00:38:46,753 --> 00:38:51,137
He was dragged into the Council chamber and
executed before my very eyes. There is no doubt.

540
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:54,923
Teal'c. We secured Ba'al's compound
and searched the premises.

541
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:59,306
In the basement, we discovered a lab containing
equipment and data related to genetic replication.

542
00:38:59,346 --> 00:39:03,569
It's very possible the Ba'al you saw
die in Dakara, was just a clone.

543
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,678
The real Ba'al could still be out there.

544
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,655
Where you going?

545
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,763
To take a much needed rest.

546
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:18,155
Don't you think you should go back to Dakara?

547
00:39:18,194 --> 00:39:20,147
Let those Jaffa know the truth?

548
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,099
No.

549
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:28,594
To reveal this at this time would seem little more
than an attempt to tarnish Gerak's hard fought victory.

550
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:29,750
Teal'c.

551
00:39:30,946 --> 00:39:32,021
It's the truth.

552
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,731
Regardless. They will not listen.

553
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:38,358
For the time being, their hearts belong to Gerak.

554
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:54,575
<i>At present, there are more questions
than answers in the events surrounding</i>

555
00:39:54,616 --> 00:39:58,322
<i>the gas line explosion that claimed
the Helsian Tower in downtown Seattle.</i>

556
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:06,490
<i>What we do know so far is that at approximately
12:45 this afternoon, local fire and emergency
crews were dispatched to the scene.</i>

557
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:11,272
<i>An evacuation order was given and
the building and surrounding areas were evacuated.</i>

558
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:17,647
<i>Two hours later, when reporters
were permitted to return to the area,
all that remained was a heap of rubble.</i>

559
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:20,876
<i>Surrounded as it was by taller highrises,</i>

560
00:40:20,915 --> 00:40:23,864
there were no eyewitnesses
to the building's destruction.

561
00:40:24,003 --> 00:40:29,343
<i>No one saw or heard the explosion and
as a result, conspiracy theories abound.</i>

562
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:33,687
<i>Some have pointed out that the amount of
rubble at the site is significantly less than...</i>

563
00:40:34,405 --> 00:40:38,231
Over six hundred channels and nothing to watch.

564
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:45,743
Think I'll turn in.

565
00:40:46,141 --> 00:40:48,491
We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
