1
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:12,085
The System Lords are no longer.

2
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:17,842
You have become a meaningless coalition
that cannot resist the power of my master,

3
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:19,916
Lord Baal.

4
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:32,396
Your master has no honour. The System
Lords have not weakened in their resolve.

5
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:35,477
The Jaffa are weak-willed and fallible.

6
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:39,035
Is it any wonder they've begun
to doubt their faith in the gods?

7
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,922
So many Goa'uld have fallen.

8
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:43,838
Baal was wise to send a representative.

9
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:46,155
I would have killed him
with my own hands.

10
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:52,195
Despite your ill will, Lord Baal wishes
to extend a most generous offer.

11
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:56,278
In exchange for your surrender,
Baal will allow you to keep your armies

12
00:00:56,365 --> 00:01:00,643
and continue to administrate
your territories under his authority.

13
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:04,604
You will be permitted to live
so long as you bow before him

14
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:08,997
as the supreme commander
of the entire Goa'uld domain.

15
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:15,078
Refusal to accept the terms of this offer
will result in the resumption of hostilities

16
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:17,918
and, ultimately, your death.

17
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:24,876
Bring her.

18
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:30,201
- What is the meaning of this?
- I should ask you the same thing.

19
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:40,960
Major Samantha Carter.

20
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:46,362
Actually, I'm a colonel now.

21
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:53,199
Her cargo ship was intercepted
by my sentries

22
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:56,834
when it violated the proximity zone
around this station.

23
00:01:56,925 --> 00:02:01,282
I am well aware of your past relationship
with SG-1 and the Tauri.

24
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:05,358
Would you have me believe that her
sudden appearance is mere coincidence?

25
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,644
What are you doing here?

26
00:03:43,165 --> 00:03:46,043
- They are late.
- Or they're not coming.

27
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,515
- In that case Rak'nor would've sent word.
- If he were able to do so.

28
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,073
Maybe we should reconsider the mission.

29
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,395
This is not an SGC mission.

30
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,238
Reconsidering is not an option.

31
00:03:57,325 --> 00:04:00,522
I know the timing of these
surprise attacks is crucial...

32
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:03,324
And we're just here as observers, but...

33
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:08,399
if you take on one of Amaterasu's
motherships without proper backup,

34
00:04:08,485 --> 00:04:11,522
- you could get yourself killed.
- Us observers, too.

35
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:15,393
Many attacks have been coordinated
simultaneously across the galaxy,

36
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:19,637
each designed to create a weakness
in the forces of the System Lords.

37
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,283
And if even one fails... I know.

38
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:26,120
The rebel Jaffa have the security codes
currently used by the System Lords.

39
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:29,277
They will believe we're allies
and lower the shields.

40
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:30,923
If all goes according to plan.

41
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:37,797
The Jaffa aboard this vessel should be
sufficient to overwhelm any resistance.

42
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:42,436
We have allies among Amaterasu's Jaffa
who will also help facilitate our attacks.

43
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:45,722
Once the others witness
the death of their false god,

44
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:48,717
they will realise the truth
and join our ranks.

45
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:53,595
Isn't the fact that we haven't heard
from Rak'nor a bad sign?

46
00:04:58,845 --> 00:04:59,834
What is it?

47
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:04,953
The ship's sensors have detected a vessel
closing in on our position. Ha'tak class.

48
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:09,004
- Rak'nor?
- Unlikely. Rak'nor would have hailed.

49
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:11,918
Then it has to be Amaterasu.

50
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:14,394
Shouldn't we get out of here?

51
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,037
Teal'c, the odds are not in our favour.

52
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,514
They never are, Daniel Jackson.

53
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:29,078
I am hailing them
and transmitting the security codes.

54
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:33,036
They fired on us.

55
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:37,557
- Shield strength is down 60%.
- How is that possible?

56
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:40,443
What the hell did they hit us with?

57
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:43,636
Returning fire.

58
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,360
Our weapons are ineffective.

59
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:56,238
- We have lost shields.
- Now can we get out of here?

60
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:59,681
Navigational controls are not responding.

61
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:02,154
- We must evacuate.
- Glider bay?

62
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:07,874
The rings can transport us to the planet
below. We'll escape through the Stargate.

63
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,160
What is it?

64
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:25,962
- That's not good.
- This way.

65
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:46,837
Daniel!

66
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:49,397
Colonel Carter.

67
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:00,954
Jacob!

68
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,878
Jack, we got a problem. We need to talk.

69
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:08,800
Hi. Hello. How are you? Long time no see.
What's doin'? What's up? Hey, buddy.

70
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:11,160
I'm sorry, Jack. It's good to see you again.

71
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:13,884
Congratulations on your promotion.

72
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:15,762
- Thanks.
- You deserve it.

73
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:18,040
Yes, well...

74
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,116
- What's up?
- The replicators.

75
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:22,844
They've launched an all-out attack
on the Goa'uld.

76
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:28,397
If the Goa'uld can't stop them,
they'll overrun our galaxy within weeks.

77
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:32,116
Why didn't you say so?

78
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:38,756
I'm sorry. You said we had a problem,
not a big galactic emergency.

79
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:51,402
Our operatives have spent years tagging
as many Goa'uld ships as possible

80
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:53,680
in an effort to track their movements.

81
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,723
Today we have beacons
on more than 100 motherships,

82
00:07:56,805 --> 00:08:02,323
transmitting their location via subspace
to an encoded Tok'ra network.

83
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:03,804
And this?

84
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:07,400
It's a receiver that will allow me
to tap into the subspace network.

85
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:12,161
We can keep tabs on Baal's fleet, see how
their battle with the replicators is faring,

86
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:15,760
and get Tok'ra intelligence reports
from our agents in the field.

87
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:18,678
We could have used something
like this a long time ago.

88
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:22,121
The High Council never thought
they could trust you with it.

89
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:25,355
- What changed their mind?
- Nothing.

90
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,276
- They don't know I took it.
- Ah.

91
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:31,561
My relationship with the Council
is still a little strained.

92
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:35,001
It's not gonna get any better
if you keep stealin' stuff.

93
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:39,875
No complaints. I'll take anything I can get.
Weapons, receivers... silverware.

94
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,323
- Each dot represents a Goa'uld ship.
- That's a lot of dots.

95
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:53,080
That's just one small quadrant
of the galaxy. Watch.

96
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:13,473
- What just happened?
- The beacons stopped transmitting.

97
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:17,524
Those ships were either destroyed
or taken over by the replicators.

98
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:21,917
Battles like the one you just witnessed
are taking place across the galaxy.

99
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:27,033
Several Goa'uld territories
are now entirely in replicator hands.

100
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:33,636
As I said, given the progress
of these battles,

101
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:37,798
the Goa'uld will be wiped out
in a matter of weeks.

102
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,523
You know, I have to admit...
I have some mixed feelings about this.

103
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:47,757
We all want to see the Goa'uld
stranglehold on the galaxy broken.

104
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:51,076
But not if they're just gonna
be replaced by something worse.

105
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:54,601
Unscheduled offworld activation!

106
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:08,882
Dad!

107
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:11,479
Hey, kiddo.

108
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:15,558
So... what the heck happened?

109
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:17,840
Didn't you guys have a ship?

110
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:26,283
And, by the way... where's Daniel?

111
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:32,395
- He was beamed away before our eyes.
- By replicators.

112
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:37,115
- Just Daniel?
- I can see only one reason: my duplicate.

113
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:39,355
The greatest threat to the replicators

114
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:42,357
is the disrupter you built
using Ancient knowledge.

115
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:45,005
So? She's immune to that now.

116
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:49,078
Yes, but replicators always seek out
the most advanced technology.

117
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:53,636
She may be worried there's other Ancient
technology that threatens the replicators.

118
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:57,115
Daniel Jackson had access to
such knowledge when he was ascended.

119
00:10:57,205 --> 00:11:00,003
- I thought he didn't retain it.
- We don't know for sure.

120
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:03,395
Daniel has remembered things
from when he was ascended.

121
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:07,717
She may think that all she needs to know
about the Ancients is in his subconscious.

122
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:09,682
If it is, she'll find it.

123
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:11,357
Oy.

124
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:21,284
The Tok'ra have operatives
in Baal's inner circle,

125
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:24,038
including one of his
high-ranking lieutenants.

126
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,241
According to the latest intelligence,

127
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:31,524
the Jaffa rebels are re-pledging their
loyalty to the Goa'uld by the thousands.

128
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:33,482
But the Goa'uld are losing the war.

129
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:36,204
Yeah. You'd think
that'd make 'em look weaker.

130
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:39,243
The Jaffa have never seen
the likes of such creatures.

131
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:42,476
Many could see these replicators
as a plague,

132
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:47,195
an evil punishment to all for daring to
stray in their beliefs and betray their gods.

133
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:50,755
This situation has dealt
the Jaffa rebellion a serious blow.

134
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:55,077
Even if we were to somehow defeat the
replicators, the Goa'uld would take credit,

135
00:11:55,165 --> 00:12:01,115
thereby solidifying Jaffa loyalty as well as
their belief in the Goa'uld as gods.

136
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:05,039
I think the key phrase in there was
"somehow defeat the replicators".

137
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,879
We haven't had much luck. The inert
replicator cells left by my duplicate

138
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:12,640
haven't given any clues as to how
to fight the immunity she's developed.

139
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:18,402
As far as I know, Thor hasn't made much
progress in modifying the disrupter either.

140
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:21,045
Well, let him know what's going on.

141
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:26,074
And remind him that we've saved
his cute little grey bum several times.

142
00:12:31,605 --> 00:12:36,679
Years of effort,
all but undone in a matter of days.

143
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:40,724
It will be almost impossible to turn so
many of our brothers back to our cause.

144
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:43,000
Perhaps. Yet there may be a way.

145
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:47,920
Even if we can, will it make a difference?

146
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:50,394
These machines are unlike
anything I've seen.

147
00:12:50,485 --> 00:12:52,919
We must believe that
Colonel Carter and Thor

148
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,599
will devise a means
to destroy the replicators.

149
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:58,518
How, then, can we prevent
the Goa'uld from taking credit,

150
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:01,597
solidifying their position
as gods in the eyes of all Jaffa?

151
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:06,042
We must act now,
before this conflict is resolved.

152
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,879
Win back the hearts and minds of those
who waver before they are lost to us.

153
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:13,674
We must once and for all destroy
the Goa'uld's image as gods forever.

154
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:15,676
How?

155
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:18,040
By capturing the temple at Dakara.

156
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:25,354
Everything we have fought for
hangs in the balance.

157
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:27,436
Yes.

158
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:29,800
- But Dakara...
- Capture it,

159
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:33,514
and never again will a Jaffa
worship a false god.

160
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:39,001
Sir.

161
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,076
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

162
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:43,633
I'm only gonna say this once, Carter.

163
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:46,637
What happened to Daniel
was not your fault.

164
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:50,035
She knows he may hold
key Ancient knowledge because of me.

165
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,561
She's out there because of me.
I gave her the means to counter

166
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:55,715
our only effective weapon against her.

167
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:59,434
I also gave you permission
to work with her.

168
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:02,722
It's not gonna change anything.

169
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:11,042
Unless you're suggesting we use
that time machine to go back and fix it.

170
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:17,081
No, sir. We all agreed we would never
do that. It could make things worse.

171
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:21,161
Sir, we're receiving a message from Thor.

172
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,440
He said he's ready to transport...

173
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:29,364
You were saying?

174
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:31,242
Never mind.

175
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,685
Hello again, Samantha Carter.

176
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:41,754
Hi, Thor.

177
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:43,961
I have transported your research

178
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:47,481
and the remains of the human-form
replicator to this lab.

179
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:50,443
We may continue our work from here.

180
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:52,362
Any progress on your end?

181
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:56,120
I have yet to isolate the cipher
the human-form replicator introduced

182
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:58,514
to render the disrupter weapon ineffective.

183
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:02,041
Given the situation, I think
it's time to take more drastic steps.

184
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:06,004
You are suggesting we attempt
to trigger a subspace connection

185
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:09,202
between the remains of the arm
and the rest of the replicators

186
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:12,675
so that we may search for the cipher
among their communications data.

187
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:17,236
- Too wild and crazy?
- To do that, we must reactivate the cells.

188
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:19,520
I know.

189
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,201
What makes this place so special?

190
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:27,719
The temple at Dakara
is sacred to all Jaffa.

191
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:30,194
It is rich in historical significance.

192
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:33,322
Legend tells it is the place
where Anubis rose from the dead.

193
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:35,760
It is also the site of the first prim'ta ritual.

194
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:39,838
It is that rite of passage that has
bonded us in servitude ever since.

195
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:44,123
For thousands of years the Jaffa have
viewed Dakara as the holiest of sites,

196
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:46,400
the very cradle of our existence.

197
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:51,161
It is the place where the Goa'uld first
gave Jaffa their strength and longevity.

198
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:54,396
And you really think this place
is gonna make a difference?

199
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:56,362
Seizing control of the temple

200
00:15:56,445 --> 00:16:00,279
would prove the Goa'uld do not possess
the power of the gods.

201
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:04,643
Even the most stubborn Jaffa would have
to question his loyalty to the Goa'uld.

202
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:11,284
There has to be a catch, or you guys
would have done this a long time ago.

203
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:13,879
Dakara is deep within Baal's territory,

204
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:16,798
and under normal circumstances
it is heavily guarded.

205
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:21,515
However, with Baal's forces throughout
the galaxy battling the replicators,

206
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,517
the temple is more vulnerable now
than it has ever been.

207
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:27,165
Our success depends
on the element of surprise

208
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:29,554
and the use of the entire rebel fleet.

209
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:33,638
Listen to me, O'Neill.
This war must be fought on two fronts.

210
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:37,354
We will re-ignite the uprising
and conquer our oppressors,

211
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:40,915
while you find the means
to stop these replicators.

212
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:44,602
Let us each fight
the enemy we know best.

213
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:12,757
Hello, Daniel.

214
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:17,516
What the hell do you want?

215
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:20,403
You have information that I need.

216
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:27,159
OK. What do you want to know?

217
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:32,638
- I'm afraid it's not that simple.
- No, it is that simple.

218
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:37,321
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not
do the hand-on-the-head thing.

219
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:41,603
- Honestly, I'll tell you whatever you want.
- Honesty is not the problem.

220
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:51,278
Unfortunately, to get what I need,
we're going to have to dig a little deeper.

221
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:58,436
Shall we begin?

222
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:09,594
What you are proposing is madness.

223
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:11,676
Dakara cannot be taken.

224
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:21,523
Tolok, you have not spoken.

225
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:28,435
Aron's right.

226
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:32,996
We would be sacrificing countless men
and ships on a fruitless mission.

227
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:37,476
We should be concentrating
on the greater threat, the replicators,

228
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:39,237
before they destroy us all.

229
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:41,759
Jaffa, hear me.

230
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:46,157
I have engaged the replicators
in battle many times.

231
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:49,954
Believe me when I say they cannot
be defeated by conventional means.

232
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:54,038
You have faced them in the past...
and won.

233
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:58,755
Indeed. Yet never in such numbers.

234
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:03,157
Those of you who choose to engage
the replicators in battle will not survive.

235
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:07,716
Teal'c is right. We must fight
only those battles we know we can win.

236
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:10,877
Yet you propose
an equally impossible task.

237
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:15,004
With Baal otherwise occupied,
now is the time to strike.

238
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:19,124
No free Jaffa has ever set foot
in the temple and lived.

239
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:22,242
And that is precisely why
we must go there.

240
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:25,761
If we succeed, many will rejoin our cause.

241
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:29,315
- Ifwe succeed.
- Were the circumstances different

242
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:31,919
I may feel the same as you, brother.

243
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,519
But the situation has changed.

244
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:37,881
We must act now
or our children will know no future,

245
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:40,160
let alone the taste of freedom.

246
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:44,602
Teal'c, I believe
there is wisdom in these words.

247
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:49,198
However, you are aware that, if we fail,

248
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:52,880
it will effectively mean
the end of the rebellion.

249
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:59,834
Are you prepared to risk
our entire cause on this one action?

250
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:05,115
Indeed I am.

251
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:12,955
So, what say you?

252
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:18,834
I say we take Dakara.

253
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:23,764
So be it.

254
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:32,358
Five more regions belonging to Baal
have fallen in the past 24 hours.

255
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:36,518
- Not putting up much of a fight, is he?
- He's making a typical Goa'uld mistake.

256
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:40,393
He's defending territory
at the expense of resources.

257
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:46,240
We can send him a message through
the undercover Tok'ra in his midst.

258
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:49,397
We could suggest a change in strategy.

259
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:50,679
Like what?

260
00:20:50,765 --> 00:20:55,043
Typically the replicators are patient and
slow-moving when not being engaged.

261
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,800
If Baal stops aggressively
fighting them and pulls back,

262
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:01,240
it may give Sam time to find a solution.

263
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:03,281
Forget that.

264
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:06,482
Look. There goes another one.

265
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:11,723
Jack, he's thinking like a System Lord
defending himself against a Goa'uld.

266
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:13,796
He doesn't know what he's dealing with.

267
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:18,640
- If he retreats, where will he fall back to?
- You're thinking of Teal'c and the rebels.

268
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:22,115
They're counting on Baal's fleet
being too busy to care about them.

269
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:25,197
The Jaffa rebellion has already failed.

270
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:31,679
We can't risk the fate of the galaxy
on one long-shot chance to revive it.

271
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:34,802
Is that Jacob talkin'? Or is that Selmak?

272
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:37,160
Jack, I'm sorry,

273
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:39,884
but the more ships Baal sends out to fight,

274
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,514
the faster the replicators
assimilate them into their own armada.

275
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:48,076
Their numbers are growing exponentially.
If we don't do something about it,

276
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:51,953
by the time we do come up with a weapon
to use against them, it may be too late.

277
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:56,721
Unscheduled offworld activation.

278
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:07,083
- Now what have you got, Walter?
- Some kind of...

279
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,081
Oh. Baal.

280
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:14,476
Stand down, boys.

281
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:18,756
Baal, buddy.
We were just talkin' about you.

282
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:20,963
All good.

283
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:24,196
By now, you are aware of
the replicator threat in our galaxy,

284
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:26,879
and that my fleet
has engaged them in battle.

285
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:32,722
There's been a little chit - and chat -
around the water cooler.

286
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:35,273
- How's that goin'?
- We're holding them at bay.

287
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:39,836
However, they are a more formidable
force than I first anticipated.

288
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,723
Yeah. Pesky little buggers, aren't they?

289
00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:47,401
I am aware that the Asgard previously
fought the replicators effectively.

290
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:50,283
More or less. I don't like
to toot my own horn, but...

291
00:22:50,365 --> 00:22:53,437
I am aware that you assisted the Asgard.

292
00:22:58,405 --> 00:22:59,394
Yes...

293
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:04,354
I wish to know what means you possess
to fight this scourge.

294
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:10,716
I'm sorry. We must've had
a bad connection there for a second.

295
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:14,480
It almost sounded like
you were asking me for help.

296
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:18,635
The replicators are a threat to everyone,

297
00:23:18,725 --> 00:23:22,923
including the countless humans who
populate worlds throughout this galaxy.

298
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:27,795
Now, I propose that we work together
to defeat our common enemy.

299
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:32,164
My, this is an occasion.

300
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:39,994
You know that bitter taste in your throat
that's kind of wrapped around your uvula?

301
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,076
That's what's left of your pride.

302
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:45,077
Perhaps you could curb your amusement
for a moment.

303
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:50,364
If we're going to work together, the first
thing we should discuss is strategy.

304
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:54,324
Your attempts at meeting the replicators
head-on will only result...

305
00:23:54,405 --> 00:23:56,714
- Jacob.
- What?

306
00:23:56,805 --> 00:23:58,796
I got it.

307
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:03,520
I've got a better idea:
instead of helping you,

308
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:07,883
why don't we sit back
and watch you get your ass kicked?

309
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:10,923
That way you'll be dead, and we'll be glad.

310
00:24:11,005 --> 00:24:13,155
You cannot be serious.

311
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:16,442
Yes, I can. I just choose not to.

312
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:18,641
Some of the time.

313
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:23,241
With your insolence, you are dooming
not just your world, but all of humanity.

314
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:25,316
I think big.

315
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,440
What the hell was that?

316
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:38,642
I'm sorry, Jacob,

317
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:41,956
but I'm just not quite ready
to sacrifice Teal'c.

318
00:24:55,725 --> 00:24:57,716
The process is complete.

319
00:24:57,805 --> 00:25:00,319
Now we must re-establish
the subspace link

320
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:04,000
between these cells
and the rest of the replicators.

321
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,838
What if they receive... instructions?

322
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:09,155
It is a risk we will have to take.

323
00:25:10,285 --> 00:25:13,243
I will only maintain the link
for microseconds at a time.

324
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:17,318
It will slow the process,
but I do not believe we have a choice.

325
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:33,274
- What did we get?
- I am processing the data now.

326
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:44,474
I believe we have pinpointed the location
of the replicators within this galaxy.

327
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:48,676
They're everywhere.

328
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:02,322
We are approaching Dakara. Defences?

329
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:08,241
I am reading only a single ha'tak-class
vessel in orbit around the planet.

330
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:10,316
Baal must indeed be desperate.

331
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:13,715
There are normally a dozen ships
patrolling this system.

332
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,399
Then we may yet succeed.

333
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,274
We are in position.

334
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:32,402
Gliders are ready for launch.

335
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:34,874
We are being hailed.

336
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:40,118
You have encroached on the domain
ofLord Baal. Identify yourselves.

337
00:26:40,205 --> 00:26:42,196
Shel'kek nem ron.

338
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:48,560
You are greatly outnumbered.
Surrender now or be destroyed.

339
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:13,997
They called you Arom, did they not?

340
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:17,644
After you returned
to your plane of existence.

341
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:20,196
Oma.

342
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:24,475
Daniel. It is good to see you again.

343
00:27:24,565 --> 00:27:26,715
I don't understand.
Last thing I remember...

344
00:27:26,805 --> 00:27:28,636
You are still on the ship.

345
00:27:28,725 --> 00:27:33,924
The human-form replicator is attempting
to probe your mind as we speak.

346
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:35,757
So why are you here?

347
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:38,882
Because when she is done,
she will destroy you.

348
00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:43,641
And when that time comes,
you will be faced with a choice.

349
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,116
I have received word from the battle.

350
00:27:58,205 --> 00:28:01,800
The fleet continues to engage
the replicators, as you have ordered.

351
00:28:01,885 --> 00:28:03,955
However...

352
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:08,076
I believe it would be wise
to pull our forces back.

353
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:12,636
If we stop confronting the enemy on
so wide a front, it may slow their advance

354
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:15,319
and allow us a chance
to mount a proper defence.

355
00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:18,954
- You doubt my power?
- Of course not.

356
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:21,354
But your fleet is falling into their hands.

357
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:26,599
- Not even the Kull warriors...
- Do not concern yourself.

358
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:30,794
When the time is right,

359
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:35,754
I promise you,
this nuisance will be dealt with.

360
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:38,598
Trust in me.

361
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:43,000
As always.

362
00:28:49,965 --> 00:28:52,877
It took several hundred
microsecond-long connections

363
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:55,763
and hours to go through
each subsequent burst ofdata,

364
00:28:55,845 --> 00:28:59,838
but we isolated the cipher that makes
the replicators immune to the disrupter,

365
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:02,917
and we've adjusted it accordingly.

366
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:06,396
The weapon works again.

367
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:11,915
- Good job.
- It was an incredibly risky thing to do, sir.

368
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:14,519
We still don't know if we were detected.

369
00:29:14,605 --> 00:29:18,518
And the altered disrupter still needs
to be tested under battle conditions.

370
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:20,596
- Got a plan?
- Thor was able to ascertain

371
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:24,234
the various positions ofthe fleet
now controlled by the replicators.

372
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:26,634
We're going to engage
a few isolated ships.

373
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:29,034
- Be careful, Sam.
- Good luck.

374
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,638
Thank you, sir.

375
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:35,925
Never a dull moment.

376
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:39,682
So you're here to offer me
the opportunity to ascend again.

377
00:29:39,765 --> 00:29:43,474
- If that is what you wish.
- What I wish? What are my options?

378
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:49,322
Personally, I would choose eternal
enlightenment rather than the alternative.

379
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:51,600
If it were only that simple.

380
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:56,042
I admit the decision
is not as easy as it appears.

381
00:29:56,125 --> 00:30:01,483
The last time, for you, the experience
was challenging at the best of times.

382
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:05,478
Unfortunately I don't have any memories
of the last time I was ascended.

383
00:30:05,565 --> 00:30:08,033
How can I make an informed decision?

384
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,958
Daniel, I did not take
your memories from you.

385
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:15,117
You think I haven't tried to remember?

386
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:18,395
- Tell me how.
- I can't.

387
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:20,794
Then tell me what I need to know.

388
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:24,514
If you are seeking an absolute truth,
you will not find it.

389
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:26,721
Only truth that applies to you.

390
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:30,921
That is so extremely unhelpful.

391
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:33,473
When the time comes, you will know.

392
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:39,915
What if replicator Carter
finds what it is she's looking for?

393
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,565
- There is that possibility.
- You have to stop her.

394
00:30:42,645 --> 00:30:44,442
- I can't.
- Why not?

395
00:30:44,525 --> 00:30:46,993
- Offer me ascension now.
- You're not dead yet.

396
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:49,076
All I can do is prepare you,

397
00:30:49,165 --> 00:30:52,760
help you to find your path
to enlightenment when that time comes,

398
00:30:52,845 --> 00:30:55,279
if that is what you decide you want.

399
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:01,120
There's a way to defeat the replicators
in my memories, isn't there?

400
00:31:01,205 --> 00:31:03,480
You need only to open your mind to it.

401
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:12,238
Brothers!

402
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:15,599
All of you will be detained.

403
00:31:15,685 --> 00:31:18,358
Have patience.

404
00:31:21,205 --> 00:31:27,724
For all of you who renounce the Goa'uld
as false gods will one day be free.

405
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:30,080
Take them. Go.

406
00:31:30,165 --> 00:31:32,076
You will not be harmed.

407
00:31:52,725 --> 00:31:57,037
The last of the garrison have surrendered.
The temple is secure.

408
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,593
Many lives were spared today.

409
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:05,160
Well done.

410
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:15,476
Firing weapon.

411
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:26,480
The ship's systems have shut down.

412
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:30,922
- That worked well.
- The weapon appears to be effective.

413
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:35,880
Another ship.

414
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:39,236
They are firing on us.

415
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,477
Targeting the second ship.

416
00:32:51,365 --> 00:32:55,074
- It's still coming.
- They have adapted to our modifications.

417
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:57,156
- That was fast.
- Yes.

418
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,522
Initiating evasive action.

419
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:14,835
Excuse the intrusion. I will return.

420
00:33:15,885 --> 00:33:17,876
Stay.

421
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,195
Speak.

422
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:55,279
A force of rebel Jaffa have managed
to take control of the temple at Dakara.

423
00:33:55,365 --> 00:34:00,803
As I hoped, they have no doubt
gathered their full force

424
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:05,754
and presented us with the opportunity
to annihilate them once and for all.

425
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:10,965
Have the fleet disengage their battle
with the replicators and move on Dakara.

426
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:13,036
Take it back at all costs.

427
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,474
Leave no survivors.

428
00:34:18,245 --> 00:34:20,236
As you wish.

429
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:32,915
You control the barrier between
your consciousness and what you seek.

430
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:36,315
You merely need to open your mind.

431
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:39,442
The truth is: all knowledge,

432
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:43,598
everything that is and was and will be,

433
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,198
is everywhere,

434
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:49,278
out there and in all of us.

435
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:55,395
If you immediately know candlelight is
fire, then the meal was cooked long ago.

436
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:57,804
Yes.

437
00:34:57,885 --> 00:34:59,682
No.

438
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:03,758
- You're tryin' to understand it, aren't you?
- It means what you want it to mean.

439
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:06,757
No, it doesn't. And you're not Oma.

440
00:35:13,005 --> 00:35:15,473
No, I'm not.

441
00:35:15,565 --> 00:35:17,476
But it doesn't matter.

442
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:21,797
Thanks to you, I found
what I was looking for.

443
00:35:26,685 --> 00:35:29,836
We are approaching Earth.
We will be there shortly.

444
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,524
What's wrong?

445
00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:36,564
Several of my key systems
are no longer responding.

446
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:41,919
We have been boarded.

447
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,082
Modify the disrupter wave again.
I'll go buy us some time.

448
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:55,363
I have no way of knowing
how many replicators you will face.

449
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,878
What choice do we have?

450
00:35:56,965 --> 00:36:01,243
I must return you to Stargate Command
before my transporter systems fail.

451
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,724
What about you?

452
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:06,241
I will attempt to fly this ship
as far away from Earth as possible

453
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:08,441
before it is completely compromised.

454
00:36:08,525 --> 00:36:10,322
No way. I'm not gonna let you...

455
00:36:13,365 --> 00:36:14,354
Dammit.

456
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:17,876
Carter?

457
00:36:19,685 --> 00:36:23,917
The weapon worked at first, but
the replicators adapted. They're immune.

458
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:26,758
No chance you guys could fix
this thing, get it to work?

459
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:31,236
Thor's ship was boarded. He beamed me
down here before all his systems failed.

460
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:34,123
He'll try to get his ship
as far from Earth as possible.

461
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:36,958
I'll take that as a no.

462
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:58,478
Never could I have imagined I would one
day stand beneath these great columns.

463
00:36:58,565 --> 00:37:03,355
Think of it: this is the very spot
in which our enslavement began.

464
00:37:03,445 --> 00:37:08,565
Then this sacred temple is an appropriate
place for our enslavement to end.

465
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:11,921
We have won a great victory
here today, old friend.

466
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:16,635
We have won a battle, nothing more.
Our victory is far from assured.

467
00:37:16,725 --> 00:37:20,559
Many of Baal's Jaffa have already
pledged their allegiance to our cause.

468
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:24,115
When word spreads of what
we have accomplished, more will follow.

469
00:37:24,205 --> 00:37:29,643
And their hearts will turn cold if they hear
our accomplishment lasted mere hours.

470
00:37:32,605 --> 00:37:34,914
Tolok. What news?

471
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:37,314
We have received word.

472
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:42,001
Baal has broken off
his battle with the replicators.

473
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:45,441
- He is coming.
- As we expected.

474
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:50,883
You see? Taking the temple
was not our greatest challenge.

475
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:53,436
Holding it will be.

476
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:03,723
This Oma character...
why do you have such reverence for her?

477
00:38:03,805 --> 00:38:07,400
- Those ridiculous sayings are nonsense.
- To you, maybe.

478
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:12,718
If she really has as much power as you
think she does, why doesn't she help you?

479
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:14,921
She merely stands by and does nothing.

480
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:18,315
You mean, while you destroy
entire civilisations.

481
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:21,158
That's a matter of perspective.

482
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:24,601
You call it destruction, we call it creation.

483
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:28,473
- You're not trying to justify your actions?
- No.

484
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:32,478
- I have no need for you to understand us.
- Why the elaborate ruse?

485
00:38:32,565 --> 00:38:35,921
You can probe my mind at will.
I obviously can't stop you.

486
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:38,519
You could have resisted.

487
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:40,800
I needed you to open up to the possibility

488
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,161
of remembering the knowledge
in your subconscious.

489
00:38:44,245 --> 00:38:47,043
It made it easier for me
to find what I was looking for.

490
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,116
And what'd you find?

491
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:58,436
Pretty. What is it?

492
00:38:58,525 --> 00:39:02,803
The ruins of an Ancient monument
on a planet now called Dakara.

493
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:07,515
Within it is the one weapon
in this galaxy capable of destroying me.

494
00:39:12,205 --> 00:39:15,959
Thanks to you, it will soon be no more.

495
00:39:28,525 --> 00:39:31,676
I'm sure he'll be here any second now.

496
00:39:34,045 --> 00:39:35,683
So, um...

497
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:38,563
I am so sorry!

498
00:39:38,645 --> 00:39:41,682
I was just finishing up a lovely brunch.

499
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:45,956
- Impudence.
- No, tuna.

500
00:39:46,045 --> 00:39:50,675
So, I hear you're fleet
is retreating from the replicators.

501
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:53,996
- How could you know that?
- I have my sources.

502
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:56,679
My fleet is on its way to recapture Dakara

503
00:39:56,765 --> 00:40:00,394
and destroy the Jaffa
who have dishonoured their true god.

504
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:03,283
Will you stop with the "true god" crap?

505
00:40:03,365 --> 00:40:07,517
Seriously, what difference will it make?
You're just delaying the inevitable.

506
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,995
The replicators are a formidable enemy.

507
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:13,963
But I have recently learned
of a weapon hidden on Dakara,

508
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,001
capable of destroying them.

509
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:18,076
Really?

510
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,963
And you're telling me this... why?

511
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:24,833
Because you must destroy it
before my fleet arrives to claim it.

512
00:40:25,725 --> 00:40:31,675
All right, you got me. I haven't the
slightest idea what you're talking about.

513
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:34,643
The weapon on Dakara
was built by the Ancients.

514
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:39,116
It is not only capable of destroying
the replicators, but all life in the galaxy.

515
00:40:39,205 --> 00:40:41,878
And your own sweet self included?

516
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:46,117
- Yes.
- So why would you use it?

517
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:49,402
I would not. But there is one who would.

518
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:53,956
One who can survive
such pervasive devastation.

519
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:58,553
Oh, please don't tell me.

520
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:01,758
Anubis.

521
00:41:03,165 --> 00:41:05,884
I asked you not to tell me.

522
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:18,076
