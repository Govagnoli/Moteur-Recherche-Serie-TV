1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:04,330
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

2
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,341
Wasn't Daniel telling me about
a very powerful weapon

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,503
in the hands of the Jaffa on Dakara?

4
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:17,640
It's not a weapon, technically. But we
did adapt it to destroy the Replicators.

5
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,020
Wait. Where are you going? I want to see.

6
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,386
Can I hold her? She's my baby. Why...

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,151
She will be the beacon of light
in the darkness

8
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,363
to the warriors of the Ori.

9
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,624
She will lead us to glorious victory.

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,000
Wait, wait, wait,
we're talking about a baby here, right?

11
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,261
She's been genetically altered.

12
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,429
<i>She'll be a fully-grown figurehead</i>
<i>in a day or so.</i>

13
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,133
Leave me. Grab her.

14
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,241
Oh, yeah, like that's going to happen.

15
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,107
Six more worlds have fallen to the Ori.

16
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,577
According to those
who witnessed the battle,

17
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,484
the enemy is led by a young woman
of extraordinary powers.

18
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,428
Mark this day,

19
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,494
for the darkness of your world
has been lifted

20
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,231
so the light of Origin may shine upon it.

21
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,840
(ALL CHEERING)

22
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:27,042
You have cast aside the shackles of
the past to welcome a brighter future.

23
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:33,456
Now, hear the words of the Orici.

24
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,034
It's Adria.

25
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:46,429
The unbelievers amongst you
sought to hinder our message.

26
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:50,501
They took up arms
in an attempt to suppress the truth,

27
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,204
but they failed and were vanquished.

28
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,210
A reminder to all that
Origin cannot be extinguished.

29
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,712
It will flourish throughout this world
and countless others.

30
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:12,197
The believers amongst you
have been richly rewarded

31
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,992
with truth, with Origin.

32
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:25,743
It is now up to you to help others see
as you have seen,

33
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:30,143
to spread the message
by joining the armies of the Ori.

34
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:45,124
Sir, I'm picking up an energy reading
coming from the surface of the planet.

35
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,729
What is it?

36
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,333
It's a wave of radiation, sir,
emanating from the gate, spreading fast.

37
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,030
Get them out of there.

38
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,032
(ALL MURMURING)

39
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:14,693
MAN: They're back on deck.

40
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,421
- What happened?
- That's what we're trying to figure out.

41
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,258
Sir I'm not picking up
any life signs on the planet.

42
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,265
That's impossible.

43
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,165
What is it, a sensor malfunction?

44
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,905
All systems are operating normally.

45
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,839
There are thousands of people
on that planet.

46
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,076
CARTER: He's right.

47
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,806
We're not picking up anything.

48
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,531
Vala, wait.

49
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,910
Look, we've still don't know
what happened down there.

50
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:16,013
They're all dead, Daniel.
That's what happened.

51
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,241
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:18,741
What for?

53
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,216
Well, believe it or not,
I know how you feel.

54
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,753
Adria was your daughter,

55
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,379
- and even though she was...
- Relief.

56
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,582
That's what I feel. Relief.

57
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,358
What, you don't think I'd want to be
responsible for the enslavement

58
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,761
of an entire galaxy, do you?

59
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,355
It was hardly your fault.

60
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,799
I knew she was the will of the Ori
even before she was born.

61
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,734
I could have done something about it,
but I didn't.

62
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,533
She was your child.

63
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,131
Maternal instinct
can only excuse so much.

64
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,203
Of course, I did tell myself that
my relationship with her might prove

65
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,145
to be an advantage,
that at some point, some critical moment,

66
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,409
I might be able to reach her
in a way that no one else could.

67
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,485
And you might have been right.

68
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,316
I'm just relieved I'll never
have to find out for sure.

69
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,623
<i>HARRIMAN: Unscheduled</i>
<i>offworld activation.</i>

70
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,337
- Chief?
- Receiving Bra'tac's IDC, sir.

71
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,906
Open the iris.

72
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,372
Bra'tac.

73
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,812
What brings you by?

74
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,113
A matter that threatens millions of lives.

75

<i>EMERSON ON RADIO:</i>
<i>Lieutenant Evans, report.</i>

76
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,973
There's no sign of residual radiation, sir.

<i>The place is clean.</i>

79
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:01,547
The weird thing is, whatever it was,
it only seems to have targeted

80
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:06,023
living tissue, 'cause everything else
was left behind.

81
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,690
You said the wave emanated
from the stargate.

82
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,789
That's right.

83
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,462
From there it spread over the entire
surface of the planet before dissipating.

84
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,268
What?

85
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,781
We know of only one device
that would operate in such a manner.

86
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,952
The council is convinced our only hope
for survival against the armies

87
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:40,219
of the Ori is to attack them
using the ancient device on Dakara.

88
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,926
The same device we used
to wipe out the Replicators.

89
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,862
Except that now
it strikes with new purpose.

90
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,058
To unmake living beings.

91
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,528
Hours ago, the first target was struck,
a planet...

92
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,104
We already know about it.

93
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,868
SG-1 was there, doing recon.

94
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,001
They were beamed out
before your weapon could hit them.

95
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,609
The villagers weren't so lucky.

96
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,317
- That is tragic.
- It's mass murder.

97
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,683
Why the hell didn't you do
something about it?

98
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,948
Our new leader, Se'tak, has convinced
the council

99
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,525
that this is our only hope for survival.

100
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,062
The more I spoke out against it,
the more isolated I became.

101
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,894
I need to contact the <i>Odyssey,</i>
let them know what's happening,

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,366
and then I need to meet this man myself.

103
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,013
I am ashamed that my brothers
have utilized these methods.

104
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,483
- They're desperate.
- There is no honor.

105
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,194
Freedom without honor is meaningless.

106
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,491
What's done is done,

107
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,066
and there's still an opportunity here.

108
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,862
We've got an Ori ship sitting
on the ground, unmanned and unguarded.

109
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,545
We must act quickly.

110
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,481
You know your way around this tub?

111
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,790
All the corridors look the same.
I haven't got my bearings yet.

112
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,622
There has to be some sort of control room.

113
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,199
I'm guessing it'll be
in one of the forward sections.

114
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,494
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

115
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,537
Time to split up.

116
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,515
Can I ask you a question?

117
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:48,476
Just the fact you have to ask me
to ask me makes me think I should say no.

118
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,889
Back on the <i>Odyssey,</i>
you said you knew how I felt.

119
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,254
- What did you mean?
- What?

120
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,260
Well, with Adria.

121
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,262
You said, "Believe it or not,
I know how you feel."

122
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,991
What did you mean?

123
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,696
JACKSON: Yeah.

124
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,941
Ten years ago,
my wife was taken as host by a Goa'uld.

125
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,914
The framed picture on the wall
in your office, is that her?

126
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,051
Yeah. Her name was Sha're.

127
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,687
We were married for just over a year
when she was taken.

128
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,015
I swore I would get her back.

129
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,519
What happened?

130
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:32,291
I joined SG-1 and searched for her
for over two years, but in the end,

131
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,366
I couldn't save her.

132
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,331
For a long time,
I felt guilty that I'd failed her.

133
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,669
And now?

134
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,805
Now, I can at least draw comfort
from the fact that she's no longer

135
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,504
suffering at the hands of the Goa'uld.

136
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,808
I guess in a small way,
I feel relieved as well.

137
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,407
Wow, check this out.

138
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,482
I'm no expert, but this looks important.

139
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,887
It appears to be
a power generation chamber.

140
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,446
Exactly, which has me thinking

141
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,356
it could be a good place to drop a little C4.

142
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,726
It would be our best opportunity to disable
the vessel, should it be necessary.

143
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,893
Just in case we can't get this thing
flying before the Ori come back,

144
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:49,537
we win one for the home team
while we're hauling ass for the gate.

145
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,610
A great Jaffa once said,
"Exalted is the warrior

146
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,201
"who achieves victory without battle."

147
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,643
Winning shows strength.

148
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,841
Winning without fighting shows true skill.

149
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,151
You are a student of Ancient strategies.

150
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,311
No, Landry said it to me.

151
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,486
I think he was quoting Sun Tzu.

152
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,581
Or it could have been Dr. Phil.

153
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,358
LANDRY: I've already advised the Pentagon
that I'm heading offworld.

154
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,729
I may be a while.

155
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,269
With all due respect, sir, you think
you might consider taking along

156
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,860
a few Marines?

157
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,769
This is a diplomatic mission, Chief.

158
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,638
The last time I checked,
the Jaffa were our allies.

159
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,372
I can't go disrespecting them
in their own house.

160
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,744
- Lf you say so, sir.
- Sometimes you make the right decision.

161
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,443
Sometimes you make the decision right.

162
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,145
- Patton?
- That one's Dr. Phil.

163
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,216
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Bra'tac is waiting.

164
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,304
Guys, I think I've found something.

165
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,965
<i>JACKSON ON RADIO: What do you got?</i>

166
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,008
<i>CARTER: I think it might be the bridge.</i>

167
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,548
And it looks like
the main command interface is a chair,

168
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,483
similar to the weapons platform
in Antarctica.

169
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,012
It would make sense that the technology
would be similar to the Ancients.

170
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,090
Vala, you said most of the people
on board the ship

171
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,251
were simple villagers, right?

172
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,623
Yes, why?

173
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,694
I think it's likely the Priors
who are flying the ships.

174
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,791
<i>Unfortunately, that probably means</i>

175
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,700
<i>the chair is keyed</i>
<i>to their unique brain physiology.</i>

176
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,037
MITCHELL: Don't sweat it.
Plan B is in place.

177
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,901
Okay, let's not jump the gun just yet.

178
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,706
At the very least, I'd like to
try to get some information

179
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,873
out of this database
before we start blowing things up.

180
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,440
I hear you, Sam, but it won't be long

181
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,919
before the Ori come back for this ship,
and we're not going to let them...

182
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,622
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

183
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,191
Cam?

184
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,063
Cam, what's happening?

185
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,432
Not much,

186
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
but we've got ourselves some company.

187
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:14,011
I am Bo'rel of the free Jaffa, and
we have come to lay claim to this vessel.

188
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,644
Slow down, brother. We were here first.

189
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,851
<i>CARTER: Cam, report.</i>

190
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,089
It's all right, Sam.
Just a little misunderstanding

191
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,559
with some of our Jaffa friends.

192
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,631
- Go back to work.
- There is no misunderstanding.

193
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,792
We achieved this victory,
therefore we claim the spoils.

194
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,338
What you have done is sacrificed
the lives of thousands of innocents.

195
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,600
No one is innocent who joins
with my enemy.

196
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,269
They were invaded by an army
with massively superior firepower.

197
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,743
They should have resisted.

198
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:44,577
So die at the hands of the Ori
or die at the hands of the Jaffa.

199
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,782
Some choice.

200
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,792
What was that?

201
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,993
Enough of this. The ship is ours.
Now, lower your weapons.

202
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,466
That's not gonna happen.

203
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,434
Colonel Mitchell...

204
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,879
Sam, we've got trouble.

205
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,882
Odyssey, <i>this is Carter,</i>
<i>requesting immediate extraction.</i>

206
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,084
Do it.

207
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,688
Major?

208
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:34,960
Something's wrong.

209
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,126
I can't get a lock on them.

210
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,488
<i>Odyssey,</i> what's happening?

211
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,754
<i>EMERSON: We're getting too much signal</i>
<i>degradation for a successful beam-out.</i>

212
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,820
As far as I can tell, the malfunction's
not coming from this end.

213
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,291
Guys, we've got a problem.

214
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,867
<i>The</i> Odyssey <i>can't beam us out.</i>

215
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,197
Why not?

216
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:15,205
Well, I'm not 100% sure, but
I think I may have activated the shields.

217
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,638
Why would you do that?

218
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,539
<i>- It wasn't intentional.</i>
- Oh.

219
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,373
Can you reverse it?

220
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,610
<i>I'll give it a try.</i>

221
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,780
<i>EMERSON: SG-1, this is</i> Odyssey.

222
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,485
<i>Three Hatak vessels are moving</i>
<i>into positions around the planet.</i>

223
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,462
Don't chance it, <i>Odyssey.</i>
We can't risk losing another ship.

224
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,591
<i>All right. Be advised that</i>
<i>we're leaving range to avoid detection.</i>

225
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,462
- Get us out of here.
- Copy that.

226
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,868
The Ori, it turns out, are not invincible.

227
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,604
This first strike against them
must be considered nothing less

228
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,478
than a complete success.

229
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,176
BRA'TAC: But at what cost?

230
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,415
Leave us.

231
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:16,327
Unable to gather support from
your fellow Jaffa, you dishonor yourself

232
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,369
by seeking it elsewhere.

233
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,569
I'm honored.

234
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,702
General Hank Landry.

235
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,801
- The Tau'ri, your people...
- Are pissed.

236
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:31,078
Your use of this Ancient device
violates our prior agreement.

237
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:36,853
An agreement made with the former
leadership that I no longer feel bound to.

238
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,152
So you're going to have your people
go back on their word?

239
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,656
Much has changed since my predecessors
consented to that agreement.

240
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,528
We now face an enemy powerful enough

241
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,364
to have rendered
our conventional weapons useless.

242
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,904
Your forces have proven
equally ineffective.

243
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,339
This device is our only means
of striking back at them.

244
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,311
Which includes
slaughtering innocent people.

245
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,214
If future attacks against armies
of the Ori allow us to recover

246
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,842
enough of their ships,

247
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,417
we will then have a powerful fleet
with which to strike back against them.

248
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:17,452
But until then,
this device is our only option.

249
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,590
Incidental genocide is not an option.

250
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,467
Granted, the cost of victory is great.

251
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,835
But the cost of defeat
would be even greater.

Where is the rest of your team,
Colonel Mitchell?

256
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,326
I don't know what you're talking about.

257
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,734
You were speaking with a female.

258
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,236
Right.

259
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,171
She's back at the village,
probably gone through the gate by now.

260
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,716
You are lying.

261
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,188
This is a message
to all Tau'ri on board this vessel.

<i>in the name of all free Jaffa.</i>

<i>We have Teal'c and Colonel Mitchell</i>
<i>in custody.</i>

<i>Surrender now</i>
<i>and no harm will come to them.</i>

If you do not identify yourselves
immediately, we will have no choice

267
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,209
but to assume your intentions are hostile,

268
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,712
in which case we will
deal with the prisoners harshly.

269
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,386
So be it.

270
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,428
Bo'rel, this is Daniel Jackson
of Stargate Command.

271
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,198
Listen, there's no reason
we should be fighting each other.

272
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,498
We should be working together.

273
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,731
I'm afraid that would not be possible.

274
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,974
Look, we're dealing
with some very advanced technology,

275
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,546
and we have some experience
that might be useful.

276
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,478
You doubt our ability to fly this ship?

277
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,288
I'm just saying there's not a lot of time,

278
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,984
and it would be in everyone's
best interests if we pool our resources.

279
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,688
My orders are to take this ship
and all on board.

More Ori ships will be here soon.

287
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,400
Then they will suffer the same fate.

Okay.

We all know, darling,
that you have telekinetic powers.

00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,203
You can stop showing off now.

I've missed you, Mother.

They said I should forget about you,
that you'd abandoned me

- because you didn't care.
- No.

00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,354
I knew you'd come back for me.

00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,758
How is it that you're even alive?

301
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,295
Everyone else on the planet was killed.

302
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,092
I was saved by this.

303
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,666
It holds a piece of the holy city of Celestis.

304
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,963
It protects me, keeps me safe.

Soon, the other ships will come for us,

00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,709
and once we're back with the fleet,
I promise you, Mother,

307
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,006
we'll never be separated again.

308
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,492
There are some who hold the Tau'ri
in great esteem for the assistance

309
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,463
they provided us against the Goa'uld.

310
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,056
I'm guessing you're not one of them?

311
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,605
While I recognize the contributions
made, I question the motive.

312
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:33,804
I suspect it had more to do
with self-preservation than generosity.

313
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,477
We had a common enemy,

314
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,607
and as much as the Tau'ri would have us
believe that we could not have defeated

315
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,381
the Goa'uld without them, I know better.

316
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,181

317
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,026

Yes.

- No, I can't abandon my army.

- It's not your army.
- Of course it is.

Well, as your mother,
I'm putting my foot down.

for protection and for answers.

what happened to the believers

to this world?

too primitive to have created
such an effective weapon.

So tell me,
how did it come into your hands?

00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,061
- Stop.
- Don't interfere, Mother.

344
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,269
Where, Jaffa?

345
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,956
I didn't know you knew
how to use one of those things.

346
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,795
Well, piece of cake.

347
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,734
Where is the weapon?

348
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,603
Dakara.

349
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,079
(BONE CRACKING)

350
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,488
Dakara.

351
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:16,666
If you continue to use this weapon
in violation of our previous agreement,

352
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,827
our alliance is in jeopardy.

353
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,963
And what does this alliance do
to benefit the Jaffa?

354
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,236
If it were not for the Tau'ri,
we would still be slaves to the Goa'uld.

355
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,107
That was in the past.

356
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,676
Now we face
a much more dangerous enemy,

357
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,148
and every day,
while we lose ground to the Ori,

358
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,380
the Tau'ri homeworld
remains curiously untouched.

359
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,117
We are the ones fighting this battle.

360
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,095
We are the ones dying by the thousands.

361
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:50,523
And yet you choose to test
your new toy on a human world,

362
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:55,672
not on one of a dozen Jaffa planets
that have fallen to the Ori.

363
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,172
Why is that, exactly?

364
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,777
This discussion is over.

365
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,689
CARTER: The <i>Odyssey</i>
tried to beam us out of here,

366
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,884
but somehow
the shields have been activated.

367
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,722
At first, I thought it was
something I'd done,

368
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,695
but after checking the controls,
I realized it wasn't me.

369
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,132
MITCHELL: There's someone else on board.

370
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,326
Three mother ships are in orbit
over the planet.

371
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,496
The <i>Odyssey</i> had to retreat
in order to avoid being detected.

372
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:30,631
TEAL'C: Then the stargate
is our only means of escape.

373
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,845
Jackson. Vala. Come in.

374
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,840
<i>MITCHELL: If you can hear me,</i>
<i>we're getting the hell out of Dodge.</i>

375
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,482
Too late.

376
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,760
Sam?

377
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,299
I don't know.

378
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,472
I need you to rally your supporters,
find out who's on side

379
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,174
and who you can trust.

380
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,012
In the meantime, I'm...

381
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,980
What is the meaning of this?

382
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,287
We just received word.

383
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:23,388
The Ori ship has taken flight.

384
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,830
I might be able to override
primary systems from the control room.

385
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:55,259
Scans are detecting no transmitter signals
on the surface of the planet.

386
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,855
Is it possible SG-1 escaped
through the gate?

387
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,866
Well, if they had, Stargate Command
would have given us the heads-up by now.

388
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,664
No, it's more likely
they're still on that ship.

389
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,664
Sir, if that's the case,

390
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:13,437
and it's on its way to rendezvous
with the rest of the Ori fleet,

391
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,672
- we've lost them.
- Maybe not.

392
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,748
We still may have a shot at rescuing SG-1

393
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,478
provided that ship is headed
where I think it is.

394
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,685
Major, set a course for Dakara.

395
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:34,391
The Ori ship destroyed three Hatak vessels
before jumping into hyperspace.

396
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,326
I'm sorry to hear that.

397
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,868
The Jaffa on the planet
reported no gate activity,

398
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,870
no other ships in the vicinity,

399
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,767
nor were there any survivors
after the initial attack.

400
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,538
Not a single soldier of the Ori
was left alive.

401
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,470
What's your point?

402
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:53,210
The only other people on board that ship
are from Stargate Command.

403
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,287
You cannot possibly think
the Tau'ri are responsible for this.

404
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,218
What other explanation is there?

405
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:01,850
We're not in the habit
of conducting sneak attacks on our allies,

406
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,224
however much we may disagree
with their tactics.

407
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,492
You were jealous of the power
we command through the Ancient device.

408
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,625
You sought to redress that balance
by taking the Ori ship.

409
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:14,227
When the Hatak stood in your way,
they were swept aside.

410
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,240
- Se'tak, this is madness.
- We shall see.

411
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,441
Guard them.

412
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,664
MITCHELL: Here's a question.

413
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,776
Who's flying this boat?

414
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,974
I know Tomin will be happy
to see you again.

415
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,184
Tomin's alive?

416
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,484
He wasn't on the planet with you?

417
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,921
No. I've been traveling with various ships.

418
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,118
As the leader of this great enlightenment,
it's important that

419
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,353
I make my presence known,

420
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,225
especially now when
the first inroads are being made.

421
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,630
Once the rest of the fleet arrives,
I'll have a much harder time of it.

422
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,068
How many other ships are coming?

423
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,159
Many, many more.

424
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,798
By my estimation, the galaxy
will be converted within the year.

425
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,370
Jackson, come in.

426
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,279
Jackson, Vala. Can you hear me?

427
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,517
We're gonna have to go out there
and look for them.

428
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,750
- Sam...
- I'll keep at it.

429
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,837
Well, at least it's not raining.

430
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,971
I don't know why you're complaining.

431
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,073
You should be delighted.
As the mother of the Orici,

432
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,846
you will be revered by
all the followers of Origin.

433
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:12,787
While I appreciate the celebrity status,
I have to admit it would get

434
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,452
very tiresome very quickly, especially if
I had to perform for the masses.

435
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,530
I'm not very good with crowds.

436
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,564
There will be no demands made on you.

437
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,567
All you have to do
is accept Origin into your heart.

438
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,504
That could be a problem.

439
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:32,098
Perhaps at first, but eventually
you will embrace the truth.

440
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,836
I don't think so.

441
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,977
You're my mother.

442
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,276
If I'm unable to convince you,

443
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:43,115
how can I be expected to sway
the countless worlds in this galaxy?

444
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:48,086
Until I have brought you into the fold,
my mission here is a failure.

445
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,791
I can be very stubborn.

446
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:56,800
Then I'll be patient and very determined.

447
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,966
What about all the other people that
refuse to bow down to the will of the Ori?

448
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,302
Are you gonna
show them the same courtesy?

449
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,405
There is a limit to my patience.

450
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,673
And there's a difference between
devotion and blind submission.

451
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,141
You can't expect to win
the faith of your followers through fear

452
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,841
and intimidation.

453
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,042
What would you have me do?

454
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,349
Give people a choice.

455
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,590
I'm trying to bring an entire galaxy
from darkness into light.

456
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,852
In order to do that,
all doubt must be removed

457
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,294
or it will spread like a cancer.

458
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,524
It's that simple.

459
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,901
This is getting a little old, don't you think?

460
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,441
You will turn this ship back immediately.

461
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,068
Love to.
Unfortunately, we're not the ones flying it.

462
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,373
You lie.

463
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,917
Would you accuse me of lying as well?

464
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,688
We are unaware of
who is in control of this vessel

465
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,588
but suspect they may be on board with us.

466
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,293
We, in fact, share a common enemy.

467
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,158
Whatever's between us,
we can finish that later.

468
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,130
Right now, we have to re-take this ship.

469
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,444
That's more like it.

470
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,580
- Adria, listen to me...
- I'm sorry, Mother.

471
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,849
The time for talking is over.

472
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,159
We've arrived.

473
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:43,641
Is that what I think it is?

474
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,369
Is that what I think it is?

475
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,436
Dakara.

476
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,879
My suspicions have been confirmed.

477
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,074
What are you talking about?

478
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,178
The Ori ship has arrived.

479
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,812
You would try to force us
to give up the Ancient device

480
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,222
rather than have us wield its power.

481
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,818
I'm telling you,
my people are not responsible for this.

482
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:11,067
We will gather our fleet
and lay siege to your world.

483
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:16,673
We will take back the Ori ship
and avenge our fallen brothers.

484
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:28,351
You don't think that whoever is flying
this boat is on a friendly trip, do you?

485
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,416
No. Me neither.

486
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:37,821
With the engines activated, there may be
a significantly greater reaction to the C4.

487
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,860
The ship may well be destroyed.

488
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,229
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

489
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,929
We must not allow this ship
to launch an attack.

490
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,601
Right.

491
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,214
Colonel Mitchell...

492
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,318
Just trying to think
of some appropriate last words.

493
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,710
What happened?

494
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,305
Nothing.

495
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,882
Yeah, I know.

496
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:34,878
Why not?

497
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,249
You should thank me.

498
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,551
I just saved your lives.

499
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,717
What are you talking about?

500
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,425
(GRUNTING)

501
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,563
<i>EMERSON ON RADIO:</i>
<i>SG-1, this is Odyssey. Do you read?</i>

502
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,641
<i>Odyssey,</i> this is Colonel Carter.

503
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,140
<i>We're gonna try</i>
<i>and beam you out of there.</i>

504
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,040
It won't work. The shield is still active.

505
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,477
I'm trying to shut it down.
Please stand ready.

506
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:11,085
The weapon is capable of firing
through a gate but it is also capable

507
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:14,214
of releasing a wave that will
encompass this world and beyond,

508
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:18,989
wiping out all life forms on any ships
that happen to be in planetary orbit.

509
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:24,128
We will be perfectly safe here
within this shielded chamber.

510
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:28,862
You will survive to bear witness.

511
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:34,672
The Jaffa have finally taken their rightful
place as a true power in this galaxy.

512
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,281
JACKSON: It won't be that easy.

513
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,551
Why wouldn't it be? I'm about to destroy
the only real threat against us.

514
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,147
You're forgetting about someone.
What about the Ancients?

515
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,328
You know as well as I do
they'll never get involved.

516
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,920
We have free rein in this galaxy.

517
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,292
Adria, listen to me.

518
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,736
I promise to stay with you.
I'll hear you out on the whole Origin thing.

519
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,328
I'll even try and keep an open mind.

520
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,207
Just let everyone else go.

521
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,073
It's too late for them, but don't worry.

522
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,380
I'll be keeping him alive.

523
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,449
We have plans for you.

524
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:26,658
We are ready.

525
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,223
My people may be on board that ship.

526
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,330
Not for much longer.

527
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,094
Fire the weapon.

528
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,622
<i>Odyssey,</i> we're good to go.

529
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,752
- Get them the hell out of there.
- Yes, sir.

530
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:14,778
Now.

531
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,369
What happened?

532
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,768
The weapon appears to have had no effect.

533
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,203
(EXPLOSION)

534
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,339
Come! Come!

535
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,813
The area was evacuated.

536
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,439
The gate is unguarded!

537
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,617
Fire again.

538
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,780
Fire the weapon!

539
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,510
There is news.

540
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:29,251
A cargo ship dispatched to the area has
reported complete and utter devastation.

541
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,348
Dakara is no more.

542
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,886
Meanwhile, we received word that
five more planets have fallen to the Ori,

543
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,986
including Hebridan and Langara.

544
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:43,726
So far, we haven't heard anything
from our allies on either world.

545
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:48,703
We are getting our asses whooped,
and it looks like that Merlin device

546
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,070
is the only shot we have at stopping them.

547
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,008
Then find it. Dismissed.

548
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,046
The council is in disarray.

549
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,142
The Jaffa nation is fractured,

550
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,755
and without Dakara
to bring us all together,

551
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,792
I fear everything we have fought for
all these years will be lost.

552
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:12,592
The war is not over, old friend.

553
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,790
If only I could have done more
to oppose Se'tak.

554
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:19,794
There's nothing to be gained
by second-guessing yourself.

555
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,268
Can't remake the past,

556
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,742
so look ahead.

557
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,537
Or risk being left behind.

558
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:42,214
She displays the wisdom
of a battle-seasoned warrior.

559
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,918
JACKSON: She's a mother.

560
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,131
Close enough.
