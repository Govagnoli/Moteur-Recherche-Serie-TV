1
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:10,276
- How about Monday morning?
- I have a thing with someone from CIA.

2
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:14,199
Johnson someone or other.
It's about that whole Kinsey thing.

3
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:18,915
- So, any big plans for the weekend?
- Oh, yeah. Big. Huge!

4
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:21,155
- Me neither.
- What are you talking about?

5
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:25,158
Ijust walked in with a whole handful
ofingredients for my famous omelette.

6
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:27,395
Famous, huh? What's in it?

7
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:32,275
- Eggs.
- I don't think that qualifies as a recipe.

8
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,835
Don't kid yourself.
There's a secret ingredient.

9
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:38,564
I can't tell you what it is
or I'd have to shoot you.

10
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:40,044
It's beer, isn't it?

11
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,002
Carter...

12
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:49,282
- Let me call you back.
- I knew it.

13
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:51,764
Hello.

14
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:55,042
- You're Jack O'Neill.
- Yes.

15
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:58,083
Here's a better question: who are you?

16
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:00,156
It doesn't matter. To anyone.

17
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:04,523
All you need to know is...
you ruined my life.

18
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:22,796
We should have gotten here earlier.

19
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:24,876
Honey, it's 7:00am!

20
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:32,001
Joe, start over there. See if you can find
a lamp that would work in the TV room.

21
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:37,601
Oh, my Lord, look!
They have those old English tea tins.

22
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:09,163
- Security breached.
- They got corridor C-9 open.

23
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:11,076
Let's go.

24
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,679
Excuse me.

25
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:34,642
How much?

26
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:39,276
So, there's this fella who walks
into a bar and sees an ape sitting there.

27
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:43,919
Sorry, no. He sees a gorilla.

28
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:49,363
That's it. Right. There's this gorilla
sitting there drinking a Coke.

29
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:53,243
So, he says to the bartender,

30
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:56,795
"Hey, what's with that gorilla
drinking that drink?"

31
00:03:56,885 --> 00:04:02,198
Well, the bartender says,
"Yeah, that ape usually orders a Coke."

32
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,913
I mean, a beer.
"..usually orders a beer."

33
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:10,281
Boss, is it an ape or a gorilla?
They're different species.

34
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:12,481
It doesn't matter. The point is...

35
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:16,444
The point is, Joe,
it's a good thing you can cut hair.

36
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:19,676
Very good.

37
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:22,233
- Are we about done here?
- All set.

38
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:27,079
Cos someone, somewhere out there,
needs themselves a new car,

39
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:29,918
whether they know it or not -
you know what I mean?

40
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:33,680
I feel the power to sell
moving through me today.

41
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:36,279
- Boys, it's been a slice.
- Thanks, Fred.

42
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:38,560
See you, Fred.

43
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,321
Bow down now,

44
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:51,999
and show your reverence for my son.

45
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:59,163
The mighty warrior Klorel.

46
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:03,319
Kel, Apophis.

47
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:24,040
We are reading the best book
in book club this week.

48
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:28,437
It's called The Heart ofa Woman.
It is such a powerful story.

49
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:31,244
- Every time I think about it...
- Wanna hear a story?

50
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:34,601
Sure, dear. What happened
to you today at the shop?

51
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:38,837
- No, it's not work-related. I have a story.
- What do you mean?

52
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:42,122
You know, like in those books
you read, only different.

53
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,318
OK, sure.

54
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:48,793
It's about a team of adventurers
known as SG-1.

55
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:54,758
They travel to other planets, through
an alien device known as a Stargate.

56
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:58,758
Their leader is the fearless Colonel Jack...

57
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:00,836
O'Neill, prepare yourself for...

58
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:05,360
extreme deceleration.

59
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:07,436
Yeah. Thanks, Teal'c.

60
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,995
You will get
to see your home one last time...

61
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:22,083
before you and everyone
on your planet are destroyed...

62
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:27,915
and your kind will disturb
the Goa'uld no more.

63
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:37,441
- So who are the Goa'uld again?
- The bad guys.

64
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,561
And this Skaara character?

65
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:42,523
Yeah. I thought you said
his name was Klorel.

66
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:47,395
I know it's a little complicated. Just wait.
I haven't gotten to the good part yet.

67
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:49,237
Skaara!

68
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:07,399
Oh, Skaara... I'm sorry.

69
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:09,077
That's it?

70
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:11,679
I think so. For now, anyways.

71
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,801
What happens to Earth?

72
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:17,355
I don't know. I mean,
I haven't figured that part out yet.

73
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:20,755
You gotta finish it.
You can't just end a story in the middle.

74
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:25,999
I tell you what. You get all your chores
done, and I'll finish the story tomorrow.

75
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:28,235
Chores?! What are we? Amish?

76
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:33,118
- Andy!
- Go... go do your homework.

77
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:40,121
He's gotten so precocious.

78
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,356
You hated it, didn't ya?

79
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:46,403
Well, I'm not the biggest
science-fiction fan.

80
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:49,045
But no, no, it was...

81
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:53,004
It was just so detailed.
How did you come up with it?

82
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:57,758
Honestly, I don't know.
It just sort of popped into my head.

83
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,959
That's amazing, really.

84
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:06,599
- What didn't you like about it?
- Don't get me wrong. It was exciting.

85
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:10,598
It's just that I like stories that are
more about interpersonal relations

86
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:14,473
and a little less to do with
things blowing up.

87
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:17,637
A giant fireball in the night sky!

88
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:25,438
- You say these folks are a military unit?
- They're part of the US Air Force.

89
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:27,914
But they travel to other planets.

90
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:31,634
- Through the Stargate.
- Which is a time-travel machine.

91
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:34,797
It's an alien device
that creates a stable wormhole,

92
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:37,445
allowing instantaneous travel
to other worlds.

93
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:40,801
- Time has nothing to do with it.
- Boss, a question.

94
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:43,797
- These Gool...
- Goa'uld.

95
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:46,797
- Goa'ol.
- Goa'uld.

96
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:48,921
Never mind. The bad guys.

97
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:51,360
- They got snakes in their heads?
- Symbiotes.

98
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:53,561
And the fellas with ones in their bellies?

99
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:57,843
The Jaffa. They incubate the symbiotes
until they're ready for implantation.

100
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:00,564
Now you see, Joe, that's confusing.

101
00:09:00,645 --> 00:09:03,796
He's right. Why can't there be
just one kind of bad guy?

102
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:06,763
Snake goes in the head,
makes 'em evil, the end.

103
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,995
- Call 'em the Snake People.
- Yeah.

104
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:12,361
They're not called the Snake People.
They're called the Goa'uld.

105
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:17,758
And the Jaffa are enslaved warriors who
mistakenly believe the Goa'uld are gods.

106
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:20,200
And it's not confusing, it's complex!

107
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:26,676
Uh... edge of my seat, the whole time.

108
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:33,996
United States Air Force.
How may I direct your call?

109
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:36,997
Hi. I'm trying to reach one of your officers,

110
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:41,556
a Colonel Jack O'Neill - two L's.

111
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:44,443
May I have your name
and the nature ofyour call?

112
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,277
- My name?
- Yes, please.

113
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:48,162
Uh...

114
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:50,122
Right. Right, of course.

115
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,673
My name is Joe... Smith.

116
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:56,121
Listen, I realise Colonel O'Neill
is probably unavailable,

117
00:09:56,205 --> 00:10:00,244
off on some important mission, but...
I know this is an odd request.

118
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:04,159
I mean, I don't know if you know
Colonel O'Neill personally, but...

119
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:06,236
could you describe him to me?

120
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:11,194
You know - height, weight, shoe size,
sense of humour, that sort of thing.

121
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:13,674
I really can't do that, sir.

122
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:16,996
Oh, of course. Sure. National security.

123
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:19,076
Now, am I understanding correctly

124
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:24,159
that there really is a Colonel Jack O'Neill
in the air force?

125
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,364
Is there a message
you'd like to leave for him?

126
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:29,436
That's fine. Thank you.

127
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:43,525
So, in the end, Rya'c was freed
from Apophis's control.

128
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:48,958
Teal'c, Drey'auc and Rya'c
were once again a family.

129
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:51,684
But Teal'c is still going back
to Stargate Command

130
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:54,802
- to fight for the freedom of the Jaffa?
- Yes, of course.

131
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:58,321
He'll take Drey'auc and Rya'c
to a place where they'll be safe.

132
00:10:58,405 --> 00:11:01,317
So the Goa'uld won't put
any more bombs in Rya'c's teeth?

133
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:03,794
That's right. Now, go to sleep.

134
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:09,080
Cool story, Dad.

135
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:27,077
Joe, where do you get these ideas
you've had lately?

136
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:31,639
- I don't know.
- Fully formed ideas, plots, characters.

137
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:35,081
- They just appear in your head?
- Basically.

138
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:42,434
Why are you looking at me like that?

139
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:45,995
I think you've gotten in touch
with your dormant creativity,

140
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:49,043
accessed your wellspring of imagination.

141
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,685
- What?
- I've read about this happening.

142
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:54,518
You're opening yourself up
to your inner muse.

143
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:57,196
My inner muse?

144
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:59,799
- It's your midlife crisis.
- It is?

145
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:04,834
Except, instead of chasing your youth by
buying a sports car or going hang-gliding,

146
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:08,884
you're seeking immortality
through creativity.

147
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:11,763
- We can't afford a sports car.
- It's a good thing.

148
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:17,158
Especially if it means you're not gonna
have an affair with a younger woman.

149
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:24,436
Wait a sec. You said Teal'c put his face up
to that head-grabber thing before O'Neill.

150
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:27,597
- Why didn't he get grabbed first?
- Guys, I told you.

151
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:29,676
Save your questions until I finish.

152
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:33,599
Now, what was left
of Colonel O'Neill's mind

153
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:36,404
managed to dial a gate address.

154
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:40,080
One they had never dialled before.

155
00:12:40,165 --> 00:12:41,757
Arrrgh!

156
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:56,441
The Asgard?
Those little grey guys. Right.

157
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,198
Shut up and let him finish, Bert.

158
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:04,523
And...

159
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:07,720
I don't want to sound ungrateful,

160
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:12,799
because I really, really appreciate
you getting all that stuff out of my head.

161
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:18,557
But you folks should understand...

162
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,954
that we're out there now.

163
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:28,002
We might not be ready
for a lot of this stuff,

164
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:30,997
but we're doing the best we can.

165
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:55,845
You have already taken the first steps
towards becoming the fifth race.

166
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:02,924
And the Furlings?
Are we gonna hear about them?

167
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:07,715
Of course. I'm sure we'll...
we'll hear lots of stories about them.

168
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:11,843
I mean, I'll make one up.

169
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:15,519
Furlings. They sound cute.

170
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,596
Like Ewoks.

171
00:14:27,805 --> 00:14:30,603
Andy, finish up,
or you're gonna miss your bus.

172
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:32,755
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

173
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:36,918
I want that lawn done today, mister.
It looks like a wheat field's growing.

174
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,996
After school, Mom. I promise.

175
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:43,636
Son, you get that lawn finished,
and I'll tell you all about the Reetou.

176
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:45,716
Cool!

177
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:48,760
See you, Mom. See you, Dad.

178
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:56,081
- The Reetou?
- Foothold situation at the SGC.

179
00:14:56,845 --> 00:15:01,475
Don't take this the wrong way, but maybe
you should cut back on the storytelling.

180
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:03,681
- Why?
- Nothing, it's just...

181
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:06,563
Well, I've heard a few comments
from people in town.

182
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:07,839
What people?

183
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:13,079
Not everyone wants to hear about SG-1
every time they come in for a haircut.

184
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:15,395
They like hearing my stories!

185
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:19,683
Maybe they're just being polite, dear.
And it's not just at the shop.

186
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:24,156
Sam at the drugstore said you talk
his ear off. And Marjory at the bank.

187
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:28,875
- And Lenny at the gas station.
- Sharlene, you said to follow my muse.

188
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:33,516
- Now you want me to stop?
- What if you write them down?

189
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:35,880
You mean, like a... writer?

190
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:39,560
Put them on paper. You can have them
in the shop, like the magazines.

191
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:42,762
That way, if people want
to read them, they can.

192
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,915
- Sir, the timing has to be exact.
- It's gonna have to be close enough. Go!

193
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:20,239
"Young Lieutenant Hammond...

194
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,236
"faced a tough decision.

195
00:16:24,245 --> 00:16:31,196
"Yet the strange foursome
hardly seemed like Soviet spies."

196
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:33,958
Honey, it's three in the morning.
Come to bed.

197
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:36,115
Just let me finish this story.

198
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:40,118
That's what you said last night.
You've got to get up in four hours.

199
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:45,279
How are you gonna cut people's hair
if you're dead on your feet all day?

200
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:46,764
Joe?

201
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:48,836
In a minute.

202
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,800
"They embraced,
and he looked into her eyes one last time.

203
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,760
"He walked away
with sadness in his heart.

204
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:14,680
"And she watched him go, wondering if
she would ever see him again. The end. "

205
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:17,199
That poor woman.

206
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:20,436
Do you think... she was with child?

207
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:24,562
You'll just have to wait until the sequel.

208
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:28,638
- You've gotta be kidding me!
- What? I got something in my eye.

209
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:33,640
You're such a softy.
See you tonight, honey.

210
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:35,716
- Bye.
- Bye, Cindy.

211
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,083
- Morning.
- Calvin.

212
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:46,159
Joe, looks like you got some letters
from those magazines in New York.

213
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:59,644
"Thank you for your submission.

214
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:02,080
"Unfortunately... blah, blah, blah."

215
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,474
"Thank you for your interest.
Best of luck."

216
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:08,274
You shouldn't have sent in this one
about Seth. It wasn't one of your best.

217
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:11,755
They rejected "Hathor"? But it was gold!

218
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,763
- Dad!
- I'm writing.

219
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:23,881
Seriously, you've got to see this.

220
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:27,480
Prepare for an x-treme adventure.

221
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,601
- What?
- Check it out.

222
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:42,159
Fourx-cellent heroes
in an x-traordinary new sci-fi series.

223
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:45,442
Starring Nick Marlowe
as the wry Colonel Danning.

224
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,597
As a matter of fact,
it does say Colonel on my uniform.

225
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,958
There's no such thing
as original thought any more.

226
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:56,515
We're all just regurgitating
the same old ideas over and over,

227
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:59,756
boiling them down to
a giant melting pot of mediocrity.

228
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:03,042
..Douglas Anders as Grell the robot.

229
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:10,323
"Wormhole X-treme. "
Coming this fall.

230
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:12,876
They stole my idea.

231
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,515
Whatever happened to
that lawsuit you guys had against...

232
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:22,438
- What was that show called?
- Wormhole X-treme?

233
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,961
- It was cancelled after only one episode.
- Bad ratings.

234
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:29,720
I liked it. Not as much as
your stories, boss.

235
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:34,554
Actually, I have a new one.
Just came to me last night.

236
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:38,684
SG-1 finds out there's a giant asteroid
headed toward Earth.

237
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:40,756
I saw the movie. It hits Paris.

238
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:44,201
Nah, this is different.
It starts when an amateur astronomer...

239
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:48,756
Actually, Joe, if it's all right with you,
I'm not really in the mood.

240
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:52,076
Come on, now! Don't you
wanna know how SG-1 stops it?

241
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:58,035
Here, I'll just tell you. Major Carter is able
to expand the hyperspace window...

242
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:02,277
No offence, but how many times can
these folks save the world from Apophis?

243
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:07,479
- What's it up to now? Five, six times?
- This story's about Anubis.

244
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:11,319
What's the diff? You know what
I'm saying? It's getting repetitive.

245
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:16,399
I mean, come on. There must be other
things we can talk about besides SG-1.

246
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:22,436
You guys play golf?

247
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:33,196
Joe, I need to talk to you.

248
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:35,753
- Just a second. I'm in the zone.
- Stop typing.

249
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:38,359
- I'm writing.
- Please.

250
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,596
- What's up?
- I want you to stop.

251
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:43,835
I just did.

252
00:20:43,925 --> 00:20:47,122
- I mean permanently.
- What?!

253
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:50,117
- I've been going over our bills.
- Sharlene...

254
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:54,437
Joe, you closed the shop early three times
this week to come home and write.

255
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:57,676
I closed the shop
because business has been slow.

256
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:01,678
- And you don't see the connection?
- Once I get a few stories published,

257
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:04,518
land an agent, things'll get better.

258
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:15,120
326. That's how many rejection letters
you've received.

259
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:17,673
You only need one yes.

260
00:21:17,765 --> 00:21:21,474
They're not reading them any more,
just sending them back unopened!

261
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:25,478
- Bert and Gordie like them.
- They work for you. What can they say?

262
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:27,556
You haven't even read them all.

263
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:31,001
I read "Holiday",
"The Light", "The Sentinel".

264
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:34,395
OK, I admit those may have been
a few small missteps.

265
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:37,875
- But on the whole they're getting better.
- I don't know.

266
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:41,355
Well, what do you think the problem is?
Maybe I can fix it.

267
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:46,963
Well, for one, it seems to me like the team
interaction isn't the way it used to be.

268
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,404
- You hate them all?
- No, I don't.

269
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:52,601
I hate what this is doing to you.

270
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:56,804
- You really want me to stop?
- Joe...

271
00:21:56,885 --> 00:22:01,595
How can this really be more important
than your livelihood, than your family?

272
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,516
Honestly, Sharlene,
I don't think I can stop.

273
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,515
Why not?

274
00:22:09,605 --> 00:22:13,154
These stories... I think...

275
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:18,243
- Think? You think what?
- I think they're real, Sharlene.

276
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:25,644
I'm not making them up.
They're happening. Somewhere.

277
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:29,274
- I see them, and it's because of the stone.
- Oh, Joe.

278
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:34,678
I can't explain it. Somehow I think it
allows me to see these incredible things.

279
00:22:34,765 --> 00:22:39,361
- That you believe are really happening?
- Yes. Here, try it.

280
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:41,197
Where is it?

281
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:43,037
Joe...

282
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,116
Did you take it?

283
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:47,924
Sharlene? What'd you do with it?

284
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:50,997
Sharlene! What have you done
with my stone?!

285
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:55,880
It was for your own good!

286
00:22:57,405 --> 00:22:59,475
Whoa.

287
00:22:59,565 --> 00:23:01,556
Has he totally lost it, or what?

288
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:05,800
Joe, please. You need help.

289
00:23:08,165 --> 00:23:10,918
Son... if you know where it is, just tell me.

290
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:14,281
- I'm not mad. I just need my stone.
- Mom?

291
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:17,084
You leave him out of this.

292
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:19,884
Joe, please! You're scaring us.

293
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:37,361
Yes!

294
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:43,279
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

295
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:01,076
No!

296
00:24:02,245 --> 00:24:04,236
He can't be gone.

297
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:09,196
He's dead.

298
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:15,834
Daniel's dead!

299
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:23,834
He can't be gone.

300
00:24:32,245 --> 00:24:34,998
Gordie, you're wearing out the floor.

301
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:37,996
- Calvin.
- Gentlemen.

302
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:43,994
- Slow day?
- What have you got, Calvin?

303
00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:49,640
Looks like a stack of bills and a couple
more letters from those magazines.

304
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:51,283
Toss 'em.

305
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:55,199
There's, uh... also another letter here
from the air force.

306
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:59,156
You read it.

307
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:12,079
"Dear Mr Spencer. Regarding your
request to meet with Colonel Jack O'Neill,

308
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:14,998
"we regret to inform you that..."

309
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:20,084
Hey. Joe.

310
00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:25,080
If you're so sure this is all real, why don't
you follow it up with more than letters?

311
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,562
Call them up, tell them what you know.
If it really is true...

312
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:31,603
Are you kidding?
I'd disappear in a heartbeat.

313
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:33,357
- You think?
- Believe me,

314
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:35,913
if the government didn't get me,
NID is sure to.

315
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:38,075
I've seen it happen.

316
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:41,601
Do you remember Armin Selig? Dead.

317
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:44,804
Right.

318
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:49,603
Well...

319
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:53,724
Look, I... gotta get back to my route now.

320
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:58,042
- You guys take care.
- Thanks, Calvin.

321
00:26:23,925 --> 00:26:25,916
Hi, Jack.

322
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:31,679
Daniel.

323
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:36,124
I leave, and look at the mess
you get yourself into.

324
00:26:38,725 --> 00:26:40,716
Yes!

325
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:44,598
Yes!

326
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:47,914
Sharlene! You won't...

327
00:26:49,245 --> 00:26:52,840
Sharlene! Sharlene, you won't believe it.

328
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:55,234
Sharlene? Oh, there you are.

329
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:57,998
Honey, it's incredible - Daniel's still alive.

330
00:26:58,085 --> 00:27:01,919
I know he ascended to
a higher plane of existence, but he...

331
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:05,554
- What are you doing?
- Andy and I are going to my mother's.

332
00:27:05,645 --> 00:27:09,115
If you have even the slightest interest
in saving our marriage,

333
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:13,801
- you'll see someone who can help you.
- Sharlene, I don't need a shrink. Sharlene!

334
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:16,763
Honey, don't do this. Please!

335
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:22,679
Come on! Honey, come on,
we can work things out.

336
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:27,122
Sharlene, look,
our problems are small compared...

337
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:30,402
Wait, just... Let's talk.
Can we just talk this out?

338
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:32,840
Goodbye, Joe. I'll call you later.

339
00:27:33,845 --> 00:27:35,437
Sharlene!

340
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:38,436
Wait! Sharlene!

341
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:50,480
"Dear Colonel O'Neill,
I understand you are a very busy man.

342
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:55,878
"However, I wonder ifyou are getting
all the correspondence I send you.

343
00:27:55,965 --> 00:28:00,117
"I have written you many letters and
left messages for you with the air force,

344
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:04,835
"but I have yet to receive
any kind ofresponse from you.

345
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,916
"Because ofthis, I have no choice

346
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:10,759
"but to take my life into my own hands
and come clean with you.

347
00:28:10,845 --> 00:28:12,836
"I know everything. "

348
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:18,594
- Gordie! You scared the hell out of me.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:22,473
It's OK, Gordie. I'm just... glad it's you.

350
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:25,477
If it's OK with you,
me and Bert are gonna head home.

351
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:28,523
- It looks like nobody's coming in again.
- Yeah.

352
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:32,917
Look, I know this is kind of
a bad time, but...

353
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:41,233
- What is it, Gordie?
- Well, it's been really slow around here,

354
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:46,240
and I kind of dropped off an application
at the Piggly Wiggly.

355
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:51,197
I understand.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

356
00:28:51,285 --> 00:28:53,640
Thanks, boss. Good night.

357
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:56,477
G'night.

358
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:30,394
Activating hyperdrive.

359
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,641
Standing straight up.

360
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:44,482
Come on, boys.

361
00:30:04,005 --> 00:30:06,121
Sir!

362
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:32,519
Thanks for seeing me. You look great.

363
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,559
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm good.

364
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:38,636
Very good.

365
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:45,319
Sharlene, I'm... I'm sorry about
everything that's happened.

366
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:48,283
I drove you and Andy away.
I understand that now.

367
00:30:48,365 --> 00:30:50,560
- Joe...
- Just let me finish.

368
00:30:50,645 --> 00:30:54,320
I was too wrapped up in the stories
to realise what was important.

369
00:30:54,405 --> 00:30:58,921
I promise I will focus on rebuilding
my business, on providing for my family,

370
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:01,041
if you'll give me another chance.

371
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:05,198
It was never about the money, Joe.
It was your obsession with that stone.

372
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:08,004
I know, I know.
And I owe you both an explanation.

373
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:11,282
That's why I brought you proof
that my visions are real.

374
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:14,038
This is what Jack O'Neill
actually looks like.

375
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,083
I know what you're thinking,
but I saw this image in my mind

376
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:19,360
- long before it was in the paper.
- Joe...

377
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:23,677
And here. This report about massive
solar-flare activity from six years ago

378
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:28,122
coincides with the time
SG-1 destroyed Apophis's fleet.

379
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:31,356
And this, about the sinking
of a Russian submarine.

380
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:36,394
It happened the same time Anubis's ship
crashed into the Pacific Ocean.

381
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:41,513
You're using real people and events
and incorporating them in your fantasies.

382
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:44,642
They're not fantasies!
O'Neill is head of Stargate Command.

383
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:47,956
There is no Stargate Command!

384
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:53,882
Listen to me. I've been talking to
several doctors about your symptoms.

385
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:58,516
They think that you might be suffering
from something called manic psychosis,

386
00:31:58,605 --> 00:32:00,755
combined with grandiose delusions.

387
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:07,034
But, with therapy and medication,
you could probably live a normal life.

388
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,241
Oh, my God!

389
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:13,204
They're fighting in Antarctica,
for Earth's very survival.

390
00:32:19,885 --> 00:32:22,240
Anubis's fleet is in orbit
above us right now.

391
00:32:22,325 --> 00:32:24,202
Joe, stop it. It's not real.

392
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:28,801
You don't understand. If Jack can't find
a way to use the Ancients' technology,

393
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:31,353
- we're all dead!
- Goodbye, Joe.

394
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:35,279
It's happening, Sharlene!

395
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:37,754
You'll see! It's real!

396
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:24,122
OK, look. This obviously isn't your forte.

397
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:27,436
So why don't you just put the gun down
before you get hurt?

398
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:29,720
Don't come any closer!

399
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:32,000
I know your gun isn't real.

400
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:34,956
However... mine is.

401
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:37,957
Oh, God! I'm sorry.
You're right. It's just a toy.

402
00:33:38,045 --> 00:33:41,082
- Please don't shoot me.
- I'm not gonna shoot ya.

403
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:44,999
I'm sorry. I just thought it was
the only way to make you listen to me.

404
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:49,158
Oh, where you're going...
people will listen.

405
00:33:49,245 --> 00:33:51,805
They got nothing to do but listen to you.

406
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:54,524
They got nice white coats, padded walls...

407
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:58,837
Please, wait!
You're Brigadier General Jack O'Neill.

408
00:33:58,925 --> 00:34:02,440
Head of Stargate Command
at Cheyenne Mountain.

409
00:34:02,525 --> 00:34:04,038
You used to command SG-1,

410
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,834
which is now led by
Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter.

411
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:09,961
You once visited a planet called Argos,

412
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:13,481
and the nanites in your blood
caused you to age artificially.

413
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:17,001
You had the entire repository
of the Ancients' knowledge

414
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:19,440
downloaded into your brain, twice.

415
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:23,962
You have a thing for The Simpsons,
fishing, Mary Steenburgen,

416
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:27,242
the colour peridot,
and you're a terrible ping-pong player.

417
00:34:27,325 --> 00:34:30,715
- Have we met?
- My name is Joe Spencer. I'm a barber.

418
00:34:31,845 --> 00:34:34,678
It's all true, isn't it? Everything I've seen.

419
00:34:34,765 --> 00:34:40,601
The Stargate, the Goa'uld, the Asgards.
It's all real.

420
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:43,722
Tell me it's real. I need to know.

421
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:47,636
First of all, Joe...

422
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:50,999
I'm not a terrible ping-pong player.

423
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:03,157
Between you and me,
I totally see the analogy.

424
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:06,999
- Burns as Goa'uld.
- Thank you.

425
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:11,556
And don't worry. I won't say a word
about your feelings for...

426
00:35:14,005 --> 00:35:19,796
It's an honour. I don't know how to thank
you for all you've done for our planet.

427
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:23,355
- There are not enough words.
- It's nice to meet you, too.

428
00:35:23,445 --> 00:35:26,039
- Joe Spencer.
- I was particularly impressed

429
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,593
with the time you blew up that sun.

430
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:30,801
Well, thank you. I had a bit of help.

431
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:34,241
- And as far as the whole Pete Shanahan...
- Joe.

432
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:38,113
Dr Jackson, can I just say,
thank goodness you're back.

433
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:43,120
Jonas wasn't a bad guy. But after all you
went through together, you belong here.

434
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:45,435
Thank you. Jack?

435
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:47,595
He's a barber.

436
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:50,245
- Broke into your house?
- Yeah.

437
00:35:50,325 --> 00:35:53,317
- Second week in a row.
- Mm-hm.

438
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:56,442
- Alarm.
- I'm thinking dog.

439
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:59,722
You could try locking your front door.

440
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:13,476
Shel kek nem Ron.

441
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:18,284
Joe, the barber.

442
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:20,356
Please be seated.

443
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:23,596
What have you got there, Carter?

444
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:26,995
Initial tests show
Joe has the same Ancient gene as you.

445
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:31,954
If you ever need me to use the chair
device in Antarctica, in defence of Earth,

446
00:36:32,045 --> 00:36:34,195
- I'm there.
- Thank you.

447
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:41,762
Other than that,
his physiology is completely normal.

448
00:36:41,845 --> 00:36:44,484
Do not a great many people
possess this Ancient gene?

449
00:36:44,565 --> 00:36:47,079
Yeah. How come I'm the only one
seeing these things?

450
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:49,520
Yes. Good question. Pray tell.

451
00:36:49,605 --> 00:36:53,120
Unfortunately, our knowledge
of Ancient physiology is limited.

452
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:56,356
We also know that Joe has
somehow managed to gain access

453
00:36:56,445 --> 00:37:00,404
to huge amounts of classified information,
mainly in regard to SG-1,

454
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:04,273
and that these visions are somehow
connected to the stone he found.

455
00:37:04,365 --> 00:37:08,916
- Anything on that?
- Daniel said it seemed familiar.

456
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:12,884
You claim to receive these visions
only within the proximity of the stone.

457
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:16,753
Perhaps there's a connection between
it and your genetic predispositions.

458
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:21,794
I know the hair makes you look different,
but didn't you used to be gold-coloured?

459
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:25,114
I think I got it.

460
00:37:25,205 --> 00:37:27,765
Took me a while to track it down, but...

461
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,320
- You have one, too?
- They're a set.

462
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:33,202
Jack, remember P3R-233?

463
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:36,322
You found a quantum mirror
that sent you to an alternate reality

464
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:38,361
where the Goa'uld invaded Earth.

465
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,995
- Hey, fella.
- Hey, Jack.

466
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:51,840
- This all the stuff we brought back from...
- P3R-233. Want to help me catalogue it?

467
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:54,200
You bet! My favourite.

468
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:58,278
But it's all gonna have to wait.
Hammond called a briefing.

469
00:37:58,365 --> 00:38:00,595
We got some intel back...

470
00:38:00,685 --> 00:38:04,917
indicating that Apophis
might not be so dead as we thought.

471
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,476
Something about...

472
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:12,636
Chulak.

473
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:15,239
The stones are
an Ancient communication device,

474
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:18,317
allowing you to see events
through a psychic connection.

475
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:22,114
Jack activated the link between the stones
by picking up the second one.

476
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:26,483
Then all that's required is a proximity
to the stone for the connection to activate.

477
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:29,125
As the stone was stored
in the base archives...

478
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:32,277
But that doesn't explain how
the other stone got to the...

479
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:35,562
- Where was it?
- A garage sale.

480
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:40,639
The person who sold it to me said
his grandfather found it on a dig in Egypt.

481
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:42,955
What about the proximity issue?

482
00:38:43,045 --> 00:38:46,003
If the stone General O'Neill touched
was kept here,

483
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:48,553
how could Joe see
what happened to him offworld?

484
00:38:48,645 --> 00:38:52,923
He was getting most of it from when Jack
was writing reports here on the base.

485
00:38:53,005 --> 00:38:55,155
The stone was stored a few levels above.

486
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:57,554
That's why the stories
were so easy to write!

487
00:38:57,645 --> 00:39:01,035
It was like someone else
had done most of the work for me.

488
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:04,515
And... you say they all got rejected?

489
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:10,356
Wait a second.
If the stones work the way Daniel says,

490
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:14,233
shouldn't General O'Neill have been able
to see elements of Joe's life?

491
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:16,634
Theoretically, yes, he would.

492
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:35,283
- Bowling league, Thursday nights?
- You saw that?

493
00:39:35,885 --> 00:39:38,479
- You got game, son.
- Wait a minute, Jack.

494
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:42,399
You've seen parts of the life
of a barber in Indiana for seven years,

495
00:39:42,485 --> 00:39:44,601
and you never mentioned it?

496
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:47,722
Yeah. Sure I did. I know I did.

497
00:39:51,965 --> 00:39:54,035
No. No, you didn't, sir.

498
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:56,954
I didn't?

499
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,320
You didn't find that the least bit odd?

500
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:05,842
Actually, no. I found it quite... relaxing.

501
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:15,961
Sharlene.

502
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:20,243
I only have about ten minutes,
and then I need to get right back to work.

503
00:40:20,325 --> 00:40:23,635
There's no easy way to say this:
I want a divorce.

504
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:25,841
I know. I mean, you have every right to.

505
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:31,045
But before we get to that,
there's someone who'd like to meet you.

506
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:33,116
Here he comes now.

507
00:40:35,885 --> 00:40:40,959
Sharlene, meet General Jack O'Neill
of the United States Air Force.

508
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:46,083
It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

509
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:50,955
I think we have some things to talk about.
