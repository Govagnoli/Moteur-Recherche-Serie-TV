1
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:30,204
When I first started the show,
I knew two years.

2
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:33,677
Then we knew four, then we knew five.

3
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,645
The sixth year happened,
and then "That's it."

4
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:42,279
Then suddenly seven happened, and
we went "This is really it. We're done."

5
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:45,996
Eight. And so it's just been a crazy ride.

6
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:50,080
Honestly, who knew it would go this long?
Who knew it would be this successful?

7
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:53,364
Part of the success of Stargate too
is not something that we see,

8
00:00:53,447 --> 00:00:55,517
except that we keep getting renewed.

9
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:59,680
I'm not always really aware of what's
going on out there in the real world

10
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:02,725
in terms of our ratings or fan response.

11
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:06,243
I know the fan base
for the show is phenomenal

12
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:09,478
but, until you go overseas,
you don't really know.

13
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:13,480
Suddenly, you're in Europe
and people are going "Sam! Sam!"

14
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:17,037
Australia - everywhere I went,
people recognise you.

15
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:20,517
So then you go
"Wow, it is a success." Who knew?

16
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:24,316
Sci-fi was not a genre
that I was hugely into.

17
00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:29,003
I've said this before and I'll say it again:
I was a Little House on the Prairie girl.

18
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:34,361
But I wanted to do this show
because of the character.

19
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:39,646
Because I loved the character
and I saw so much potential for her.

20
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:42,605
In the pilot, I saw her flaws,

21
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,963
but I also saw great potential
and I saw all her strengths.

22
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:50,518
It's not a character that
you come across very often, as a woman.

23
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:53,485
So I was really thrilled
by the opportunity to play her.

24
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,603
That's what jazzed me.

25
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:59,521
OK, I'm Stargate Barbie and we're dead!

26
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:02,360
It wasn't that I thought "Sci-fi",
and I still don't.

27
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:07,475
We're not in a ship all day long.
We're present-day, fallible human beings.

28
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:10,479
We're goofy and irreverent at times.

29
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:14,845
There's a definite sense of humour to
the show, and a definite human element.

30
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,646
And I think it's very accessible.

31
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:20,639
Even though I am probably
the most sci-fi character in it

32
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:22,797
because of the techno-babble I speak.

33
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:26,357
I used to do Shakespeare.
Now I do techno-babble.

34
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:30,759
I don't think of it as a sci-fi show.
I hope that doesn't upset sci-fi fans.

35
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:34,078
Cos it is a sci-fi show,
but it's so much more.

36
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:40,919
- What? What?
- We got trouble.

37
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:43,202
- W-What kind of trouble?
- Think Bolivia.

38
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:45,357
Oh, Jaffa?

39
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:50,324
They made our position.
Keep working.

40
00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:08,236
What a dream job. We get to do
what we love to do for a living.

41
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:13,117
Everyone loves being here - crew, cast.

42
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:17,917
It's so hokey but we really like each other.
We love each other.

43
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:21,363
Just last night, I'm talking to
Chris Judge for an hour and a half.

44
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:24,837
I talked to Michael before he went
to Australia, and to Don the other day.

45
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:29,000
And getting together with
our craft-service guy and hair stylist.

46
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:31,396
We really dig each other.

47
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:36,356
We're very, very lucky, and I don't know
that it's the same on every show.

48
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:38,085
It's just like a family.

49
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:41,398
Michael, Chris and Rick
are just like my three brothers.

50
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:46,197
So we have our sibling rivalries
but, when push comes to shove,

51
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:49,404
we'd go to the wall for any one of us.

52
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:53,685
We'd all look out for each other,
and that's rare, I think.

53
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:00,518
So what happens beyond the gate?

54
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:06,037
I have a very boring life
during the shooting of Stargate

55
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:10,564
because I have to stick
to a pretty regimented routine

56
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:12,956
in order to say all the words
that I have to say.

57
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:14,400
This is my favourite thing.

58
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,844
But on weekends, for me, it's about
getting out into the woods with my dog,

59
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:21,725
just breathing fresh air and hiking.

60
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:24,998
I'm still renovating my house.

61
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,078
I play guitar.

62
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:30,555
Not in public. Ever.

63
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:36,036
But it's really quiet, sedentary,
just chilling. Chilling, chilling.

64
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:39,324
I'm not a big party girl.
I don't go to the club scene...

65
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:42,604
unless I go out with Christopher Judge.

66
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:46,885
Which happens once a year -
cos that's all you can handle.

67
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:51,006
It's very quiet.
I'm nature girl on weekends.

68
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:55,842
I bought an Ocean Kayak,
and now I'm kayaking, which I love.

69
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:58,077
So I'm just outdoors-y girl.

70
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:01,796
Shooting in Vancouver is brilliant.

71
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:06,881
In the summertime, and even up until
a couple of weeks ago, I was kayaking.

72
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:09,959
Wintertime, you go skiing.

73
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,766
The guys play hockey,
so you go to the hockey games.

74
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:17,079
My husband plays with the Stargate guys.

75
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:22,560
It's a perfect lifestyle out here,
especially if you're into the outdoors.

76
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:33,244
Directing was, and is, and has been
something I've wanted to do

77
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:37,798
since before I got on Stargate
and I was directing theatre.

78
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:43,598
For me, it was really six years of proving
to the powers that be that I could do it.

79
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:46,918
In the negotiations for season seven,
I laid it on the table

80
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:51,797
and said "This is a deal breaker.
I have to be able to direct."

81
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,605
And they let me.

82
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:58,363
That's the scene. We're doing one crane
shot which'll end up in a wide master,

83
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:00,244
a two-shot of Daniel and Carter,

84
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:04,559
and simultaneously shoot a medium
close-up of Barrett with his radio.

85
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:05,636
Nice!

86
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:10,164
"Resurrection" - initially I was gonna
direct it early in the season.

87
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:14,957
Then I was gonna direct the episode
right after the summer hiatus.

88
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:17,766
Then I was gonna direct
the second-last episode.

89
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:21,920
Suddenly it was the last episode and it
was Michael's episode, which was great

90
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,124
because I could talk to Michael
about what his vision was

91
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:27,163
when he wrote the script.

92
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,521
I've never seen
such a complete bastardisation

93
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:35,646
of what was once a very lyrical
and musical piece of work.

94
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:38,799
It all worked out.
Initially I was freaked out.

95
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:40,878
"Oh, my God! How am I gonna do this?"

96
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:47,918
It turned out to be the most phenomenal
experience of my career so far. I loved it.

97
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:52,717
The one thing I kept forgetting
to do was say "Action."

98
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:55,605
- Action!
- That's brilliant.

99
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:10,003
Daniel/ You OK?

100
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,681
Where is she? She won't get far.

101
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:18,244
All units. This is Agent Barrett.
The female prisoner is unaccounted for.

102
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:19,316
Secure all exits.

103
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:24,481
Without exception, every single member
of this crew gave 110% for me.

104
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:28,719
And they all said they would,
from our locations manager, Lynn Smith,

105
00:07:28,807 --> 00:07:31,799
to Bridget McGuire to James Robbins.

106
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:34,640
All of the elements
that happen prior to shooting.

107
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:37,400
And then on set, everyone.

108
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:42,402
It will take a really long time,
but... that's what cool shots take.

109
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:46,639
I was able to design a show
and design a style for the show

110
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:50,766
based on the knowledge that I knew
I could push the camera department

111
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:55,079
because I knew that our crew could
handle what I was throwing at them,

112
00:07:55,167 --> 00:08:01,083
the two-and-a-half-page crane shot that
I designed for the opening of the show.

113
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:04,000
And I knew that it would work,
and they all added.

114
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:11,482
I also had the privilege and the safety net
of Michael Greenburg on set every day.

115
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:14,206
He just let me do my thing.
I designed every shot.

116
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:16,881
I drew it out on paper.

117
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:20,846
I'd say "Michael, this is the next scene.
These are my camera angles."

118
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:23,122
"This is why I want
the camera to move here."

119
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:26,722
A great director.
I can't believe she's a first-time director.

120
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:31,085
She's got all the right moves,
all the right stuff. And she looks good.

121
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:36,764
She used to be really ugly, then she got
punched in the face and became pretty.

122
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:42,678
Then, of course, I had a great cast.
Rick wasn't in it, sadly.

123
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:47,636
But Michael and Christopher...
I just love them. They were so on board.

124
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:52,717
That goes back to that whole...
why we love each other so much.

125
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:57,756
Brad Rines was my editor,
and he's an amazing editor.

126
00:08:57,847 --> 00:09:01,635
So I came in with his mix and his first edit

127
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:05,356
and went "This is great!
I barely have to change anything."

128
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:08,837
Will Waring said to me
"When you go into the first-day edit,

129
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:11,919
you'll pretty much sit there and go 'Cool."'

130
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:14,202
This is really cool!

131
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,721
There was just a few things
that we changed,

132
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,526
a couple of takes we used differently.

133
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:24,920
But it took less than a day for me to do
my director's cut. It was that easy.

134
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:30,320
Mind you, I designed the show in such a
way that there was little room for editing,

135
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:32,875
which the producers may
or may not have liked.

136
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:36,277
But it was like "You kinda
have to do this. This is the way."

137
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,358
I did a lot of what we call "oners"

138
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:43,760
where it was an entire scene in one move
so you can't cut into it.

139
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:46,281
All part of my design.

140
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,164
It was great.

141
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:50,238
Directing is a career path.

142
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,363
I will always want to be an actor.

143
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:57,475
There's always a charge to that creative
juice, but to open up other elements.

144
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:01,879
Especially after seven years on a show,
you don't wanna become stagnant.

145
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:06,239
I would love to direct episodes of
the spin-off, but certainly other things.

146
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:09,637
This is the final shot of season seven.

147
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:14,720
And it's bloody
brilliant, if I do say so myself.

148
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,640
Cut. Project the gate!

149
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,797
That's a wrap till season eight.

150
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:22,082
Whoo!

151
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,002
Thank you to the fans, to all of you.

152
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:41,237
Hope you're enjoying season seven.

153
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:44,319
Hope you're enjoying the DVDs.

154
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:50,596
I've said this before and I'll say it again:
There but for the grace of you go... we.

155
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:55,643
If it weren't for your support, we wouldn't
be doing the show, or season eight.

156
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:58,685
Oh, my God, it's fantastic!

157
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:04,046
For your letters and your love
and... just for sticking by us.

158
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:06,322
From the moment
the show was announced,

159
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:09,922
we had a fan base,
before we even hit the airwaves.

160
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:13,522
You stuck by us and so thank you
from the bottom of our hearts.

161
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:16,075
If it weren't for you,
