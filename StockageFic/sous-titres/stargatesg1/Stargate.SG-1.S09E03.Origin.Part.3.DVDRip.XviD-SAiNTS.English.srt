1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,037
<i>Previously, on Stargate SG-1</i>

2
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:06,364
These bracelets link us together.

3
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:09,684
It says that the Alterans named their new home Avalon,

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,345
and that they built many Astreaporta.

5
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,780
- Stargates.
- The Ancients built the Stargates.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,334
Well it stands to reason that
they weren't always called the Ancients.

7
00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:20,237
These stones are actually
an ancient form of communication device

8
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:23,224
that links the users psychically,
allowing the user to see through each others eyes.

9
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:24,308
Where are we?

10
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:27,995
I don't know, but I think we're in them.

11
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:31,599
It's possible it was meant to work this way
so that we can communicate with others,

12
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,776
without intruding on the minds
of those we're connected to.

13
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,137
They're just temporary transmitters.

14
00:00:36,446 --> 00:00:41,359
Not quite what I imagined
when I pictured a civilization of gate builders.

15
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:44,804
- You're not allowed to investigate your own history?
- If such a history contradicts the book of Origin.

16
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:47,983
- You're heretics.
- What if these Gods, the Ori,

17
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,386
are the people left behind by the Alterans?

18
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:53,330
You think they ascended.
What are you gonna do?

19
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:55,481
We are gathering as much evidence as we can

20
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:59,495
and keep hidden those artifacts which prove our claims,
in case one or more of us are discovered.

21
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:04,358
- Daniel?
- You're killing an innocent person!

22
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:07,194
She's in VFIB! Code blue.

23
00:01:14,402 --> 00:01:15,987
You will come with me.

24
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:30,051
Where are we?

25
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:32,137
The planes of Celestus.

26
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:34,181
And that?

27
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:37,225
City of the Gods.

28
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:47,912
Maybe you can tell me who you are.

29
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:50,281
I am a Prior of the Ori.

30
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:51,599
And what is that?

31
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:53,692
<i>In time.</i>

32
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,095
<i>All in due time.</i>

33
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:21,596
I guess we'll just wait here.
Is that what we're gonna do?

34
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:57,442
Hallowed are the Ori.

35
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,727
Season 9 - Episode 3
Origin

36
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,026
Both Daniel and Vala's vitals
have been stable for two hours now.

37
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:04,853
What about disconnecting them from the device?

38
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:07,194
Dr. Lee has been unable to remove the stones.

39
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:09,937
We haven't tried C4 yet Sir.

40
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,259
<i>Dr. Lee is working on disabling the power source,</i>

41
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,821
but given that the device
is tied directly into their minds,

42
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:17,104
I recommend we proceed with caution.

43
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:18,345
I understand.

44
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:21,027
But if one or both of them run into trouble again,

45
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:25,351
I'm ordering you to take whatever action
is necessary to shut that thing down!

46
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:29,795
Teal'c, a word.

47
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:35,599
What can you tell me about this Gerak fella?

48
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,122
He was First Prime of Montou.

49
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:42,806
A minor Goa'uld who served Ra,
then later fell in with Baal when Ra was killed.

50
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:49,271
After the fall of the Goa'uld,
Baal's armada was led by a Jaffa named Hubr'ok.

51
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:54,936
Hubr'ok was an ally of Bra'tac and would have supported
our desire to reform the Jaffa nation with democracy.

52
00:04:55,618 --> 00:04:58,360
However, approximately four months ago,
Hubr'ok disappeared.

53
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,582
You think Gerak had something to do with it?

54
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,484
Though no evidence has been uncovered,

55
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:05,466
shortly after Hubr'ok's disappearance,

56
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:09,590
Gerak emerged as spokesperson for the
more traditional ways of the Jaffa High Council.

57
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:11,632
Which he could control.

58
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:17,317
Through a series of slow and deliberate manipulations,
the council played squarely into Gerak's hands.

59
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:20,159
Well, that makes him one of the
most powerful guys out there.

60
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,801
At least that we know of.

61
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,364
I suppose I should meet him face to face.

62
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:29,327
I will extend your invitation.

63
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:42,019
Alright Daniel. What does it say?

64
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,422
Well it seems to fall into suit
with many of the religions I've studied.

65
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:48,304
They tend to weave their doctrines
into simple fable like narratives, with

66
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:50,827
characters that are meant to be
identifiable with the common individual.

67
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:54,590
Well why don't you read one to me?
I love a good yarn.

68
00:05:57,652 --> 00:06:01,416
They all seem to teach meditation
on one's worth and significance.

69
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:04,799
The path of righteousness
towards a state of higher being.

70
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:10,284
What?

71
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:12,586
I'm starving.

72
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:15,969
The central icon of the religion seems to be fire.

73
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,051
I don't need a book to tell me that.

74
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,894
That would make sense. Fire is light, energy, warmth.

75
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:25,938
And yet, on Earth at some point,
fire became associated with demonic imagery.

76
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:27,980
Things that are evil. Hell, not Heaven.

77
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,981
And?

78
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,142
I'm just wondering if the Ancients
had something to do with that.

79
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:34,586
Tell you what?

80
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:37,228
Why don't you flip to the end

81
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:40,010
and see how it all turns out.

82
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,205
The village of Veraga has been corrupted.

83
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:58,847
We didn't do it, I promise.

84
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:02,892
We are connected to these people, Harrid and Sallis,
by means of a communication device

85
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:07,255
that was brought to our galaxy a long time ago
by a race of people called the Alterans.

86
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:10,097
Also known as the Ancients...

87
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,461
Look, the point is, we meant no harm.

88
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:16,583
We're explorers.

89
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:19,186
You know of others in Veraga?

90
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:20,907
Others?

91
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:23,649
Unbelievers.

92
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,991
Oh, I'm sorry.

93
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:28,434
Do you want us to tell on people
who don't believe in the Ori?

94
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,357
Devotion is rewarded.

95
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,359
Those who stray must be guided back to the path.

96
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,881
Seems to me, those who stray get burnt to death.

97
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:41,125
The Ori gave all men and women free will.

98
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:44,568
If the Ori are so powerful,

99
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:50,333
why do they need us to tell them
who believes in them and who doesn't?

100
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:53,336
The Ori need nothing from us.

101
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:57,780
It is we who must seek the truth of the universe,
in order to achieve enlightenment.

102
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:01,623
Been down this road before.

103
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:07,188
At ease Colonel.
How are they doing?

104
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:08,590
There's no change, Sir.

105
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:12,553
I know you're concerned for them, so am I.

106
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,516
But I've got something else for you to do.

107
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:16,356
Sir.

108
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:21,761
Just got a report from Dr. Lindsay on P3X-421.

109
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,322
Lindsay. Anthropologist, right?

110
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:29,608
She's been working with the Human
population on 421. Helping them get over
the loss of their former false god.

111
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:30,810
Trouble?

112
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:33,171
Well it seems a missionary of sorts

113
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:37,976
came through the gate yesterday and started
spouting a religion we haven't encountered before.

114
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:41,259
Not that we have a problem with
people exploring different faiths.

115
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:45,742
I suspect we'll see a lot of opportunists
trying to fill the void left by the Goa'uld, Sir.

116
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:48,685
This new found freedom is quickly going to

117
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,669
bring about desperation,
if people don't learn to defend for themselves.

118
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,913
A lot of these, shall we say, sheltered civilizations,

119
00:08:57,513 --> 00:09:02,117
could potentially be taken advantage of by
a charlaton with a flashy bag of tricks.

120
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:03,479
And in this case?

121
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:10,205
Well, this missionary is apparently trying to prove
the validity of his claims by performing miracles.

122
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,587
Miracles.

123
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,193
I'd like you to take SG-12 and check it out.

124
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:23,336
Yes Sir.

125
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:32,324
Emeca was forgiven his transgression
and found his way back to the path.

126
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,766
I can't take much more of this.

127
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:35,887
I'm sorry to interrupt, but

128
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:37,189
if you've brought us here to try to convert us,

129
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:40,231
I think it's fair to tell you that
we're really not in the market for new gods.

130
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:43,153
The will of the Ori brought you here.

131
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:45,656
I suppose we could talk to one of these Ori.

132
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:46,817
Of course.

133
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,541
Well great! That would be great!

134
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:54,084
Speak and they shall hear you.

135
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:56,445
<i>Okay.</i>

136
00:09:56,926 --> 00:10:00,689
You can torture us all you want with your rhetoric,
but we're not gonna crack. Well, I might.

137
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:03,372
But we're not going to tell you anything
because we don't know anything. Am I right?

138
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:05,073
Can I talk to your boss?

139
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:07,736
The...

140
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:14,061
The Doci.

141
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:16,983
The one who speaks the word of the Ori.

142
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:25,231
Like Ageadius of Valdair, I need to speak things
that can only be spoken in the light of the fire.

143
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:29,575
Come with me.

144
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,801
Could you not have asked that an hour ago?
I've been listening to him drone on and on.

145
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,383
- Not you.
- What? Not who? Not me?

146
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:40,424
But I...

147
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:44,048
<i>I'll wait here.</i>

148
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,982
Quite the hefty rise.

149
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:07,829
Welcome.

150
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,758
As he lay there, dying in the sun,

151
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:23,243
the sands of the desert all around him,
Petris spoke to the rock.

152
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,485
Not with his lips, but with his mind.

153
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:32,771
And the rock wept tears of fresh water
and his thirst was quenched.

154
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:36,615
Fear not the Ori.

155
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:41,279
Fear the darkness that would
conceal the knowledge of the universe.

156
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,580
Believe in the truth of all things

157
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:47,524
and you too may find the path to enlightenment.

158
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:50,687
And a man has no greater thing under the sun,

159
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,410
but eat, drink and be merry.

160
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,592
Ecclesiaste's, my favourite.

161
00:11:57,974 --> 00:12:00,495
My Grandma was a bit of a Bible thumper.

162
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:06,601
Weekends with Grandma meant long, long
Sundays at St Hilda's church of the Grand Epiphany.

163
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:10,324
Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell,
how are you doing?

164
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,626
I am a Prior of the Ori.

165
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:14,108
It's nice to meet you.

166
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,530
Your arrival here was foreseen.

167
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:18,732
No kidding.

168
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:21,914
So you see the future, do you?

169
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:25,458
Lessons of days gone by
teach us what will come to pass.

170
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:29,661
I'm a bit of a history buff myself.
Doesn't help me pick the lotto numbers though.

171
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:32,064
So, where are you from?

172
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,726
Where we come from and where we are going,

173
00:12:34,947 --> 00:12:36,267
are all the same.

174
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:37,729
Oh I get ya.

175
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:42,794
Wherever you go, there you are.
I think that's Buckaroo Bonzai.

176
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:45,576
Me? I'm from a little planet called Earth.

177
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,839
The home of Daniel Jackson.

178
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,561
He never mentioned that before.

179
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:56,966
You know Dr. Jackson, do you?

180
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:59,448
From him did we learn of your need.

181
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,931
Our need for what?

182
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:05,934
The revelation of your destiny.

183
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,181
Doci.

184
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:42,286
Leave us.

185
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,817
Hello, I'm...

186
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:55,418
Daniel Jackson.

187
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,860
Right.

188
00:13:57,901 --> 00:14:00,223
From the planet Earth.

189
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:07,789
OK. So you know my name and
where I'm from, so I assume you also know how
I'm connected to this man's mind.

190
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,672
Why I'm here.

191
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:12,934
You see, we're explorers.

192
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,276
We'd very much like to get to know you.

193
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:18,479
Your society. How you came to be.

194
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:22,282
A Prior has been dispatched
to the place from whence you've come.

195
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:29,789
Really. You can do that.
I thought we were in another galaxy.

196
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:37,796
It is the will of the Ori, that we should spread
Origin to all those blessed by their creation.

197
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:45,222
OK, well, then you should understand
that there are many different kinds of people
in the place from whence I come.

198
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:48,645
People who believe in many different things.

199
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:51,348
They shall find the path to enlightenment.

200
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:53,848
Right. Well I think you should also understand

201
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:56,713
that they may not see your way as the only way.

202
00:14:57,553 --> 00:15:01,917
The power and the greatness
of the Ori cannot be denied!

203
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:07,722
Those who reject the path
to enlightenment, must be destroyed.

204
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:12,287
Right. I was afraid of that.

205
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:25,438
George Washington, one of our country's
founding fathers and first President,
once said, true friendship is a plant of slow growth,

206
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:31,463
and must undergo and understand the shocks of
adversity, before it is entitled to the appellation.

207
00:15:32,344 --> 00:15:35,907
The First Prime of Horus,
Kar'ek of the High Plains once said,

208
00:15:35,947 --> 00:15:41,392
there is more honour in dying at the hands of
a brother, than there is killing a would-be friend.

209
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:45,355
He was a wise man.

210
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,762
He was killed shortly after losing one
of the greatest battles in history.

211
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:54,564
Oh well,
I hope it wasn't his brother that shot him.

212
00:15:54,904 --> 00:16:01,570
It was me. The Jaffa was a fool in every respect.
He did not deserve an honourable death.

213
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,571
I see.

214
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:06,374
<i>Unscheduled incoming wormhole!</i>

215
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:13,040
I'd better see what this is about.
Teal'c, please escort our guest to the briefing room.

216
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:25,392
The Book of Origin says, those who seek the path
to enlightenment must not be led astray!

217
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:30,196
Right. See, that could be interpreted
a number of different ways.

218
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:34,799
I think maybe I know what the Ori are. Who they are.

219
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:41,205
And I'm not denying they are very powerful beings,
but if I'm right, they're not Gods.

220
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:46,090
They're like the ascended beings I know.
They simply have a greater understanding
of the knowledge of the universe.

221
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,654
What is a God, but a being
that is worshipped by those beneath?

222
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:56,819
Is great knowledge, power, understanding
not enough for you to revere the Ori?

223
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:59,021
Respect, yes certainly. But...

224
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:02,024
that doesn't mean
I would murder innocent people in their name.

225
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,025
I guess what I'm trying to understand is,

226
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:07,629
whether the Ori have spoken to you directly
and told you to worship them.

227
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:12,033
Or whether you've misinterpreted
some evidence you've found along the way and

228
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,874
developed this religion on your own.

229
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:16,957
I can't speak for everyone in my galaxy,
but in my own humble opinion,

230
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:21,602
I don't believe that any individual
or society can achieve enlightenment
through fear-mongering and forced servitude,

231
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,003
no matter what power is presented as evidence.

232
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,847
That's something the ascended beings I know,
very clearly seemed to understand.

233
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,210
Don't get me wrong, I mean, we should
all try to better ourselves. I mean, if

234
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,552
ascension really is the ultimate end
we're trying to achieve, then so be it, but...

235
00:17:33,592 --> 00:17:36,475
we should all be allowed to
get there or not of our own free will.

236
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,859
You can kill me for saying that,
but that is what I believe in.

237
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,862
And nothing you say or do will ever change my mind.

238
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:51,688
Come.

239
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:10,104
The Ori hear you.

240
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:36,909
We do not require blind faith.

241
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:42,113
Only that you believe what
you see and know it to be true.

242
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:45,696
I realize this is just a friendly meeting,

243
00:18:45,737 --> 00:18:50,421
but on behalf of our planet's leaders, I've been asked
to present a few thoughts for you to consider.

244
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:58,167
Some points that we can discuss in the future.
Possibly looking forward to an official treaty
between our world and the Jaffa nation.

245
00:18:58,248 --> 00:18:59,048
Who is that?

246
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:12,540
Lt Col Mitchell,
SG-12 and a gentleman we encountered on another planet,
who claims that he represents some Gods called the Ori.

247
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:18,706
I think we have yet to see the real fallout
from dismantling the infrastructure
established by the Goa'uld.

248
00:19:18,745 --> 00:19:25,471
Indeed. We have already seen the rise of individuals
and organizations who have threatened to challenge us.

249
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,953
There are as many Humans out there as there are Jaffa.

250
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:37,062
But if we don't continue to work together,
the victory that we both worked so long
and hard for, could result in chaos.

251
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:46,470
We are Ori.

252
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,672
You instruct these people to worship you.

253
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:55,538
We are their creators.
All who follow the path will join us in enlightenment.

254
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:57,179
Do you know who the Alterans are?

255
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,382
Those who abandon the path are evil.

256
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:02,785
Evil? Why?

257
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:04,286
They shielded you.

258
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:07,990
Really. I didn't really think they did much
of anything for us, but I guess I was wrong.

259
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:14,395
The truth of the universe has been obstructed.
All will learn the power of the Ori.

260
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:23,704
Hallowed are the Ori

261
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:31,010
Vitals are returning to normal.

262
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,212
I wonder what that was all about?

263
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,734
I don't know, but he was in some sort of distress.

264
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:42,020
We can't seem to disconnect
the stones or turn off the device.

265
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:44,622
It is the will of the Ori.

266
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:49,566
Figured you might say that.
Are you sure there's nothing you can do?

267
00:20:50,107 --> 00:20:54,350
You help us out, I guarantee we'll be more receptive
to those stories you wanna tell.

268
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:55,732
Call it a miracle if you want.

269
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:05,040
When Hanomere fell from above and learn't
to fly on the way down, that was a miracle.

270
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:07,943
Right.

271
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:12,847
These planets you've mentioned,
all have plentiful naquadah mines on them.

272
00:21:13,347 --> 00:21:15,949
And substantial Human populations.

273
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,651
Whose side are you on, Jaffa?

274
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:22,256
There are no sides here.
Just topics of conversation.

275
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:29,342
I wish to meet this Prior of the Ori.
If he preaches faith in false Gods,

276
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:36,568
then that is a concern for all of us.
I wish to hear his claims and challenge him.

277
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:56,045
What's going on?

278
00:21:56,086 --> 00:21:56,927
This is bad.

279
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,487
Worse than being burned to death?

280
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:00,990
It appears our ascended Ancients
and the Ori have a slight difference of opinion.

281
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,593
See the Ori seem to think that because they're ascended,
Human beings should worship them.

282
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:05,594
All Humans.

283
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:06,615
And if we don't?

284
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:08,697
Then the world where
we're living should be destroyed.

285
00:22:08,737 --> 00:22:11,339
I don't think enlightenment means
what they think it means.

286
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,702
See, apparently, our Ascended Ancients have been
shielding our existence from the Ori.

287
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:16,304
They've been protecting us.

288
00:22:16,343 --> 00:22:19,987
The Ori seem to think that our Ancients
are evil because they haven't shared
the secrets of the universe with us.

289
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:21,809
Well I hate secrets. At least the ones I don't know.

290
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:25,532
See the problem is, the Ori now know our galaxy
is inhabited by Humans, because of us!

291
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:28,875
I refuse to accept the blame for that.
Curiosity is part of Human nature.

292
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:32,519
Look, if the Ancients knew that the Ori were so bad,
why didn't they stop us from coming here?

293
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:33,159
Free will.

294
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:39,124
Right. If they have been protecting us,
there's no reason to believe they won't continue.

295
00:22:39,564 --> 00:22:42,748
The Ancients may protect us from the Ori,
but not their Human followers.

296
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:45,210
See Ancients won't interfere
on any lower planes of existence.

297
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,813
If anybody from our galaxy wants
to worship the Ori, apparently that's our choice.

298
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:52,336
And they won't stop Priors from coming through
the gate because apparently they've already sent one.

299
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:54,838
The Ori have given Priors special power
and that's not fair.

300
00:22:54,878 --> 00:22:58,441
They're still Human and highly evolved Humans
can have some pretty amazing abilities.

301
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:06,448
They're using the secrets of the universe that the Ori
have given them, to spread world of the Ori's Godliness
and when people don't see the light, it's gonna be...

302
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:07,249
What are we gonna do?

303
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:10,651
I don't know. I'm starting to think
that sending Priors is just the beginning.

304
00:23:11,252 --> 00:23:13,454
We could be talking crusade here.
We need to warn Earth.

305
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:14,976
We need to get out of these people.

306
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,170
Take the unbelievers back to Veraga.

307
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:36,115
Let its cleansing mark forever
the beginning of a new age.

308
00:23:37,776 --> 00:23:42,381
Evil has raised a great many unbelievers
in a far off place.

309
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,283
They must be shown the path.

310
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,685
Hallowed are the Ori.

311
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:50,688
Hallowed are the Ori.

312
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,001
What are they doing?

313
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:10,405
Why did he bring us back here?

314
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:16,910
I think he's using us to weed out
any other heretics that might be here.

315
00:24:17,411 --> 00:24:23,917
I still don't get why the Ori just don't do it
themselves. They're supposed to be Gods.
Aren't Gods all seeing, all knowing, all powerful?

316
00:24:23,957 --> 00:24:26,720
The universe is infinite remember?
Apparently that's a lot to keep track of.

317
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,121
I suppose.

318
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,624
They didn't even know about our galaxy.
Well, until recently.

319
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:38,830
It's not our fault. You'd think at least
they keep on top of their own people.

320
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:46,236
I get the feeling the Ori that their devout followers
do their enforcing for them to confirm their loyalty.

321
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,120
OK. Why did we let the Prior bring us back here?

322
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,362
Well, because I don't think
he was gonna give us much choice.

323
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:57,026
And besides, I'm starting to think
that might be our best way to contact Earth
and warn them about what we know.

324
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:57,747
How?

325
00:24:58,648 --> 00:25:01,250
Well Phanis said that his sect
have found other artifacts.

326
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,553
You think they also have a terminal
device to go with the stones.

327
00:25:03,592 --> 00:25:07,455
If they do and we can find it and
hook up the stones, well we will get
this communication thing going both ways.

328
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:12,060
Right. If the Prior is using us
to weed out other unbelievers.

329
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,064
How do we make contact
with Phanis without giving him away?

330
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:17,585
We can't.

331
00:25:20,307 --> 00:25:22,309
You do not believe in a higher power?

332
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:23,990
Well it's complicated.

333
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:27,033
There are a lot of different points of view
about that subject around here.

334
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:32,659
The Jaffa have recently shed the dominance of false
Gods that have enslaved us for many generations.

335
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,921
But many have long believed
in a path to enlightenment.

336
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:38,283
Origin will guide you on this path.

337
00:25:38,424 --> 00:25:41,686
Those who revere its wisdom, shall be uplifted.

338
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:44,849
I have come to spread the word to the unbelievers

339
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:49,293
who have been sheltered and raised by evil.

340
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:53,757
You have no idea how much he sounds like my Grandma.

341
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,264
It's a pretty big village and I suspect
that Phanis and his gang did a reasonable
job of hiding sacrilegious artifacts.

342
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:04,907
Well we have to do something.

343
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,640
No, no, no!

344
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,961
Phanis!

345
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,404
You shouldn't have come.

346
00:26:24,644 --> 00:26:25,806
They're using us to get to you!

347
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:27,327
So I suspected.

348
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:30,009
Either that or you've truly come
to see the power of the Ori.

349
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:30,770
Bloody likely.

350
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,351
You have to leave.

351
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:35,975
If I can help you speak the reality
of our existence to your people,

352
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:43,100
maybe one day in turn,
you'll spread that word back here.

353
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,562
You said you had other artifacts besides the stones.

354
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:46,084
I'll show you.

355
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:47,805
No, just tell me!

356
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:53,129
Now we're looking for a large dome
shaped object with a blue crystal on top.
The stones fit inside of it.

357
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,071
Come.

358
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,932
Phanis!

359
00:26:57,934 --> 00:26:59,095
You're risking your life.

360
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:01,457
Harrid, Sallis and I,

361
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:06,262
all those who believe as we do,
have known for some time that
we may give our lives for our cause.

362
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:11,066
We only hope one day the truth
comes to bear as a result.

363
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,177
And...

364
00:27:52,682 --> 00:27:55,525
Something just happened.

365
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,567
Phanis?

366
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:42,287
And the people shall deliver the wicked

367
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:45,209
unto your divine judgment.

368
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,293
Where their sins shall be weighed in balance

369
00:28:49,414 --> 00:28:54,858
with all that is just and true.

370
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:06,508
The Ori are great!

371
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,190
I love the Ori!

372
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,671
I am a believer!

373
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:13,874
What's the matter with you people!
I'm telling you, I've seen the light!!

374
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:15,717
I don't think they're buying it.

375
00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:17,839
Ah, I've heard you do better!

376
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:34,213
Glorious are the Ori who lead us to salvation.

377
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:39,378
Who did fight the evil that
would doom us to mortal sin.

378
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:45,003
Did they defeat the old spirits
and cast them out. And now

379
00:29:45,143 --> 00:29:52,409
for the strength of our will, they do call upon us
to prevail against the corruption of all unbelievers.

380
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,414
Well, second times a charm.

381
00:29:57,794 --> 00:30:01,478
The Ori do not shield this knowledge as others might,

382
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:04,240
selfish in their powerful advantage.

383
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:08,364
They lead you to their realm with
the path that is laid out in the book of Origin.

384
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:12,167
All you need do is follow their teachings.

385
00:30:12,207 --> 00:30:18,092
I'm very sorry, you'll have to excuse
us for a moment. Please continue. Colonel.

386
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:22,476
They woke up just for a moment
and then they lost consciousness again.

387
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:24,317
Did they say anything?

388
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:26,340
Yes they did.

389
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:28,782
Guide us on the path

390
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:33,866
so that we may triumph over the enemy of our salvation

391
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:42,354
and be with you in the end of ends,
on the plains of enlightenment.

392
00:30:50,721 --> 00:30:51,883
What's the meaning of this?

393
00:30:51,922 --> 00:30:58,168
Very sorry, we've just received
some information about our visitor here,
which demands we take every precaution.

394
00:30:59,008 --> 00:31:02,692
We'll have to take the staff, Sir.

395
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:08,077
And you'll have to come with us.

396
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,718
I demand to know what you've learned!

397
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,581
All I wish to do is spread the word
of the Ori to your world.

398
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,823
Actually, that was never going to happen.

399
00:31:15,864 --> 00:31:17,985
Then I must leave at once!

400
00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:21,228
That's not gonna happen either.

401
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:23,450
Hallowed are the Ori.

402
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:27,114
Hallowed are the Ori.

403
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:34,340
Hallowed are the Ori.

404
00:32:09,932 --> 00:32:15,136
<i>Code Blue.
Medical emergency to science lab one. Repeat code blue.</i>

405
00:32:28,007 --> 00:32:30,450
Same as before, only this time it's both of them.

406
00:32:32,372 --> 00:32:35,235
Now hold on. This device draws
its power directly from subspace.

407
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:37,516
It'll react very badly to an explosion.
You can't blow it up.

408
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:38,778
Perhaps we should send it through the Stargate.

409
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:39,298
Genius.

410
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:43,422
No! It also uses subspace to communicate
with another galaxy across the universe.

411
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,525
I mean, there's no reason to believe
that Daniel and Vala won't stay connected
to it, even from another planet!

412
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,727
I have a different idea.
Tell them to start dialing the Gate.

413
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:50,387
Where too?

414
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:51,669
Wherever.

415
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:54,211
Wherever. Alright.

416
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:10,946
Chevron 2 encoded.

417
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:13,588
Chevron 3 encoded.

418
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:14,069
Walter.

419
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:15,790
Orders from Colonel Mitchell, Sir.

420
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,072
Proceed.

421
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:19,954
Chevron 4 encoded.

422
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:24,058
Out of the way!

423
00:33:29,262 --> 00:33:31,984
Chevron 6 encoded.

424
00:33:32,105 --> 00:33:34,427
Not yet Walter! Not yet!

425
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:36,910
Halting dialing sequence.

426
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:43,795
Blood pressure's dropping, their heart
rates rising, they're going into shock.

427
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,519
Now!

428
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,042
Resuming dialing sequence!

429
00:33:51,182 --> 00:33:55,225
Chevron seven, locked!

430
00:34:03,512 --> 00:34:04,994
Charge at 200.

431
00:34:05,134 --> 00:34:06,935
Clear!

432
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,514
General Landry.

433
00:34:37,383 --> 00:34:42,507
Dr Lam say's that Daniel and Vala
have regained consciousness.

434
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,548
Well done!

435
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:47,352
You see, that's what I'm talking about!

436
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,213
You have served the Ori well.

437
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:12,694
I bow in humble account.

438
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:19,660
Come and gaze upon the flames of enlightenment.

439
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:28,248
Let its power wash over you.

440
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:57,834
Great holy armies shall be gathered
and trained to fight all who embrace evil.

441
00:35:58,174 --> 00:36:03,539
In the name of the Gods, ships shall be built
to carry our warriors out amongst the stars

442
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:09,144
and we will spread Origin to all the unbelievers!

443
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:13,187
The power of the Ori will be felt far and wide

444
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:16,330
and the wicked shall be vanquished.

445
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,535
Hallowed are the Ori.

446
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:24,738
Hallowed are the Ori.

447
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,890
Thank you.

448
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:46,717
General Landry is ready for us.

449
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:55,085
So you think we should expect more
of these Priors to show up?

450
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,847
I would be very surprised if they didn't.

451
00:36:57,887 --> 00:37:02,812
How? We know one came through the Stargate,
but if their galaxy is so far away.

452
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:05,534
I suspect the Ori have the power
to make a lot of things happen.

453
00:37:05,574 --> 00:37:08,016
Still for the Priors, I think we can
assume it's a one way trip.

454
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:10,739
Don't think they have a problem with self sacrifice.

455
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:17,064
You think the Ancients here in our galaxy
will continue to stop the Ori from using
their power to attack us directly?

456
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:18,506
I hope so.

457
00:37:18,545 --> 00:37:20,788
So how do we fight these guys?

458
00:37:20,828 --> 00:37:23,751
And I mean the message as much as the men.

459
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,433
A lot of folks out there are gonna buy
what these guys are selling.

460
00:37:26,473 --> 00:37:30,396
Hopefully now, many have been educated
to the ways of false Gods.

461
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:34,961
Yes, but we're not talking about Humans with
snakes in their heads and a slightly better
understanding of technology.

462
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:36,762
You see, the power isn't false.

463
00:37:36,803 --> 00:37:40,005
The Priors are gonna offer to people
what will seem like proof of God.

464
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:42,887
Proof of powerful beings is not proof of God.

465
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,008
I'm not saying it is.

466
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:48,292
Look, just because we know there are some beings
on a higher plane of existence than ourselves,

467
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:53,276
does not mean there is not an order
of being higher than them.

468
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:55,238
Least I reckon that's what my Grandma would say.

469
00:37:55,378 --> 00:37:57,801
The universe is supposedly infinite.

470
00:37:57,941 --> 00:38:01,103
Which in my book, makes it impossible
to know everything.

471
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:07,109
I mean, somewhere in there you gotta fill
in the blanks with a little faith.

472
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,112
I had a Grandma too.

473
00:38:11,794 --> 00:38:14,556
So. Business as usual Sir?

474
00:38:14,595 --> 00:38:15,837
Let them bring it.

475
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,239
We'll use our strengths against their weaknesses.

476
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,084
That's a pretty good strategy
for any kind of business you're in.

477
00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:27,167
I'm glad you two are OK.

478
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:33,693
Amen.

479
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:41,900
Hey!

480
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:45,223
Wow, what the hell are you doing here?

481
00:38:45,263 --> 00:38:46,665
Nice to see you too.

482
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:49,907
No, I'm awfully sorry.
I just wasn't expecting to see you.

483
00:38:49,947 --> 00:38:53,631
Ah well, I was in the neighbourhood

484
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:58,075
and I've got a little surprise for Mitchell.

485
00:38:58,114 --> 00:39:01,117
Oh. Yeah, he loved the last one. The...

486
00:39:01,157 --> 00:39:04,480
fact that you didn't tell him that we were
all moving onto different positions.

487
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:07,363
Yeah. Sorry you missed Daedalus.

488
00:39:07,403 --> 00:39:08,724
No you're not.

489
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:11,406
You're right. I'm not.

490
00:39:13,288 --> 00:39:16,490
Listen, I just had a briefing with Landry

491
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:21,055
about your stuff.

492
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,738
Sounds like it could be a problem.

493
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:28,542
Well... We've been up against
some pretty bad guys before.

494
00:39:28,581 --> 00:39:30,824
Not so pretty.

495
00:39:30,864 --> 00:39:32,545
Overdressed, yes.

496
00:39:32,585 --> 00:39:33,866
Through some tough situations.

497
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:35,948
That we always won.

498
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:42,634
Yeah, but didn't you feel that was
because we had someone looking out for us?

499
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:47,238
I don't think I would say this
to anyone else, but for the first time,

500
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:48,639
I'm scared.

501
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,446
I'm hungry.

502
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:00,850
Me too.

503
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,932
Come on.

504
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,302
Yeah man!

505
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:16,664
This is good.

506
00:40:16,944 --> 00:40:18,025
Still a rush.

507
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:19,067
Yeah.

508
00:40:19,106 --> 00:40:24,311
I didn't know why you didn't get back
on the horse-seater, except I didn't think
you could take one of these things for a joyride.

509
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:28,154
You see, that's one of
the great things about being a General.

510
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:30,677
You pretty much get to do whatever you want.

511
00:40:30,717 --> 00:40:34,360
Especially after you saved
the world seven or eight times.

512
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,561
Who's counting?

513
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,403
Teal'c.

514
00:40:37,443 --> 00:40:41,046
Actually, he mentions it quite often.

515
00:40:42,847 --> 00:40:46,611
So Mitchell. I hear you haven't
picked out your team yet.

516
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:48,732
I'm hoping I won't have to, Sir.

517
00:40:48,773 --> 00:40:51,936
Why, did General Landry say something about it, Sir?

518
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:53,337
He did.

519
00:40:53,377 --> 00:40:55,338
Are you going to tell me Sir?

520
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:58,702
He said you're gonna be fine, Mitchell.

521
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:00,303
Thank you Sir.

522
00:41:00,343 --> 00:41:02,265
Do you mind if I kick in the afterburners Sir?

523
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,067
Oh please!

524
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:05,788
Thank you Sir.
