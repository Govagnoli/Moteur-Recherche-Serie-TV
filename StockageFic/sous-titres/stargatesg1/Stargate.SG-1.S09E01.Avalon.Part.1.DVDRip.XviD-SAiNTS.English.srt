1
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,550
- Who's that?
- Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell.

2
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:20,344
Two years ago,
dogfight over Antarctica.

3
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,565
SG-1 found the Ancient outpost,
took out Anubis' fleet.

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,359
That's him?

5
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:26,894
That's him.

6
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:34,544
<i>Remember, no matter what,
we're here to protect SG-1 at all costs.</i>

7
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:41,684
Target the Al'kesh first, gliders second.

8
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:44,812
Go low boys and girls, Prometheus has our backs.

9
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,751
Break left,
two gliders at our three o'clock.

10
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:04,124
Prometheus!

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,819
<i>SG-1, this is Hammond, do you read?</i>

12
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:09,272
Yes Sir, it's good to see you!

13
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:18,763
Contact!
One bandit on the deck and inbound.

14
00:01:18,773 --> 00:01:20,191
Tally one.

15
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:26,089
Fox two, Fox two.

16
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:28,984
So close...

17
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:33,480
<i>We've been hit! Left thruster is down.</i>

18
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:35,632
<i>Contact, two gliders on our six!</i>

19
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:50,022
Blue leader, we've got your six.

20
00:01:57,255 --> 00:01:59,007
Nice shot, Red!

21
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:08,558
- He's been hit!
- Red One?

22
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,595
He's gone.

23
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,851
Chief Master Sergeant Walter Harriman.

24
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:29,355
The General's ready for you, Colonel.

25
00:02:30,573 --> 00:02:33,701
- Bigger than I thought it'd be.
- Yes Sir.

26
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,563
Welcome to Stargate Command!

27
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:43,823
Season 9 - Episode 1
Avalon (Part 1)

28
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,629
Feel free to have a seat,
General Landry will be with you shortly.

29
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:50,750
He's finishing up a briefing with SG-12.

30
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:52,709
Thank you, Sergeant.

31
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,688
<i>Alright boys and girls, listen up.</i>

32
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:11,148
We've got a change of plans.

33
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,148
New orders from Gen. Hammond.
We are no longer going after Anubis' mothership.

34
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:17,868
SG-1 is on his way to Antarctica on a cargo ship.

35
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:21,307
- SG-1?
- They think they may have
found the Lost City of the Ancients.

36
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,747
- In Antarctica?
- Doesn't matter where they are,
or what it is they're doing,

37
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:26,027
It's SG-1 and we're gonna cover their asses.

38
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,667
E.T.A. is nine minutes,
expect ennemy to throw everything they have at us.

39
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:30,866
Alright, saddle up folks!

40
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,746
<i>Cocky sons of bitches!</i>

41
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:35,946
Marines! Never liked them.

42
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:41,426
- You must be Colonel Mitchell.
- Yes, Sir.

43
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:43,346
It's good to be here, Sir.

44
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:47,225
Your service record's impeccable, Mitchell.
What's wrong with ya?

45
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:50,866
- Sir?
- Nobody's perfect.

46
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:53,865
Everyone has some sort of character flaw,
what's yours?

47
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,804
Sometimes I can be impatient, Sir.

48
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:00,825
All pilots have "Type A" personalities.

49
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:03,064
I'm talking about your kryptonite.

50
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:07,224
Don't worry, I'll figure it out. Walter?

51
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:10,704
<i>The files on the desk are the personnel
folders you're about to request, Sir.</i>

52
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,044
About to request?
Walter, I'd appreciated...

53
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:14,864
<i>You have to push the button to talk, Sir!</i>

54
00:05:19,164 --> 00:05:20,843
Thank you, Walter.

55
00:05:21,384 --> 00:05:24,783
The thing that's hardest to get used to, around here,

56
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,823
It's how good everybody is at their job!

57
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:33,423
The fact is, I like yelling at people!
Never got the damn chance.

58
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:36,202
I'll try not to lower the average, Sir.

59
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,342
Oh, a self deprecating sense of humour.

60
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:44,942
You think it'll make people like you,
despite your outward perfection?

61
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:46,582
No.

62
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:50,261
Here you go son, get started.

63
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:51,781
Sir?

64
00:05:51,862 --> 00:05:56,781
You heard the disconnected voice of the
little Sergeant with psychic powers.

65
00:05:56,941 --> 00:06:00,061
Those are personnel files. Start picking a team.

66
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,100
General, I'm here to join SG-1.

67
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,820
Colonel, you're here to lead SG-1.

68
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,700
What about Lt. Col. Carter?

69
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,740
Well, she's taken command of
Stargate's R and D out of Area 51.

70
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,059
- Since when?
- Last week!

71
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:23,499
And Daniel Jackson?

72
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:26,499
Dr. Jackson put in for reassignement.

73
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,139
Teal'c left the program over a month ago,
I'm surprised Gen O'Neill didn't tell you!

74
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,099
No.

75
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,378
That's Jack for you?

76
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,578
You know, I looked for the key for that desk
for a week, before I finally got him to admit,

77
00:06:40,898 --> 00:06:44,858
He never had one! The man never opened
a drawer the whole time he was here.

78
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:47,938
I'm sorry, Sir.

79
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:51,977
The reason that I requested this post...

80
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:57,617
Why I worked so hard...

81
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:04,217
Expresses himself poorly
when faced with unexpected challenge.

82
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:08,616
Your sheet says you have
outstanding leadership skills.

83
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:15,456
Take the files, Colonel. Choose your team
before I start to question the accuracy of that claim.

84
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,255
Yes Sir.

85
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,455
Doctor Jackson.

86
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:27,335
Colonel.

87
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,655
- My friends call me Cameron.
- Daniel.

88
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:34,494
- How are you?
- I'm good, thanks.

89
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,695
- Yeah, I heard you were coming.
- Yeah, they told me you were leaving.

90
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:39,935
Yeah, finally.

91
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:43,214
You don't wanna help?

92
00:07:43,414 --> 00:07:46,054
No, actually I came to see if
I could talk you into staying.

93
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:47,334
You're kidding.

94
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:50,494
I've been given command of SG-1.

95
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,013
Good for you, you deserve it.

96
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:57,774
'Think the SGC still needs you.

97
00:07:58,013 --> 00:07:59,533
There's lots of other guys.

98
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,033
You're the world's formost expert on the Ancients.

99
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:05,132
Yes, that's why I'm going to Atlantis,
"city of the Ancients".

100
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:06,913
Listen,

101
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:13,012
Gen. O'Neill gave me the choice of
any posting I wanted, I chose SG-1.

102
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,092
That meant Col. Carter, Teal'c and yourself,
not two letters, a dash and a number.

103
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:18,112
That's nice.

104
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:21,731
I wanted to be on the frontline, working with the best.
I wanted to learn from you.

105
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,671
- Look, this is all very flattering but...
- Thats not the point.

106
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:28,251
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,491
And I know why, I owe you one.

108
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:33,891
We all do.

109
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:39,930
We've lost the turbines.

110
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:42,650
Heads up Blue leader, this is Carter.
We have another bandit incoming.

111
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:44,010
I see it, Major.

112
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,609
Fox two.

113
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:54,410
Splash. One Alkesh!

114
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:00,149
That was close...

115
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:05,128
Listen, Jackson...

116
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:08,888
I don't want you to stay
because you think you owe me one.

117
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:12,408
- Unless of course you're considering it.
- Oh, no, no...

118
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:17,128
I was just going to offer you my appartement...

119
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,368
Right.

120
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:27,287
<i>Brother, I love what you've done with the place.</i>

121
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:31,567
These columns were salvaged and
restored from the original Ancient monument.

122
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:33,626
Well it's got a real High Council feel to it.

123
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:36,486
I hope you've taken lots of Before and After pictures.

124
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:38,687
Where's the rest of your team, Colonel Mitchell?

125
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:42,127
Actually, it's still kinda SG-Me.

126
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,726
That's one of the reasons I'm here.

127
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:46,006
I was hoping,

128
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:47,846
maybe you could help me.

129
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,926
I can offer some names of those
I consider to be honourable warriors.

130
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,445
I appreciate that. I know you're busy.

131
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:59,045
We are attempting to build
a whole new system of government

132
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:01,605
and expand Jaffa worlds throughout the galaxy.

133
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:03,205
Yeah, how's that going?

134
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:04,605
Not well.

135
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:09,044
Well, your people did just renounce their gods.
I guess we gotta cut them a bit of a break.

136
00:10:09,164 --> 00:10:14,204
Too many are still steeped in an old culture full of
antiquated rituals and are slow to accept change.

137
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:17,604
I understand Major Davies
and SG-7 are trying to help out.

138
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,164
That has caused problems as well.

139
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:23,284
Many view the Tau'ri with the same
level of mistrust as a would be enemy.

140
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:27,563
They see the proposed system of government as a means
to control and subvert their newly acquired freedom.

141
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:29,203
My allegiance to the Tau'ri

142
00:10:29,243 --> 00:10:33,643
is not serving me as well as you might think in winning
votes from the most traditional Jaffa electorate.

143
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:38,402
- Politics really does suck everywhere you go.
- Indeed.

144
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:43,043
Listen, maybe it's a good thing I came by.

145
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:46,562
If this doesn't work out,
before all the space on the team fills...

146
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:49,042
Teal'c, the Council's returning from recess.

147
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:51,762
- I must go.
- Sure.

148
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,042
It was good to see you, Colonel Mitchell.

149
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:55,641
I will forward a list of names as soon as I am able.

150
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:57,601
Have fun!

151
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,881
Did I mention I'm on a mission for God?

152
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,801
Okay, never mind.

153
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:05,761
Yo, you wanna join SG-1?

154
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,720
Hi.
Cameron Mitchell, Colonel.

155
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:11,681
Excuse me, can you tell me wich way to the Stargate?

156
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:13,280
Stargate, Chappa'ai?

157
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,761
Just... point a finger!

158
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,080
- Hi, Cameron!
- Hey, Sam, it's good to see you.

159
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,560
Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.
We have been up to our ears

160
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,199
double checking the new hyperdrive,

161
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,719
and then the uplink was jammed with the long range
plotting program being transmitted by the Asgard...

162
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:36,958
No need to bore you.
How you been? You look good.

163
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:41,358
Thanks. Listen, Sam, come back and rejoin SG-1.

164
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:43,919
I heard you'd be given command, congratulations.

165
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:48,078
I'm not kidding. You can keep an eye on R and D
in your spare time, just like you always have.

166
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:51,758
Besides, Dr. Lee is pouting
because you got the post over him.

167
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:54,478
- Really?
- No, I made that up.

168
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:57,318
I have my reasons for wanting this job.

169
00:11:57,478 --> 00:12:03,677
I had my reasons for wanting this job, one of them, was
working with you and please, do not say that's nice.

170
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:04,877
We'll still work together.

171
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:08,636
Won't be the same.
What if the world need saving?

172
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:11,537
Well, if the world needs saving,
I will be here to do what I can.

173
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:16,837
What if the world needs saving because
I screwed up cos you weren't here in the first place?

174
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:21,756
- How about we pretend I didn't say that?
- Done.

175
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:26,075
<i>Lt. Col. Carter to the bridge.
Lt. Col. Carter please report immediatly to the bridge.</i>

176
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:28,835
- Sorry, I gotta go.
- Yeah.

177
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:33,395
- Buy you breakfast when you get back on solid ground.
- You're on. Talk to you soon.

178
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:47,234
Well, Walter, doesn't look like
we're getting the band back together.

179
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:49,754
<i>I can't shake it. Reroute power to...</i>

180
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:55,953
Banks, you okay?

181
00:12:59,074 --> 00:12:59,953
Banks!!

182
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:03,993
I'm losing it, hang on back there.

183
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:06,513
Eject! Eject!

184
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:08,913
Damnit, ejection failed.

185
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:13,433
Mayday, mayday!
We are going in, repeat, we are going in!

186
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:28,232
So did you decide to go with the desk

187
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:31,552
at an angle or flush with the door?

188
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:36,151
Is that what this is about? You come all the way
to Colorado Springs to check up on me.

189
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:39,951
No I had to sign the papers to my house,

190
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,350
and my car,

191
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:43,191
motorcycle.

192
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:47,150
You know, I'll never forget that day on
the front porch of my house.

193
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,150
You standing there saying you wanted to tell me
something about the Stargate Program.

194
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:53,750
I thought one of us had truly lost his mind.

195
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,070
That may actually be true.

196
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,749
How are things working out for Mitchell?

197
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:06,469
Well you could have told him that SG1 had
been reassigned. You should have seen his face.

198
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:07,749
Yeah,

199
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:09,349
I suppose huh.

200
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:11,749
He'll uh, he'll get his feet.

201
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,149
The man's a survivor.

202
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:19,348
He's also got the best of the best looking out for him.

203
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:24,148
A General's only as good as the people he commands.

204
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:25,548
Who said that?

205
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:28,547
I just did.

206
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,467
I mean, Douglas MacArthur may have
said something similar.

207
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:37,547
Didn't he also say there's no substitute

208
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:39,147
for winning?

209
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:47,947
Actually, it was in a war and
there's no substitute for victory.

210
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:51,946
You seem to have the knack for it.

211
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:57,745
I'm fluent in Mandarin, Russian, Spanish.
Three dialects of Goa'uld. Tenise, Golap

212
00:14:57,786 --> 00:15:01,546
and the yet unnamed language of
the cave people of P3K-447.

213
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:04,545
And of course, Ancient. Spoken as well as written.

214
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,145
Go ahead, say anything.

215
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:09,345
- Nah it's ok, I believe you.
- Toa puta ego.

216
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:12,545
Which is actually, just I believe you.

217
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,544
That's ok is a modern vernacular that
can't be directly translated into Ancient, however...

218
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:17,544
This is really unnecessary.

219
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,744
Ono mattah na tario.

220
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:23,105
Thank you.

221
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:27,544
87 mission hours to 32 alien planets.
Front line ground combat on four different occasions.

222
00:15:27,784 --> 00:15:32,744
I was hoping you could tell me something
about yourself. Something personal.

223
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,343
People call me Dave.

224
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:43,343
It says here, that's your name.

225
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:44,143
Yes.

226
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:49,543
The magnetic properties of the planet,
make it an excellent choice for the long term study

227
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,743
of positively charged ions on the neurons of the brain.

228
00:15:52,542 --> 00:16:01,702
... 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 ...

229
00:16:01,742 --> 00:16:06,501
We have modified
the android body recovered from PX3-989

230
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:11,541
and are currently incorporating the experiences of
every SG team member since the inception of the program,

231
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:13,741
into a viable artificial intelligence.

232
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:18,740
Wait a minute. Are you guys saying
that this thing actually exists?

233
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:23,340
We haven't received our funding, yet.
But we were hoping that with your support,

234
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,140
perhaps a funding body would look
more favourably on our proposal.

235
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,500
Don't make a decision yet.

236
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:34,299
We do have a precise but thorough
380 page report for you to...

237
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,739
Thousands of bright yellow, I don't know,
and they're coming from the surface.

238
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:38,940
I don't know what they are.

239
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:40,939
They're cutting the enemy fleet to shreds.

240
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,539
My god, it's beautiful.

241
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:44,539
They're the Ancient weapon.

242
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,738
It's SG-1, they've found what they were looking for.

243
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:48,139
All the ships are being destroyed.

244
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:50,739
They're just exploding everywhere we look.

245
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:53,899
Don't worry, it's gonna be ok.

246
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:56,338
- Respiration is weak.
- He's bleeding internally. I need an ultrasound.

247
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:59,138
Lt Adam Banks body was recovered at 0843 this morning.

248
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:03,478
Oh my God, Cameron?

249
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:06,337
I rate the chance of you walking, quite slim.

250
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:08,617
But with physiotherapy, hopefully...

251
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:10,737
None of us would be here today
if it wasn't for what you did.

252
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:16,437
The Congressional Medal Of Honour is the highest
award for valour in action against an enemy force,

253
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:21,037
that can be bestowed upon an individual serving
in the armed services of the United States Of America.

254
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:22,937
On behalf of the President...

255
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:23,937
You get well soon,

256
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,136
and when you do,

257
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:31,536
you can do anything you want, and I mean

258
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:36,335
professionally, anything you want.

259
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:41,435
Well not anything.

260
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:45,535
What's up Sir?

261
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:50,935
I wanted you here for this. SG-12 sent word five
minutes ago. They should be arriving, momentarily.

262
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:53,535
Receiving IDC. Opening the iris.

263
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:02,134
Well,

264
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:04,934
don't you all have me surrounded.

265
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:08,133
Welcome to the SGC. I'm General Landry.

266
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,533
Vala. Vala Mal Doran.

267
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:15,333
Thank you so much for the lovely greeting party.
We had a wondeful time searching each other, didn't we boys?

268
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,932
I know we haven't met.
In fact, I'm sure I would remember.

269
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:26,132
Lt-Col. Cameron Mitchell.

270
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:28,492
Nice outfit.

271
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:29,692
Thanks.

272
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:36,232
When I would normally be thrilled to have so much
testosterone at my disposal,

273
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:38,532
where's my Daniel?

274
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:46,691
OK, where is it?

275
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:49,970
Nice to see you too! How've you been?

276
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:53,130
The tablet! The one that leads
to the incredible Ancient buried treasure.

277
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,691
There is no tablet!

278
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:58,690
- What?
- I lied.

279
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:01,530
I had to tell you in person.

280
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,010
I'm pregnant.

281
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,730
Pretty sure it's yours. Anyway,
there's at least a one in...ten chance?

282
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:16,489
Dr Jackson, you're the reason
we let her through the gate.

283
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,529
I'm sorry Sir, I really have to finish packing.

284
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:20,729
The Daedalus doesn't leave for another 12 hours.

285
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:22,728
At least have a look.

286
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:28,528
Thank you.

287
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:38,127
Yep. Don't know where you got this,
but you got ripped off.

288
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:39,927
It's complete gibberish.

289
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:41,127
It's written in code.

290
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:49,127
Well I can't crack this in a few hours.

291
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:51,126
I know the cypher.

292
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:53,087
Then why do you need me?

293
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:58,726
Well reading it is one thing. Understanding it is
another. The individual I got this from assured me

294
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:02,526
that the treasure it describes is here on Earth.

295
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:07,725
Now I could have come by ship and looked for it myself,
but I know nothing about your fair planet,

296
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,125
other than it seems to have a rather interesting
if somewhat limited gene pool.

297
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,485
So where did you get this?

298
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:24,484
The Jaffa may have won their freedom,
but there's still more than a few Goa'uld out there.

299
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:28,125
Most of them have lost their dynasties though
and are either on the run or in hiding.

300
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:30,644
Yeah, they're plotting some
means of regaining their power.

301
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:38,724
Yes, and in the meantime they are having
a lot of trouble maintaining the lifestyle to which
they've grown so accustomed over the last 5000 years or so.

302
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:45,284
As such, there are a number of rather
interesting artifacts, currently on the market.

303
00:20:46,683 --> 00:20:49,883
Anyway, that isn't the issue.
The question is, what's it worth?

304
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:55,322
Well the Ancients aren't exactly known for secret
stashes of gold. Like these for example.

305
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:58,922
Wait a minute.

306
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:03,122
These markings are Goa'uld. The treasure is supposed to
be Ancient. What do they have to do with this?

307
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:05,842
These are actually only loosely related to the tablet.

308
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:06,802
Yeah, how?

309
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:08,922
Have you ever heard of the Goa'uld, Nut?

310
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,722
As in Cashew?

311
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:13,122
Pea?

312
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:15,322
Oh, you mean the Egyptian Sky Goddess.

313
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:15,911
Yes.

314
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:16,721
No, never heard of her.

315
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:21,321
These were her ceremonial marriage bracelets.
She wore one and her husband of the moment wore one.

316
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,121
Of the moment?

317
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,720
Yes, she had many.

318
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:25,721
One of the few admirable things about her.

319
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,320
Ow! What are you doing?

320
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,200
Security!

321
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,320
OK, that was fun, now take it off.

322
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,920
Not until we find the treasure.

323
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,719
What?

324
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,199
These bracelets link us together.

325
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,519
The tablet is mine and I want
my fair share of what it leads to.

326
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:06,718
That's the third blade I've gone through.

327
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:11,118
I'm not gonna be able to cut it off the hand.

328
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:15,077
If we remove the hand... I know that on first blush
that doesn't sound like a viable option.

329
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:18,078
But I understand that Dr Bennett
is becoming quite proficient at reattaching...

330
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:20,317
I thought SG-12 checked everything she had on her.

331
00:22:21,517 --> 00:22:22,117
They did.

332
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:26,597
And in their defence, at that time, the bracelet
wasn't giving off any kind of energy signature.

333
00:22:26,717 --> 00:22:29,116
I mean, even now it's barely measureable.

334
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,516
So what's it doing? I mean, how does it work?

335
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:32,517
Well...

336
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:34,716
I don't know.

337
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:39,916
No, no. I just need a little more time.

338
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:40,915
I'll find out.

339
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:49,315
Hey, are you ok?

340
00:22:56,915 --> 00:22:57,915
Come to torture me?

341
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:00,515
How old are you?

342
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:05,914
Mental abuse won't work either.

343
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:10,114
I have a daughter about your age.
Hasn't listened to me since she was twelve.

344
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:12,114
Doesn't matter what I say or do.

345
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:14,314
You're not going to bore me with
your personal life, are you?

346
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:16,114
I have to admit an hour or two of that might break me.

347
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:18,113
I don't like being deceived!

348
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:21,793
I'm not here to hurt anyone

349
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,813
and I really do hope this leads to something fabulous
for all of us, but it's not easy out there,

350
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,113
and I'm sure you can appreciate that a girl
has to do what a girl has to do to get by.

351
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:32,713
I am about as interested
in your sob story as you are in mine.

352
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:37,312
I just want you to know that Dr Jackson is the one
who recommended I let you through the gate.

353
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:40,912
He thought there was a chance that what
you had to offer might be legitimate.

354
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:46,111
And he's the one with an alien device
now stuck on his wrist.

355
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:50,911
Now how this plays out and
what you get out of it, in the end,

356
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:53,511
I'm going to leave entirely up to him.

357
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:55,511
So if I were you...

358
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,710
Teal'c?

359
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:16,509
Daniel Jackson.

360
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:19,709
How you doing?

361
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:22,509
Fine, I think.

362
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:25,309
I don't know what happened. I was...

363
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:26,668
It's the bracelet.

364
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:30,509
They are called Korm'ak.

365
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:32,308
Figured he might know.

366
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:37,108
Yeah, she said there was some sort
of weird Goa'uld Nut, marriage thing.

367
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,508
I do not believe that to be the case.

368
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:40,108
No?

369
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:41,308
No.

370
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:42,908
I should have known.

371
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,068
I have only heard of them in passing,
a very long time ago,

372
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:52,107
but I believe it was Cronus who used
this technology, when a prisoner of value
needed to be transported by one of his Jaffa.

373
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:57,347
He would have fixed a bracelet such as this to both
the prisoner and the Jaffa responsible for him.

374
00:24:57,387 --> 00:25:02,706
If they became separated for more than a short
period of time, they would both become ill and die.

375
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:03,706
Both?

376
00:25:03,986 --> 00:25:07,306
That's just about the stupidest thing I've ever heard!

377
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:11,106
You didn't know?

378
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:14,706
Well I knew it would make you sick,
I didnt know it would have the same effect on me too.

379
00:25:14,745 --> 00:25:15,906
How could you not know!

380
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:19,105
Because the person that I stole it
from didn't tell me that part!

381
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:29,704
Question. Why would the Goa'uld design
these things that way?

382
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:32,865
To punish the Jaffa for his incompetence.

383
00:25:33,305 --> 00:25:34,304
Right, of course.

384
00:25:34,905 --> 00:25:36,104
Can you take it off?

385
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:41,204
I am sorry Daniel Jackson, as I have said,
I have only heard of this technology in passing.

386
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:43,604
Please tell me you know how to take this off!!

387
00:25:45,404 --> 00:25:52,804
Yes, of course I do. I mean, that's assuming that the
person I stole them from was honest about that part.

388
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:54,903
Just do it!

389
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:59,303
All right! As soon as we find
the treasure and I get my fair share.

390
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:04,102
OK, just to clarify. When I kill her, I die?

391
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:07,303
Just as if you left her proximity.

392
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,702
Or we could just find the treasure.

393
00:26:15,302 --> 00:26:18,302
The Daedalus left two hours ago. Sorry.

394
00:26:22,301 --> 00:26:25,261
Look, the tablet is written in Ancient code, right?

395
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:31,701
I know it's not the Lost City of Atlantis we're looking
for here, but whatever it is, could be worth finding.

396
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:37,801
Or you just have to marry that chick.

397
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:40,900
Yeah! Let's make babies!

398
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:48,899
You're sure you have this cypher right?

399
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:49,899
Yes, why?

400
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:53,100
I can't believe I missed the Daedalus for this.

401
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:55,099
Get over it.

402
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,299
You don't have to get back to Dakara?

403
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:01,299
The council is in recess until tomorrow.

404
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:03,499
Curious?

405
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:04,899
Indeed.

406
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:07,698
See, this is good, isn't it?

407
00:27:07,898 --> 00:27:12,498
Being part of a team again?
Working together to unravel some cool Ancient mystery?

408
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:15,497
Right, so we're not working together.

409
00:27:15,698 --> 00:27:21,297
But any minute now I bet Dr Jackson discovers some key piece
of information that sets us off on a great adventure.

410
00:27:21,338 --> 00:27:22,497
This can't be right.

411
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:24,697
What is it?

412
00:27:25,697 --> 00:27:30,297
Well this is a portion of the database
the Atlantis expedition brought back
with them a few weeks ago. Specifically it's a

413
00:27:30,337 --> 00:27:34,897
log of the names of the Ancients who left the planet
when it was under Siege from the Wraith
and returned to Earth.

414
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,697
Thousands of years ago.

415
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:37,896
Yes.

416
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:39,897
And what does this have to do with the tablet?

417
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:43,896
See the tablet talks about a treasure, but it doesn't
make any specific reference at all to where it is.

418
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:45,696
Well it is supposed to be here.

419
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:48,896
That's what the person who I stole it from told me.

420
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:52,496
Before I stole it from him.

421
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:54,976
Well I think it is here and
I think I know where it is, too?

422
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,895
Alright, time out. If the tablet doesn't say.

423
00:27:57,935 --> 00:28:03,295
It doesn't say specifically,
but it is signed by a guy named Meardon.

424
00:28:08,695 --> 00:28:09,694
Never heard of him.

425
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:13,494
I think you have and the amazing part is,
his name also appears in the database.

426
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:18,094
The Ancient who carved this tablet is one of
the Ancients who returned to Earth from Atlantis.

427
00:28:18,494 --> 00:28:18,894
Yes.

428
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:24,493
I have an Uncle Marvin and I'm pretty
sure I dont' know any Meardons.

429
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:28,893
That's because in English his name sounds
a little different. Have you heard of Merlin?

430
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:33,733
Merlin. King Arthur and the knights
of the round table, Merlin.

431
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:34,293
Yes

432
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:35,293
Was an Ancient.

433
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:35,933
I think so.

434
00:28:37,493 --> 00:28:40,292
See? That is what I'm talking about!

435
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,492
Arthur was then carried off in a barge by Merlin,

436
00:28:49,692 --> 00:28:53,891
saying that he was heading for the veil of Avalon,
which according to legend was a
magical place where the dead would meet.

437
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:57,291
Now at the time, some said Arthur never actually died,
but would in fact, one day return.

438
00:28:58,091 --> 00:29:00,491
From what we know about the Ancients, it's possible that

439
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:03,771
Avalon was actually a place
where Merlin helped Arthur, a mortal, ascend.

440
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:07,891
Are not the Ancients prevented from interfering
with the existence of mortals.

441
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:10,890
Ascended Ancients, yes, for the most part.
But it's possible, Merlin was not actually

442
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,010
ascended himself, but was in fact just a human,
far along the evolutionary path.

443
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,090
What does this have to do with
where this alleged treasure is buried?

444
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:22,249
Well there are a number of conflicting interpretations,
but certain threads point to
the knights of the round table,

445
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:26,889
gathering great treasure from the far
corners of Arthurs domain an
hiding them in a magical stronghold at Avalon.

446
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:28,689
Including the holy grail.

447
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:29,689
According to some.

448
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,689
So this grail? What's that worth?

449
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:37,009
What?

450
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:41,488
In 1191, the monks at Glastonbury Abbey,
claimed to have found the grave of King Arthur.

451
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:47,048
On the burial was an inlaid cross
with the inscription...

452
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:49,247
Here lies the famous King Arthur,
buried on the isle of Avalon.

453
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:53,448
The claim was not taken seriously until 1278
when Henry 2nd ordered the grave to be exhumed.

454
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:58,887
Now Glastonbury, a small town about 125 miles
from the West of London,
has been a pilgrimage for believers since.

455
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:00,287
Yes, yes, and the point is?

456
00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:02,887
Certain Celtic legend say's that Glastonbury Tor,

457
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:05,687
the hill overlooking the town, is actually hollow

458
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,287
and that contained within it is
the entrance to the underworld, Avalon.

459
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:10,646
Has no-one ever done any sort of geological survey.

460
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:12,646
There have been several scientific studies,
apparently...

461
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:14,746
- Jackson! I'm, I'm, I'm...
- We're talking about the Ancients here, Sir!

462
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:18,586
It's very possible that the underground entrance
was concealed with some sort of technology.

463
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,886
Sir, we're hoping to use the Asgard sensors
aboard the Prometheus,

464
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,686
to find something we haven't been able to see before.

465
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:26,485
Thank you.

466
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:34,685
Well, two years ago I wouldn't have believed we'd find
an Ancient Outpost under a mile of ice in Antarctica.

467
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:37,085
I'll call the President.

468
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:41,284
I'm sure he'll want to inform
the British Prime Minister.

469
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:47,084
That was fantastic. You talk to Carter yet?

470
00:30:47,284 --> 00:30:49,044
Uh, yeah, she can't make it.

471
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:53,483
What? This is huge. We could be on the brink of
another major discovery of Ancient technology here.

472
00:30:53,524 --> 00:30:55,084
Yeah, I'm sure she'll be
interested in whatever we find.

473
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:00,763
Try playing hard to get.

474
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:02,683
Man look who's talking.

475
00:31:10,283 --> 00:31:12,082
So what do you reckon the range of this thing is.

476
00:31:12,483 --> 00:31:14,982
Well, Dr Lee seems to think we need
to sink about a hundred feet or so.

477
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:17,742
About half an hour inside that boundary,
we'll begin to feel the effects.

478
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:21,082
You know, if we do find something?
I'm thinking maybe Teal'c and I should check it out.

479
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:24,862
Uh, I missed the Daedalus because of this.
If we find the secret Ancient base, I'm going.

480
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:26,182
That means we've got to take her with us.

481
00:31:28,882 --> 00:31:29,481
Good point.

482
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:32,081
Look, I want you there. You know that.

483
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:34,481
I'm just thinking we can stay in radio contact.

484
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:38,481
<i>Lt-Colonel Mitchell please report
to auxiliary control room two.</i>

485
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:48,640
- Now this brings back memories.
- How's that?

486
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,720
- Is this where I beat you up?
- No.

487
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,879
No, I'm pretty sure that's right there
as well I crushed your...

488
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,879
Alright! Excuse me kids.
Marks, what you got?

489
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,679
Well, thanks to the Asgard sensors,

490
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:06,079
we were able to map around the energy distortion
that would have normally fooled deep ground sonar.

491
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:10,479
I was able to define a large main cavern,
a network of tunnels and some smaller caves.

492
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:12,079
Well done Lt.

493
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:17,079
Can you see what's in there?
Say, large piles of precious metals?

494
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:22,078
Like I said. We could only map
the exterior of the structure.

495
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:24,478
Can you get us in there?

496
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:29,877
Well, it's almost a half mile underground
and there's no visible access from the surface.

497
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:30,577
Asgard beams.

498
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:32,277
Tried that.

499
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:36,077
Doesn't seem to penetrate whatever sort
of energy shield is disguising the caves.

500
00:32:36,117 --> 00:32:36,717
Rings.

501
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:42,876
The Ancients were the gatebuilders, right?
And they invented the rings, too.

502
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:45,976
They had to get in and out of there somehow,
and I know this ship has rings...

503
00:32:46,116 --> 00:32:47,876
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good times,
good times. She's right though.

504
00:32:48,077 --> 00:32:49,996
If there are rings down there,

505
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:51,676
we should be able to lock on.

506
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:53,676
But your radios won't work.

507
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:57,875
Looks like we're all going.

508
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:00,875
You'll be on your own.

509
00:33:03,075 --> 00:33:03,675
Ladies first.

510
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,075
Well then after you.

511
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:13,275
Come on! This is fun, right?

512
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:26,274
Wicked!

513
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:29,273
And empty!

514
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:33,314
Well, I haven't been this disappointed
since Daniel and I had sex.

515
00:33:45,832 --> 00:33:47,832
A sword in a stone...

516
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:50,473
What's that supposed to mean?

517
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:56,632
Well, King Arthur once pulled a sword from a stone
as proof of his righteousness and loyalty.

518
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:57,791
Excalibur.

519
00:33:57,832 --> 00:33:59,392
Actually that's a common misconception.

520
00:33:59,431 --> 00:34:02,431
See, Excalibur was forged by the
lady of the lake at Avalon, but

521
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:05,951
wasn't given to King Arthur until after the sword
pulled from the stone, broke in battle.

522
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,990
Give it a try muscles. I'll give you half.

523
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,390
Yeah, it's in there pretty good.

524
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:36,749
Welcome you knights of the round table.

525
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:42,189
Men of honour. Followers of the path of righteousness.

526
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:50,908
Only those with wealth of knowledge and truthful spirit,
shall be given access to the underworld.

527
00:34:51,748 --> 00:35:01,587
The storehouse of riches of Ambrosius Orelanus.
Prove ye worthy and all shall be revealed.

528
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:02,988
That's incredible.

529
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:09,627
Certain scholars have speculated that Ambrosius
and Arthur were one and the same, but

530
00:35:10,147 --> 00:35:12,987
that would have made him 74 years old
at the battle of Battle of Mount Badon.

531
00:35:14,507 --> 00:35:17,547
It's actually quite fascinating, you see
Ambrosius was the son of the Emperor Constantine...

532
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:20,946
Yes, yes, yes. Fascinating is the one thing it's not.

533
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:23,906
How do we prove ye worthy and get all to be revealed?

534
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:28,466
I have no idea, but something tells me
truth of spirit might be a problem for you.

535
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,806
You know nothing about me!

536
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:31,226
Except that everything that
comes out of your mouth is a lie.

537
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:33,505
Don't make me separate you two.

538
00:35:35,705 --> 00:35:37,585
Perhaps there is something in these tunnels.

539
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:40,145
See? That is why he's here.

540
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:43,905
Genius. We're gonna split up. I'm with Teal'c.

541
00:35:44,385 --> 00:35:46,305
Yo! Wait up!

542
00:35:56,824 --> 00:36:00,383
I guess it would have been too easy for them
to just leave that stuff laying out in the open.

543
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:06,423
Maybe it's just me, but

544
00:36:07,883 --> 00:36:10,683
I'm digging this rapport
we've got going between the two of us.

545
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:14,063
You should give me a weapon.

546
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:14,823
No.

547
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:18,223
Could be some sort of icky creature down here,
left behind to protect the treasure.

548
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:19,422
For hundreds of years?

549
00:36:19,663 --> 00:36:21,213
Some sort of stasis or hibernation.

550
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:24,142
What if it senses our presence and
awakens hungry for human flesh.

551
00:36:24,462 --> 00:36:26,782
- That isn't quite the Ancients style.
- Still.

552
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:30,101
I'm sure, if there is a monster down here, it's going
to be much more scared of you than you are of it.

553
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:32,742
Especially once it gets to know you.

554
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,699
Check this out.

555
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:22,758
Okay, that can't be good.

556
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:26,098
Jackson come in.

557
00:37:28,418 --> 00:37:30,618
Jackson do you hear me?

558
00:37:38,057 --> 00:37:41,057
If you immediately know the candlelight is fire.

559
00:37:41,477 --> 00:37:42,597
Nothing.

560
00:38:00,356 --> 00:38:05,635
OK, the hologram said that only those with
a wealth of knowledge and truth of spirit will pass.

561
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:09,596
This has to be a test.

562
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:11,655
What does it say?

563
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:14,175
It says "The universe is infinite".

564
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:17,775
That seems infinitely not useful. How about this one?

565
00:38:17,935 --> 00:38:19,435
"The treasure is in this pot".

566
00:38:19,475 --> 00:38:20,115
Really?

567
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:24,895
I was hoping for something
a little more substantial, but ok.

568
00:38:24,955 --> 00:38:26,074
No, wait, wait, wait!!

569
00:38:26,534 --> 00:38:28,094
- Too obvious?
- Give me a minute.

570
00:38:31,014 --> 00:38:31,974
Not a minute...

571
00:38:33,314 --> 00:38:34,874
Still not a minute.

572
00:38:35,974 --> 00:38:42,173
Alright. I am assuming this is some kind of puzzle.

573
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,413
<i>Can you read this writing?</i>

574
00:38:50,313 --> 00:38:51,472
No.

575
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:57,293
Well I think we're supposed
to arrange the stones into some sort of order.

576
00:38:57,932 --> 00:38:59,092
What do you think?

577
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:08,252
Bullets bounce!

578
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,251
Okay, how about this?

579
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,890
We open both of them and whichever
one the treasure is in is the right one.

580
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:30,890
No, I think that's the wrong idea.

581
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,270
There's two pots here. I think the point
of the excercise is to only open one pot.

582
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,750
This says "Treasure is inside".

583
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:37,030
Right. That makes it the obvious first choice.

584
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,549
- So over to the gold?
- No.

585
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,230
- Back to the silver then!
- No, no, no!!

586
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:42,689
It's empty.

587
00:39:46,169 --> 00:39:49,168
There's nothing I hate more than a bald faced lie.

588
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:53,088
Would you stop!!

589
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:56,409
What? We're already trapped in here.
How much worse could it get?

590
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:05,847
How about that much?

591
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:09,427
I knew it was a mistake, the moment I said it.
The moment.

592
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:21,487
Okay, that didn't work.

593
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,687
Indeed.

594
00:40:29,766 --> 00:40:32,126
Oh come on!

595
00:40:38,326 --> 00:40:40,246
- This one's empty too.
- I know!

596
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:42,405
- That doesn't make sense.
- I know!

597
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,406
Colonel Mitchell!

598
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:51,385
Two down and only a billion
possible combinations to go.

599
00:40:51,445 --> 00:40:53,325
Are you still having fun, Colonel Mitchell?

600
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,244
- So what do we do?
- I don't know!

601
00:40:56,445 --> 00:40:57,445
You don't know?

602
00:40:57,724 --> 00:41:00,764
So now is a bad time to
tell you that I hate small spaces?

603
00:41:02,724 --> 00:41:04,804
Ever get a bad feeling about something?
