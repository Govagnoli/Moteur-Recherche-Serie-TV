1
00:00:01,758 --> 00:00:03,685
Think! You are the expert on all things Ancient.

2
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:05,587
You didn't care about that two minutes ago.
Let's try this one. How about this one?

3
00:00:05,912 --> 00:00:06,730
I'm thinking!

4
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:08,982
- Sorry, could you probably think a little bit faster?
- The universe is infinite.

5
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:12,152
No doubt it's deliberately ironic
that we're in an ever decreasing space.

6
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:14,296
To quote an old Ancient proverb.
There's only one truth. The universe is infinite.

7
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:14,930
How does that help us?

8
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:16,457
There's only one truth.
This box says the treasure's in this box!

9
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:17,841
It's not in either of them!

10
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:19,827
I know, but we did it wrong,
so we have to see if we can do it again.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,122
There is only one truth!
The universe is infinite, thereforth

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,776
the statement about the treasure being in this pot
has to be false, so the treasure must be in...

13
00:00:37,512 --> 00:00:40,431
Good thing you know your Ancient proverbs,
otherwise we'd be...

14
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:43,176
- Mitchell.
- Teal'c!

15
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,838
Yo, feel free to jump in here anytime!

16
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,023
Teal'c!

17
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:06,034
Daniel Jackson!

18
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:08,753
Hey! We got a little problem in here!

19
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:10,129
What's the puzzle?

20
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:13,166
There's eight stones with symbols on them
and some Ancient writing. I think...

21
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:14,334
Describe the writing!

22
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:20,115
A U with a square over it. A chair with a square!
Upside down backwards L, call that seven!

23
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,002
Squares unevenly stacked.
That chair thingy again and big N, and fat face...

24
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,188
Reflect! It means reflect!

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,165
Reflect?

26
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:29,775
<i>Reflect, reflect, reflect a meaningful path!</i>

27
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:32,111
Put those pieces to reflect a path to enlightenment.

28
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:35,347
Yeah, that tells me exactly nothing!

29
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:39,009
I'm sorry! I can't help if I can't see the symbols on
the stones you're supposed to put in order!

30
00:01:39,143 --> 00:01:41,103
Reflect! Double 8, 4 reflected...

31
00:01:48,236 --> 00:01:49,904
Four?

32
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:55,518
Six...

33
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:05,037
Teal'c!

34
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,717
Look, I didn't hear any screaming or
squishing sounds so...

35
00:02:19,526 --> 00:02:24,365
Thanks, the symbols were actually numbered one
through eight in a mirror image.

36
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:34,067
Alright, we passed the test so this should work.

37
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:06,109
I should have known it wouldn't be that easy.

38
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:11,800
Season 9 - Episode 2
Avalon (Part 2)

39
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:23,183
You uh, you done this before?

40
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,665
Fight a Knight in armour?
No, can't say that I have.

41
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:26,345
<i>Well you're doing good.</i>

42
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:29,065
Ha! I took a little fencing in college.

43
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,170
OK, I need a little help.

44
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:46,813
It appears to be a hologram.

45
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:47,954
A hologram?

46
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:52,696
<i>Jesus!</i>

47
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,836
I don't think it actually cut you.

48
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,437
Well it hurt like hell.

49
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,161
I don't know. I don't think he's actually that good.

50
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:07,802
So I flunk fencing.

51
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:17,967
Colonel Mitchell! The sword!

52
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:34,054
OK, that thing is going to kill him!

53
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:35,294
Everybody get to the rings!

54
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:48,659
OK, that's enough for today.

55
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,500
No, I can do this!

56
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,114
Come on!

57
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,456
That's gotta be it!

58
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:35,719
I don't understand. We solved the riddles.

59
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,922
Well, he solved one and
he solved one and he won the fight.

60
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:44,043
And what, nothing?

61
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:46,004
But you're the only one who defeated the Knight.

62
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,926
That sword was obviously designed
to sense whoever pulled it from the stone.

63
00:06:49,965 --> 00:06:51,877
What if there's sensors detecting us?

64
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:53,887
Are you suggesting that we should leave?

65
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:54,969
It's worth a try.

66
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:58,449
Alright.

67
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:05,853
If nothing happens, just join us.

68
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:29,263
What happened?

69
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,904
The whole place is collapsing.
We must have done something wrong.

70
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:36,466
What d'you take?

71
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:38,007
What?

72
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,027
Truth of spirit.

73
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:41,948
- I was...
- Truth of spirit. What d'you take?

74
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:03,903
Worth it.

75
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:16,669
We are not going to let her keep that, are we?

76
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:21,391
No.

77
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:22,831
Good.

78
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:29,394
Well that figures. Room full of golden jewels
and Dr. Daniel Jackson finds the one book.

79
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:32,956
So what's it about?

80
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:36,718
Actually it's a story. It's written like fiction.

81
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,398
Once upon a time...

82
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:44,521
Once upon a time there was a race of people
that went on a great journey through space.

83
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:47,042
Across the universe. They were called the Altera.

84
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:55,126
After much time, I think this means thousands of years,
they found a great belt of stars.

85
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:57,607
And they lived happily ever after.

86
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,449
Have you found something, Daniel Jackson?

87
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:11,292
It says that the Alterans named their new home Avalon,
and that they built many "Astreaporta".

88
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:14,054
Stargates?

89
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:14,854
Yes.

90
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:16,454
The Ancients built the Stargates.

91
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:21,437
Well it stands to reason that
they weren't always called the Ancients.

92
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,177
What do you care? You got your treasure.

93
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:29,820
Let's see what's of more value. A few gold trinkets
that apparently I won't be allowed to keep.

94
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,743
Or, previously undiscovered
secrets about the gatebuilders,

95
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:39,424
the most powerful race to ever inhabit the galaxy.

96
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:42,025
You realise what this could mean?

97
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:51,910
Whoa, we've always presumed that the Ancients
were the first evolution of humans in this galaxy.

98
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,191
But this, this is
the first evidence suggesting they came here

99
00:10:57,993 --> 00:10:59,673
long ago, from somewhere far, far away.

100
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:01,674
Colonel Mitchell!

101
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:22,482
One of these things is not like the others.

102
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:29,726
It's much, much more than that.

103
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:33,327
We know the Ancients left our galaxy for Pegasus
and returned when they lost the war with the Wraith.

104
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:34,488
But what happened to them?

105
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:35,928
I thought they ascended?

106
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,390
Well some did, that we know of.
But what if the others went home?

107
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,611
Even if they didn't, the book I read
suggested that the Alterans left a civilization behind.

108
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:43,892
And your point is?

109
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:47,477
My point is that we haven't met a single living Ancient
who is willing to share their knowledge freely with us,

110
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,694
and there could be an entire advanced civilization
of them, out there somewhere in another galaxy.

111
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:54,076
Isn't that why we're doing this, all of this?
The Stargate Program, the budgeting,

112
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:58,318
so we go and meet new races, gather advanced technologies,
possibly learn about ourselves in the process?

113
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,059
Oh come on! You do it to meet women.

114
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,300
She has a point, sir.

115
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,221
I've been thinking,
I need to get off on an offworld mission or two.

116
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:08,103
Yeah, just to get the feel for it.

117
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:10,863
Always do everything
you ask of those you command.

118
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:11,744
Patton!

119
00:12:11,984 --> 00:12:12,984
Very good.

120
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:13,744
Good movie.

121
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:16,946
Laugh if you want to, but I believe finding
these Alterans and where they came from,

122
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:20,848
should be our top priority from this point forward.
They are the gate builders.

123
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:24,689
Nobody's laughing Dr. Jackson.
The universe is a big place.

124
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,871
Tell me where they are and how to get there
and I'll order you to go.

125
00:12:31,472 --> 00:12:33,233
I'm not saying this is going to be easy. I mean

126
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:35,834
if they're from a distant galaxy,
our network of stargates might not even connect.

127
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:38,875
And even if it does, we know the massive
power requirements necessary to dial Pegasus,

128
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:40,716
and they're relatively close, in intergalactic terms.

129
00:12:40,836 --> 00:12:41,917
But on the bright side,

130
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:43,617
according to the text
we found in the Glastonbury cavern,

131
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:46,358
the Ancient device we discovered may be
capable of intergalactic communication.

132
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:51,360
Thank you Dr. Jackson.
I'm sure you'll keep me posted. Colonel.

133
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,641
General.

134
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:57,403
He has no idea what you just said.

135
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:01,925
Someone wanna tell me why she's still on my base?

136
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:05,727
And, yes I did.

137
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,910
Well I think it's incredible.

138
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:24,575
The Jaffa of the Omak cognate was many as all the other
regional coalitions. And they strongly support Gerak.

139
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:25,475
Of this I am aware.

140
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:30,737
If we allow them even one more vote based on unconfirmed
military strength, the council will be in Gerak's hands.

141
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:32,938
- Until proper inspection...
- Rak'nor!

142
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:37,740
I'm sorry. We are all working very hard.
It just seems as though Gerak is winning.

143
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:41,823
Bratac and Ry'ac are negotiating with coalitions
who have yet to declare their allegiance.

144
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:47,185
I did not fight for the freedom of all Jaffa, only
to have it corrupted by a few power hungry individuals.

145
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:48,585
Nor did I.

146
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:54,467
I just do not understand why you have chosen to spend
so much time with the Tau'ri at such a critical stage.

147
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:59,430
My friends of the Tau'ri are largely
responsible for the Jaffa are being free

148
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,072
and as thanks they have been
treated with mistrust and disrespect.

149
00:14:03,512 --> 00:14:07,953
Until all Jaffa see that the old ways are not the future,
I will do whatever I need to do to enlighten them.

150
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,834
And how does chasing Ancient history do that?

151
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:13,036
Ancient knowledge is what defeated
the Goa'uld and the Replicators,

152
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,437
and I believe that one day it will unite
the Jaffa in a nation of peace!

153
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:19,038
I will prove it.

154
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,040
I hope so.

155
00:14:26,402 --> 00:14:29,747
I have been around the galaxy
long enough to know that knowledge is power

156
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:33,549
and understanding the technology that was left behind
by the Ancients is the most powerful knowledge around.

157
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:35,750
And if you think I wanna stay linked
with you for the rest of my natural...

158
00:14:35,846 --> 00:14:40,847
Focus! Maybe we should focus on the task at hand.

159
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:49,651
Yeah well, the device obviously has a power source
and I don't think it's been depleted.

160
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:55,438
OK, when I read this was a communication device,
I realised the shape of these recess spaces look familiar.

161
00:14:55,533 --> 00:15:01,681
These stones are actually an Ancient form of
communication device that links their users psychically,
allowing them to see through each other's eyes.

162
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:05,378
It appears that they're actually meant
to be used in conjunction with this terminal.

163
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:07,163
So what happens when you attach the stones.

164
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:08,219
We're gonna find out.

165
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,141
These stones were originally set
for General O'Neill and one, Joe Spencer.

166
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:13,062
Barber from Indiana.

167
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:15,862
Yeah, weird guy. I read the file.

168
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:23,666
Anyway, after a lot of tedious,
although I must say, ultimately very brilliant work,
if I do say so myself, I was able to reset the stones.

169
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:27,468
Don't they have to be activated by someone
with the Ancient gene? Same file.

170
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:32,814
Well that's what we thought at first, but no,
like a lot of Ancient technology,
the stones actually just need to be initialised.

171
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,271
By someone with the gene. That's a guess.

172
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:37,872
No, you're right. Which these obviously have been.

173
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:41,874
So any one of us can take the pony ride?

174
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:45,596
Yeah, I figured that was gonna be me.
I mean, I did miss the Daedalus for this, so...

175
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:47,876
You're gonna dine on it for a while?

176
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:49,677
Yeah, yeah. Like you wouldn't believe.

177
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:55,279
Well no-one's gonna make an argument
against that. You are the world's
foremost expert on the Ancients, but we got two stones.

178
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,681
Yes, and this one's mine. Thank you.

179
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:59,881
Excuse me. How do you figure that?

180
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:01,722
Daniel and I are linked.

181
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:03,883
I'll just point out for the record, we don't have to be.

182
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:09,987
He's only guessing that this device is for
communication. What if it's a transporter of some kind
and he gets whisked away and can't get back?

183
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:14,688
Actually, we have done a fair bit of research on this
device and I can say with absolute...

184
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:17,833
relative certainty.

185
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:22,932
Look, we have studied devices like this for years and
at some point ultimately you just have to turn it on.

186
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:23,972
I'm gonna give it a try.

187
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:24,973
Where he goes, I go.

188
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:25,773
I'm not going anywhere.

189
00:16:25,813 --> 00:16:26,353
So he thinks.

190
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:27,393
It's a communication device!

191
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,414
I'm gonna watch from the observation room.

192
00:16:30,094 --> 00:16:32,295
Alright. Good luck!

193
00:16:33,896 --> 00:16:35,897
So, what do we do?

194
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,499
Well, I'm guessing we just put these
two stones in any two of these spots.

195
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:40,459
Any two?

196
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,901
Well there aren't any markings
to indicate otherwise, so any two.

197
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:46,502
And...

198
00:16:57,106 --> 00:16:58,506
Med team to science lab one.

199
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:16,114
Hello? Please don't be afraid.
My name is Daniel Jackson.

200
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:19,716
It's me. Vala.

201
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,917
OK, not a transporter.

202
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:26,719
Where are we?

203
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,320
I don't know.

204
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:46,127
But I think we're in them.

205
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:03,934
Blood pressure and heartrate are normal.
Pupils are slightly dilated.
Now we're sure this is because of the device?

206
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:06,976
They also passed out before when
they were separated, because of the bracelets.

207
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:10,738
The reaction was virtually instantaneous
after the device was activated.

208
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:17,300
Anyway, there's no discernable energy raise
and no measurable radiation being emitted so...

209
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,662
And we found no contagions. Alright...

210
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:27,385
I wanna get an EEG going, but my first impression here
is that they're in some kind of sleep state.

211
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:29,986
Maybe we should disconnect the stones.

212
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:35,948
For all we know, this could be perfectly normal.
I mean, this could be the way the device actually works.

213
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:39,150
And could you give me some time here,
before we go messing around with that thing anymore?

214
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,995
I wouldn't call it messing around.

215
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:45,292
Look, for all we know, disconnecting the stones
could put them in further jeopardy.

216
00:18:48,553 --> 00:18:49,995
So how are things on Dakara?

217
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,555
About as well as here.

218
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:55,556
I don't understand.

219
00:18:55,957 --> 00:19:00,959
This is an odd communication device.
I mean, I can't talk to this poor woman.

220
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:09,563
I have no access to her mind, her thoughts, her memories.
I'm just inside of her, looking out through her eyes.

221
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:13,564
Yeah. Jack and Joe Spencer described the experience
as having visions of what was happening to the other.

222
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:16,005
Were they ever in total control of each other's bodies?

223
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:19,727
No. But they weren't using the stones
in conjunction with the Ancient terminal either.

224
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,568
It's possible it was meant
to work this way, so that we can

225
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:25,753
communicate with others without intruding
on the minds of those we're connected to.

226
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:28,571
They're just temporary transmitters.

227
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:32,372
Do you think we're actually in another galaxy?

228
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:33,573
I don't know.

229
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,175
Why these people?

230
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:38,575
I don't know.

231
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:46,858
Well maybe it's just me,
but this house, these clothes...

232
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:52,781
we don't look the way I'd expect the Ancients to look.

233
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:53,782
No.

234
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:55,782
What do you suppose their names are?

235
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:57,063
Harrid and Sallis.

236
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,584
How do you know that?

237
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:08,588
Well because it says so, right here.
It says this is the... home of Harrid and Sallis Ciceru.

238
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:10,389
Wait I missed that, you mumbled it.

239
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:10,949
No I didn't.

240
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:12,990
Well you said something that I couldn't understand.

241
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,551
Well I didn't say it because I didn't
really know what it means, so I'm not
gonna say it out loud because I know what it means.

242
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:17,552
Well go on.

243
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,193
Nuptial, it means nuptial.

244
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:20,913
As in we're...?

245
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,955
Married. Yeah. Let's go look outside.

246
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,601
Not quite what I imagined
when I pictured a civilization of gate builders.

247
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:47,685
No. Something tells me this is not the same people
who built a spaceship capable
of travelling across the universe.

248
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:50,245
Above the sun! Harrid! Sallis!

249
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:52,166
What?

250
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:55,688
Uh, I think that means good morning.

251
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,690
Above the sun to you.

252
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:03,211
Above the sun?

253
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:07,413
I think he's speaking Ancient.
I think the communicator's translating for us.

254
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:09,278
I couldn't read the sign.

255
00:21:09,374 --> 00:21:11,215
Maybe it only works for spoken language.

256
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:12,535
See you at prostration!

257
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:15,096
Prostration it is!

258
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,537
Prostration it is!

259
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:22,803
So what do you want to do, Harrid? Or is it Sallis?

260
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:24,661
People are starting to stare.

261
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:26,841
Well shall we walk around and try to appear normal?

262
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:37,626
Nope, not what I was expecting at all.

263
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,947
Me neither.

264
00:21:39,627 --> 00:21:42,548
On the bright side,
I think he was looking at me when he said Harrid.

265
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,350
Please, he was staring at me the whole time.

266
00:21:52,673 --> 00:21:54,673
Hey! Come in.

267
00:21:55,234 --> 00:22:00,036
Now I can't decide if I like the desk here.

268
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:02,237
Where else are you going to put it? Out in the hall?

269
00:22:05,118 --> 00:22:06,119
Daniel and Vala are stable.

270
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:10,921
Based on rapid eye movements and brainwave patterns,
I'm guessing it's actually some kind of induced
dream-link condition.

271
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,587
Doctor Jackson believes the device
was used for long range communication.
Is it possible that's what they're doing?

272
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:21,109
Talking to someone somewhere... out there.

273
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:22,269
I don't know.

274
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:23,526
I'm heading to the mess.

275
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:26,007
I'm good thanks, I should get back to Daniel and Vala.

276
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:28,928
Of course. Just keep me posted.

277
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:37,852
Caroline, you seem to be settling in okay.

278
00:22:40,253 --> 00:22:43,295
I don't know if I'll ever
get used to this place, it's pretty...

279
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:47,256
Yeah.

280
00:22:47,656 --> 00:22:53,459
Yeah. And working for you,
makes this whole thing just that much more bizarre.

281
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,579
You didn't have to take the job you know.

282
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,846
Are you kidding? Who could refuse it?
Besides at the time General O'Neill
didn't tell me you'd be my boss.

283
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:02,422
He's funny that way.

284
00:23:02,462 --> 00:23:06,584
By the way, the desk looks fine the way it is.

285
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:07,665
Really?

286
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:09,746
You never were happy
with anything the way it was.

287
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:18,069
All hallow the Ori.

288
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:21,070
All hallow the Ori.

289
00:23:23,072 --> 00:23:28,233
On their great power,
we shall meditate herein this day.

290
00:23:33,076 --> 00:23:34,276
Prostation it is.

291
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:52,483
We must meet. By the protacol
of light at the hour of bligh. Speak not.

292
00:23:52,524 --> 00:24:01,407
Oh greatness that is the Ori.
You guide us, and give meaning to our daily lives.
We beseech you, give us strength.

293
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:10,292
All hallow the Ori,
all hallow the Ori, all hallow the Ori.

294
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:19,135
Well that was fun, six hours of prostration!

295
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:27,699
Why don't we just tell someone who we are,
and what's going on. I mean, isn't that
the whole point of this, to communicate?

296
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:31,501
I don't think these people are going to
entirely understand. Did you hear what the guy said
when we first came to the service?

297
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,401
Something about meeting.

298
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:34,282
Yeah at the protacol of light on the hour of bligh.

299
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:35,562
What is that supposed to mean?

300
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:36,443
I have no idea.

301
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:38,504
What are you looking for?

302
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:46,307
I don't know. Some reason as to why we're in
these particular people, these specific bodies,
well, it can't be totally random.

303
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:50,629
Well, I have a more pressing question.

304
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:58,032
Do you have any idea how we're
supposed to detach from them?

305
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:03,395
No. That's another thing that's got me worried.
Have you tried?

306
00:25:03,474 --> 00:25:05,996
Mmm. Nothing.

307
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:09,637
It doesn't seem to be something
I can just will to make happen.

308
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:20,921
Maybe it's about removing the stones
from the device on Earth.

309
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:24,083
Yeah unfortunately we can't tell the people on Earth
that we need them to remove them,

310
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,525
and we'll just have to wait
for them to figure it out for themselves.

311
00:25:26,564 --> 00:25:29,006
Maybe they have already, and it had no effect.

312
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:32,287
I'm just gonna rule out that possibility.

313
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:38,689
Do you think these people are in our bodies?

314
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,730
I don't know. I mean,

315
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:43,932
this can't be how the technology is supposed to work.

316
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:51,335
Yeah it's the book that some
of the villagers were walking around with.

317
00:25:51,415 --> 00:25:56,657
It says on the front,
"The book of Origins, blessed are the Ori".

318
00:25:56,737 --> 00:25:58,498
I think you should take a look at it.

319
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:01,699
Oh I think I've seen enough.
I mean, Prostration for six hours!

320
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:03,700
Give us strength.

321
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,702
You know, it's all very clear.

322
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:08,502
I think you'd find it really interesting.

323
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,463
Yeah. When did you start being able to read Ancient?

324
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:11,703
I can't.

325
00:26:11,824 --> 00:26:16,225
But this, looked familiar.

326
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:39,195
Thank those full of value.
I was worried when you did not meet me.

327
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:40,556
Yeah, sorry about that.

328
00:26:40,676 --> 00:26:41,957
Why did you not meet me?

329
00:26:41,997 --> 00:26:44,517
Why are you not sharing leaves
with the administrator's wife?

330
00:26:45,758 --> 00:26:48,519
I... forgot.

331
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:51,381
We are already suspected,
we must not alter our behaviour.

332
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,421
Suspected of what?

333
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:55,803
Harrid, what ails you? If I did not know better,
I would fear you, you're trying to entrap me.

334
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,603
No. I wouldn't dream of trying to...

335
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:58,924
Entrap you? How?

336
00:26:58,964 --> 00:26:59,924
Stop this, please.

337
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:01,245
Okay, you know what?

338
00:27:03,766 --> 00:27:07,367
Please... would you, would you sit?

339
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,650
Go with me.

340
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:24,415
My name is Daniel Jackson,
and I am inside the mind of Harrid.

341
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:29,397
I am able to speak through him
by use of a communication technology

342
00:27:29,477 --> 00:27:34,239
that we believe was first constructed
and use by a race known as the Alterans.

343
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,341
And I'm Vala... Mal Doran.

344
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:45,904
How you doin?

345
00:27:46,224 --> 00:27:49,986
By the stars, forgive me. I am Phanis.

346
00:27:52,947 --> 00:27:56,508
Nice to meet you, we're from a place called Earth.

347
00:27:56,628 --> 00:27:57,589
Can I speak with Harrid?

348
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:02,031
No, his consciousness appears to be supressed
so long as we are connected.

349
00:28:02,151 --> 00:28:04,712
Harrid always suspected that the stones
were a means of communication.

350
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:06,352
You know about the stones?

351
00:28:10,395 --> 00:28:13,196
We are curators, investigators of the past.

352
00:28:13,396 --> 00:28:16,437
The stones were discovered some time ago
in what we believe are the remains

353
00:28:16,517 --> 00:28:18,878
of an ancestral burial ground not far from here.

354
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:20,319
Why are you hiding them?

355
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:22,320
Such investigation is sacrilege.

356
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,820
You're not allowed to investigate your own history?

357
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,661
If such a history contradicts the book of origin.

358
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:27,261
You're heretics.

359
00:28:28,362 --> 00:28:34,565
We have uncovered evidence that
we believe proves the race of humans
predates our supposed creation by the Ori.

360
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,606
Excuse me, Daniel.

361
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:42,608
What if these Gods, the Ori,

362
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:45,149
are the people left behind by the Alterans?

363
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,330
You think they ascended?

364
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,531
It's possible.
The Alterans left a long, long time ago.

365
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:53,793
And what we know of the Ancients,
they learned to evolve and ascend.

366
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:56,234
What if the people who remained here, did too.

367
00:28:56,274 --> 00:28:58,475
That would mean these people
are a subsequent evolution of humans,

368
00:28:58,555 --> 00:29:01,716
which is apparently what happened
in our galaxy after the Ancients we know ascended.

369
00:29:01,857 --> 00:29:05,578
And it would explain why
they are not as advanced as we might expect.

370
00:29:05,698 --> 00:29:07,419
No, but the religion doesn't fit the profile.

371
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:09,780
The ascended beings I know, don't pose as Gods

372
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,781
I mean that's the one
explicit rule that they do follow,

373
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:14,222
is that they don't meddle in the affairs
of the lower planes of existence.

374
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:15,822
The Ori are not posing.

375
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:19,024
We do not doubt their power,
just their word and intention.

376
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:22,785
Their power is as real as the strength
and belief of all followers.

377
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:27,668
You were late for leaves with the administrator's wife,
Sallis and she are aquaintances.

378
00:29:27,747 --> 00:29:29,168
So what should I do?

379
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:31,129
Can you not disconnect and allow Sallis to return?

380
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:34,110
No, apparently we can't do that.

381
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:38,232
Then you must pose as Sallis, or we will be discovered.

382
00:29:42,273 --> 00:29:43,995
I can do that.

383
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:03,183
The council has already taken rest of it.
The vote was quick.

384
00:30:03,483 --> 00:30:05,244
I delivered yours by proxy.

385
00:30:06,244 --> 00:30:08,645
Gerak's motion was resolved by a slim majority.

386
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:11,286
The Jaffa will be ruled by a High Council.

387
00:30:11,847 --> 00:30:17,089
Votes will be attributed to the various
coalition representatives, based on military assets.

388
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:19,329
Making Gerak...

389
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:21,791
The new leader of the Jaffa nation.

390
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,895
You said the Ori may have
ascended, what does that mean?

391
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,855
Where we come from,

392
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:38,158
some people who used to look a lot like us
evolved physically and mentally so much

393
00:30:38,198 --> 00:30:40,719
that they found a way to shed their physical bodies

394
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:44,541
and live as energy on
another higher plane of existence.

395
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:47,061
Some called it enlightenment and

396
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:50,363
came with it a much greater understanding
of the universe and all its knowledge.

397
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:55,065
Now this happened a long time ago and I believe
that those people may have originally come from here.

398
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:57,626
And those ascended beings as you call them,

399
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,407
do not guide you and ask that you worship them.

400
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:02,268
No, in fact, they believed so
strongly in free will that they...

401
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:04,349
would not even intervene and
use their knowledge even if it meant

402
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,030
the destruction of an entire galaxy
full of us regular old humans.

403
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,751
Such is not the case with the Ori.

404
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:13,473
Yes, so they ask that you worship them and yet
conceal the truth of your existence from you.

405
00:31:13,553 --> 00:31:15,074
That is not all.

406
00:31:16,034 --> 00:31:17,355
What are you gonna do?

407
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:19,395
We are gathering as much evidence as we can.

408
00:31:19,996 --> 00:31:25,358
Our hope is that one day we will have enough proof
to convince even the most devout believers.

409
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:30,080
In the meantime, we meet in secret, and share
with those who we trust what we have learned.

410
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,562
We keep hidden those artifacts which prove our claims
in case one or more of us are discovered.

411
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:36,603
How many of you are there?

412
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:39,284
A few. Our numbers are growing.

413
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:43,006
Some believe the fact we have not been
discovered is further proof

414
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:46,167
that the Ori are not all-powerful and all knowing.

415
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:51,489
Others wonder if they are just giving us the
opportunity to see the error of our ways and repent.

416
00:31:57,692 --> 00:31:59,292
A crowd gathers at the arrar.

417
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:05,215
That's an altar?

418
00:32:05,895 --> 00:32:07,576
I cannot be seen with you.

419
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:14,299
And so said Disraya before the battle of ages.

420
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:22,502
He spoke to the sky and said "And the people shall
deliver unto you the wicked for your divine judgement

421
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:28,145
where their sin shall be weighed in
the balance of all that is just and true".

422
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:32,467
Let go of me! Get your hands off me! Daniel!

423
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:33,828
What happened?

424
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:35,629
It didn't go so well.

425
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,069
Yeah, I can see that.

426
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:39,310
Excuse me.

427
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:43,511
Harrid, stand back. Sallis has been overcome.

428
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,712
No she hasn't, if you'll just let me explain.

429
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:47,714
Listen to me!

430
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:58,078
Fear not, for the Ori see all, outside and within.

431
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:03,040
If your heart is pure and your devotion unwavering,
they will protect you.

432
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,681
They'll cleanse your being and
you will be taken to be with them forever.

433
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:12,444
If not, may the fire burn you down
to the ground and lay you in the dust.

434
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,925
Fire?

435
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,571
Hallowed are the Ori.

436
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:56,683
Her heartrate is 140, she's in distress.

437
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:59,343
Daniel's BP and heartrate are increasing too.

438
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:01,185
Pull the stones!

439
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,067
I can't!

440
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:09,989
What the hell did you say?

441
00:34:10,068 --> 00:34:11,469
I think at first it's what I didn't say.

442
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,470
You see, apparently there's a blessing you're supposed
to recite over the leaves before you drink,

443
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:16,852
which nobody warned me about.

444
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:18,452
Then I think it's what I did say.

445
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:20,853
I was trying to politely explain what was going on

446
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:23,454
and then his wife started screaming
and accusing me of being overcome,

447
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:28,736
at which point I believe I suggested she might want
to think about procreation... with herself.

448
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:33,118
Well listen! Please listen to me!
You have to believe me.

449
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,560
This is not what it looks like,
Sallis is not possessed. Okay!

450
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,722
This is going to sound crazy,
but we're from another galaxy.

451
00:34:42,362 --> 00:34:47,525
That's where we were using a communication technology
that allows us to take over a body from very far away

452
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:51,446
and let us talk to you! We just want to talk to you!

453
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:06,032
Okay this is getting worse,
I'm administering a sedative.

454
00:35:06,113 --> 00:35:08,034
Hopefully it'll calm things down.

455
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:20,799
DANIEL!

456
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,539
Okay listen to me! Listen to me.
You have to believe me.

457
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,460
You're killing an innocent person!

458
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,381
DANIEL!

459
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:29,022
Blessed are those that deliver us from evil.

460
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:45,590
She's in VFIB. Code blue!

461
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,391
Charging to 200!

462
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:51,032
No, don't shoot!

463
00:35:51,672 --> 00:35:52,832
You got a better idea?

464
00:35:52,873 --> 00:35:54,953
You might cause a surge, you could kill them both.

465
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:56,834
You might detonate the power source, now come on.

466
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:58,194
Clear!

467
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:14,027
Charge to 360. Clear!

468
00:37:16,388 --> 00:37:19,430
Still in VFIB, charging again. Clear!

469
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:29,034
I've got no pulse, she's gone into A-Cistallic.

470
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:34,837
I'm calling it.

471
00:37:36,897 --> 00:37:38,298
She's dead?

472
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:40,059
I'm sorry.

473
00:38:23,016 --> 00:38:25,058
His vitals have stabalised for the moment.

474
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:27,138
You can't pry the stones off?

475
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:27,939
No.

476
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:29,499
And you don't want me to shoot it?

477
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:30,240
No.

478
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,661
Then how do we unplug this thing?

479
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:35,862
I don't know.

480
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:37,003
Brilliant.

481
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:40,164
At the very least, we need to find a way
to get that bracelet off of Dr Jackson.

482
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,865
They're still linked and without Vala he'll proba...

483
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,067
She's got a heartbeat!

484
00:39:03,514 --> 00:39:04,715
Daniel...?

485
00:39:06,755 --> 00:39:08,156
You okay?

486
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:14,678
I've got tingles all over.

487
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:19,180
And don't flatter yourself,
I'm pretty sure it's not you.

488
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:23,923
Thank you.

489
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:29,745
Thank the Ori. Stand. You will come with me.

490
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:35,168
I think he wants us to follow him, can you walk?

491
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:39,049
If it means getting away from here.

492
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:02,779
Hallow to the children of the Ori.

493
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:06,821
Hallowed are we. Hallowed are the Ori.

494
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:22,147
Hallowed to the Ori.
