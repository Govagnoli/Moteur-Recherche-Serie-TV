00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:04,196
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:05,999
(BABY CRYING)

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,903
Wait. Where are you going? I want to see.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:08,975
She is Orici.

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:14,069
With the wisdom of the ages
she will lead us to glorious victory.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,774
Merlin was conducting research
on some kind of new invention,

7
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:20,182
a weapon capable of
destroying Ascended beings.

8
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:24,450
<i>MEURIK: Arthur and his knights left</i>
<i>to quest for the Sangraal long ago.</i>

9
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,890
It is said that they journeyed
to three distant lands

10
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,655
mentioned in Merlin's prophecy,

11
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:33,290
Castiana, Sahal, and Vagonbrei.

12
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,336
(GATE ACTIVATION ALARM BLARES)

13
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,338
Six more worlds have fallen to the Ori.

14
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,939
Two were Jaffa strongholds.

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,680
They attempted to resist, but were
overwhelmed within a matter of hours.

16
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,321
According to those
who witnessed the battle,

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,522
the enemy is led by a young woman
of extraordinary powers.

18
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:15,971
Six planets in eight days and they don't
even have their full team in the field yet.

19
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,634
Why haven't they
made a move against Earth?

20
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,907
In all probability, the Ancient device
in Antarctica is giving them pause.

21
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,914
At least until the rest
of their battle fleet gets here.

22
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,008
I got it! I got it.

23
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,518
I made the connection.

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,648
Sir Gawain to Gwalchmei,
Culhwch, and Olwen. Verus Gen Bree.

25
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,227
And you say I'm hard to understand.

26
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,353
(STAMMERS) Oh, it's Vagonbrei,

27
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:41,366
one of the planets Arthur and his knights
went to in their quest for the Holy Grail.

28
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,333
I got the gate address.

29
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,836
While on PX1767,
we got the names of three planets,

30
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,672
Castiana, Sahal, and Vagonbrei,

31
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,905
three possible destinations
for Arthur and his knights

32
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,950
in their quest for the Holy Grail,
what we know to be Merlin's weapon.

33
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,485
Unfortunately, what we didn't get
were any corresponding gate addresses

34
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,681
and the process of going through that
library page by page looking for clues

35
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,779
could have potentially taken years.

36
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,860
So I knew we were going to have to
narrow the search parameters a little.

37
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,452
That's when it hit me. Sir Gawain.

38
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,427
Wasn't he one of the knights
who says, <i>"Ni"?</i>

39
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,161
He was a knight of the Round Table,
and in one his earliest incarnations,

40
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,171
an old Welsh tale, he went on a quest
to help rescue a lost love.

41
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,037
The legend says that Sir Gawain,
a.k.a. Gwalchmei,

42
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,804
visited several lands
over the course of his adventure,

43
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,903
including a place called
Gwlad Gan Brenhinol Gwir,

44
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,278
which is Welsh for
"The land of royal truth."

45
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:42,411
Translate that into Ancient and
you get "Verus Gen Bree." Vagonbrei.

46
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,319
So how does that get us a gate address?

47
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,289
It doesn't,
but it did give me something very specific

48
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,826
to look for in Merlin's library,
namely, references to Gawain.

49
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,259
Now, based on this information,

50
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,763
I started scanning through the titles
and I found this.

51
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,356
Now, the entire volume is dedicated
to Gawain's adventures

52
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,265
and includes several
very interesting illustrations,

53
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,531
including a depiction of a sword
he once carried.

54
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,073
Note the symbols engraved on the blade.

55
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,166
- A gate address.
- Vagonbrei.

56
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,301
Well, we won't know till we check it out.

57
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,812
Well done, Doctor. Colonel Carter,
what's the status of the Ori supergate?

58
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,078
Any attempts we've made to dial out
to the Ori galaxy have failed.

59
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,016
It looks like they're blocking us
from their end.

60
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,749
There is a mothership in the area that will
alert us to the arrival of any other ships.

61
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:21,190
More ships? We can hardly deal
with the ones that are already here.

62
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,194
You have a go. Find that weapon.

63
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,991
- Yes, sir.
- Will do.

64
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,261
I was talking to SG-1.
You're not going anywhere.

65
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,038
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

66
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,877
General, I'm hoping
you might reconsider your decision

67
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,111
and allow Vala to come with us.

68
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,120
Given everything she's put you through,

69
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,784
you're the last person
I would have expected to ask me that.

70
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:58,193
Yes, sir, and I'm hoping that impresses
on you just how strongly I feel about this.

71
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,998
Look, I know she's no angel.

72
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,969
She's lied, she's stolen, she's cheated,
she's misrepresented herself.

73
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,734
She's lied.

74
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,174
But she also risked her life to warn us
that the Ori were on their way

75
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,714
and almost sacrificed herself
to shut down the very first Ori supergate.

76
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,283
I understand the contribution she's made.

77
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,820
The truth is, the Pentagon
isn't willing to roll the dice on her.

78
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,389
But you could convince them otherwise.

79
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,155
You see, 10 years ago,
General Hammond sat in that very chair

80
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,164
and he was faced with a similar decision.

81
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:37,999
As former First Prime to Apophis, Teal'c
had committed some terrible crimes.

82
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,197
As the former First Prime to Apophis,

83
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:44,242
Teal'c provided valuable insight
to the enemy's resources and tactics.

84
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,541
And as the mother
to the leader of the Ori army,

85
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,138
Vala may hold the key to stopping them.

86
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,682
If I push this issue

87
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,844
and the Pentagon agrees
to let her join you on off-world missions,

88
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,321
then I'd be the one ultimately
held accountable for her actions.

89
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:02,087
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.

90
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,826
So I'd be counting on you
to keep her in line.

91
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,605
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,454
So can I go on the mission?

93
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,715
No. You're not cleared
for off-world travel yet.

94
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,814
You still have to go through
a psych evaluation.

95
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,914
What's that?

96
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,551
It's sort of an interview given to
all prospective SGC personnel,

97
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,130
designed to assess
a person's psychological state,

98
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,631
get a sense of their mental well-being.

99
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,167
Oh, to find out if I'm...

100
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,998
(MAKES STRANGE SOUND)

101
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,071
...wonko.

102
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,167
Right. So, they're going to
sit you down in a little room,

103
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,868
get you talking about yourself,
and ask you a few questions.

104
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,002
- So it's a test?
- Sort of.

105
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,479
And all I have to do is pass.

106
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,106
How hard can that be?

107
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,378
I'm gonna have to do some research,
so I'm gonna use your computer

108
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,475
while you're away on this mission.

109
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,645
You know what? I'd prefer if you didn't.

110
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,120
There's a lot of sensitive material in there.

111
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,781
Great. Be careful!

112
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,325
Time to go.

113
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,554
I said no, and you can't access it
without my password!

114
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,027
Already got it. Thanks!

115
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,530
I... But the...

116
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,781
MITCHELL: This place is deader
than a Texas salad bar.

117
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,283
Hello!

118
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,030
Hello!

119
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:53,497
It is obvious this village
has long since been abandoned.

120
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,945
General. What brings you by?

121
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,819
Just thought I'd see
how you were getting along.

122
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,145
What are you doing?

123
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,317
Just a little research
for my upcoming mental appraisal.

124
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,954
You can't cram
for a psychiatric evaluation.

125
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,157
That's what they want you to think.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,797
It's a battle of wits.

127
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,096
My mind against theirs.

128
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,036
They'll try and confuse me
with their trick questions,

129
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,734
but I already have the correct answers.

130
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,401
There are no correct answers.

131
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:38,644
For instance, when they ask me,
"What do you consider your biggest flaw?"

132
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,048
No, they won't ask that question.

133
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:45,112
My answer will be that I feel
I am too much of a perfectionist.

134
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:50,125
You see, I put a positive spin
on a negative.

135
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,663
Yes, that was very transparent.

136
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:56,496
Question two. "You are in the desert.

137
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,834
"You see a tortoise lying on his back
in the hot sun.

138
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,435
"You recognize his plight,
but do nothing to help. Why?"

139
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,743
Why?

140
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:18,450
Because you are also a tortoise.

141
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,740
Guys, you should take a look at this.

142
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,919
Whoa.

143
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,220
I thought I liked to sleep in.

144
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,673
CARTER: Dr. Reimer.
REIMER: Colonel Carter, Colonel Mitchell.

145
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,675
I understand you've got a bit of
a medical mystery on your hands.

146
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,938
MITCHELL: What we have here
is a village full of skeletons.

147
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,411
CARTER: We found a few
lying on the ground,

148
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,505
but most seem to have died in their beds.

149
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,278
I think we can rule out violence.

150
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,216
Anything left besides bones?

151
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,221
Sorry, Doc, whatever happened
here happened a long time ago.

152
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,018
REIMER: Let's go take a look.

153
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,635
Did the village records give an indication
as to what befell these people?

154
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,335
No, but it does make mention
of some Ancient lore tied to the area.

155
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,434
According to legend,
a cave overlooking the village

156
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,843
was once home to Morgan Le Fay.

157
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,708
(EX CLAIMS)

158
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,751
In Arthurian myth,
Morgan was a powerful sorceress.

159
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,879
King Arthur's half-sister
and an adversary of Merlin.

160
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,684
That would suggest
she may have had a hand in

161
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,588
the disappearance of the weapon we seek.

162
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,685
Now, Morgan, like Merlin,
was a purported magic-user,

163
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,731
so it makes sense that, again like Merlin,
she was once Ascended.

164
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,323
One who foresaw the dangers
presented to her and her kind

165
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,960
by a weapon capable
of destroying Ascended beings.

166
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,562
So she took the weapon from Merlin
and went into hiding.

167
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,871
On three possible worlds. This being one.

168
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,504
We've got to find that cave.

169
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,881
Why did I have to tag along
on this little hike?

170
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,319
You got somewhere else you need to be?

171
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,357
Yeah, how about at home in bed?

172
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,724
I got pulled off inoculation duty on 865
to come here and pull a double shift.

173
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,854
I've been up 18 hours straight.

174
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,366
What is it?

175
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:46,968
Birds.

176
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,537
What birds?

177
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:56,309
My point exactly. I first noticed it in
the village, now here in the forest as well.

178
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,713
An unusual stillness.

179
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:03,482
There are no birds,
or any other animal life, for that matter.

180
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,888
All right. So what happened to them?

181
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,538
Vala. I'm Dr. Hutchison.

182
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,075
Have a seat.

183
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,344
So, how are you feeling?

184
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,177
Very well. Very well.

185
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,315
Well, you know, all things considered.

186
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,850
I mean, you'd assume I'd be a prime
candidate for acculturation difficulty,

187
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,588
enduring feelings
of displacement and alienation.

188
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,063
Perhaps even a little paranoid ideation.

189
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,830
But the truth is
I was able to adopt an abstract attitude,

190
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,499
which allowed me to release
some of my repressed feelings,

191
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,840
ultimately providing me
with a cathartic actualization.

192
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,204
How are you feeling?

193
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,449
I'm fine.

194
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,589
There's nothing here.

195
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,995
Maybe it's the wrong cavern.
We should continue searching the area.

196
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,295
CARTER: It's getting dark out, Daniel.
We should head back to the village.

197
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,733
Ackerman.

198
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,631
Yo, Ackerman! Wake up.

199
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,266
- What happened?
- We're done.

200
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,980
Sorry, Jackson.

201
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,694
Are you familiar with inkblot tests?

202
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,730
Okay. I'm going to show you
a series of images,

203
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,495
and I just want you to say the first thing
that comes to your mind.

204
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,864
Okay.

205
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,163
Courage.

206
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,306
Respect.

207
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,983
You look at this inkblot and the first
thing that pops into your head is respect?

208
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,115
Yes. Respect.

209
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,423
Okay. Vala, this is called a projective test.

210
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,090
It's designed to allow me a little insight
into your emotional state.

211
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,657
I just want to get to know you better,
not pass judgment on you.

212
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:34,705
I want to help, but to do that, I'm going to
need you to be completely honest

213
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,503
and spontaneous with your answers.
Do you understand?

214
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,907
- Of course.
- Okay.

215
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,638
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,911
Kindness.

217
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,492
Red team's wrapping it up.

218
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,427
Figured we'd do the same.

219
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,364
This can't be a dead end.
There has to be something here.

220
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,426
Take it up with Landry.

221
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,971
You can come back tomorrow,
knock yourself out,

222
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,098
strain your eyes all you want.

223
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,440
You're right. I could probably
get a fresh start in the morning.

224
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,021
All right, let's go home.

225
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,957
GRIMSBY: Hang on a minute.
Where's Ackerman?

226
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:33,657
Ackerman, come on! Bernie!

227
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,539
Ackerman. Let's go.

228
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,840
Yo, Ackerman! Wake up. Come on.

229
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:07,197
MITCHELL: He's asleep.
What the hell kind of diagnosis is that?

230
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,530
Dr. Reimer says he won't know more
until he's completed all the blood work.

231
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,298
There's got to be something more to it,
like a coma.

232
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,771
REIMER: No, I'm afraid not.

233
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:20,004
Coma patients don't respond to
outside stimuli. Pain, sound, touch.

234
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:24,515
Ackerman responds to all three.
He even flinches, reacts in his sleep state.

235
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,948
- Why can't we wake him up?
- I don't know.

236
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,816
I need to do more tests
before I can say anything for sure,

237
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,355
and we have to contact
Stargate Command

238
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,584
and have them send out
the necessary equipment.

239
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:37,458
I'm sorry, is that not something
you'd be better off doing back at the base?

240
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:42,262
Ideally, yes, but, unfortunately,
and just like Ackerman here,

241
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,802
all of our blood work
shows an elevated white cell count

242
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,303
and a marked increase in serotonin levels.

243
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,864
Whatever it is, we've all been infected.

244
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,012
You think this is the same thing
that killed the villagers?

245
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,275
Let's just say, for the time being,

246
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:01,080
I recommend we all try and stay awake
for as long as possible.

247
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,917
If we fall asleep, we may never wake up.

248
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,764
We're sending the medical supplies
through now, Colonel.

249
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,094
<i>MITCHELL: Roger that, sir.</i>

250
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,931
Sure you don't want a little more help?
I can send another team in Hazmat.

251
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,371
<i>Until we know what we're dealing with,</i>
<i>sir, that would just be risking more lives.</i>

252
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,068
<i>- We can handle it.</i>
- Understood.

253
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,419
I'm awake. I'm awake.

254
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,051
Compliments of Dr. Lam.

255
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:45,961
We have dextroampheta-something,

256
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:52,004
moto-whatchamacallit, caffeine pills,
and good old-fashioned coffee.

257
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,269
Go easy there, Grimsby.

258
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,604
How long have you been awake for?

259
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,008
I don't know, what, 24 hours?

260
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,411
Yeah, talk to me when you get to 40.

261
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,888
- You've pulled all-nighters before, right?
- Yeah, loads of them.

262
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,981
This feels worse, doesn't it?

263
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,255
Yeah, I thought it was only me.

264
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,488
I, too, am more fatigued
than I would have expected.

265
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,087
It has to be the infection.

266
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,826
It doesn't just keep you from waking up,

267
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,459
it makes you want to sleep
in the first place.

268
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,368
Well, in that case, Teal'c?

269
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,737
I prefer to rely on my tretonin.

270
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,939
Cheers. Reimer.

271
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,172
- What you got?
- Since we started monitoring him,

272
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,978
Ackerman has been in Stage 4 level,

273
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,885
what they call delta sleep
or slow-wave sleep.

274
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:48,119
We also noted that his brain is producing
a surprising amount of melatonin.

275
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,560
It's a hormone synthesized from serotonin,
a sleep-inducing agent.

276
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,187
That's what's keeping him asleep.

277
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,392
So all you've got to do is figure out
why his brain is producing the melatonin.

278
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,197
We're working on it.

279
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:04,136
Jackson, what did you find
in the town records?

280
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,074
A handwritten entry
from the village doctor

281
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,045
in which he mentions a sleeping sickness
that affected the town.

282
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,809
Now, he doesn't go into any great detail

283
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,851
but it does make mention of
a possible source for what was happening.

284
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:17,012
Morgan Le Fay.
See, it seems the villagers believed

285
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,714
she cursed them
for revealing her whereabouts

286
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,315
when King Arthur and his knights
came looking for her.

287
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,190
- So did Arthur find her here?
- JACKSON: Probably not.

288
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,697
If the villagers believed she cursed them,
then it's more than likely she escaped.

289
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,199
In any case,
we have to go back to that cave.

290
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:38,839
General, just wondering if they've reached
a decision on my mental well-being yet.

291
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:43,142
Dr. Hutchison isn't finished with you yet.
You're to meet with him again later today.

292

(SIGHS)

293
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,253
If I may speak candidly, General.

294
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:55,622
I have a feeling that
Dr. Hutchison is somewhat troubled.

295
00:19:55,727 --> 00:20:00,164
In fact, I think he may be suffering
from Klinefelter syndrome,

296
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,028
though you didn't hear it from me.

297
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:06,594
The only thing Dr. Hutchison is suffering
from is the headache you gave him.

298
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,732
I suggest you stop playing games and
start taking this evaluation very seriously.

299
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,104
I thought I was.

300
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,839
Let's call that delusional memory.

(DOOR CLOSES)

302
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,155
MITCHELL: You know,
it was Jackson's idea

303
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,124
to come back here
and check this cave out again.

304
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,095
I can't help noticing he's the only one
who didn't make the trip.

305
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,529
TEAL'C: Daniel Jackson made it clear
that his time would be better spent

306
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,193
continuing his research
of the town records.

307
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,167
CARTER: Here.

308
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,304
Dr. Reimer wanted us
to take some soil samples.

309
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,234
Why?

310
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,371
Just in case this is where
Ackerman picked up the infection.

Hello.

00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,065
Hello. May I have a moment of your time?

316
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,605
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just on my way out.
I've got a meeting.

317
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,801
With Dr. Hutchison, I know.
That's why I'm here.

318
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,400
I promise to be quick.

319
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,471
My name is Richard Woolsey.

320
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,982
I work for

representatives from the various nations

involved in the Stargate Program.

323
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,983
And what can I do for you, Mr. Woolsey?

324
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,687
Why don't I tell you
what we can do for you.

325
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:44,967
We can see to it that you pass your
psychiatric evaluation with flying colors,

00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:50,064
effectively putting any doubts Stargate
Command may have about you to rest.

327

And what would you want in return?

328
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,417
Just a little insight into the weekly
goings-on here at Stargate Command.

329
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:05,013
You see, despite the fact that
all signatories to the Gate Alliance Treaty

330
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:08,286
are de facto partners
in the Stargate Program,

331
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,487
my employers are often left out of the loop

developments here on the base.

We'd just like you
to keep us updated is all.

334
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,038
So you want me

(CHUCKLING)

337
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,748
I've read your file, Ms. Mal Doran.

338
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,414
I don't think
what we're asking is that unusual

339
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,083
for someone with such a colorful history.

340
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,759

(BEEPING)

342
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:55,406
Cam, Teal'c? I think I found something.

343
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,911
What you got?

344
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:05,346
Well, it's a faint energy spike.
I almost went past without noticing it.

345
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,228
Shazam!

346
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:26,495
- I guess Daniel was right after all.
- MITCHELL: Yes, he was.

347
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,597
We should check this out.

348
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,438
Would it not be prudent for one of us
to return these samples to Dr. Reimer

349
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,977
as quickly as possible?

350
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,068
No, he's right.

351
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,116
We're on the clock
and we have no idea how deep this hole is.

352
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:40,878
All right, I'll go back.

353
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:47,247
Stay in radio contact.
At least as long as you can.

354
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,730
Do you really think these will hold me?

355
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,969
Oh, those aren't restraints.
We're hooking you up to a polygraph.

356
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,568
It's also known as a lie detector.

357
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,615
It measures certain variables,
like blood pressure and heart rate,

358
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,775
to determine
whether you're being truthful or not.

359
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,149
Oh. I see.

360
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,882
All right. Let's get started, then, shall we?

361
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,354
And what's your name?

362
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,453
Vala Mal Doran.

363
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,231
Where did you spend the last week
on Earth?

364
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,860
Here at Stargate Command.

365
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:38,142
- Have you ever stolen anything?
- No.

366
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,415
That depends on how you define "stolen."

367
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,543
These are control questions
designed to gauge your reaction

368
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,884
by eliciting both truthful
and deceptive answers from you.

369
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,480
You're doing fine. Just

370
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:55,715
try to relax.

Oh, thank you.

374
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:10,197
- You're looking rather dashing yourself.
- Oh, thanks.

375
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,839
I mean, nice.

376
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,512
(STAMMERS) I mean, not objectionable.

377
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,926
Colonel, come take a look at this.

378
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,262
This was in that soil sample
you brought back from the cave.

379
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,305
What is it?

380
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,571
I believe it's a parasite.

381
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,608
- Is it dead?
- No, it's dormant.

382
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,583
Ackerman may have
somehow awakened one.

383
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:57,655
Well, how? It doesn't seem
to respond to movement.

384
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:01,624
Excuse me. Let's see what happens

385
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:08,725
when they come in contact
with live tissue.

386
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,404
Whoa.

387
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,942
I'll lay odds that's your culprit right there.

388
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,541
These people would have
had no understanding of microbiology.

389
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,483
They probably came up
with the story of Morgan's curse

390
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,421
because they couldn't comprehend
what was happening to them.

391
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,322
CARTER: Hey.

392
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,087
Where's Grimsby?

393
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,793
He said he was on his way back.
He isn't here?

394
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,631
Oh, no.

395
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,818
Perhaps we should rest.

396
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,589
No. That's a bad idea.

397
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,751
And I am starting to regret staying up late

398
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,389
to watch <i>Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo</i>
last night.

399
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:17,400
Check that,
I regretted it almost immediately.

(FAINT RUSTLING)

401
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:24,269
- Am I imagining things, or...
- I heard it as well.

402
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,009
Grimsby!

00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,952
Sam?

404
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:58,473

He's asleep, and we can't wake him.

Dr. Reimer?

406
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,581
What's wrong? Has his condition changed?

407
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,713
Well, you could say that.

408
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:14,723
He's dead.

409
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,468
REIMER: I see evidence of a ruptured
aneurysm near the pineal gland.

410
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,405
There's something else in here.

411
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,741
REIMER: What the hell?

412
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,889
Morphology is identical to the parasite
we found in the soil sample.

413
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,685
Only it's grown 1,000 times bigger.

414
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,426
I'm assuming things didn't go well.

415
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,783
I fail to see the point
of that ridiculous exercise,

416
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,714
unless its purpose was
to thoroughly humiliate me.

417
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,186
Those questions weren't intended
to shed light on my character

418
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:27,594
or delve deeply into my subconscious.

419
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,432
They were merely little reminders
as to exactly why

420
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,570
I don't belong here.

421
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:43,505
Then I take it you've carefully considered
our offer and come to a decision?

422
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,784
I have.

423
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,922

MITCHELL: Okay, question.

426
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:20,751
If what took out the village
is what killed all the wildlife around here,

427
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:24,015
how come that little sucker's
alive and kicking?

428
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,750
It may possess a natural immunity
to this mysterious affliction.

429
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:27,950
Yeah, that's exactly my point.

430
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:34,191
So, all we got to do
is catch Joe Bob there,

431

take him back up to Carter and Reemer...
Reimer, whatever.

Bob's your uncle. We sleep till Tuesday.

(RADIO STATIC)

437
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,049
We have progressed too far
within the cave system.

438
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,885
Yes, we have.

439
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,017
All right, well, we'll nab Junior first,

440
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:06,221
then we'll call Carter
when we get back up to the surface.

441
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,645
Progress?

442
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:32,553
We've been theorizing that when
the parasite enters the bloodstream,

443
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:36,923
it triggers the body's immune response
and the production of serotonin.

444
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:42,193
Then it makes its way to the patient's
brain, where it lodges and feeds.

445
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,031
Feeds?

446
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,802
- On what?
- Melatonin.

447
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,309
Our analysis showed the parasite
we removed from Ackerman

448
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,810
gorged itself on the stuff.

449
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,541
CARTER: It stimulates the production
of melatonin, which floods the body,

450
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,285
that's why the urge to sleep
is so powerful.

451
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:00,774
That's why the urge to sleep
is so powerful.

452
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:05,117
And once you give in,
the parasite just keeps on feeding

453
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:12,492
until the engorged parasite affects
the surrounding cranial tissue,

454
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,657
eventually provoking a lethal aneurysm.

455
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:21,228
But we're thinking that it may be possible
to starve out the parasite,

456
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,931
so, to that end,

457
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,841
we have isolated a specimen that
we awakened from a dormant state.

458
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,169
(GROANS)

459
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:31,606

462
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,908
He's dead.

463
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,322
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Ah, Vala.

464
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,558
Oh, not you again.

00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,601
You know, you have
another scheduled appointment.

466
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:25,726
What would be the point of that?

467
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,862
You people have already made up
your minds about me.

468
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,371
Is that what you think?

469
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,136
Well, it's not like I haven't encountered
this sort of thing before.

470
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,006
You know, I saw it every day
in the eyes of the people

471
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,081
who couldn't separate me
from the Goa'uld who enslaved them.

472
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,878
So, you know, instead of becoming
a victim of their arrogance and stupidity,

473
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:45,149
I chose to take advantage of it.
So I lied, I cheated, and I stole.

474
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,714
I'm not going to apologize for it
and, to be perfectly honest with you,

475
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:52,557
I can't guarantee that I won't do it again.
All right?

476
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,566
Of course, I have recently
found myself risking my life

477
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,034
for something other
than my own personal benefit.

478
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,538
Maybe it's just a phase. Hold it, please.

479
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,803
Or maybe it's because, for the first time,
I've actually met someone

480
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,936
who, in some small way,
actually believes in me,

481
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,845
but I'm sure you're right.
I'm sure it will pass.

482
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,211
What?

00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,212
CARTER: Daniel!

484
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,056
- You can't fall asleep. Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

485
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,064
We can't take any more of these, either.

486
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:33,297
With our serotonin and melatonin levels
spiking, it's too dangerous.

487
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,964
We're going to have to rely on each other,
all right?

488
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,472
Okay.

489
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,728
Easy, there.

490
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,899
Easy. Don't worry.

491
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,636
I'm not going to hurt you.

00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:34,091
There is much ground to cover
if we are to reach the surface.

No, you... You go ahead without me.
I'm just going to...

I'm just going to stay here. I'm cooked.

498
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,004
Then I will carry you if I must.

Forget it. No.

catch up with you at some point.

The important thing for you
is to take Kermit back to Carter

502
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,580
and what's-his-name

503
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,118
and get them started on the cure.

504
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:05,928
Indeed. I will return for you,
Colonel Mitchell.

505
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,824
And I'll be

506
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:12,858
right here

507
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,272
waiting on you.

508
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,445
Sam! Sam.

509
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,278
I can't do it anymore.

510
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:30,753
You have to. You got to hang in there
just a little while longer.

511
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:42,365
In here! Dr. Jackson, Colonel Carter,
where's the rest of your team?

512
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,559
Reimer and Ackerman are dead.

513
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:48,298
- Teal'c and Mitchell went to the caves.
- What caves?

514
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,938
Get them in the isolation pods.

515
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,179
No, wait. Wait.

516
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,184
No, wait.

517
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,348
We can't go to sleep.

518
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,953
It's okay. We'll take care of you.

519
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,086
No, you don't understand.

520
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:15,063
The parasite. It feeds on...

521
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,497
(INAUDIBLE)

522
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,101
(COUGHS)

523
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:03,174
Take it easy, Teal'c. We've got you.
Take it easy.

524
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:03,503
Take it easy, Teal'c. We've got you.
Take it easy.

525
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,280
We've got some sort of animal here.
We need to take it to the lab.

526
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:24,360
Yeah, I was getting worked up, cussing at
Teal'c, telling him to, "Go on. Leave me."

527
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:28,462
Must have been 20 minutes
before I realized he had gone

528
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,693
and I was sitting there talking to myself.

529
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,530
JACKSON: What about you?
Any hallucinations?

530
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,834
Yeah, when they put me in the pod,
I imagined I was being put in a coffin.

531
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,499
I thought I was being buried alive.

532
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,942
Well, rise and shine. How are you feeling?

533
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,638
Rested and raring to go, sir.

534
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,613
I assume Dr. Lam got you up to speed.

535
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,740
CARTER: Yes, sir.

536
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,409
Between the sample
they collected from Teal'c

537
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,680
and the research
Dr. Reimer and I conducted,

538
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,757
they were able to produce a serum
that effectively isolated the parasite

539
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:54,847
and starved it out.

540
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,395
I just hate that that cave was a dead end.
We went through all that for nothing.

541
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,895
JACKSON: I wouldn't say that exactly.

542
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,557
I did find one reference in that library
that might prove to be useful.

543
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,526
Atlantis.

544
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,627
You think the location of Merlin's weapon
is hidden in their database?

545
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,501
I think it's worth checking out.

546
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,904
(PHONE RINGING)

547
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:14,936
Carter.

548
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,946
I see. We'll be right there.

549
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,481
There seems to be a problem
in the gate room, sir.

550
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,824
I never liked you
and I know you can hear me.

551
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,863
Dial the gate now! Dial the gate!

552
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:36,228
Don't make me come in there! You stop it.

553
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,766
What's going on?

554
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,268
I'm leaving.

555
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,134
I'm not staying somewhere
where I'm not welcome,

556
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,901
and don't even think about
making me stay against my will.

557
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,739
Wouldn't dream of it.
But I figured you'd want to stay

558
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:51,679
after going through all the trouble
of passing the psychiatric evaluation.

559
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,242
I passed?

560
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:57,878
Dr. Hutchison seems to think
that you have a lot of potential.

561
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,247
He does?

562
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:04,521
He feels you can make a significant
contribution here at Stargate Command,

563
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,061
and I agree.

564
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,591
Congratulations.

565
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:18,831
I'm a little

566
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:20,835
overwhelmed.

567
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:29,183
But as my first official act, I'd like to
report a rather disagreeable little man.

568
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,685
That would be me.

569
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,688
Mr. Woolsey's offer was part of the test.

570
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,088
We wanted to make sure
we could trust you.

571
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:40,995
I knew that, but were his sexual advances
part of the test?

572
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,726
What? That's... General, I can assure you...

573
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,893
Well, I would have even
considered playing along,

574
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,698
but some of his requests were...

575
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:51,707
Well, a little unusual, even for me.

576
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:56,610
General, I would never...
General... General, wait...

577
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,811
So when do I get
one of these SG-1 badges?

578
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:05,946
You don't. You're not a member of SG-1.

579
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,651
You're a probationary member
of Stargate Command

580
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:13,093
who will be subject to some very intensive
scrutiny for the next few months.

581
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,323
Oh.

582
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,857
Don't screw up.

583
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,035
And welcome aboard.

584
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:32,041
See, I still think it's cause for celebration,
so I say we go out, have lunch, and I'll pay.

585
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,445
Pay with what, exactly?

586
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,044
Well, Daniel will cover me
until I get my share of the loot.

587
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,089
Loot?

588
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:46,458
Yeah, from all the treasures we're going
to bring back from our off-world travels.

589
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:51,796
What, I have to wait until I'm off probation
before I can start collecting?
