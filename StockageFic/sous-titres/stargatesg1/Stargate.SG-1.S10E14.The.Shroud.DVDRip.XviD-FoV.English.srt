1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,533
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:07,002
Merlin was conducting research
on some kind of new invention,

3
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,837
a weapon capable of
destroying Ascended beings.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,145
"Here lies Myrrdin,
Archmage of the Round."

5
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:18,906
He's dead.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,455
We've seen it used to download
information into someone's mind.

7
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,156
- You have Merlin's memories?
- Some of them.

8
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:28,352
Earth, Atlantis
and the work he did in this lab.

9
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:32,598
What is that?

10
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,860
First step towards
creating Merlin's weapon.

11
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,495
I have too many thoughts in my head.
I can't concentrate. I get confused.

12
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,436
- You have to fight it.
- I have to let it happen.

13
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,882
Get to the gate! I'll be right behind you.

14
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,654
TEVARIS: He was very persuasive.

15
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,588
"Convert or die."
Yeah, I'd say that's got some bite.

16
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:10,692
He said nothing of death.
Only salvation and life eternal.

17
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,832
The blessings of the Ori.

18
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,871
He didn't threaten you?

19
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,043
TEVARIS: He spoke of the religion.

20
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,444
Left this book with us
to read and consider.

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,180
Said he'd be back today
to hear our answer.

22
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,377
Well, you're not alone.
This is happening all over the galaxy.

23
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,716
Are you saying
this Prior's claims are false?

24
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,087
We're saying that book's got about
as much truth in it as <i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

25
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,251
Hey, that's what they want you to think.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,590
- They? They who?
- I do not understand.

27
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,027
It's a book from our planet.

28
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,656
It's very entertaining,
but it is fiction nonetheless.

29
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,734
I wouldn't be so sure.

30
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,269
Okay, I think we've gotten
a little off point here.

31
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,861
What evidence do you have
to support your position?

32
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:51,342
Well, we really don't have any,
and we can't tell you what to do.

33
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,538
Obviously, subjugating people
by threatening their lives is wrong,

34
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,582
so if you choose to resist,
we'll do our very best to try to help you.

35
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,879
Not that we can make many promises.

36
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,981
But we've seen a number of villages
just like this one wiped out.

37
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,116
As I have said,
the Prior made no such threat

38
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:12,790
and spoke upon the positive
merits of Origin as true salvation.

39
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,833
Soft sell, that's a new approach.

40
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,964
VILLAGER: The Prior of Ori returns!

41
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,599
(VILLAGERS MURMURING)

42
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,471
Listen. No matter which way
you're gonna come down on this,

43
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:27,068
it's probably best if that Prior
doesn't know we're around.

44
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,474
You can hide here.

45
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,430
Welcome back.

46
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,267
PRIOR: Thank you, Tevaris.

47
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,967
Have you contemplated your divine right?

48
00:02:56,075 --> 00:03:00,136
We have, Prior.
We wish to hear more of your wisdom.

49
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,779
It is not my wisdom,
but the wisdom of the ages

50
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,682
passed on to us by the only true gods.

51
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,620
Hallowed are the Ori.

52
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:27,900
Adria must've done something to him.
I mean, before turning him into a Prior.

53
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,234
You mean she brainwashed him somehow.

54
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,999
Well, Daniel would never willingly become
one of them like that, preach their beliefs.

55
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,665
MITCHELL: He's damn good at it.

56
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,273
Had those people eating out of his hands

57
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,403
without issuing
one tiny little genocidal threat.

58
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,414
That's what makes me think there's
still a part of Daniel in there somewhere.

59
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,676
He's better than all this.

60
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,276
Yes, but we still have to face
the very real possibility

61
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,413
that it's not even really Daniel anymore.

62
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,491
Having Merlin's consciousness
downloaded into his mind

63
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,423
could have overshadowed
Daniel completely,

64
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,825
weakened him to the point
where Adria could do this.

65
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,557
Still, we cannot abandon him.

66
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,165
So, what do we do?

67
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:05,135
We go get him, try to figure out
what happened, try to undo it.

68
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,306
- Turn him back.
- That's going to be very risky.

69
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,775
Could be exactly what Adria is hoping for.
She might be using him to get to us.

70
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,903
Still, it's Daniel.

71
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,940
- Lf there's any chance.
- We have no choice.

72
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,954
"Aroden then took off the mask
and revealed his face.

73
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,829
"'Your appearance matters not,' he said.
'Only the truth of spirit in your heart."'

74
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,863
Blessed are those that follow
the path to Origin.

75
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,569
(ALL EX CLAIMING)

76
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,412
Hey, what took you guys so long?

77
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,720
- Carter, we got him.
- Great.

78
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,585
Take us into hyperspace.

79
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:12,229
- I take it the anti-Prior device is working.
- Well, he didn't stop us from zatting him.

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,234
Guys?

81
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,373
Daniel?

82
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,912
What's going on?

83
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,978
We could be asking you.

84
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,218
Okay, this is not necessary.

85
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,315
No offense, but have you
looked in the mirror lately?

86
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,654
I'm not a threat to you.

87
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,594
In case you change your mind,
you should know there is someone

88
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:42,066
with a finger poised over a button
waiting to beam you out into space.

89
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,160
We had to let this happen.
It's part of the plan.

90
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,972
- I'm sorry. "We"?
- Oh, yeah, myself and Merlin.

91
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,803
Oh. So he's still inside you.

92
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,505
Yeah, you remember back on the planet
when Adria and I were fighting it out?

93
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,309
Yeah, thanks for that, by the way.

94
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,543
Yeah, it's a good thing
you guys got out, too.

95
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,449
She was way too powerful for me,

96
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,549
but I couldn't just let Merlin's weapon
fall into her hands.

97
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,486
I know it's our only chance
of destroying the Ori.

98
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,959
You gave in.

99
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,655
More or less.

100
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,571
Of course, Origin is designed to channel
the energy of its followers to the Ori.

101
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,576
It's that unselfish act of giving
that leads one's soul to salvation,

102
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,612
and ultimately, to Ascension.

103
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,874
This is no great secret.
The <i>Book of Origin</i> says,

104
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:34,214
"Make yourself one with the path,
and the journey will lead you to eternity."

105
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,811
Were it not for the power
the Ori draw from our belief,

106
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,619
the Ancients would have
wiped them out long ago.

107
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:40,793
Why?

108
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,384
You know the answer.
You were once Ascended.

109
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,957
Because they won't tolerate
anyone or anything

110
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,660
that doesn't follow their collective rules.

111
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,033
They claim not to interfere,
but they do manipulate.

112
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,935
They use their power
to hoard their knowledge

113
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,839
and prevent those beneath them
from reaching their level.

114
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,378
<i>JACKSON: She seemed to know</i>
<i>everything about me.</i>

115
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,348
<i>She had a tremendous power</i>
<i>of persuasion.</i>

116
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,513
<i>It was almost as if I could hear her voice</i>
<i>inside my head telling me what to believe.</i>

117
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:15,650
So I let her believe
that she was getting to me, turning me.

118
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,098
- Why?
- Because I needed her to trust me.

119
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,725
And did she? Well, don't get me wrong.

120
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,361
You're not a terrible liar,
but you're nowhere near as good as me.

121
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:27,939
Who is?

122
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,134
And Adria could see right through me.
So how did you manage to fool her?

123
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:35,180
I was able to protect Daniel, make Adria
think he had succumbed to her will.

124
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,841
- Merlin?
- It was necessary.

125
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,525
In our time together, I've really come to
see in you what draws Mother's affection.

126
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,761
Affects what?

127
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,837
It's very important to me
that we save her together.

128
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,107
Of course.

129
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,445
I can feel the difference in you.

130
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:15,019
It's because you've done so much for me,
showing me the true path.

131
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,348
I'm glad.

132
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,527
And there's so much more
I can do for you, and you for me.

133
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,830
So, she trusted you enough
to turn you into a Prior.

134
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,374
- She had to.
- Why, exactly?

135
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,273
Because she knew I was her best chance
of converting Earth.

136
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,346
And me.

137
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,175
Well, that would explain why she wanted
to believe you, not why she had to.

138
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,947
She had Merlin's weapon.
She just didn't know how to finish it.

139
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,681
I thought she knew everything.

140
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,781
She's human.
Her knowledge is still limited.

141
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,359
But Merlin knew how.

142
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,528
It was a quick and easy way
to avoid an all-out war

143
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,995
between the Ori and the Ancients.

144
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,261
She knows the device can be used
to wipe out the Ancients,

145
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,132
so I told her I would finish it for her.

146
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,930
- Did you?
- Not exactly, but close.

147
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,636
I needed to have the rest of my plan
in place before I finished it.

148
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,007
Which is?

149
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,375
- I needed her to make me a Prior.
- Hello.

150
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,214
So I could steal an Ori ship and fly it
through the supergate to the Ori galaxy

151
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,050
with the weapon onboard
and destroy them.

152
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,285
Okay, one small flaw in that plan.

153
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,522
I know. There's a wormhole blocking
the supergate, and that's why I'm here.

154
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,894
I need you guys to shut it down.

155
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,277
He knew he was no match for her,

156
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,973
and he couldn't let Merlin's
unfinished weapon fall into her hands.

157
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,448
So he and Merlin came up with a plan
to fool Adria

158
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,542
into thinking
that he had succumbed to her power.

159
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,450
So he could continue
to work on the weapon

160
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,150
ostensibly, this time,
for her to use against the Ancients.

161
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,283
Merlin?

162
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,285
He says he still has Merlin's
consciousness in his mind.

163
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,762
Merlin even seemed
to be speaking on occasion.

164
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,231
Daniel says that's what protected him
from Adria's influence

165
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,462
and what's allowed him
to convince her to make him a Prior.

166
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,835
Why did he need her to make him a Prior?

167
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,272
So he could steal the Ori ship
with the weapon onboard

168
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,775
and fly it through the supergate.

169
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,074
He wants us to shut down
the incoming wormhole so he can dial out.

170
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,910
Yeah, so he says.

171
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,075
You do not believe
Daniel Jackson is being truthful?

172
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,915
Oh, I want to believe him.

173
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,956
That could be exactly
what they expect of us.

174
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,515
If Adria really did somehow manage
to brainwash Daniel, then...

175
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,891
This whole thing could be
an elaborate plot to get us

176
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:15,228
to shut down that wormhole so
more Ori ships can come into our galaxy.

177
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,571
So, what do we do?

178
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,023
Fellows.

179
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,194
This is new.

180
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,792
Yeah, it's always something, isn't it?

181
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,236
Got to tell you, though, not your look.

182
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,035
Oh, it is just temporary.

183
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,936
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

184
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,342
You see, when Merlin programmed
the Ancient device to download

185
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,508
his consciousness into my brain,
he gave it a time limit.

186
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,449
See, he knew I could only survive
so long with the knowledge

187
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:11,080
and consciousness of
two distinct people in one mind, so...

188
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,290
And when he goes?

189
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,916
He's genetically programmed
my body and mind

190
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,463
to revert back to the state it was in
before he was downloaded.

191
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,225
- He can do that?
- Yeah, I'm hoping so.

192
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,994
I won't look like this anymore.

193
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,933
I won't have any
of a Prior's special abilities.

194
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,097
Unfortunately, I'll just be
little old me again.

195
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:29,930
But that's good news.

196
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,840
Yeah, except I won't be able
to fly an Ori ship,

197
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:37,075
it'll be too late to execute the plan,
and Adria will have Merlin's weapon.

198
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,980
- I thought that wasn't finished yet.
- It's very close.

199
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,950
All the pieces are there.
It just needs to be assembled.

200
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,521
Adria will figure it out.

201
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,682
And just when does your chariot
turn back into a pumpkin?

202
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,387
- I don't have much time. A day or so.
- A day?

203
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,430
Kind of risky
leaving it this late in the game.

204
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,623
Well, I didn't have much choice,

205
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,997
and it took you guys a little longer
to capture me than I planned, so...

206
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,069
Right.

207
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,137
Why do we have to do that again?

208
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,708
Well, I couldn't exactly just come to you.

209
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,175
I think Adria might have
suspected something.

210
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,768
Yes, I see.

211
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,939
Jack, you have to believe me.

212
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,817
Why?

213
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,718
Why? Well, because...

214
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,686
Oh, I don't know, the fate
of the galaxy hangs in the balance.

215
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:21,658
You know,
that old chestnut's getting a little old.

216
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,125
No, no, that part never gets old.

217
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,130
Now, you have to shut down that
supergate and you have to let me go.

218
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,132
You know how much
I hate being told what to do.

219
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,394
Jack, it's me.

220
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,992
What, that's supposed to convince me?
Look at you.

221
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,129
Have I ever let you down?
No, don't answer that.

222
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,470
Have I ever let you down
when it really mattered?

223
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,043
I don't even know
who I'm really talking to right now!

224
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,805
Not when you were
being tortured by Ba'al,

225
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,744
killed, brought back to life
over and over again.

226
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,976
- I stood by you the whole...
- All right, just stop!

227
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,776
I don't need to be reminded of that.

228
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,750
I've been around
this barbecue a few times.

229
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,189
Just because you know
the stuff Daniel knows

230
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,660
doesn't mean you're him,
doesn't mean you're telling the truth.

231
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,061
I mean, come on, you've got to know
what you're asking me to do.

232
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,132
I do!

233
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:06,364
You know, there's a bottom line here.
Carter doesn't think it can't be done.

234
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,736
Yes, it can.
A Mark IX beamed directly behind the gate

235
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,502
in the Pegasus Galaxy
will destroy that gate.

236
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,133
The wormhole connection will be broken.

237
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,144
How do you know that?

238
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,713
Hello? Merlin!

239
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,215
- Oh, yes, Merlin!
- Jack, I wish I had proof.

240
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,911
I wish I had a way to convince you,
but I don't.

241
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,650
Now, this was the only choice I had,
and I took it. It's a good plan.

242
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,626
It just happens to hinge on you guys
believing in me, having a little faith.

243
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,719
Now, I thought you, of all people, might.

244
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,058
Why?

245
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,498
You, of all people, should know that
I don't believe anything anybody says,

246
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,628
even if I understand
what they're talking about!

247
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,601
Jack, it's me.

248
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,967
Yeah?

249
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,285
CARTER: He's right, sir.

250
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,381
A Mark IX Gate Buster, beamed
directly behind the event horizon

251
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,983
so the force won't be absorbed
by the active wormhole,

252
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,121
would destroy the gate
and sever the connection.

253
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:07,699
Yeah,

254
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,532
I should've known that.

255
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:14,730
- So, do you believe him now?
- I honestly don't know.

256
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,968
Well, unfortunately, I don't think
a polygraph would work in this case.

257
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,808
No, but I'm not worried about that.

258
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,039
See, I think we've got something better.

259
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,014
You know, Teal'c, the longer I'm gone,

260
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,091
the more suspicious
Adria is going to become.

261
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,490
Why were you preaching
to the villagers on that planet?

262
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,652
What?

263
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,853
I told you, I found out
you guys were going to be there,

264
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,898
so I set myself up to be captured.

265
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,865
You misunderstand me, Daniel Jackson.

266
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,835
Why is Adria not suspicious
of your actions?

267
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,837
You attempt to reform
a meaningless planet of people

268
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,069
instead of completing the weapon?

269
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,813
Actually, she was the one who stopped me
before I completed the weapon.

270
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,107
Why?

271
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,837
- I'm almost done.
- I know.

272
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,610
You must stop for now.

273
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,522
You're afraid the Ancients
will take the device away from us

274
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,650
before we can use it.

275
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,593
They've interfered once before
in its creation.

276
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,561
You're using Merlin's knowledge,

277
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,395
knowledge he kept
from when he was Ascended.

278
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,927
But if I don't finish it...

279
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,762
For now,

280
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:58,474
you must help bring the energy
of more followers into the fold.

281
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,542
The original plan was for the Ori
to convert our whole galaxy

282
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,912
so they could build up their power
enough to attack the Ancients.

283
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,384
But even then, a conflict like that
on that level was going to be costly.

284
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,853
But now they have a weapon
that could destroy all Ascended beings

285
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:14,016
within the scope of an entire galaxy
in one fell swoop.

286
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,287
They just need to distract the Ancients
long enough so that they can use it.

287
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,694
Engage them in battle
long enough to complete the weapon.

288
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,858
And back off to safety
while Adria detonates it.

289
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,562
If the Ancients perceive
this weapon as a threat,

290
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,730
why not intervene and simply take it now?

291
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,864
I have no idea.

292
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,340
I mean, maybe they want to
give my plan a chance to work.

293
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,809
Either way, the Ori believe
they still need more power

294
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,506
to maximize their chances for success.

295
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,078
More power.

296
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,981
That means they will need
more followers...

297
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,075
Exactly.

298
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,484
Adria's out working hard for the cause,

299
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,524
which leaves me the perfect opportunity
to steal the ship with the weapon on it.

300
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,026
If you guys would just believe
I'm still on your side.

301
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,623
We're running out of time.

302
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,069
I believe Daniel Jackson speaks the truth.

303
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,110
Lot of good it's going to do us.

304
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,885
I'm going to let you tell them yourself
because I don't have a stomach for it.

305
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,285
MITCHELL: That's all right, sir,
General O'Neill filled us in.

306
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,186
The IOA has nixed the whole thing.

307
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,555
No, I don't think you know everything.

308
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,140
You have to understand,

309
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,144
we've considered
all the evidence at our disposal,

310
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,043
but more than that, as difficult as this is,

311
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,015
I feel very strongly
that we have no viable option.

312
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,784
You want to get to the point?

313
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:55,090
I assure you this may be
the hardest decision I'll ever make,

314
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,257
but I take full responsibility for it.

315
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:03,158
Based on my recommendation,
the IOA has proposed to the President

316
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,635
that Daniel Jackson's life
be terminated immediately.

317
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,584
JACKSON: So, what the hell is going on?

318
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,082
This and that. You know, the usual.

319
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,921
You'll never believe what's happening
on <i>One Life to Live.</i>

320
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,086
I really hate to press
the issue here, but I do have a deadline.

321
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,185
So do we.

322
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,787
Oh, yes, I know, before I figure out

323
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,924
how to overcome the effects
of the anti-Prior device.

324
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,899
I thought Teal'c believed me.

325
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,130
- Oh, he does.
- Jack?

326
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,540
No, he's on your side, too.

327
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:48,075
That little weasel man who
somehow represents your government.

328
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,375
Woolsey?

329
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:54,846
I can't be certain,
but I think he might not like you.

330
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,285
He wants to have me killed, doesn't he?

331
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:01,253
I'm not sure how serious he is.
He seems quite the prankster to me.

332
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,850
You know, I was afraid of that.

333
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,631
He was the one who argued to keep
Khalek alive and got burned for it.

334
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:05,995
He was the one who argued to keep
Khalek alive and got burned for it.

335
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,065
Khalek?

336
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,257
It was his highly evolved half-breed son.

337
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:13,031
Two people died as a result.
It could have been much worse.

338
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,404
Now that you mention it,
that seems to be in play.

339
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:23,772
But not to worry.
If it comes down to it, I have a plan.

340
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,248
Oh, you have a plan. Great. What is it?

341
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,649
Well,

342
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,891
when I said that I had a plan,
I meant that I have to plan the plan.

343
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,928
So when, or rather, if,
it comes down to it, I will have a plan.

344
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,800
I've cleared my whole afternoon

345
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,470
for planning.

346
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,341
You believe me, right?

347
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:56,748
Mmm-hmm.

348
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,584
Okay, now I don't believe you.

349
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,131
Imagine our positions were reversed.

350
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,759
What would you do?

351
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,837
Hmm...

352
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,036
I know you've trusted me even when
you've had every reason not to,

353
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:29,572
but perhaps I'm the only one who knows
how dangerous and powerful Adria is.

354
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,840
There's no evidence.

355
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,615
Only your word,
and that should be enough,

356
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,179
but this is so big.

357
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:42,422
- Well, I wouldn't let them kill you.
- Of course not.

358
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,225
I won't let that happen to you.

359
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,661
But would you support me,

360
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:55,566
if what I was proposing could very well
open the door to the final Ori victory?

361
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,708
Not if there was the slightest chance
that I wasn't on the level,

362
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,745
even if it was the tiniest nagging doubt.

363
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,358
That's a load of crap.
You're wasting our time.

364
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,460
Dr. Jackson was the one
who suggested we should kill Khalek.

365
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,436
He was the demon spawn of Anubis.

366
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,737
And Dr. Jackson is now
potentially an even bigger threat.

367
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,834
I think the operative
word there is "potentially".

368
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,913
We don't know exactly
what's going on yet.

369
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,915
And by the time we do, it may be too late.

370
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,382
We know that anti-Prior device

371
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,851
will only subdue his powers
for a limited time.

372
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,388
After that, you won't
be able to control him.

373
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,586
All right, listen to me closely,
because I'm only going to say this once.

374
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,496
You kill Daniel over my dead body.

375
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,931
Obviously, we need to discuss
some realistic options.

376
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,497
We can't hold Dr. Jackson long-term
and we can't release him,

377
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,073
given what he knows.

378
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,309
Well, if he has fallen under their influence,

379
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,811
the Ori likely know everything
they can learn from him already.

380
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:09,881
What are you suggesting?

381
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,111
Dr. Jackson claims he'll revert
back to his old self in short order.

382
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,483
We only need to hold him long enough
to see if that's true.

383
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:21,150
If it's not, we still have the option
of placing him in stasis.

384
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,987
If he hasn't already caused
a major catastrophe by then.

385
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,619
Oh, will you stop it?

386
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,526
If he is telling the truth,

387
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:32,035
then we've blown the best chance
we've ever had of beating the bad guys.

388
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,078
How's it going, sir?

389
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,945
Longing for the days
when I actually carried a weapon.

390
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,382
- What do you got?
- A crazy idea.

391
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,752
I'm down with crazy. I like crazy.
Crazy and I are like that.

392
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,324
Cam likes crazy, too.

393
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,926
Listen, if what Jackson is saying is true,

394
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:58,723
there is an Ori ship out there
with a near-complete weapon on it

395
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,162
that could prove useful against the Ori.

396
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,566
- I think we should go after it.
- You're right, that's crazy.

397
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:08,298
I'm just saying, if they're not going
to let Jackson complete his mission,

398
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,306
there is no reason that we shouldn't try.

399
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,036
Daniel Jackson may be able to provide
us with the intelligence required

400
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,203
to ensure the success for this mission.

401
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:18,111
He might be able to tell us where the ship
is and how to get aboard undetected.

402
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,343
And he must have enough knowledge
of their technology by now

403
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,578
to provide me with what I need

404
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,177
to interface with the ship's
control systems.

405
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,847
Assuming he tells you.

406
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,849
Well, why wouldn't he?

407
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,455
If he knows he's not going anywhere...

408
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,092
- That's crazy.
- That's what I said. It's crazy.

409
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,830
It's nuts. It's wacko.
But let's be honest, what isn't?

410
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,672
Jack, I'm the only one
who should be going.

411
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,172
It's too dangerous for anyone else.

412
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,675
Not if you give me the intel we need.

413
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,039
It's my plan.

414
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,841
It was a bad one. Come on, Daniel,

415
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,710
you had to know we weren't going
to shut down that supergate for you.

416
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:54,944
We had no choice.

417
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,577
Oh, now it's "we".

418
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:01,615
You've been in my position before.
Well, not this one, but similar.

419
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,727
Yes, I'm sure I have,

420
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,562
but my brain's been messed with
so much over the years, I don't remember.

421
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,568
Wait a second, with your way,
you still have to shut down the supergate.

422
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,365
Come on, where's the ship?

423
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,505
How does Carter fly it?

424
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,036
And give me any other intel
I might need to make this op a success.

425
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,204
Come on.

426
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,079
I'm trusting you.

427
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,120
Oh, yes, I really feel the faith.

428
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,919
Well, now you have to trust us.

429
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,220
Let us finish what you started.

430
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,922
The Ori ship containing Merlin's weapon

431
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,864
is parked in orbit
around a planet with a gate.

432
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,960
We gate to the planet,
use rings to get aboard.

433
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,129
There is a Prior in charge of the ship

434
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,502
but he preaches to the masses
on the planet daily.

435
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,872
I thought only a Prior
could fly one of their ships.

436
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,604
The systems are activated
using mind control,

437
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,907
but Daniel's given me
what I need to get around it.

438
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:59,006
He's also given us instructions
on how to put the final pieces together.

439
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,518
<i>Daedalus</i> will be standing by
in Pegasus to shut down the wormhole.

440
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,919
We use the Ori ship to dial out,
and we send the weapon through.

441
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,218
But not before the <i>Odyssey</i> beams us off.

442
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,020
Now, that's a plan.

443
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,321
That depends entirely
on Daniel Jackson's word.

444
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:17,595
We will know whether he's on the level
before we shut off the supergate.

445
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,398
So at this point, the only thing at risk

446
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,473
is us.

447
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,356
No gun.

448
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,464
Hmm.

449
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,561
Did you bring lethal injection,
high voltage,

450
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,160
or are you just going to have them
beam me out into space?

451
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,205
I think you understand my position.

452
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,467
I gave Jack the information you asked for.

453
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:00,738
And you will be frozen in stasis
until such time

454
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,678
that SG-1's mission is deemed successful.

455
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:09,517
I take it then, you're not going to allow me
to just turn back into my old self?

456
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,918
If the intel turns out to be reliable,

457
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,421
you will be unfrozen
and allowed to resume transforming,

458
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,257
if that indeed is going to happen.

459
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,990
I see.

460
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,438
I am here out of respect for you.

461
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,977
I wanted to explain personally

462
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,571
that we're about to beam you
into the Ancient pod in Antarctica.

463
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,613
Okay.

464
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,924
You're clear to beam the prisoner out now.

465
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,327
What's the holdup?

466
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:01,764
<i>MAN: We're having some technical</i>
<i>problems. We can't seem to get a lock.</i>

467
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,059
Not part of my plan.

468
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:38,966
I've always been the one
who caused the worry, not the worrier.

469
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,437
It's not easy. Don't second-guess yourself.
This is the best possible course of action.

470
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:47,177
Exactly. Action, good. Sitting around, bad.

471
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:51,187
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,
I still worry sometimes, too, about you.

472
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,655
- Well, thank you, sir.
- Don't mention it.

473
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,589
I thought we fixed this thing
so that wouldn't happen anymore.

474
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,499
Daniel?

475
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:12,768
Jack.

476
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,044
- What's up?
- Oh, I'm taking the ship.

477
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,637
Oh. I see that.

478
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,879
Yeah, I beamed the crew safely
to the surface.

479
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,652
Nice for them.

480
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,479
But, as you probably figured out by now,
I'm going to need you.

481
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:30,557
You know, I was just thinking
how much I missed being needed.

482
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,160
(MEN YELLING)

483
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:10,091
All right, fellows, here's the deal.
We're commandeering this ship.

484
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,160
I'd like for you to throw down
your weapons and surrender, please.

485
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,673
That's a no.

486
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,380
We asked nicely.

487
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,067
Okay.

488
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,177
This shouldn't be too bad.

489
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,207
I don't know.

490
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,081
For me, whenever there's some
assembly required,

491
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:07,248
I inevitably find some part missing.
A screw, widget, what have you.

492
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,484
Hmm.

493
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:13,427
Well, according to Daniel's instructions,
it all seems to be here.

494
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,726
Ah, well, I never follow instructions.

495
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,529
You think that could be
part of the problem?

496
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,355
- We clear?
- For the moment.

497
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,184
Okay, I've locked out the rings
and secured this level.

498
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,191
We shouldn't have any more company.

499
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:46,286
Hang on, guys. If this works,
we're about to jump into hyperspace.

500
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:03,105
Yep. Just like old times.

501
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:11,548
Except I'm here against my will,
and you look like Marcel Marceau.

502
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,216
Yeah, you know, some things change,
but others stay the same.

503
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,622
Very good.

504
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,693
Why'd you bother giving me the intel
if you were going to bust out anyway?

505
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,500
Well, obviously,
I'm improvising at this point.

506
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,333
I had no idea when, or even if,

507
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,340
I was going to be able to overcome
the effects of the anti-Prior device.

508
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,670
Time was running out.

509
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,745
Adria is going to notice my absence
and become suspicious

510
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:40,045
so sending the rest of SG-1 to get
the device was my only choice at the time.

511
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,312
Then why do this now?

512
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,511
Because I'm afraid the rest of the team

513
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,749
won't be able to complete
the mission without me.

514
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,084
Oh, aren't we full of ourselves?

515
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,060
That, and I wasn't about
to let Woolsey freeze me.

516
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,097
- That I understand.
- Yeah.

517
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:05,633
Okay, I think that's about it.

518
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,312
Hang on. What's this?

519
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,074
Oh, I'm not sure about that one.

520
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,515
See, there is always a widget left over.

521
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,917
I thought you were always one short.

522
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,216
Well, you'd think both
was impossible, but it's not.

523
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,484
Right.

524
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,390
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that's the timing crystal that sets

525
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:27,987
the detonation of the weapon
five minutes after it's inserted.

526
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,091
Right. Hold on that. Carter, status?

527
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,031
<i>CARTER: Vala, Cam, we're moments</i>
<i>from exiting hyperspace.</i>

528
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,368
Roger that. We're almost done here.

529
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,943
Check that. Vala's almost done.
I still have my doubts.

530
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,721
And that means?

531
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,792
That means the weapon
is ready to be activated.

532
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,120
What?

533
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,697
Oh, I was just wondering
if an Ascended being

534
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,468
was going to swoop down
and take it away.

535
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,895
I guess they don't mind us
doing their dirty work for them.

536
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:07,971
Or...

537
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,166
Or what?

538
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,569
Or there's no point
because I've assembled it wrongly

539
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,736
and it's not going to work.

540
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,614
- Colonel Carter.
- Yeah, I see it.

541
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,989
Just came up on the ship's sensors.

542
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,261
Cam, Vala.

543
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,194
We have a problem.

544
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,805
What's it doing?

545
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,803
It seems to be just sitting there
blocking our way.

546
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,002
I'm trying to raise shields.

547
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,678
Hi there.

548
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:58,683
Carter, I thought you sealed off this level
and locked out the rings.

549
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,454
Me, too.

550
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,902
I was afraid of that.
Adria must've anticipated my plan.

551
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,513
- They're going to detect us.
- We're cloaked.

552
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,983
- This ship doesn't have that.
- It does now.

553
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,780
Having a ZPM helps.

554
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,382
When the time comes,
give the order to <i>Daedalus.</i>

555
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,194
We'll see.

556
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,263
I should never have trusted you.

557
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,101
They're about to shut down the supergate
and allow our ships through.

558
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,608
They've assembled the weapon,
and the Ancients didn't interfere.

559
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,803
Right?

560
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,608
You did exactly as I said, right?

561
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,375
Daniel, what are you doing?

562
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,681
We can destroy the Ancients right now,
and the Ori won't even have to fight.

563
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,688
I've done all of this for you.

564
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,095
- Your mind is closed to me.
- Yeah.

565
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,568
- What the hell is going on?
- Sorry about that.

566
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,472
I had to be sure
this was working on her first.

567
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,404
You got past her personal shield.

568
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,942
Yeah, that took a lot.

569
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,309
- Are you all right, Daniel Jackson?
- Yeah, a little dizzy.

570
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,552
Look, I don't have much time left.
Go arm the device.

571
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:40,980
Jack's onboard <i>Odyssey.</i>

572
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,560
He's going to shut down the gate.
Now, go!

573
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,566
Jack, give the command.

574
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,382
<i>Please.</i>
<i>I'm running out of strength to do this.</i>

575
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,620
<i>Daedalus,</i>

576
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,852
this is General Jack O'Neill.

577
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,859
What's going on?

578
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,764
- Daniel's flying the ship.
- Daniel?

579
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,530
He wishes us to arm the weapon.

580
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,104
General O'Neill's onboard the <i>Odyssey.</i>

581
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,638
- And?
- Do it.

582
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,600
We got to go.

583
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,769
Sir, if you can hear me,
we need to beam out now.

584
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,073
What about Adria?

585
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,390
(MONITORS BEEPING)

586
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,861
Hey, sleepyhead.

587
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,471
What took you so long?

588
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:14,636
- What happened?
- Nothing. Why?

589
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,939
We armed the weapon, you dialed
the gate and sent the Ori ship through.

590
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,845
Assuming it is you.

591
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,750
No, it's me.

592
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:28,489
Merlin's gone.
He sacrificed himself for this to work.

593
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,989
Yeah? Prove it.

594
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,996
- What the hell was that?
- Lf I was Merlin, you would know.

595
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,599
- What about Adria?
- Still on the ship.

596
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,609
All right, here's a question.

597
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,504
How do we know it worked?

598
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,242
We don't. Not yet.

599
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,916
I think if it did work,
the Ancients would feel obligated

600
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,821
to give us a fruit basket
or, like, a gift certificate,

601
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:05,988
or something like that.

602
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:09,224
Maybe the reason why they let us do it
is because they knew it wouldn't work.

603
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,268
Or maybe because they knew
it would and wanted it to.

604
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,937
There's no point in guessing.

605
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,269
Even if it is successful,
there are still many Priors

606
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:21,936
with great power and vast armies
of warriors bent on converting this galaxy.

607
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:25,573
It will be very difficult
to convince them their gods are dead.

608
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,116
If they're dead.

609
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,857
Carter, Sunshine is awake.

610
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,627
- That's good. Is he okay?
<i>- Well, he's grumpy.</i>

611
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,828
Can you ask him
how he managed to cloak the ship?

612
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,671
He said magicians
don't reveal their secrets.

613
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,173
<i>Hey, is that Ori ship</i>
<i>still hanging around out there?</i>

614
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,743
Yeah, it's still out there.

615
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:57,177
I sent a message to Earth,
telling them that we were going...

616
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,309
Guys, you better get up here.

617
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,951
Incoming wormhole.

618
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,899
Yeah, I think that went well.

619
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:30,307
We knew eliminating the Ori
might not stop their followers.

620
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,213
I still think it was the right thing to do.

621
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,013
We may have made
things worse right now.

622
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:40,453
But in the long run,
it could be our only chance to win the war.
