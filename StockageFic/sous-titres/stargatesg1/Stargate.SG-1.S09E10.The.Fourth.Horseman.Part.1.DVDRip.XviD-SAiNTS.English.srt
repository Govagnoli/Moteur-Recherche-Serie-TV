1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,162
<i>Previously, on Stargate SG-1</i>

2
00:00:03,187 --> 00:00:05,506
What say you to the promise of the Ori?

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,758
We will hear no more of false Gods.

4
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,819
<i>First we had to make a choice.</i>

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:11,954
<i>Follow the Ori or be destroyed.</i>

6
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:14,482
<i>In moments, our city was leveled.</i>

7
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:17,151
<i>If a Prior visits your world,</i>

8
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:19,020
leave.

9
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:23,024
Is great knowledge, power, understanding,

10
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:26,010
not enough for you to revere the Ori?

11
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:28,296
It doesn't mean I would murder
innocent people in their name.

12
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:32,592
If we don't continue to work together,
the victory that we worked so long and hard for,

13
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:34,386
could result in chaos.

14
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:35,796
My name is Orlin.

15
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:37,565
<i>I'm from the planet you just visited.</i>

16
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:41,033
<i>Actually the truth is, I...</i>

17
00:00:41,043 --> 00:00:42,002
<i>love you.</i>

18
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:43,446
Oh my God.

19
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:48,951
<i>I'm just saying it's pure ego.</i>

20
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,112
Pure ego? I don't know.
At that level of enlightenment?

21
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:54,974
I mean, arrogance is about pleasure, right?
Wallowing in the pride of one's achievement.

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,378
Well, you don't think that getting a whole galaxy

23
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:00,446
to bow down to worship you,
is something to write home about?

24
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:03,583
No, I'm just saying the ascended beings that I've met
have pretty much all the satisfaction anyone can need.

25
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,835
They don't need to lord it over us.

26
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:07,671
They kind of look at us the way we look at bugs.

27
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:08,964
Insignificant. Amusing.

28
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:12,075
Yeah. No, look, I get what you're saying, but...

29
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:14,119
Damn!

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,505
- That smell, is that you?
- No.

31
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,190
Don't think so.

32
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:21,250
Oh, Barnes! Right, of course.
I should have known that stench was you.

33
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,428
Very funny, Mitchell.

34
00:01:22,603 --> 00:01:24,522
Been under cover on P2X-885.

35
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:28,182
10,000 poverty stricken peasants.
Only one fresh water well.

36
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:30,787
Not to mention 130 degrees... in the shade.

37
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,997
Well you might want to think about taking a shower,
before you debrief Landry.

38
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:34,399
Right after Lam clears us.

39
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:35,383
<i>Hell. Lucky her!</i>

40
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:37,844
Maybe if we're lucky she'll give us all a sponge bath.

41
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:40,997
I wouldn't repeat that around the General, Lieutenant.

42
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:42,649
I wouldn't repeat that around me.

43
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,609
Sorry Sir.

44
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:49,664
Let's go.

45
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:54,706
OK seriously. What's his problem?

46
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,606
Aside from the fact that's a
completely inappropriate comment?

47
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:59,174
Lam is Landry's daughter.

48
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:01,852
- Sir, I'm sorry.
- Know when to shut up, Lieutenant.

49
00:02:01,894 --> 00:02:03,354
Hey, Colonel!

50
00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:04,730
How'd it go, by the way?

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,357
Not good.

52
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:07,983
885's gone Ori.

53
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:12,905
Third planet this month.

54
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:24,409
I asked not to be disturbed.

55
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:26,828
Forgive me, but he is here.

56
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:36,405
Greetings.

57
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:42,486
Have you contemplated your destiny?

58
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:46,824
I have read from the book
and I find it to be most illuminating.

59
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,435
Antares and the river.

60
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,364
How the people of the low valley
were freed from the yoke

61
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,701
of an iron serpent who ruled over them without mercy.

62
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,672
Do you see this as more than mere coincidence?

63
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,224
You suggested this prophecy.

64
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:08,387
Such is the wisdom granted by true enlightenment
and the road we all must take.

65
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:12,693
Many Jaffa are without faith and direction.

66
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,847
Hurt by the lies and betrayal
of those who have enslaved us.

67
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,741
<i>You've been burned by evil.</i>

68
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:23,329
But do not let that keep you from
the warmth and light of the eternal flame.

69
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,915
Let Origin show you the way.

70
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:27,550
I'm merely saying that

71
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:31,496
it may still take some time...

72
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:35,500
for other Jaffa to see Origin as I have come to see it.

73
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:39,412
But,

74
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:43,425
I vow to spread the word
of the Ori to all Jaffa.

75
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:47,671
Hallowed are the Ori.

76
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:50,048
Hallowed are the Ori.

77
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:57,152
Season 9 - Episode 10
The Fourth Horseman (Part 1)

78
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:01,220
Colonel Carter!
I've read your proposal.

79
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:02,419
And?

80
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:07,338
And, I'm not exactly sure what an aneurism feels like,
but I suspect I'm pretty close.

81
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:09,378
Boy, I'm glad I'm not the only one.

82
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:10,978
Can you put this in layman's terms?

83
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:12,497
Well, simply speaking, Sir,

84
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:15,858
based on the research that was done
on Anubis' genetic experiment, Khalek,

85
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:20,137
we believe we may be close to developing a technology
that could inhibit a Priors special abilities.

86
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:22,680
Are we talking about a anti-Prior gun here?

87
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:25,656
Because I don't remember seeing
the word gun anywhere in here.

88
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:29,416
Well it wouldn't be a gun exactly, but that is kind
of what made us think it was possible.

89
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:32,976
Because I was able to shoot Khalek while
he was focused on defending himself from you.

90
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:34,816
<i>Which meant he wasn't omnipotent.</i>

91
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:36,615
You think the Priors are the same.

92
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:41,215
We've identified specific portions of the brain that
were active when Khalek was using his unique abilities.

93
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,694
Now he had those abilities because he was at
a much more evolved state very close to ascension.

94
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:47,614
Now, we're hoping the Ori are affecting
the Priors in much the same way.

95
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:51,293
Dr Lee and I are working on a way of targeting
and neutralizing those higher brain functions,

96
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:54,533
using a field generator emitting
fluctuating ultrasonic frequencies.

97
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,052
And my headache was just going away.

98
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,573
I don't wanna sound overly optimistic Sir,

99
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,292
but I think we may be close to
testing within a couple of days.

100
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:06,532
I would like to report that something positive
came out of that whole Khalek situation.

101
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,451
- Yes Sir.
- Keep me posted.

102
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:14,211
He didn't look too impressed.

103
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:15,491
<i>Oh, trust me.</i>

104
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:18,291
Anti-Prior gun would have gone down better.

105
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:29,090
If the Jaffa at Kallana had heeded the wisdom
of the Priors, then they'd still be alive today.

106
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,489
The Jaffa at Kallana were defending
themselves against a military incursion.

107
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:39,608
The Ori were attempting to construct a means
by which to invade our galaxy and attack us.

108
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:44,048
They offer us the wisdom of the ages
and everlasting life and we met that with force!

109
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:46,407
<i>Were their actions not justified?</i>

110
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:50,248
Thousands of lives were lost.

111
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,567
All the more reason why
we should respect their power.

112
00:06:52,606 --> 00:06:56,846
If you are suggesting we have no other choice
but to acquiesce, that would be cowardice.

113
00:06:57,846 --> 00:06:58,887
Gerak!

114
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:08,005
I believe their intentions are pure.

115
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:12,405
They offer us enlightenment, knowledge, salvation.

116
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:16,604
All of these things can be ours, if...

117
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:21,243
we have the courage to embrace our destiny.

118
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:25,683
I believe a recess is in order.

119
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:29,043
The council will deliberate on Gerak's proposal.

120
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:48,680
I came as soon as I heard.

121
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,160
Gerak has proposed that the religion
of the Ori should be adopted by all Jaffa.

122
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,920
As law?

123
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,319
To be taught to our children.

124
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,439
It's benedictions and traditions
followed to the letter.

125
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:10,918
Should it be ratified by the council, all Jaffa
would have no choice but to accept the Ori as Gods.

126
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:13,078
True belief cannot be legislated.

127
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:15,598
Surely the council must know
this is beyond their purview.

128
00:08:15,717 --> 00:08:17,558
But Gerak seems to have swayed many.

129
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:22,557
He is convinced that the Ori represent
the true Gods we have all sought for generations

130
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:27,516
and that only by worshipping them
can we finally find peace and enlightenment.

131
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:30,436
Then he is a fool and must be revealed as such.

132
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,316
Gerak is many things,

133
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:34,396
but he's no fool, Teal'c.

134
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:39,795
Because of us, too many Jaffa now know
that the Ancients of this galaxy

135
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:42,595
will never offer us a quick path to ascension.

136
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:46,474
Still, the Ori are not the answer.

137
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,355
No.

138
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,594
But Gerak is old, as are many of the Council.

139
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:55,874
For them, the Ori represent hope
for life beyond that which we now know.

140
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:59,433
For that reason alone, this proposal will carry weight.

141
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:09,272
A couple of days?

142
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:13,112
Well, we'll just have to roll up our sleeves
and burn some midnight oil if we have to.

143
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:14,512
Midnight oil...

144
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:18,431
Why didn't you just tell them we'd come up with a viable
means of creating cold fusion while you were at it?

145
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,471
Sure, if you've got something!

146
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,790
No, look, I mean, all we have is a bunch
of uncorrelated data and a theory.

147
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,549
I mean, I admit it's a pretty sound theory,
if you pardon the pun.

148
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:36,709
Ultrasonic waves!

149
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:38,519
That's good.

150
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:41,049
Anyway, I mean, it's gonna be
a matter of months before we get it...

151
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:45,888
Oh! I see. I understand.

152
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:48,728
This is your first project,
back from Area 51 and you just...

153
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:51,167
you just wanna impress everybody, ri..

154
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,366
Can you hear me?

155
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:58,686
What?

156
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:01,927
Ah, no, I... Right.

157
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,006
Sleeves up...

158
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:07,006
and working!

159
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:16,605
It's Colonel Barnes.

160
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:19,244
About three hours ago
he came in complaining of fatigue.

161
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:22,084
About an hour after that, he could barely stand.

162
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:26,044
High fever, chest pain, respiratory distress.
Sound familiar?

163
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:27,643
You're certain it's the same?

164
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:31,603
He's displaying identical symptoms
as the people who were infected on 412.

165
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:33,483
It's a Prior plague.

166
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,202
We have to find Lieutenant Fisher, and fast.

167
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:45,321
In my many years of service, I have met with our men
and women in uniform around the world.

168
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,881
Active, guard and reserve
along the front lines and those here at home.

169
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:54,520
And then as now, I am continually amazed

170
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:58,480
by your courage, dedication and patriotism.

171
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,080
Our airmen, soldiers, sailors and marines,

172
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,519
are symbols of the pride and strength of this nation.

173
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,159
Be proud of what you do.

174
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:15,638
You make our nation stronger and our world safer.

175
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:17,358
Thank you.

176
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:54,994
<i>What's going on?</i>

177
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:00,793
<i>This way Sir.</i>

178
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:03,053
Back off. Back off.

179
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,033
Lieutenant Fisher?

180
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,013
Yes Sir?

181
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:06,693
You're gonna have to come with me immediately.

182
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:10,192
Come on, that way. In here please.

183
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:19,752
You cleared SG-6 when they returned from 885.

184
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,231
I approved their clearance, yes.

185
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:23,951
We've been taking extra precautions
since the outbreak on 412,

186
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,471
but you can't test for a virus
that you don't know exists.

187
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,910
This strain has a completely different
genetic make-up and what's worse,

188
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,989
it seems to be mutating right before our eyes.

189
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,749
Sir! They've found Fisher. They're bringing him in.

190
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,829
And everyone at the speech has been quarantined.

191
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,709
Barnes says he thinks Fisher was the one
who made direct contact with the Prior.

192
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:44,949
Airman Ryan is showing early symptoms.
Lieutenant Brooks has been quarantined as well. Sir,

193
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,898
we have no way of knowing who Fisher may have
come into contact with prior to leaving this base.

194
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:50,708
Or how far this thing has spread.

195
00:12:56,787 --> 00:12:59,227
<i>It was a couple of days before we left the planet.</i>

196
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:01,867
Airman Ryan and I went to morning prostration.

197
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:03,547
The Prior was there preaching.

198
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,666
You had no idea your cover had been blown?

199
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,746
No Sir.

200
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:10,985
There is no way anybody from that planet
could have known we were from Earth.

201
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:15,396
The Prior walked among us, touching people on the head.
Some sort of benediction.

202
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:16,965
Wait, wait, wait he touched...

203
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:19,065
Sorry, he touched you on your head?

204
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:21,864
I'm sorry Sir.

205
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:24,704
If I had realised it was so important,
I would have put it in my report.

206
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:26,824
That's alright Lt. Thank you.

207
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,864
So how come he isn't sick?

208
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:32,504
I'm guessing it's because he's just a carrier.

209
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:35,623
If he got sick and died from the virus,
it wouldn't spread very far would it?

210
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:39,483
Colonel? Dr Lam? A word.

211
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:43,962
What have we got?

212
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:45,482
He's definitely patient zero.

213
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:52,041
The team on site at Peterson just reported that two of
the people in the crowd at General Hammond's speech

214
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:56,201
are displaying symptoms and have tested positive.
The General himself is fine.

215
00:13:56,241 --> 00:14:00,600
That's good Sir. What about the restaurant and
the gas station Fisher stopped at on his way into town?

216
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:07,839
The CDC has mobilised units to try and
contain the situation. They've sent out bulletins
to every hospital and medical facility in the state.

217
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,759
Anyone showing plague
symptoms will be referred to us.

218
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,269
Do we have a cover story?

219
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:16,479
A new influenza that first appeared at
St Francis Medical Center, two day's ago.

220
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:19,038
We're issuing a press release in an hour.

221
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:20,718
Colonel, I'd like you in the field,

222
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:24,538
following up on Lieutenant Fisher's activities,
just to be sure.

223
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:25,467
Yes Sir.

224
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:28,397
You'll have to get
scrubbed and stay in hazmat on the outside.

225
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:29,327
Yes ma'am!

226
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:31,697
Twelve infected base personnel
have been quarantined too.

227
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:37,277
Four of them are showing early symptoms.
Now half of those people came in direct
physical contact with SG-6 after they came back.

228
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:38,676
However, the rest of them didn't.

229
00:14:38,716 --> 00:14:41,116
Which means we should assume
the worst case scenario.

230
00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:42,196
Which is?

231
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:44,715
The virus may be airborne and persistant.

232
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:48,035
So we have no idea how many people
this will ultimately affect.

233
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:48,875
No.

234
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:51,534
<i>Unauthorised offworld activation.</i>

235
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:53,155
What now?

236
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,194
You wanted to be a General.

237
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:57,634
<i>General Landry to the control room.</i>

238
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:01,634
Chief?

239
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:02,874
It's Teal'c Sir.

240
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:05,713
I've established a videolink
with him on Dakara.

241
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:07,073
General Landry.

242
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:11,472
Chief Harriman has informed me of the situation.
May I be of any assistance?

243
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:16,112
Not at the moment. We've restricted
gate travel in and out of the base for the time being.

244
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:17,032
Understood.

245
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:19,551
How'd it go with the council?
Have they made a decision?

246
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:20,872
<i>They have not.</i>

247
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:25,231
But I have been told that they are leaning towards
accepting Gerak's proposal, despite our warnings.

248
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:26,661
Doesn't sound good.

249
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:30,591
Bra'tac and I no longer believe this battle
can be won through diplomacy alone.

250
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:33,030
The Council must know of our resolve by other means.

251
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,270
Such as?

252
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:38,670
<i>We will travel to Chulak to meet
with other Jaffa leaders who feel as we do.</i>

253
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,069
No matter what the council decides,
we will resist any alliance with the Ori.

254
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:45,989
So your fight for freedom may end up
in an all out civil war.

255
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,068
Indeed.

256
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:50,509
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

257
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:03,147
<i>It's a self service station, Sir.</i>

258
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:07,866
According to receipts,
22 people have used the pump that Fisher used.

259
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:11,626
<i>We're tracking down the folks that used credit cards.
Six used cash.</i>

260
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:18,105
We've called in the National Guard.
I'm staying in touch with the Governor, but it
looks like we may need to close down the state Colonel.

261
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,665
<i>Yes Sir, it's pretty bad.</i>

262
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:22,265
The attendant's been put into quarantine

263
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:24,465
and it looks like he's got it.

264
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:26,944
<i>That's not the news I wanted to hear.</i>

265
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:50,502
What are you doing?

266
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:53,092
- What are you doing?
- I'm testing frequencies.

267
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:56,711
- With Dark Pariah?
- I can't hear a thing.

268
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:59,601
Noise cancelling technology.

269
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:03,440
- How's it coming?
- Not well.

270
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:07,540
I mean, we all know our auditory
senses are a direct line to certain brain functions

271
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,780
and we know that they respond differently
to different sonic frequencies, but...

272
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,579
you know, trying to achieve something as specific
as isolating one small part of the brain that's like...

273
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:19,859
I mean it's like...

274
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:22,379
<i>it's like trying to do</i>

275
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:24,778
something that's...

276
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:26,698
impossible.

277
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:33,257
- Good analogy.
- Oh come on, I haven't slept!

278
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:37,297
<i>What?</i>

279
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,377
What?

280
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:41,256
<i>No, I said it first.
What are, what are you looking at?</i>

281
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:42,476
Nothing.

282
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,676
I think I'm just tired too.

283
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:53,235
The waitress who served him, the cook,
the manager, they're all testing positive.

284
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:56,075
We have fourteen customers unaccounted for.

285
00:17:56,315 --> 00:18:00,234
Bulletins are being issued
on local and national radio and television.

286
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:02,154
<i>The media's having a field day.</i>

287
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:03,954
<i>Have you closed the state border, Sir?</i>

288
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:09,018
Too late for that Colonel. We already have
reported cases in Utah, Kansas and New Mexico.

289
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:11,713
<i>- Damn, that was fast.
- Faster than we can move.</i>

290
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:16,083
Airports, bus stations, train stations.
They're all secure at this point but...

291
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,732
more than one person seems to have gotten out.

292
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:21,772
<i>- Track 'em down Colonel.
- Will do, Sir.</i>

293
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:28,092
Panicked citizens are demanding
answers from authorities who have been clearly
overwhelmed by the speed and scope of the virus.

294
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:32,451
Despite their best efforts,
the contagion continues to spread at an alarming rate.

295
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:36,810
Of course, keep it right here. We'll have
the latest in breaking news on the hour, every hour.

296
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:38,251
We'll see you then.

297
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,170
This is going nowhere and
my sleeves are up as high as they can go.

298
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:49,368
Perhaps if we tried a different kind of spread spectrum.
A combination of waves.

299
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:51,568
Yeah but, look I,...

300
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:59,488
I'm sorry. The only thing I can confirm with any kind
of certainty, is that sleep deprivation definitely
has an adverse affect on all brain function.

301
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:02,608
I'm gonna go get some coffee.
Do you want anything?

302
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:03,888
No, I'm good.

303
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:11,206
<i>You're so close.</i>

304
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:12,247
I know.

305
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:17,886
Hello Sam.

306
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:19,646
It's good to see you again.

307
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:21,525
I've missed you.

308
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:23,086
Who are you?

309
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:26,325
I had no choice but to take this form.

310
00:19:27,045 --> 00:19:29,044
It's me, Orlin.

311
00:19:44,903 --> 00:19:47,592
As far as I can tell,
he's a normal Human adolescent.

312
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:51,442
Who claims he's an Ancient
who has descended and taken Human form.

313
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:55,072
There really is no other explanation Sir,
for how he could have gotten into the base.

314
00:19:55,122 --> 00:19:56,321
Orlin know the things he knows.

315
00:19:56,562 --> 00:20:01,371
<i>I'm pretty sure he's given us the key to
finishing the anti Prior technology that
Dr Lee and I were working on.</i>

316
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:04,821
According to the mission report
on your first encounter with Orlin,

317
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:09,541
you two had an intimate relationship?

318
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,450
Well, we did.
But, he didn't look like that.

319
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,859
- He was...
- Taller?

320
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,239
He was a grown man.

321
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,309
Well. So why come back as a boy this time?

322
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,798
<i>He said he had no choice, Sir.</i>

323
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:29,798
He had to take a younger form in order to preserv
as many of the Ancient memories as possible.

324
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:33,108
The knowledge he possesses as an ascended being
was too massive for a normal Human brain to handle.

325
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:37,397
We're guessing that having a younger brain
gave him a slightly better chance of
retaining the knowledge a little longer.

326
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,037
That makes sense, actually.

327
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:43,277
The known make-up of a still developing mind has a
potential for better memory retention than that of an adult.

328
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:46,836
Ultimately Sir, he says he will
lose most of the knowledge.

329
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:50,276
Sir, I think he's taking a huge risk just to be here.

330
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,755
We should at least hear him out.

331
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:59,755
I'm sorry. Aren't you breaking some
major cosmic rules here? I mean,

332
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:02,835
why did the others let you go
without wiping your memory clean?

333
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,514
Honestly, I don't really know.

334
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:11,513
I guess enough of them felt it was necessary
for someone to step out of line and warn you.

335
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:13,674
I'm assuming you're talking about the Ori.

336
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:16,723
We're already aware of the threat they pose.

337
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:19,373
Believe me. You don't know everything.

338
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:24,332
<i>A long time ago, the Ori and
the Alterans were one society. Human,</i>

339
00:21:24,372 --> 00:21:26,732
on an evolutionary path to ascension.

340
00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:29,362
But a philosophical division grew.

341
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:32,972
The Ori grew more and more
fervent in their religious belief.

342
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:37,530
The Alterans, for a lack of a better way
of putting it, believed in science.

343
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,330
The Ori tried to wipe them out.

344
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:44,020
<i>So instead of going to war, the Alterans
built a ship, left the galaxy and came here.</i>

345
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,519
We know that both the Alterans and the Ori eventually
ascended and that the Ori passed on their religion

346
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:49,730
called Origin to the next
evolution of Humans they created.

347
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:53,459
Yes, but the central promise of the religion,

348
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:57,229
everything the Origin's followers
devote themselves to, is a lie.

349
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:03,827
Are you saying that the Ori don't
offer their followers, ascension?

350
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:06,947
No, most certainly not. Then they'd have to share.

351
00:22:07,188 --> 00:22:08,308
Share what?

352
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:11,027
The power they sought from those who worship them.

353
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:12,827
Well, how is that possible?

354
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:19,026
I mean, are you saying that there is a real physical
transfer of energy to the Ori that occurs simply
through a Human being's belief in them?

355
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:23,315
Simply is not how I would put it.
It's quite complicated, but possible.

356
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:28,525
And if they're to have a measurable effect it requires
massive numbers of Humans really pushing their will.

357
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:36,444
Nevertheless it is one of the main reasons
the Ancients have so strongly believed
in strict non interference in the lower planes.

358
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:42,324
Because the temptation to manipulate and malign lower
life forms into some order for your own purposes can
result in exactly this type of abuse and corruption.

359
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:47,863
The Ori empower themselves by sapping the life force
of those willing to surrender themselves to them.

360
00:22:47,903 --> 00:22:49,233
<i>Unknowingly.</i>

361
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:51,613
And this promise of salvation in return...

362
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:54,182
Leads to nothing but death of the most meaningless kind.

363
00:22:54,622 --> 00:22:59,272
Because there's no conscious effort to achieve
enlightenment without being spoon fed by the Ori.

364
00:22:59,322 --> 00:23:02,361
Do the Priors know this?
I mean, are they complicit?

365
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:04,641
No. They are merely pawns.

366
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:06,961
<i>The more worlds the Priors convert,</i>

367
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:09,581
the more powerful the Ori become.

368
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,420
They must be stopped.

369
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:16,380
Why don't the Ancients, Alterans,
whatever you call yourselves now,

370
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,699
why don't you stop them?

371
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,459
I'm one of them no longer.

372
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:25,099
And even if I was, it is unclear
whether such action would result in victory.

373
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:30,498
Nor is such an endeavour at that level necessarily
the next best step to further enlightenment.

374
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:34,988
All I can say for sure is that if this galaxy
were to succumb and bow to the Ori,

375
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,118
it would be very bad for everyone.

376
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:50,916
You have spread the word of the Ori well, Gerak.

377
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:55,076
I believe that their wisdom was worthy of my efforts.

378
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:59,455
And yet, such wisdom still falls upon deaf ears.

379
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:03,135
A group of unbelievers,

380
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,015
Jaffa,

381
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:10,434
would stand against your leadership
and the Ori, are meeting, as we speak, on Chulak.

382
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,014
<i>But your belief cannot be forced upon others.</i>

383
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:17,713
The offering of Origin, speaks for itself.

384
00:24:19,913 --> 00:24:21,553
I believe that in time,

385
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:24,792
they will come to believe that this is true.

386
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,273
<i>As you have said.</i>

387
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:29,112
The Jaffa are strong willed.

388
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:34,791
You are a people that understands
the nobility of bloodshed.

389
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:37,511
The neccessity of sacrifice.

390
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,111
What would you have me do?

391
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:41,951
Go to Chulak.

392
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,900
Mark it as the last place a Jaffa
will ever defy the power of the Ori

393
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,709
<i>and destroy all those who will
not walk the path to enlightenment.</i>

394
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:58,309
We're hoping that as long as you're here,
you may be able to help us.

395
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:04,628
I no longer possess the power to simply cure
this plague as I could have as an ascended being.

396
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,788
However, with the knowledge I still retain,

397
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:10,787
I believe I can synthesise a cure easily,
using your medical technology.

398
00:25:11,328 --> 00:25:15,607
You built a stargate in my basement
with spare parts from a toaster.

399
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,447
Actually, this will be a little harder than that.

400
00:25:33,005 --> 00:25:34,005
Gerak.

401
00:25:35,005 --> 00:25:38,004
The battle at Kallana.
I lost a cousin there.

402
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,705
And it does still haunt me today.

403
00:25:43,204 --> 00:25:45,403
But it does not cause me to doubt my decision.

404
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,163
I have read from the book of Origin.

405
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:53,413
<i>Searched for the wisdom you speak so highly of.</i>

406
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:57,983
And I do see fables, meant to fill us
all a raft of hope with purpose.

407
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,993
Stories of morality and righteousness.

408
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:01,352
And this is not worthy of your respect?

409
00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:03,402
So are the traditions of the Jaffa.

410
00:26:04,002 --> 00:26:06,241
Are we just supposed to abandon all that we are?

411
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:07,002
No!

412
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:15,904
But if you want to look really carefully
you will find everything that we want

413
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,400
is in here. Everything that
we ever desired is in here.

414
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,037
How's it going?

415
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:42,558
Basically, I know what I need to make.

416
00:26:42,597 --> 00:26:45,397
I just don't have any of the right materials or tools.

417
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:47,717
This is the best we have.

418
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:50,776
I can get you a toaster if you need it.

419
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,777
Not unless you're hungry for toast.

420
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:55,096
Waffle iron?

421
00:26:56,596 --> 00:26:59,445
Look, I hate to be pushy, but do you have
any kind of timeframe on this?

422
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:03,655
Honestly? Time from your perspective is not
something I'm all that used to dealing with.

423
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:05,795
So is there anything I can do?

424
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:07,195
You can keep me company.

425
00:27:08,155 --> 00:27:09,194
Right.

426
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:12,895
<i>Hospitals are struggling to
cope with an influx of people.</i>

427
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:15,774
<i>- I have Colonel Mitchell on the line for you.
- who suspect they may have contracted the virus.</i>

428
00:27:15,814 --> 00:27:21,293
As a result, crowded waiting rooms are now
serving only to exacerbate an already difficult...

429
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:24,093
Put him on speaker.
What have you got, Colonel?

430
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:27,653
Sir, we have a problem.

431
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:33,632
Looks like one of the people that used
the gas pump Fisher touched got onto a plane
before the quarantine went into effect.

432
00:27:33,672 --> 00:27:35,072
<i>To where?</i>

433
00:27:36,192 --> 00:27:37,271
It's bad.

434
00:27:37,312 --> 00:27:39,581
He caught a flight to Denver.

435
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:42,031
With connections to Chicago and New York.

436
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:44,990
<i>Sir, I'm afraid we've lost control of the situation.</i>

437
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,229
I have to admit, it's nice being out
of that uncomfortable suit for a while.

438
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:58,079
I know I'm vulnerable now as a Human,

439
00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:01,609
yet I still can't quite get
my head around my own frailty.

440
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:04,728
What? You've been at it nearly nine hours, straight.

441
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:06,408
You need something to eat.

442
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:07,768
I am hungry.

443
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,018
Maybe it's just me.

444
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:13,147
It has been a while since I experienced Human senses,

445
00:28:13,188 --> 00:28:15,947
but this food doesn't smell very good.

446
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,667
That's because it's not very good.

447
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:24,487
I remember eating pretty well
the last time I did this.

448
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:28,686
This is a one way trip for
you this time, isn't it?

449
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:31,645
The others. They're not gonna
help you ascend again, are they?

450
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:33,485
I don't think so.

451
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:39,385
I know it must be kind of weird,
my appearing this young.

452
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,384
A little.
But I understand.

453
00:28:43,684 --> 00:28:49,883
My only regret in all this is that Human
social conventions preclude us from
showing affection the way I wish I could.

454
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:53,283
Excuse me?

455
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:57,507
My feelings haven't changed for you,
since we last saw each other, Sam.

456
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:58,883
Maybe in a few years.

457
00:28:59,682 --> 00:29:02,242
It's OK. We don't need to talk
about it any further.

458
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:06,241
I just wanted you to know
that taking Human form at this age,

459
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:07,642
well necessary,

460
00:29:07,782 --> 00:29:12,261
didn't come easy, because of how I knew
I would feel being here with you again.

461
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,780
Is it me, or is this food not very good?

462
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,664
Are you making a joke?

463
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,879
No. It has been a while since
I tasted food, but this seems terrible.

464
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:30,559
We just talked about that.

465
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:32,219
Oh right. I'm sorry.

466
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:34,738
I'm used to hearing my own thoughts in my mind

467
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:38,778
and sometimes it's hard to distinguish
which ones I say out loud.

468
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:42,668
Did I tell you I still have feelings for you?

469
00:29:42,718 --> 00:29:46,277
Yes, thank you. Yeah.
We don't need to go into that again.

470
00:29:55,257 --> 00:29:57,306
Five thousand confirmed cases of infection.

471
00:29:57,356 --> 00:29:59,266
Now, the bulk of those are from
the Colorado Springs and Denver areas.

472
00:29:59,316 --> 00:30:01,059
What about New York and Chicago?

473
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:05,955
45 new cases have been reported in Utah.
36 in New York, 20 in Chicago and now 20 in San Diego.

474
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:07,195
The country's in a panic.

475
00:30:07,335 --> 00:30:08,975
The President's preparing an address.

476
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,175
What the hell happened to JFK and Salt Lake?

477
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:14,824
The CDC had the manifest
and the names of the flight crew.

478
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:16,514
And because we moved fast,
most of the passengers were quarantined,

479
00:30:16,854 --> 00:30:20,373
but a few still remain unaccounted for.
They're doing the best they can to track them down now.

480
00:30:20,774 --> 00:30:23,373
We're now hearing about cases in new locations.

481
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:26,573
Every hour now as opposed to three or four a day.

482
00:30:26,612 --> 00:30:27,677
What about casualties?

483
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:29,862
There are only eight people dead so far.

484
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,232
Five of them are SGC personnel.

485
00:30:31,272 --> 00:30:32,033
So far?

486
00:30:32,072 --> 00:30:34,742
I say so far, because of the reasonably
long incubation period.

487
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:38,912
Again, this virus was designed to avoid detection
and for maximum spreading capability.

488
00:30:38,952 --> 00:30:40,312
And we know it's deadly.

489
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:44,851
So with over 5,000 people infected
and no effective treatment as of yet,

490
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:48,671
that number of casualties
will climb very quickly, very soon.

491
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:55,370
Colonels! Please tell me something good
is happening somewhere.

492
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:58,369
Dr Lee has finished the anti Prior prototype.

493
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,869
Of course, without a Prior on hand.

494
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:03,998
It does need to be field tested,
but we think we have a good reason to try it.

495
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:04,553
How's that?

496
00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:07,528
Orlin seems to have hit a dead end
with his work on a cure.

497
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,768
He says there's a vital component missing.

498
00:31:09,808 --> 00:31:11,578
I told you. Anything he needs.

499
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:15,468
What he needs is a blood sample from
the Prior who infected Lieutenant Fisher.

500
00:31:16,068 --> 00:31:20,787
Orlin thinks the Prior essentially manipulated
his own DNA to create the virus.

501
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:26,076
It has mutated several times since then,
but he still thinks having the root DNA
that it was based on, may help.

502
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:29,926
You're talking about using an untested
technology to try and capture a Prior.

503
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:34,265
No, not just any Prior.
The Prior who infected Fisher.

504
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:38,965
Using our intel from our friends on the Sodan planet,
who led us to 885 in the first place,

505
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:41,924
apparently they're expecting
the same Prior back there tomorrow.

506
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:43,684
And you're sure they can be trusted?

507
00:31:43,924 --> 00:31:47,764
As far as we know, the Sodan are
the ones who blew SG-6's cover.

508
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,588
I don't believe that, Sir.

509
00:31:49,984 --> 00:31:51,554
Seems awful risky.

510
00:31:51,604 --> 00:31:54,734
Given that Orlin doesn't even sound
positive this will help him.

511
00:31:54,784 --> 00:31:57,527
Orlin's attempt to find a cure might
not be the only reason to do this.

512
00:31:57,623 --> 00:32:00,447
He thinks the Priors don't know
the truth about the Ori.

513
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,662
Maybe if we enlighten them for a change.

514
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:06,252
You want to try and turn this Prior.

515
00:32:06,302 --> 00:32:07,822
Well maybe not a complete 180, but

516
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:11,761
he might give us something, especially once
he finds out his Gods aren't going to ascend him.

517
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:13,091
If he believes you.

518
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,472
<i>Won't know until we try, Sir.</i>

519
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:16,761
In the meantime, we can at least get a blood sample.

520
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:23,520
So how does it work?
Assuming it actually does work..

521
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,640
You know, I keep telling myself
that one of these days

522
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,160
I'm gonna do something that actually
gets me a little respect around here.

523
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,639
We're all waiting for that day, Bill.

524
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:35,199
Theoretically, once activated, the device
will emit an omnidirectional ultrasonic field.

525
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:38,878
And that will prevent a Prior from
accessing a highly evolved area

526
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,238
of his brain that gives him
a super Human ability.

527
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,638
Of course, we're presuming that
the staff weapons the Priors carry,

528
00:32:44,678 --> 00:32:47,917
are also mentally activated
and will also be neutralised.

529
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:50,797
While we're at it, why don't we
just assume that I can fly!

530
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:52,877
Oh actually, I've been working on a theory where...

531
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,637
You said yourself it would be risky.

532
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:59,797
Yeah, I know, I know I said that, but the more I'm
hearing, the more it's crossing over into crazy.

533
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:02,676
Don't get me wrong, I like crazy,
that's why I asked for this job.

534
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:07,126
One more thing. There's a range of
frequencies programmed into the emitter.

535
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:10,335
If one doesn't work at first?
Try the others.

536
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:25,253
Even if the Kal'chak region commits to our cause,
we will still be outnumbered in ships and armies.

537
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:27,883
Nearly six to one.

538
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:30,133
Hopefully, no shots will ever be fired.

539
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:34,013
You believe our mere willingness to battle our brothers,
will force the council to hear us?

540
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:35,972
<i>The council is lost.</i>

541
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,062
It is the hearts and minds of our brothers
and sisters, that will take notice.

542
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:42,471
They must be made aware of the threat the Ori pose.

543
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,431
If he is unarmed,
let him enter.

544
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,270
You are not welcome here!

545
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,949
The powers of the Ori, cannot be denied.

546
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:07,699
I have come to beg you to cease
this madness or be destroyed.

547
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:08,959
By whose hand?

548
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:11,208
My Ha'tak is in orbit above this planet.

549
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,529
You would murder your brothers and sisters.

550
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:16,968
Innocent children, for choosing
the life of a free Jaffa?

551
00:34:17,008 --> 00:34:18,608
You leave me no alternative.

552
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:24,047
You have been warned.

553
00:34:38,926 --> 00:34:41,126
What are you doing?
I thought you were going to get some rest?

554
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:44,675
As soon as I finish the DNA
sequencing program.

555
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:48,775
That way, when we get the sample from the Prior,
we can plug in the decoded strand

556
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:51,104
and we'll know if it's going to help.

557
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,584
Orlin, you've already done it.

558
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:55,873
What?

559
00:34:55,923 --> 00:34:59,204
The sequencing program. You finished it a couple
of hours ago. You were gonna get some rest.

560
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:06,762
I was on my way and I felt
like I had forgotten something.

561
00:35:06,803 --> 00:35:08,043
Orlin?

562
00:35:09,283 --> 00:35:11,592
It's OK.
I'm just tired.

563
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:12,992
No, you're not.

564
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:14,842
I want you to go see Dr Lam.

565
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:18,251
I think she has enough to deal with right now.

566
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:21,181
Orlin, you're our best hope for finding a cure.

567
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:24,180
<i>We need you to be OK.</i>

568
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,239
I have them targeted.
Shall I open fire?

569
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:48,418
The only true darkness, lives in the hearts
of those who will not follow the path.

570
00:35:48,658 --> 00:35:51,847
Otherwise, there's always
some measure of light.

571
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:57,017
And where there is light,
the Ori see all.

572
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:01,947
I spared their lives because
I believe they will soon see.

573
00:36:01,997 --> 00:36:07,556
You defied me!
We do not serve the Ori at our whim!

574
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:12,915
You cannot win the hearts of the Jaffa,
by needlessly spilling the blood of the innocent.

575
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:15,245
We are mere mortals.

576
00:36:15,295 --> 00:36:20,814
We cannot begin to question those with the knowledge
and understanding of the infinite universe.

577
00:36:20,855 --> 00:36:25,854
If a few Jaffa must give their lives, so that
all Jaffa from now until the end of time,

578
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:30,573
can find true enlightenment,
then who are YOU to stand in the way!

579
00:36:33,453 --> 00:36:35,053
Would you forgive me?

580
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:39,852
Ask me not for forgiveness.

581
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,352
I sense your doubt, Gerak.

582
00:36:44,812 --> 00:36:51,091
But fear not.
The Ori do not require blind obedience.

583
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:54,211
They will show you their power.

584
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,170
Where are we?

585
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,219
Your physical form remains on Dakara.

586
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:11,669
The power of the Ori has brought your mind here,
to Celestus, City of the Gods.

587
00:37:15,009 --> 00:37:16,488
Come.

588
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:48,525
Hallowed are the Ori.

589
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:57,844
Relax Jackson.

590
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:59,914
I spent two weeks with these guys.

591
00:37:59,964 --> 00:38:01,244
We've got nothing to worry about.

592
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:03,483
Well, considering what happened
the last time we were here, you'll

593
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:05,203
forgive me if I'm a little cautious.

594
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:06,883
We'll be fine.

595
00:38:20,322 --> 00:38:21,241
Are we still fine?

596
00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:22,841
Yeah, we're fine.

597
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:24,841
<i>Good, just checkin'</i>

598
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:30,020
It's the most active scan
we've seen since Khalek.

599
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,940
That device you brought back from Anubis' genetic lab,
shows us his actual synaptic interaction.

600
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,700
And...

601
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,670
Looks like pockets of cells are just shutting down.

602
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,119
I can't say for certain, but I can hazard a guess
they're wearing out from extremely unnatural overuse.

603
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:44,199
Well he said he would lose the memories, eventually.

604
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,599
Human brain isn't meant to hold that much information.

605
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:47,958
This looks worse than that.

606
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:53,648
It's like the cells are literally dying, because
they can't handle all the synaptic activity.

607
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,288
What?

608
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:57,457
Hey! This is way beyond my experience.
Still.

609
00:38:58,198 --> 00:39:02,637
As you said, the Human brain
wasn't supposed to be used this way.

610
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:06,007
I don't know if it's conscious or not,

611
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:08,497
but it's possible he's trying
to hold onto the knowledge.

612
00:39:09,136 --> 00:39:12,136
And holding onto that much
knowledge is causing brain damage.

613
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:25,825
That's right.
Have him contact me as soon as he lands.

614
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,794
We're tracking a new outbreak in Florida.

615
00:39:31,274 --> 00:39:31,903
Walter.

616
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,354
Sir. Just received a communique
from the Whitehouse.

617
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:39,153
Can I have your attention please?

618
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:45,722
At last count, we have reports of over
8,000 people infected in 13 states.

619
00:39:45,772 --> 00:39:49,412
As a result of these numbers,
as of 0800 this morning,

620
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:54,711
the President has ordered that all borders
in the United States be closed until further notice.

621
00:39:54,752 --> 00:39:58,721
All inbound planes and ships and other traffic,

622
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,891
will be ordered to divert to alternate destinations.

623
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:08,290
Our country is now entirely under quarantine.

624
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:15,140
You cannot ratify this proposal until all
members of this council have been heard from!

625
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,079
- So far six regional members...
- You merely seek to delay the inevitable.

626
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:21,248
If and when all Jaffa wish to embrace the Ori,

627
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,578
then we shall act accordingly.

628
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:27,747
If our brothers refuse to accept Origin into
their hearts, then they seal their own fate.

629
00:40:28,388 --> 00:40:32,347
We cannot turn our backs on our own
salvation because of indecisiveness.

630
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:36,986
And they will see their way to the path.

631
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:50,505
It is the destiny of all Jaffa

632
00:40:50,545 --> 00:40:51,745
to follow

633
00:40:52,405 --> 00:40:53,765
Origin.
