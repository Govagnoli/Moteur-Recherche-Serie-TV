1
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:07,595
Previously on "Stargate SG-1".:

2
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:10,245
We have a time machine.
We can go back and get the ZPM.

3
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:13,362
We don't know where it is now,
but we do know where it was.

4
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:15,640
Gîza, 3,000 BC.

5
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:18,000
That's Katep and his brother Salatis.

6
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:20,834
Nice.

7
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:23,202
We got a little problem here.

8
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:26,197
We alter this time line
and the future is already different.

9
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:31,279
We brought you here because of what had
been recorded on the tape in that camera.

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,323
I'm part ofa team called SG-1.

11
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:37,158
And we havejust travelled
back in time 5,000 years.

12
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,236
Look at this
as a way to change everything.

13
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:42,761
We're supposed to be a team.
We save the world.

14
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:46,758
- It was exactly where you said.
- If anybody should go, it's us.

15
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:50,238
You only have
this Stargate cos ofus.

16
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:54,034
- I'm aware of that.
- I'm a linguist. Your team may need one.

17
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,355
What if something
goes wrong with the gate?

18
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:59,482
Neither of you have had
any military training whatsoever.

19
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:02,875
Have either one of you
ever even fired a weapon of any kind?

20
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:05,638
Unless you count launching a rocket.

21
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:08,436
Look, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:12,721
Your expertise may be needed
sometime in the future, but for now...

23
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:15,399
Can I ask who is going?

24
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:27,679
I don't understand.
What made you change your mind?

25
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:32,120
Hi, Jack.

26
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:36,874
- That's Colonel, Major.
- You're retired.

27
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:41,197
- I was.
- I take it you two know each other.

28
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:45,164
- We served together a long time ago.
- It wasn't that long ago.

29
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:49,318
Major Kawalski was assigned to assemble
the team to go through the Stargate.

30
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:51,760
You knew I couldn't say no
if he was involved.

31
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,040
You don't owe me anything.

32
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,514
Admit it, you gotta be curious.

33
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:59,756
Travelling to a different planet,
through a wormhole?

34
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:04,441
- I know I am.
- Sir, what are they still doing here?

35
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,323
I'm not sure.
Airmen, please escort...

36
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:10,795
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We were all on that tape.

37
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:15,754
That tape had nothing to do with it. Jack
O'Neill's one of the best I've served with.

38
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:19,804
You may not care that this time line
is a result of tampering with the past,

39
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:24,401
but you have to acknowledge that the tape
said the planet is enemy territory.

40
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:27,955
An enemy that is way more advanced
than us, technologically.

41
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:32,402
- What's your point?
- You're walking into an alien situation,

42
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,841
outmanned and outgunned.

43
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:38,917
Do we have a choice?

44
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:57,521
We could only activate the lights
and the dialling computer,

45
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:02,201
but, according to the tape, you have
the gene that can make this ship fly.

46
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:05,518
And travel through time.

47
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:09,678
Presumably, you don't have to do that
if you don't want to.

48
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:12,203
Hm.

49
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:38,043
- What do I do?
- Sit down.

50
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:52,716
- Now what?
- You're supposed to be able to fly this.

51
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:55,000
With your mind.

52
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:04,794
- Try not to think about the past.
- Or the future.

53
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:20,400
- You so have to let us go with you.
- Please.

54
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:32,520
Put those on.

55
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:42,518
How come we have to wear these
and you don't?

56
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:45,836
OK, people.
Let me remind you.

57
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:49,518
This mission's recon only.
Do not engage the enemy.

58
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:54,281
I'm allowing the use of this ship because
of the tactical advantage it provides you.

59
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:59,155
Under no circumstances
is it to be used to travel through time.

60
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:01,634
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

61
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:07,441
Never in my life
would I have imagined giving that order.

62
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:13,558
Are you absolutely certain
about them, Colonel?

63
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,356
No, sir.

64
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:20,679
Good luck, and Godspeed.

65
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:25,280
All aboard.

66
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:38,314
Hey, watch this.

67
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:48,755
Oh, by the way, you do have the address
to get us back home, correct?

68
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:51,120
- Yeah.
- Good.

69
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,196
Dial it up.

70
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:13,754
I give this no more
than a fifty-fifty chance of working.

71
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:17,042
According to the tape,
it worked for eight years.

72
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:28,640
Wow.

73
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:34,316
I'm certainly glad it's not me
going through that... thing.

74
00:07:37,365 --> 00:07:39,515
Any idea what to expect?

75
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:43,598
Not really. According to the tape,
we're going to be demolecularised,

76
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:46,324
transmitted 2,000 light years
through subspace,

77
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:49,954
and then rematerialised on the other side.

78
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:52,400
I did not need to know that.

79
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:53,998
OK.

80
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:59,156
Gateship one. You're go for launch.

81
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:03,079
- Gateship?
- It's a ship that goes through the gate...

82
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,835
All right.

83
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:12,157
What? It's a ship that goes
through the gate, a gateship.

84
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:14,955
I thought it was clever.

85
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:42,920
- Well, that was cool.
- I didn't feel anything.

86
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:47,715
- Doesn't feel like we're pulling any Gs.
- This thing must have inertial dampeners.

87
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:50,239
- Any enemy troops on the way through?
- No.

88
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:53,044
But that doesn't mean
we weren't detected.

89
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,639
Is that a city?

90
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:01,717
I'm gonna set her down in those trees.

91
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:12,194
I thought the reason we brought this ship
was so we didn't have to walk.

92
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:17,040
You can't just fly into an alien city.
This is stealth recon, meaning undetected.

93
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,923
- Meaning shut up!
- Sorry.

94
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:27,722
Donner, Mansfield, guard the ship.
Bosworth, you're with us. Move out.

95
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:30,603
Why did we have to park so far away?

96
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:39,443
Seriously, why did we bring them?

97
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't know. I guess I had a gut feeling.

98
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,519
Like Peru?

99
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:49,165
All right, that didn't work out so well.

100
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:52,282
- Sierra Leone? Uganda?
- All right, look.

101
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:56,677
Maybe the better question here is why
did you invite me on this dog and pony?

102
00:09:56,765 --> 00:10:00,314
Let's just say
I prefer my gut instinct over yours.

103
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:10,880
What's with the...?

104
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:21,317
Aw, sh...

105
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,678
Hello? Anybody there?

106
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:50,154
We're all here.

107
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:56,004
- Where are we?
- It looks like a prison cell.

108
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:01,643
- Anyone seen my glasses?
- I think they must have taken them.

109
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:04,683
Why would they do that?

110
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:25,274
- Teal'c.
- From the tape?

111
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:29,563
If you know my name,
then you know enough to fear me.

112
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:34,362
- I know this might sound a little crazy...
- Who are you?

113
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,436
Hi. Uh...

114
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,844
We're... we're from the Tauri.

115
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:44,155
We call it Earth.

116
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:48,793
You see, we found this tape from the past.

117
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:53,596
Apparently, we're part of a team.

118
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:57,079
The four of us, not the two of them.

119
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:59,156
We're called SG-1.

120
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:02,999
We used a time device to go to the past.
We screwed up and changed the future.

121
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,838
You're not supposed to be
still Apophis' First Prime.

122
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,644
The Jaffa are supposed to be free.

123
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:13,196
We know that you think
that the Goa'uld are false gods.

124
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,436
That wasn't necessary.

125
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:18,834
Speak such blasphemy again,
I will kill you.

126
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:20,881
Look...

127
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,433
I know this is a lot
to throw at you all at one time,

128
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,756
and you gotta put up a little show
for the boys here,

129
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:29,040
but the fact is...

130
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:33,235
- we know the truth.
- See, it's all on the tape.

131
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:36,681
You have to see it. It's... It's in the...

132
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:40,599
It's in the camera that you took
from the bag that you took from me.

133
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:45,805
If you bring it to me, I can show you
how it works and we can... we could go...

134
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:48,399
and see it over at...

135
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:50,874
wherever you wanna go.

136
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:09,359
Kneel before your god.

137
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,156
Kneeling.

138
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:22,436
- Who are you?
- Name's Daniel Jackson.

139
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,800
If you give me my eyeglasses,
I could see...

140
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:29,401
- He claims he's of the Tauri.
- You weren't supposed to tell him that.

141
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:32,238
The Tauri have no Chaapa-ai.

142
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:34,316
Oh, sorry, I guess I was wrong.

143
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:37,761
I'm sure your information is correct.
I'm usually quite wrong.

144
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:41,997
Quite unreliable, actually.
To be honest with you, I'm insane.

145
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:44,280
Speak.

146
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:50,120
Bring him.

147
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,797
I think there is much you can tell me.

148
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:10,958
If you wanna know about the early
settlers of Mesopotamia, I am an expert.

149
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:13,036
Agh!

150
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,434
It's been over an hour.

151
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,596
Maybe you shouldn't
have said anything.

152
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:35,635
All I said was,
"This is gonna sound a little crazy".

153
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:39,559
While there are obvious similarities,
our time line is different

154
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:44,594
from the one in which Teal'c came to
believe that the Goa'uld were false gods.

155
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:48,473
Are you saying this guy might not turn?

156
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:52,399
- It's possible.
- And you're telling me this now?

157
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,759
This one is strong.

158
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:13,040
Leave us.

159
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:22,643
You will tell me all that you know.

160
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:53,519
What's goin' on?

161
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:56,555
Show me.

162
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:07,797
Uh...

163
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,445
Teal'c, you should say something.

164
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:17,153
The Jaffa are free.

165
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:21,120
False god that he is,
Apophis is long dead.

166
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:26,563
A new medicine, tretonin, has liberated
us from our dependence upon symbiotes.

167
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:30,354
The Jaffa have risen up as brothers
and sisters and defeated the Goa'uld.

168
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:33,676
- What trickery is this?
- It's not a trick.

169
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:36,916
You have a son, Rya'c,

170
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:42,238
who is now married, and a strong leader
among the newly formed Jaffa nation.

171
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:47,763
Ifthese things have not come to pass, you
must believe the present you now live in

172
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,679
exists only because the past
has been mistakenly altered.

173
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,835
It must be restored.

174
00:16:55,605 --> 00:16:57,402
Please.

175
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:01,641
You have to help us.
The reason we came here was to get you,

176
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:04,842
so we could go back in time
and fix things.

177
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,075
That's not true.

178
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:10,594
We just wanna get out of here.

179
00:17:10,685 --> 00:17:14,473
If you can help us,
we'll do our best to help you.

180
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:17,318
I cannot free you.

181
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,953
What about our weapons, our vests?
Can you get us those?

182
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,755
Easy, easy!

183
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,234
Get outta here.

184
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:42,916
Pissants!

185
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,643
- I didn't tell them anything.
- Good. How are you feeling?

186
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:52,195
- Not so good, really.
- Sorry.

187
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:56,560
- Maybe this will make you feel better.
- Agh!

188
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:02,640
How did you...?

189
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:05,876
Teal'c. He brought us the camera.
I showed him the tape.

190
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:10,038
- I don't think he can be trusted.
- He gave us our weapons. It's a start.

191
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,242
He's gonna meet us
on the way back to the ship.

192
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,362
Safety off, point and shoot. Not at me.

193
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:20,960
- I don't really like guns.
- Neither do I.

194
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:23,605
- What about explosives?
- Those I like better.

195
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,074
- Cover.
- Let's go.

196
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:38,481
- Airman, this is O'Neill.
- We were starting to worry.

197
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:42,001
We're on our way. ETA, ten minutes.

198
00:18:45,445 --> 00:18:50,644
- We gotta get goin' here.
- We got a battalion on our ass.

199
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,439
What the hell was that?

200
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:04,634
Shoot him, Jack. Let's shoot him
and get the hell outta here.

201
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:07,523
- Why did you do that?
- He was a Goa'uld.

202
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:12,076
Apophis implanted him with a symbiote to
gain access to the knowledge in his mind.

203
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:14,554
- How do you know?
- I could sense it.

204
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:17,239
Your friend did not give in to torture.

205
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:20,522
- He's lying.
- Why would he lie, Kawalski?

206
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:23,756
If he wanted us dead,
why aren't we surrounded by Jaffa now?

207
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:28,316
We will be if we don't get the hell out of
here now, and I'm not taking him with us.

208
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:32,000
Apophis has ordered a fleet
of Ha'tak vessels to the Tauri.

209
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:35,634
- He's sending ships to Earth?
- The symbiote planted in Daniel Jackson

210
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:38,159
was a spy intended to accompany you.

211
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:41,362
Apophis now knows
what Daniel Jackson knew.

212
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:45,836
He knows that you came in a ship.
He knows that the Tauri is a threat.

213
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:48,519
How the hell do we know
you're not a spy?

214
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:03,914
His eyes glowed.

215
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:16,202
He's dead.

216
00:20:18,445 --> 00:20:20,436
Go, go!

217
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,759
- Kawalski!
- Go! Start it up!

218
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,122
- Kawalski's been hit!
- Go.

219
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:29,839
Are you injured?

220
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:31,404
No.

221
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:34,079
I've just never seen anyone killed before.

222
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:36,554
Daniel and Kawalski.

223
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:40,564
Oh, my God. You've been shot.

224
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:46,321
- It will heal.
- All right. We've got some problems here.

225
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:01,875
- Gliders.
- I can't shake 'em either.

226
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:05,797
The gate will be well guarded.

227
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:11,596
You know something? I don't think
we're gonna make it to the gate.

228
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:16,554
There is a way out. Was there a Stargate
on this planet 5,000 years ago?

229
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:18,920
I believe so.

230
00:22:40,405 --> 00:22:42,760
I think you did it.

231
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:46,758
- What has he done?
- I think we just travelled back in time.

232
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:49,075
Check it out. Dial Earth.

233
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:14,204
- This is definitely Ancient Egypt.
- The Ha'tak vessels bore the mark of Ra.

234
00:23:14,285 --> 00:23:16,515
He ruled on Earth during this period.

235
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,358
It is likely we were detected
exiting the Chaapa-ai.

236
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:22,357
Well... there's no ships on our tail.

237
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:26,442
But I think we'll skedaddle anyway.

238
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:29,323
You saying you're on board
with trying to fix the past?

239
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:32,761
Well, we did kind of screw up
our time line, didn't we?

240
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:36,804
The only way to stop the invasion on
Earth is to make sure it never happens.

241
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:39,843
Yeah, remind me how we do that again.

242
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,844
All right. Here's the plan.

243
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:58,758
We make contact with the locals.

244
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:04,600
- And then?
- That's all I got so far.

245
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:09,920
- Any idea what time it is exactly?
- Three o'clock.

246
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:12,599
Sorry, I meant what year?

247
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,758
You and Daniel said there was
some kind of a failed rebellion.

248
00:24:17,845 --> 00:24:20,040
In 2995 BC.

249
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:21,964
BC?

250
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:25,799
- Colonel.
- Kidding. And call me Jack, will you?

251
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:40,635
Hey! It's all right, folks.
We come in peace, nothing to be afraid of.

252
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:44,324
I doubt they speak English.

253
00:24:44,405 --> 00:24:46,999
- Hello.
- He does.

254
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:50,394
- Yes, I am Katep.
- I am Jack.

255
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:54,876
O'Neill. Colonel Carter and Teal'c.

256
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:59,002
- How do you know...?
- Come with me. Ra's patrols come often.

257
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:02,316
They must not see you, especially you.

258
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:04,396
Please, come.

259
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:11,356
Please.

260
00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:23,475
- How do you know who we are?
- This is not the first time we have met.

261
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:27,877
- You knew the other SG-1 team.
- Five years ago you came.

262
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:31,355
You were witness to the death
of my brother at the hands of Ra.

263
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:35,757
After you were trapped here,
we planned an uprising together.

264
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:40,839
- So much for causality.
- Ra is still here. We have seen his ship.

265
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:44,634
Our first attempt at gathering forces
for the rebellion did not go well.

266
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:48,843
We had to expose ourselves
to those who proved still loyal to Ra.

267
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:53,123
You were captured and executed
long before the plan could be finished.

268
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:55,400
Really?

269
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:58,799
- All of us?
- All but one.

270
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,080
This can't be a good sign.

271
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:17,725
- Why's that?
- Where am I?

272
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:23,198
- Ancient Egypt.
- No, I mean the me from your time line.

273
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:25,719
I killed you.

274
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:28,273
- Why?
- You were a Goa'uld spy.

275
00:26:29,685 --> 00:26:31,835
- A good reason.
- It was horrible.

276
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:36,794
- I'm sure. Why are you here?
- Yes, excellent question.

277
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:41,120
- You don't know?
- I thought I did there, for a while.

278
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:44,322
And then I realised I didn't.

279
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,001
- I know why I'm here.
- Good. Let's start there.

280
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:54,034
- We came back in time to get a ZPM.
- Right. It was buried with the tape.

281
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:56,116
Why is it so important?

282
00:26:56,205 --> 00:27:01,074
I think you were about to explain it,
but the batteries on the camera ran out.

283
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:04,714
Long story. Why don't you take a seat?

284
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:14,444
Basically, we got trapped here because
you didn't want to affect the time line.

285
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:17,437
But, ultimately,
you and you couldn't stand the idea

286
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:20,801
of living out your lives under Ra's rule
without doing anything.

287
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:24,798
We remembered there was a rebellion
here. That's how the gate got buried,

288
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:28,639
so we figured what difference does
it make if we're involved or not.

289
00:27:28,725 --> 00:27:31,239
Unfortunately, we never
got to execute the plan.

290
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:33,839
- We heard.
- Yes, we tried to do too much too fast.

291
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:37,474
Since then, Katep and I have been
building up an underground movement.

292
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:42,559
I assume things don't go well cos if
you're here, the future still needs fixing.

293
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:45,842
- Something like that.
- We didn't just see the tape.

294
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,519
We saw the tablet.

295
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:51,165
What tablet?

296
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:56,399
The one you haven't written yet, and put
where the Stargate was supposed to be.

297
00:27:56,485 --> 00:28:01,195
- Supposed to be?
- In our time line, the rebellion works.

298
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:03,719
Ra ends up leaving and Earth is freed,

299
00:28:03,805 --> 00:28:07,002
but Ra takes the Stargate with him.

300
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:10,923
- OK, that's a problem.
- Yes.

301
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:15,601
The gate is never found at Gîza, and none
of us join the Stargate programme.

302
00:28:15,685 --> 00:28:20,156
But you left a tablet
in an obscure Egyptian dialect,

303
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:25,273
telling us the rebellion date and where
to find the second Stargate in Antarctica.

304
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:30,200
Good for me. So you're here to make sure
Ra doesn't take this Stargate.

305
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:33,914
- It's a plan.
- They're near! They're near!

306
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,565
- Jaffa.
- We must hide.

307
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:38,442
Where?

308
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:41,516
In here.

309
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:32,478
Sweet.

310
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,514
Kree, lok nel.

311
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:54,037
We've got secret stores of weapons in
several positions throughout the region.

312
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:58,960
- How many troops?
- Couple of thousand. That's not the issue.

313
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:01,684
According to you,
my account of history says we win.

314
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:04,916
We need to make sure
that the gate stays here and gets buried.

315
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:08,998
- We'll have to steal it and hide it from Ra.
- It's in the open, close to his ship.

316
00:30:09,085 --> 00:30:12,998
Holding such a position against
a Ha'tak would be virtually impossible,

317
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:16,441
- even for a short period of time.
- Also, the gate is heavy.

318
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,993
And we also have a ship.

319
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:22,521
Yes, but, you see, the ship fits in the gate,

320
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:25,483
not the other way around.

321
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:30,995
There has to be a way that we can
cable the gate to the ship, fly it out.

322
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:34,282
But we still gotta get close to it
without being detected.

323
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:38,040
That's easy.
The ship has a cloaking device.

324
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:41,234
It makes it invisible.

325
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:46,763
- You're telling me this now?
- I was sure I mentioned it on the tape.

326
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:52,124
If we time our approach to coordinate with
the uprising, we may yet have a chance.

327
00:30:52,205 --> 00:30:55,800
We need to test the cloak. We took
a lot of damage coming out of Chulak.

328
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:59,321
- Because we didn't know about the cloak.
- I was sure I mentioned it.

329
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:10,115
They are gone.

330
00:31:12,045 --> 00:31:16,402
You ever wonder what your life
is gonna be like in the future?

331
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:18,680
It won't really be my life, will it?

332
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:22,201
No, but still. I've led such
a small and unimportant existence,

333
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:26,642
I can't ever imagine being
a hero who saves the planet.

334
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:30,684
Well, we do have a time machine.
We could go check it out.

335
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:33,074
No way.
We have already screwed up enough.

336
00:31:33,165 --> 00:31:36,601
Once we're done with the gate,
we need to destroy the ship.

337
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:38,676
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

338
00:31:41,405 --> 00:31:44,477
You mean we have to stay here?

339
00:31:44,565 --> 00:31:48,240
I wonder if the future me has a boyfriend?

340
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:06,243
- So what do I do?
- Um...

341
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,839
Try thinking invisible.

342
00:32:12,925 --> 00:32:14,278
OK.

343
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:22,399
How do we know if it's working?

344
00:32:28,565 --> 00:32:29,600
Nope.

345
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:38,159
Your strategy is good.

346
00:32:38,965 --> 00:32:43,516
But it does not work well as a distraction
in our plan to steal the Chaapa-ai.

347
00:32:43,605 --> 00:32:46,881
- We know this plan works. If we alter it...
- We may fail.

348
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,763
With this plan,
the uprising succeeds and Ra leaves.

349
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:52,075
And Ra takes the Chaapa-ai.

350
00:32:52,165 --> 00:32:55,521
If we are to be successful
in keeping Ra from taking the Chaapa-ai,

351
00:32:55,605 --> 00:33:01,396
we must focus the efforts of the rebellion
on distracting him from it.

352
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:06,953
Trust me.

353
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:20,201
- How's it going?
- I've never seen this kind of technology.

354
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:23,755
You're supposed to be a genius.
That's why I brought you along.

355
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:27,838
I'm working on it.
I think the power relay was overloaded.

356
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:32,953
I may be able to reroute the circuit
to the control interface.

357
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:35,396
What?

358
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:39,922
It's just a little weird, hearing that
kind of stuff come out of someone so...

359
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:42,360
- So what?
- Hot.

360
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:46,799
- Really?
- Yeah.

361
00:33:48,645 --> 00:33:50,442
Wow.

362
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,317
It's just...

363
00:33:53,405 --> 00:33:57,603
You're not the kind of guy
that I usually attract.

364
00:33:57,685 --> 00:33:59,676
- No?
- No.

365
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:03,194
God. Wow.

366
00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:06,960
- This is kind of awkward.
- Yeah, it's gettin' there.

367
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,605
I'm kind of attracted to Daniel.

368
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:15,675
What?

369
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,517
Really?

370
00:34:22,605 --> 00:34:24,357
Sorry.

371
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:28,597
No, that's OK. No problem there.
It's just, you know...

372
00:34:28,685 --> 00:34:32,075
First impressions,
I kind of thought he was...

373
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:38,434
Never mind.

374
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:58,959
Carter, how's it going in there?

375
00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:02,879
- I think I'm almost there.
- That's good.

376
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:05,763
We're about to have some company.

377
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:17,843
They have a patrol on its way here.

378
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:23,156
Try it.

379
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:32,714
Nothing's happening.

380
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:39,439
Hey, guys.
We got a little problem here.

381
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:43,120
Carter, forget it. I'm just gonna take off.

382
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:52,794
God.

383
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:55,763
- Now that's not working.
- Oh, boy.

384
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:02,079
Try the cloak now.

385
00:36:07,045 --> 00:36:09,240
Did it work?

386
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:23,553
Apparently.

387
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:40,402
Shek nok, cree!

388
00:36:40,485 --> 00:36:42,476
What?

389
00:36:44,165 --> 00:36:46,440
Go, go, go, go.

390
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:50,993
Get down. Whoa.

391
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:53,883
- This could be a problem.
- You think?

392
00:36:53,965 --> 00:36:57,594
If they penetrate the hull and hit
the engines, the blast could feed...

393
00:36:57,685 --> 00:37:00,074
- Carter!
- We could explode!

394
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:06,839
- Daniel, Teal'c.
- We're almost there.

395
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:11,516
Oh, boy.

396
00:37:16,925 --> 00:37:20,042
- This doesn't look good.
- Indeed.

397
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:25,995
It is ironic. It started cos Sam didn't want
to take the jumper from the Jaffa patrol.

398
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:30,115
- God!
- Look, if we don't make it...

399
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,037
Wait a minute! You said you liked Daniel.

400
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,878
I lied. I just wanted
to get to know you better.

401
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:44,642
See, usually I'm a very cautious person
and I tend to think things...

402
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,116
Jaffa!

403
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:52,436
Hear me.

404
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:58,154
Ra is not a god. You can live free.

405
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:02,923
- Ka kek, shol'va!
- I don't think he bought it.

406
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:09,398
Relinquish your weapons and surrender.

407
00:38:09,485 --> 00:38:12,238
Kal tek trey lo tonak.

408
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:14,555
Yeah, I thought you'd say that.

409
00:38:14,645 --> 00:38:16,636
Shal tek!

410
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:49,001
Sam and Jack, it's all clear.
You can come out now.

411
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:51,474
In a minute.

412
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:08,198
I can fix that.

413
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:13,040
Jack, you should say something.

414
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:16,800
College football is played on Saturdays,
pro on Sundays.

415
00:39:16,885 --> 00:39:19,479
And there are no fish in my pond...

416
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,520
at all, where I fish.

417
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:28,043
I think that covers it for me.

418
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:31,160
Is that correct?

419
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:35,875
- If it is, we don't do anything?
- Nothing we did affected the time line.

420
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:39,435
- But we didn't do anything.
- Not yet.

421
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:45,475
Apparently we were going to, two weeks
from now, but now we don't have to.

422
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:49,001
Excellent. That's it. I like it.

423
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:51,883
- I'm gonna get this to the lab for analysis.
- No.

424
00:39:51,965 --> 00:39:55,480
I'll take it. There's a whole room
full of geeks up there

425
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:58,921
just dying to get their hands on this.

426
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:01,599
You've got packing to do.

427
00:40:11,605 --> 00:40:15,439
- This is great.
- I told you.

428
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:18,119
I can't believe
we didn't do it years ago.

429
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:20,196
Yes, well...

430
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:22,674
Let's not dwell.

431
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:37,283
Didn't that tape say
there were no fish in your pond?

432
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:41,000
Close enough.

433
