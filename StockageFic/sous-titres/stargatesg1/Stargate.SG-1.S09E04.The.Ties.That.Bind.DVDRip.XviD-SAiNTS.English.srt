1
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,936
Came to see me off. That's sweet.

2
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,771
Well we've been through a lot together
and I just wanted to

3
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:16,049
come here myself and make sure you were…

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,759
thoroughly searched.

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,995
This is a little keepsake.
Something to remember you by.

6
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:38,881
This is a priceless artifact.

7
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:41,300
As priceless as the memories we share.

8
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:44,687
Well.

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,268
Thank you.

10
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,688
- I hate long goodbyes.
- OK, Goodbye.

11
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,698
Don't I even get a hug?

12
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:19,198
Daniel!

13
00:01:19,723 --> 00:01:22,434
Don't make this harder than it already is.

14
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:28,624
Can't blame a girl for trying.

15
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:29,984
No, I can.

16
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:01,867
Jackson, hey! Where's your girlfriend?

17
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,211
She left about an hour ago.

18
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:05,046
Men, I missed the going away party?

19
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:06,364
Hope you saved me a piece of cake.

20
00:02:06,406 --> 00:02:08,366
Now that she's gone, I can finally get
some work done around here.

21
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:10,618
Yeah about that. The whole SG-1 thing?

22
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,080
You never gave me a firm answer.
What do you say we make it official?

23
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:15,548
Jackson?

24
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:16,741
Jackson?

25
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,493
Jackson!

26
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:21,396
I need a med team on level 25!

27
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:29,171
Good morning sunshine.

28
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:31,715
<i>How you feeling?</i>

29
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,202
Better.

30
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:37,046
What happened?

31
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:39,173
We're not exactly sure.

32
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,019
But Dr Lam here thinks it may have
something to do with those alien cuffs.

33
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:49,976
Why does one assume that?

34
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:52,804
Well, you were completely unresponsive
when we brought you in,

35
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:56,432
but your condition suddenly improved
when she came back.

36
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,152
Miss me?

37
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:07,192
Season 9 - Episode 4
The Ties That Bind

38
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,311
Walter.

39
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,631
- Just the man I was looking for.
- Sir, we have to talk about your schedule

40
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,831
and according to this
you're going to be in meetings all day.

41
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,552
- Hell I am!
- Sir?

42
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:17,072
After two months on this base, I've come to realise

43
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:20,733
that an alarming portion of these meetings
are a complete waste of my time.

44
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:22,392
This is all housekeeping.

45
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:23,433
You can handle it.

46
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:25,433
- Me? No, I don't think so Sir. I'm not--
- Walter!

47
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,554
- Don't make me promote you.
- No Sir.

48
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:29,754
Yes Sir. I mean, what?
- Just..

49
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:33,595
Just write up the highlights
and leave them on my desk.

50
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:38,515
- General?
- Dr. Lam.

51
00:04:39,315 --> 00:04:40,396
What's...

52
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:42,636
what's the latest on Dr Jackson?

53
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:46,077
Well, as evidenced by Vala's
departure and immediate return,

54
00:04:46,117 --> 00:04:50,037
they can't be separated for much more than an hour
before they begin to feel the effects.

55
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:52,518
If she hadn't come back when she did,
I suspect they'd both be dead.

56
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:55,238
I thought it was supposed to stop
when they took the wristbands off.

57
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:56,078
It was.

58
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,399
Dr. Lee is theorizing that it
might have something to do

59
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,679
with the Ancient communication device they found.

60
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,799
It's possible that the two
technologies brought together

61
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,440
somehow combined to create a more permanent bond.

62
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
I see.

63
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,881
Colonel.

64
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:18,282
This is a waste of time.

65
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:21,402
- Do me a favour. Shut up.
- It's not like I wanted this to happen anyway.

66
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:23,643
I'm being realistic. He has no idea what he's doing.

67
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:24,683
I'm standing right here.

68
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:27,103
He can do all the tests he wants,
it's not going to get us anywhere.

69
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:29,263
Look, I know we're scraping the bottom of the barrel
here, but it's not like we have a lot of choice,

70
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:32,605
unless you happen to know someone else
who understands this technology!

71
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:36,245
You know someone?

72
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:37,685
Someone who can help us?

73
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:39,326
No.

74
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:41,565
And yes.

75
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:43,726
Wait, we're not done here yet!

76
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,887
Who?

77
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,686
A scientist who was studying
the bracelets at one point.

78
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:49,687
Well let's go see him.

79
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:51,487
- No! Out of the question.
- Why?

80
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:53,848
- I'd rather not say.
- This is the guy you stole the bracelets from, right?

81
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,928
How dare you assume that I acquired those bracelets
through anything but honest means?

82
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:00,969
- I may have a less than perfect reputation, ...
- You told me you stole them!

83
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:02,929
Did I?

84
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,129
Yes!

85
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,490
Anyway, he won't help us.

86
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,451
Correction, he won't help you.

87
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:12,651
Fine.

88
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:14,211
But if we're going,

89
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:17,892
- we'll need a change of clothes.
- Fine!

90
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:21,492
Fine.

91
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:31,094
Tell you what, these outfits make a bold statement.

92
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:33,814
You don't reckon Landry's gonna make us
work them into the rotation, do you?

93
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:37,935
Let me see. That's a camouflage green and
undercover rawhide. It's got a nice ring to it.

94
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:41,035
Well this better be quick,
45 minutes away from your girlfriend,

95
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:42,575
you're gonna turn into a pumpkin and

96
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:45,016
I'm gonna have to haul your ass back there.

97
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:49,897
Gentlemen! How can I help you?

98
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:52,317
Well, we require your expertise.

99
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,797
Expertise!

100
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:57,958
Well you are the foremost expert
on alien technology on this planet.

101
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,639
Foremost? Well, I don't know
if I'm the foremost expert.

102
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,279
I might be among the top five.

103
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,640
Are you familiar with these?

104
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:13,080
Yes, yes.

105
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,201
I actually owned a pair myself
up until not too long ago.

106
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,802
So you know how they work?

107
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:20,042
Of course!

108
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:24,202
The bracelets create a physiological
bond between the wearers.

109
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:26,282
They were used by the Goa'uld.

110
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:29,003
Have you ever heard of the physiological bond being
sustained say,

111
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,483
after the bracelets were removed?

112
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:32,964
No.

113
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:34,364
No.

114
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:37,964
Barring some freak power surge
in the bracelets themselves,

115
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:42,165
that might somehow transfer their effects outright,

116
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:43,926
it's highly unlikely.

117
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:47,126
But in the unlikely event this did happen,

118
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:50,446
would you be able to sever the connection?

119
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:52,527
I might be able to.

120
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,448
Great! Could you tell us?

121
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:06,929
How is she?

122
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:08,890
Who?

123
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,090
Vala.

124
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,930
We don't know any Vala.

125
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:17,851
Then I'm afraid I can't help you.

126
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:21,092
OK! Maybe we know a Vala.

127
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:22,692
I need to see her.

128
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:24,772
Why?

129
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:27,852
It's not what you think. I'm not after revenge.

130
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:32,573
The truth is, the bracelets weren't
the only thing she took from me.

131
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,334
She also stole...

132
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:38,294
my heart.

133
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:41,335
Excuse me?

134
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,535
<i>I remember it as if it were yesterday.</i>

135
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:44,816
Some nights,

136
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:48,536
we would steal away from the city,

137
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:51,697
strip off our clothing and

138
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:54,537
bathe in the springs of our garden.

139
00:08:55,217 --> 00:08:59,098
We would chase one another
across the mossy hills and then

140
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:03,138
lie naked under Adora's moons

141
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:05,659
and Vala would sometimes...
- It's OK!

142
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:07,179
It's great, thanks.

143
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:09,100
We got the picture.

144
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:11,540
<i>Very vivid, very disturbing picture.</i>

145
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,579
Yes.

146
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,341
Those were wonderful, carnal times.

147
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,340
But that's in the past.

148
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,821
All I ask now is that I be given
the chance to see her one last time.

149
00:09:25,622 --> 00:09:28,823
Bring me Vala and I'll consider helping you.

150
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:36,224
<i>Sir! Major Gibson's here to see you.</i>

151
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:37,464
<i>Send her in.</i>

152
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:40,825
- General.
- Major!

153
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,105
How are things at the Pentagon?

154
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:44,545
Not so good, I'm afraid.

155
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,745
The international committee has reviewed
your budget proposals

156
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:50,226
and despite your warnings of how it'll affect
the day to day operations of Stargate Command,

157
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:54,107
they have decided to throw their
full financial backing behind the Atlantis mission.

158
00:09:54,146 --> 00:09:56,987
They now see this base as serving
little more than a support role.

159
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:58,467
Can't say I'm surprised.

160
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:01,228
They've been going over the report
brought back by Dr Weir and her colleagues.

161
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,788
With the prevalence of Ancient
technology in the Pegasus Galaxy,

162
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:05,588
they feel that's where
we should be focusing our efforts.

163
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:07,549
- And you believe that?
- Sir?

164
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:12,350
Atlantis is a civilian operation.
They approved Dr Weir's appointment.

165
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:17,951
The reason they don't want to support Stargate
Command is because they have no say in how it's run.

166
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:19,790
That's what General O'Neill said.

167
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:23,791
He also said he'd be willing to go
to bat for you with the President.

168
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,792
But he thinks it might help if you take your case to
the chairman of the appropriations committee yourself.

169
00:10:27,832 --> 00:10:28,953
Does he?

170
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:33,313
Oh Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.

171
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:39,834
Arlos?

172
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:46,676
I thought I'd never see you again!

173
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:48,195
Hello Vala.

174
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:56,237
They overpowered me.

175
00:10:56,836 --> 00:11:01,637
Some five, six, mercenaries,
one morning on my way to see you.

176
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:06,038
They demanded that I steal
the bracelets under penalty of death.

177
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,879
I don't care.

178
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,279
Arlos?

179
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,161
Are you going to have me killed?

180
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:25,241
No.

181
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:29,322
The memories of what we shared,

182
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:32,002
and that you so callously threw away,

183
00:11:32,043 --> 00:11:35,163
will undoubtedly haunt you until the day you die.

184
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:36,283
That

185
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:38,644
should be punishment enough.

186
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:41,164
Oh yes, you're right!

187
00:11:42,204 --> 00:11:44,005
That should do it.

188
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:47,165
I'm over you.

189
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:53,246
What I'm not over however,
is the theft of my mother's necklace!

190
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,927
I want it back!

191
00:11:56,286 --> 00:12:00,967
Only then am I going to tell you
how to sever the link connecting you!

192
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:03,288
Be realistic. That necklace is gone.

193
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:05,328
There's no way I can get that back.

194
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:06,248
Well,

195
00:12:06,288 --> 00:12:08,088
then our business is done.

196
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:12,449
Hang on, loverboy!

197
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:15,010
We'll get your Momma's necklace.

198
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,210
Then we have a deal.

199
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:32,932
This once belonged to the first prime of Bastet.
It's completely unique. One of a kind.

200
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:34,773
And I am going to give it to you

201
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:37,674
for three ounces of Naquadah...

202
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:39,014
No?

203
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,734
Two for five!

204
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,135
So,

205
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:48,455
business not so good, huh?

206
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:52,215
Well with no planets to conquer
and no cities to loot,

207
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,896
how's a Jaffa expected to put food

208
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:57,016
on the table?

209
00:12:57,616 --> 00:13:01,297
Listen... a mutual friend of ours was
supposed to send word that we were coming.

210
00:13:01,337 --> 00:13:02,618
<i>What mutual friend?</i>

211
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:03,737
Vala?

212
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:07,818
Where is she?

213
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:09,538
We're not sure.

214
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:13,139
She said she had some business to attend to
and she'd meet us back at the gate.

215
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:15,780
What? She didn't call ahead?

216
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,260
I swore the next time I saw Vala,

217
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,060
I'd kill her where she stood.

218
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,300
That's a no.

219
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:23,220
Do you take me for a fool?

220
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,622
I don't know about them, but I certainly do.
Hello Inago.

221
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:30,662
Nicely done with the distraction, boys.

222
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:33,782
- Oh, that's what we're doing.
- You didn't wanna let us in on your little plan?

223
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,422
You would have just screwed it up.

224
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:36,463
Vala!

225
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:40,584
You cowardly, backstabbing,
sorry excuse for a woman.

226
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:42,703
- How've you been?
- Inago.

227
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:46,785
You filthy, double talking slug.
Nice to see you too.

228
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:48,505
Obviously they used to date.

229
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:51,345
Do you remember that necklace you sold me?

230
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:54,266
The priceless heirloom from the house of Verenna?

231
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:57,026
I may have overstated it's value slightly.

232
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:58,746
Slightly? It was worthless.

233
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:05,707
Huh, you're one to talk. That Goa'uld forceshield
inhibitor, turned out to be nothing more
than a power coil from an obsolete cargo ship.

234
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:07,508
Fortunately,

235
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,868
I'm not here for revenge.

236
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:11,228
In fact,

237
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:14,229
I'm here to set things straight.

238
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:19,910
By buying back that worthless necklace.

239
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,430
Why?

240
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,871
What's your angle?

241
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:25,711
You don't need to know.

242
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,311
Well then I guess you don't need that necklace.

243
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,351
No deal.

244
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:33,792
However, I am willing to show you
how I want to square things here.

245
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:37,312
I might consider buying back
that useless power coil.

246
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:41,153
Why would you want to buy back a power coil
from an obsolete cargo ship?

247
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,034
No necklace, no deal.

248
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:51,795
I've got an idea. How about a straight swap.
Necklace for power coil.

249
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:52,515
No!

250
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:55,076
No wait, wait, wait. I have a better idea.

251
00:14:55,196 --> 00:15:00,796
We dig a big old pit, we drop these two
in it and we let them fight it out.

252
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:03,117
I'll ask again.

253
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,397
<i>Deal?</i>

254
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:12,519
Deal.

255
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:14,519
Deal.

256
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:19,120
Of course I don't have the power coil.
We're going to have to go and get that back.

257
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Where would you unload an obsolete power coil?

258
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,962
Sister Visina,

259
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,403
<i>welcome back.</i>

260
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:37,842
Brother Kaius.

261
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,403
How are the orphans?

262
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:42,123
The orphans are well. Thank Grannus.

263
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,583
And you?

264
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:45,724
Well enough. Thank Grannus.

265
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:46,668
Who's Grannus?

266
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:50,044
- Minor celtic God. One of Camulus' former Lt's.
- Thanks.

267
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:53,885
Of course, all of us continue
to be grateful for your generous gift.

268
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:58,766
Pilgrims from all over the system travel
to see the legendary ring of Shen'Marak.

269
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:03,407
However, it has been a bittersweet
season for us, since coincidentally,

270
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:07,167
around the same time you made your gracious donation,

271
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:12,528
the shrine's most precious relic,
the Nevanna crystal, mysteriously disappeared.

272
00:16:12,568 --> 00:16:13,569
No!

273
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:14,688
Yes,

274
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:18,809
it is shocking the depths some people will plum.

275
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:23,090
Unfortunately I have some more bad news.

276
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:29,331
It appears I was decieved
and this ring of Shen' Marak is apparently a fake.

277
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:31,491
I'm afraid you'll have to get rid of it.

278
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:32,851
Out of the question.

279
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:37,252
Hey! It's bogus! Your followers
are worshipping a phoney relic!

280
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:41,052
Yes, but ultimately its true worth
can only be judged by the

281
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:45,134
genuine faith it instills in the hearts
of the many pilgrims who come to visit the shrine,

282
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:49,654
and more importantly, in the charitable
contributions they make while they are here.

283
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:50,895
Right.

284
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:53,534
<i>Of course, if you were willing to make a</i>

285
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:56,735
substantial contribution of your own?

286
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:02,856
What do you want?

287
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:08,377
I have to get outta here! I can't take anymore!

288
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:10,338
The fasting, the chanting,

289
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:12,361
bathing of the poor.

290
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:17,059
If I have to weave one more prayer basket,
I'm gonna kill someone!

291
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,299
Blessed day.

292
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:21,139
Blessed day, blessed day...

293
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,339
<i>Oh my.</i>

294
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,500
You're not a real monk.

295
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,341
He used to be a smuggler.
One of the best I ever knew.

296
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:36,341
Then things got a little too hot
for him and he had to find religion.

297
00:17:36,382 --> 00:17:38,362
Well it was a sweet rap while it lasted.

298
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:42,402
Until great God Grannus went
and got himself executed by his own Jaffa.

299
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:46,503
Since then the number of pilgrims
has been...well, significantly reduced.

300
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:48,564
<i>That's why you can't have the ring.</i>

301
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:50,364
- Power coil.
- Whatever!

302
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,685
The point is
that it's the only thing keeping this place going.

303
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:57,165
If you wanna go. Why not just go?

304
00:17:57,205 --> 00:18:00,005
Because all I got right now
are the clothes on my back.

305
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:05,166
I need my cargo ship. The one you borrowed.

306
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,607
Yes, that might be a bit of a problem.

307
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,247
But,

308
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:13,087
we can get you a replacement.

309
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:14,328
No deal.

310
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:17,409
What's so special about this particular cargo ship?

311
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:19,969
Let's just say I made a few modifications of my own.

312
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:23,009
- You bring it to me and I'll give you the ring.
- Power coil!

313
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:24,650
Look,

314
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,290
don't try anything, alright?

315
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:30,490
The Pilgrims of Grannus may be greatly reduced
in numbers, but they are more fanatical than ever.

316
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,491
You'd have to be to be worshipping a dead God.

317
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,852
I give the word and they will tear you to pieces
before you can get halfway to the gate.

318
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:37,756
<i>Now,</i>

319
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:42,253
if you'll excuse me?
I have morning prayers to attend to.

320
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:49,453
So how do we get the ship?

321
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:51,854
We can't!

322
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:53,334
<i>Why not?</i>

323
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,574
We've come this far.

324
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:57,415
What's the problem?

325
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,376
<i>What news?</i>

326
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:10,337
We've put the word out, but she has yet to appear.

327
00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:16,578
I needn't remind you that because
of your bungling, we've already lost a case
of weapons grade refined Naquadah.

328
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:22,019
Now someone has to pay. And if it's not Vala,
then it might as well be you two.

329
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:30,841
Rest assured. Vala can't hide forever and when
she turns up we'll deliver her, dead or alive.

330
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:37,382
See that you do and let it be known
that no-one defies the Lucian Alliance.

331
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:42,762
So let me get this straight.

332
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,102
You need to get this ship,

333
00:19:45,623 --> 00:19:47,063
to get the power coil,

334
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:52,944
to get the necklace, to get this guy to tell you how
to undo whatever is keeping you two connected?

335
00:19:52,964 --> 00:19:55,404
Yeah, that about sums it up.

336
00:19:55,964 --> 00:19:59,345
Unfortunately that ship is now
in the hands of the Lucian Alliance.

337
00:19:59,425 --> 00:20:02,145
- The who?
- It's a coalition

338
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:08,946
of former smugglers and mercenaries
who've banded together to take advantage of
the power vacuum left by the demise of the Goa'uld.

339
00:20:08,987 --> 00:20:12,027
The fact they've managed to form
a coherent group makes them unique, and a

340
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,787
particular threat especially
to the newly formed Jaffa government.

341
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,467
Can we contact them?

342
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,708
They won't deal with someone they don't know.

343
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:21,229
I assume they know you.

344
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:25,749
Well yes, but our last encounter
didn't exactly go as planned.

345
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:28,269
Ooh, let me guess.

346
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,870
You screwed them and now they wanna kill you.

347
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,271
Actually it was Daniel who messed up the deal.

348
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:34,770
You tried to sell them a stolen ship.

349
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:36,531
You're the one that told them they couldn't have it.

350
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:40,531
The point is if they see either
of us again, they will kill us.

351
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,532
Can we take this ship by force?

352
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:44,532
You'd have to go up against a sizeable armada.

353
00:20:44,572 --> 00:20:46,812
If the alternative is staying linked to you,
I'm willing to take that risk.

354
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,973
I'm sorry Dr Jackson but I can't allow it.

355
00:20:51,454 --> 00:20:56,135
Dr Lee's continuing his research, hopefully
he'll be able to come up with something on his own.

356
00:20:56,174 --> 00:20:57,534
In the meantime

357
00:20:57,854 --> 00:21:00,975
you're just going to have to
learn to live with each other.

358
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:03,415
And by the way,

359
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:04,976
in three days,

360
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:06,496
you're coming to Washington.

361
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:07,536
- We are?
- I am?

362
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:11,536
I need you to testify in front of the Chairman
of the Appropriations Commitee.

363
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:13,937
Let him see exactly what we're up against.

364
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:18,938
Your experience with the Ori could go a long way
towards convincing him of the dangers headed our way.

365
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,178
Right.

366
00:21:22,138 --> 00:21:24,379
We will do our best Sir.

367
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,981
Daniel,

368
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:41,902
do you happen to have
one of these...

369
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:43,942
credit cards?

370
00:21:43,982 --> 00:21:46,983
Yes I do, and no you can't.

371
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:54,384
By the way, is a security escort still necessary?

372
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:56,424
Do you really have to ask?

373
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,105
I noticed you've assigned a woman,

374
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:05,445
were you afraid I might corrupt
one of your impressionable young men?

375
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:09,786
No, I just thought that save someone
the trouble of having to rebuff your advances.

376
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:12,227
How do you know you succeeded?

377
00:22:15,787 --> 00:22:17,587
I'm so bored!

378
00:22:18,147 --> 00:22:21,368
What do you do around here, for fun?

379
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:25,368
I'm doing it.
Translating these artifacts from P4S-559.

380
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,929
Oh, are they valuable?

381
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:33,070
Well their historical value is immense, but there is
no gold or jewels involved if that's what you mean.

382
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,091
Don't touch that!

383
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,431
Do you know what?

384
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:46,472
You need to occasionally get up from under
the dust of dead civilisations and live a little.

385
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:49,673
Why don't you take me out to dinner?

386
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:54,993
Look the only way you're getting off this base
is on this little side-trip to Washington and
if we could find a way around that, we would.

387
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:57,473
Why don't we go off-world?

388
00:22:57,514 --> 00:23:00,794
I've got a great little deal cooked up
with some traders on Katana.

389
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:01,634
No.

390
00:23:02,594 --> 00:23:04,155
We could be partners.

391
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:07,395
Split everything down the middle, 60/40.

392
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:13,696
Hardly seems fair that your life gets
to continue and my affairs are put on hold.

393
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:16,657
Excuse me? I should be on my way
to the Pegasus Galaxy right now.

394
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:21,298
Oh don't you blame that on me,
it's your own curiosity in the ancient
treasure that cost you a trip to Atlantis.

395
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:22,337
You cuffed us together.

396
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:23,979
You weren't paying attention at the time.

397
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:29,859
Look, we can point fingers all we want
but the fact is, we're stuck together.

398
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:33,420
Like it or not, we're just going
to have to learn to get along.

399
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:45,421
Found your glasses.

400
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:56,503
I'm going to see what Dr Lee's doing.

401
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:24,868
Hello.

402
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:27,308
What the hell are you doing here?

403
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:29,588
Isn't this my room?

404
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:34,909
No your room is across the hall...
with the guard in front of it.

405
00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:36,630
Ah yes,

406
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,310
they all rather look alike don't they.

407
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,791
<i>Anyhow,</i>

408
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,431
<i>since I'm here,</i>

409
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,071
shall we make the best of it?

410
00:24:46,991 --> 00:24:48,352
No we shalln't.

411
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:49,816
<i>Come on Daniel.</i>

412
00:24:49,912 --> 00:24:53,673
We're both stuck here on this base
and there's nothing else to do.

413
00:24:53,712 --> 00:24:58,033
Yes there is! There's sleeping, there's working,
there's finding a way out of this mess!

414
00:24:58,073 --> 00:24:59,177
What if we can't?

415
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:01,274
We might have to spend
the rest of our lives together.

416
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:03,218
No! Don't even go there.

417
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:05,495
There's literally a bond between us.

418
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:08,895
Some people might even find that romantic.

419
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:10,736
I'm not one of those people.

420
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:17,117
Am I really so repulsive?

421
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,197
No...

422
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:21,277
No!

423
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,758
No you're not

424
00:25:26,178 --> 00:25:28,579
repulsive, you're just...

425
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:32,459
It's...

426
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:36,260
it's just that I know what you're doing,
the whole sexual thing.

427
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,120
It's a defence mechanism.

428
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:40,520
Really?

429
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,780
Yeah.

430
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,721
You live a solitary existence, you move from place
to place, you never form any lasting relationships,

431
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:49,361
you use sex as a weapon, prevent yourself
from forming any real emotional bonds.

432
00:25:52,762 --> 00:25:54,563
Textbook case.

433
00:25:57,523 --> 00:26:00,123
Never realized I was so transparent.

434
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:01,643
Vala..

435
00:26:01,684 --> 00:26:04,684
No really it's fine Daniel, you're right.

436
00:26:04,924 --> 00:26:09,125
I can see why you wouldn't want
to become involved with someone so pathetic.

437
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:12,686
I wasn't always like this, you should know.

438
00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:14,525
There was someone once.

439
00:26:14,925 --> 00:26:17,647
<i>In fact, I was engaged.</i>

440
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:25,168
Then I was taken as a host and even though the Tok'ra
eventually freed me, the damage was already done.

441
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:30,649
And once you have been spat on, and stoned

442
00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:34,049
by the people of your own village,

443
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:36,529
well,

444
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,850
you try forming lasting relationships.

445
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,950
Vala, just wait... please.

446
00:26:44,091 --> 00:26:45,531
Stop.

447
00:26:45,891 --> 00:26:47,491
Alright I'm sorry.

448
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:50,432
Okay,

449
00:26:52,172 --> 00:26:54,292
I'm sorry. I'm just...

450
00:26:54,332 --> 00:26:56,132
sometimes I just,

451
00:26:56,793 --> 00:26:59,153
I forget what you've been through.

452
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:03,754
If you've actually been through any of that...
are you messing with me?

453
00:27:03,793 --> 00:27:04,434
Is it working?

454
00:27:04,574 --> 00:27:06,574
Get out, go.

455
00:27:06,615 --> 00:27:08,054
Get out.

456
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:10,415
Go!

457
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:21,137
<i>Despite the fact the Jaffa are free
and Anubis has been defeated,</i>

458
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:24,638
it would be a mistake to assume
the Goa'uld are no longer a threat.

459
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:28,438
But without the Jaffa to do their bidding,
they're effectively crippled.

460
00:27:28,578 --> 00:27:31,622
Many still have the loyalty of their human slaves.

461
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:34,022
Slaves are a long way from an effective army,

462
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:40,839
and besides if the Jaffa saw the light, it will only
be a matter of time before the slaves follow suit.

463
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,440
The Goa'uld aren't the only threat out there Sir.

464
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:49,541
So I assume you're referring to these people
that you supposedly met in a distant galaxy.

465
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:50,782
Supposedly?

466
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:53,542
Well, correct me if I'm wrong.

467
00:27:53,582 --> 00:27:58,423
But according to the report I read,
you never actually left Stargate Command.

468
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,603
You went into a coma, had some kind of vision,

469
00:28:00,643 --> 00:28:03,923
for all we know, the whole thing could
have been an elaborate hallucination.

470
00:28:03,964 --> 00:28:05,708
One of the Priors came through the Gate.

471
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:11,229
A simple man who did nothing but spout a lot
of religious nonsense and then killed himself.

472
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:13,149
Senator I was there,

473
00:28:13,245 --> 00:28:15,126
the man burned himself to death.

474
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:19,446
Without the aid of any obvious devices
or technology, it was no parlor trick.

475
00:28:19,486 --> 00:28:23,287
We're also beginning to get reports that
there are other Priors showing up on other planets.

476
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:28,368
Well it's hardly surprising that new religious groups
would arise in the wake of the Goa'uld's collapse.

477
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:31,048
The Ori are very real senator.

478
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:33,609
As ascended beings they have all
the appearance of genuine God's.

479
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:36,193
But again, this is according to your testimony,

480
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:43,730
they cannot act in this galaxy without incurring
the interference from these other ascended beings.

481
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,891
Isn't that correct?

482
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,010
Technically yes.

483
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,691
Well, look at it from our point of view Dr Jackson.

484
00:28:48,731 --> 00:28:54,132
Finally after 8 years and billions of dollars spent,

485
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:58,252
the Goa'uld have been neutralized,
along with the Replicators.

486
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:03,853
And now suddenly,
out of nowhere, along come these magical Ori

487
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:07,038
requiring a redoubling of efforts and expenditures.

488
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:10,294
Exactly what are you suggesting Senator?

489
00:29:11,534 --> 00:29:16,935
The Stargate program has succeeded
in acquiring alien technology.

490
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:23,281
So now it's time to devote our resources
to exploiting those technologies for planetary defence,

491
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:27,418
namely by building more Daedalus class ships.

492
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:30,258
Now we have no intention of shutting you down completely,

493
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:35,842
you will continue to operate at 30%
of your current budget, I think you will
find that is more then enough money

494
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:38,659
once you deemphasize your explorations.

495
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:40,159
If you recall Senator,

496
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,720
it was new exploration that got us
those technologies in the first place.

497
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,084
Now there are still thousands of
Stargate addresses left unexplored in this galaxy.

498
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,862
This program doesn't exist to
satisfy your curiosity Doctor.

499
00:29:54,542 --> 00:30:02,383
The important thing is that we have learned enough
to defend this planet against any potential threat.

500
00:30:05,424 --> 00:30:08,104
Do you have something to say.

501
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:10,408
Well it's just all so amusing, isn't it.

502
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:19,786
I mean only an idiot would assume that
this backwater of a planet will safe because
you have a few ships with decent shield technology.

503
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:24,506
You don't look like an idiot to me.

504
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:29,587
So I have to assume that the reason
why you want to build more ships is

505
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:35,012
like all the men you like big machines
with big engines that fire big missiles

506
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:39,749
because you have a deep-seated need
to overcompensate for your own shortcomings.

507
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:41,189
Excuse me.

508
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:44,029
See, she knows what I mean.

509
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,430
I think a short recess would be a good idea.

510
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,671
I'm done here anyway.

511
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:55,192
This meeting is over.

512
00:30:56,871 --> 00:30:58,352
How did it go Sir?

513
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:01,113
Let's just put it this way,
you're going after that ship.

514
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,993
The cargo ship, what about the Lucian Alliance Sir?

515
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:05,457
You'll have to figure out a way to deal with them.

516
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:06,833
Why, what happened?

517
00:31:06,874 --> 00:31:11,418
She accused the Chairman of
the Senate Appropriations commitee of having a...

518
00:31:11,514 --> 00:31:14,355
let's just call it, an insufficient manhood.

519
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:16,475
She's gotta go.

520
00:31:22,395 --> 00:31:23,616
Just a word of warning.

521
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:26,416
Tenat and Jup are notoriously unscrupulous traders.

522
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:31,617
They're crafty, devious and although stupid,
under no circumstances are they to be trusted.

523
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:34,758
In other words they're going to
try and screw us before we screw them.

524
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,518
It should be alright as long as you keep your
guard up and we keep focus on what needs to be done.

525
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:42,559
Close the deal, take the ship,
make sure they don't kill me.

526
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,119
Certainly not in that order.

527
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,000
I still think we need some more
boots on the ground, just to be safe.

528
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:54,281
And they will most certainly run a surface scan of
the planet, any additional life signs or any ships in orbit
will only raise suspicion and jeopardize everything.

529
00:31:56,041 --> 00:32:01,122
We're approaching the planet, run a surface scan.

530
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:03,802
Four life signs.

531
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:06,843
Let's go greet them.

532
00:32:08,363 --> 00:32:10,683
This is a good plan, very inspired.

533
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:14,044
Yes we have you to thank for that. Nothing
motivates like complete and utter desperation.

534
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:16,125
You say that now,
but you will miss me when I am gone.

535
00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:17,725
No I'm pretty sure I won't.

536
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:20,445
Just like old times.

537
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:24,990
I am offering my assistance
on this mission only to aid Daniel Jackson.

538
00:32:25,086 --> 00:32:29,366
My participation should not be
construed as a desire to rejoin SG-1.

539
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:30,647
Right.

540
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:35,767
Colonel Mitchell at times, you remind me of O'Neill.

541
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:38,808
Ah, I'll take that as a compliment.

542
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:41,288
As you wish.

543
00:33:02,771 --> 00:33:03,972
Teal'c.

544
00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:16,414
Hey fella's. What's with all the hostility.

545
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:21,415
Vala, how does it feel,
knowing your sorry life is about to end.

546
00:33:21,455 --> 00:33:26,416
I don't know. How did it feel telling the Alliance
that you half-wits lost their Naquadah.

547
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:29,256
Woah. No, no violence.

548
00:33:29,296 --> 00:33:32,657
No damaging the goods until we've finished our deal.

549
00:33:32,696 --> 00:33:37,978
Besides I think the Alliance
wants to hold her up as an example.

550
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,338
Yes, they do.

551
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:42,218
Your name?

552
00:33:43,258 --> 00:33:44,859
Cam Mitchell.

553
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,339
Bounty hunter.

554
00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:48,219
Never heard of you.

555
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,443
That's because I keep a low profile.

556
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:53,380
I like to let my work speak for itself.

557
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,180
You've partnered with a Jaffa I see.

558
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,941
Look. We'd love to sit around and talk shop, but
we're on the clock. Where's our reward?

559
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:04,381
We have a caseload of weapons grade
refined Naquadah sitting in our cargo ship.

560
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:06,022
Good, let's go and get it.

561
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:06,943
No,

562
00:34:06,982 --> 00:34:08,743
I will stay here with you.

563
00:34:08,782 --> 00:34:11,623
While Jup takes Vala and her partner to the ship.

564
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:17,024
Once they've been secured he will return
and ring the Naquadah down to you.

565
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:21,705
And what's to stop all Jut here from
just ringing you away and just skidattling.

566
00:34:21,745 --> 00:34:22,665
Our honour.

567
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:25,145
It would not be in our best interests to cheat you.

568
00:34:25,185 --> 00:34:29,906
After all we have reputations as traders to uphold.

569
00:34:29,946 --> 00:34:31,146
Right,

570
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:33,667
reputations.

571
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:45,129
I can't help noticing the absence of the case load
of refined Naquadah you guys were promising.

572
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:49,350
Do you seriously think the Alliance
would have trusted us with another case,

573
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:52,190
after we lost the last one?

574
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,750
So this is a double cross?

575
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,070
What happened to upholding your reputation?

576
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:03,231
Let's just say those bounty hunters won't be
in a position to do any complaining.

577
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:12,473
Hold still!

578
00:35:14,953 --> 00:35:16,953
Told you.

579
00:35:30,076 --> 00:35:35,076
So who you like in the NFL this year?
You kinda strike me as a Raiders fan.

580
00:35:36,977 --> 00:35:38,721
Daniel, why don't you let me do it?

581
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:41,797
I can do it. Just do me a favour, I need some help.

582
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:42,597
OK, what?

583
00:35:42,638 --> 00:35:45,838
Go to the panel by the rear exit.

584
00:35:46,998 --> 00:35:48,078
OK, now what?

585
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,799
Stay there, shut up and let me finish.

586
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,520
Yeah, they got a great secondary in the league's.

587
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,464
The best pass rush.

588
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,401
Offence runs games and
the defence runs championships, am I right?

589
00:36:08,923 --> 00:36:11,402
Our cargo ship has returned.

590
00:36:11,442 --> 00:36:14,523
I suggest you lower your weapons.

591
00:36:14,843 --> 00:36:17,924
I take it we're not getting our Naquadah.

592
00:36:17,964 --> 00:36:23,165
No you're not and so concludes our deal.

593
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:44,567
Well!

594
00:36:45,128 --> 00:36:47,568
That went better than I expected!

595
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:51,169
I'm picking up ships. Lot's of them.

596
00:36:55,649 --> 00:37:00,730
Correction. That went much worse than I suspected.

597
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:05,092
<i>Stand down and prepare to be boarded.</i>

598
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:07,412
Shouldn't we be jumping into hyperspace or something?

599
00:37:07,552 --> 00:37:09,752
They will pursue us.

600
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:11,532
What are you doing?

601
00:37:11,572 --> 00:37:16,333
Kaius said he customised this ship.
Let's see if there's anything we can use.

602
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:23,394
What's happening?

603
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:25,795
Multiple energy signatures and phantom vessels.

604
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,355
They're confusing the Alliance ships.

605
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:29,795
Fine! Let's go, let's go, let's go!

606
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:39,501
There are two vessels pursuing us.

607
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:41,438
You got anything else in your bag of tricks?

608
00:37:41,477 --> 00:37:43,078
I'll show you.

609
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,640
What are you doing?

610
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,760
Vala?

611
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,120
Wait for it...

612
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:06,281
Now!

613
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:12,922
Wicked.

614
00:38:14,323 --> 00:38:15,403
Pulse wave.

615
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:20,644
Their power levels spiked and overloaded. It should
take a couple of minutes to restore primary systems.

616
00:38:20,683 --> 00:38:23,965
Which should give us enough time to...

617
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:30,485
Thanks for getting my ship back...

618
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:34,926
and for not helping yourselves to
the swag in the ships hidden compartments.

619
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:38,767
Wait! Did you just say hidden compartments?

620
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:40,687
No! Wait!

621
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:46,168
So really.

622
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:50,753
Why would you want to trade a power coil
from an obsolete cargo ship?

623
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:55,849
So really. Why would you want to trade
for this worthless necklace?

624
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,730
Never mind.

625
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:08,652
Excellent.

626
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:12,852
Finally I can get Mother off my back.

627
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:16,932
So?

628
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:18,213
So?

629
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:20,413
So, we had a deal, remember?

630
00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:23,294
We give you the necklace and you sever the link.

631
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:29,375
Yes, of course. I've been doing extensive research.

632
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:31,135
And?

633
00:39:31,175 --> 00:39:34,495
Well there's nothing I can do.
The effect can't be countered.

634
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:39,257
But you know? My guess is,
it'll wear off eventually on it's own.

635
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:42,017
So long everybody.

636
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:51,418
That's it?
You went through all that for nothing?

637
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:52,859
Pretty much.

638
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:55,579
I can't wait till Senator Fisher hears about this one.

639
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:57,019
Yeah, have you heard any news?

640
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:58,939
I spoke to the President.

641
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,780
He gave me two choices.

642
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:08,221
Accept the budget cuts or
convince the International Committee to change
their minds and contribute to our funding.

643
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:09,182
Right.

644
00:40:09,321 --> 00:40:10,822
How do we do that?

645
00:40:10,861 --> 00:40:12,662
Give them what they want.

646
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:15,702
A new civilian position appointed by the committee.

647
00:40:15,742 --> 00:40:17,886
With full access to this base

648
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,903
and a say in all major
decisions concerning its operation.

649
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:23,544
Watchdog.

650
00:40:25,904 --> 00:40:27,425
Exactly.

651
00:40:35,786 --> 00:40:36,905
Thanks for helping out.

652
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:38,545
Indeed.

653
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:42,067
Good luck on Dakara.

654
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:51,108
Don't be a stranger!

655
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:02,270
He'll be back
