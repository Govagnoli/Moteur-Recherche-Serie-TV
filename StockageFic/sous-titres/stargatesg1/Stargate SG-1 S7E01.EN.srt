1
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:16,757
The new animal took a look around

2
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:22,080
and immediately chose a place next to
the laziest, greediest beast in the stable.

3
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:26,126
The master saw this, put a yoke on him
and took him back to the merchant.

4
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:30,598
- We've heard this one already.
- Has it lost its meaning?

5
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:33,440
You told it just now
on the way down to the water hole.

6
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,524
Who are you?

7
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:08,718
I don't know.

8
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,326
I got it.

9
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,846
I got it. Teal'c! Teal'c!

10
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,918
I got it.

11
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:03,678
I got it.

12
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,564
Sorry, Tyler.

13
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:08,480
Siler. Master Sergeant Siler.

14
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,558
Three, please.

15
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:16,758
It's not the Lost City.

16
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:21,967
There's a subtle difference in meaning
in Asgard translations of early Ancient.

17
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:24,515
Excuse me. Watch it, watch it.

18
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:30,045
Hey, where's Major Carter?

19
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,402
She's in Hammond's office.

20
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:39,998
According to the Tok'ra,

21
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:44,399
Anubis is decimating the forces
of the remaining System Lords.

22
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:46,557
I got it.

23
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:49,445
- Hopefully it's not contagious.
- Ha, ha.

24
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:52,200
The Lost City.

25
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:55,040
- On the tablet.
- You found it?

26
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:58,119
Yeah, only it's not the Lost City.
That never made sense.

27
00:03:58,207 --> 00:04:01,961
The tablet is written in Ancient.
How could they lose their own city?

28
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:05,005
And why call it the Lost City?
They'd call it by its name.

29
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:08,079
- Mr Quinn...
- It's the City of the Lost.

30
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,727
- Do you have a gate address?
- There's a reference

31
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:13,765
in some translations
that Dr Jackson was working on

32
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:17,920
to a city of the Ancients called Vis Uban
as a place where plague began.

33
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:22,000
This was gonna be the crown jewel
in the entire Ancient domain.

34
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:25,079
It was still under construction
when the plague broke out.

35
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,044
Two words: Gate address.

36
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:31,803
Four years ago when Ancient knowledge
was downloaded to Colonel O'Neill's mind

37
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:36,085
he put a bunch of new gate addresses
into the SGC computer.

38
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,680
How many did he put in there?

39
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:40,679
We've been sending probes
and cataloguing them.

40
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:43,281
Any relevant planet
goes on the mission list.

41
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:47,406
- How many have been sent probes?
- Less than a quarter.

42
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,242
Do you think he got these gate addresses
randomly, or could there be an order?

43
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:53,521
Yeah, I suppose.

44
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:57,600
If Vis Uban wasn't finished
at the time the Ancient civilisation fell...

45
00:04:57,687 --> 00:05:00,884
You're saying the city we're looking for
is the last on the list.

46
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,801
We've been going in order
from first to last, right?

47
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,640
- Send a probe.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:14,759
We're not talking about a common cold,
Carter. It was the plague.

49
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,044
Sir, we don't wear a HazMat
every time we step through the gate.

50
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:21,676
There's always a chance we could be
exposed to something dangerous.

51
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:27,603
- The place is called the City of the Dead.
- City of the Lost, actually, sir.

52
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:30,281
Not for lack of a sense of direction.

53
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:56,837
Well, these folks don't look lost, nor dead.

54
00:05:56,927 --> 00:06:00,363
I don't think that these are the Ancients.

55
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,438
I mean, anything's possible, but...

56
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:08,921
they look like some sort of a nomadic
tribe that's just taken up residence.

57
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:17,678
Greetings.

58
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:19,400
Greetings.

59
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:23,480
We're travellers
from a planet called Earth.

60
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:27,765
- You came through the Chaapa-ai?
- The Stargate. Chaapa-ai.

61
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:31,084
He is Jaffa.

62
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,362
No, but he plays one on TV.

63
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:39,401
This is Teal'c. He's no longer allied
with the Goa'uld. He's a friend. As are we.

64
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:41,876
We too are travellers.

65
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:48,156
This place is not our original home, but
we have been here for some time now.

66
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:53,321
- If you wish to lay claim...
- No. No, no, nothing like that.

67
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:56,717
We just want the opportunity
to learn more about your people

68
00:06:56,807 --> 00:07:01,278
and to take a really good look
around these ruins.

69
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,278
We did a sweep of the area, sir.

70
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:06,564
Maintain a secure perimeter.
50 metres radius from the gate.

71
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,683
Sir?

72
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,875
They are travellers, like us.

73
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,844
They say they are friends.

74
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:33,476
No one can be a friend
if you know not whether to trust them.

75
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,683
Don't judge a book by its cover.

76
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:39,476
Enemies' promises
were made to be broken.

77
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:43,845
And yet honesty is the best policy.

78
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:46,395
He that has too many friends has none.

79
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:49,479
Ah, but birds of a feather...

80
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:54,360
I'm unfamiliar with that story.

81
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:58,287
What lesson does it teach?

82
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:02,795
It has to do with flocking,
and togetherness...

83
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:08,399
and, to be honest, I'm not that familiar
with the particulars myself.

84
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:11,843
The point is, we're not your enemy.
Give us a chance to prove it.

85
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,761
Colonel.

86
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:20,915
We found something
you might want to see.

87
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,118
Daniel?

88
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:37,801
Arrom.

89
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,957
- Arrom?
- That's what we call him.

90
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,163
It means "Naked One".

91
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:46,045
That's how we found him
in the forest two moons ago.

92
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,243
Seems he doesn't remember who he is.

93
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,318
Daniel?

94
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,998
It's OK. It's me, S...

95
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:01,565
Do you not recognise us, Daniel Jackson?

96
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:03,956
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,918
Not even me?

98
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:26,396
Please leave me alone.

99
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,158
I'm Jack O'Neill.

100
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:36,998
And, barring some freakish similarity,
you are Doctor Daniel Jackson.

101
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:43,797
This tent is all I know.

102
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:47,675
And these people, they're all I know.

103
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:51,123
Before I woke up in the forest,
I don't remember anything.

104
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:55,485
I've tried.
I've tried to remember who I was before.

105
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:59,240
Sometimes I think
it's floating in front of me,

106
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:02,205
and all I have to do
is reach out and grab it.

107
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:06,246
I try... and it's gone.

108
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:13,963
You were a member of my team, SG-1.
You're a friend of mine.

109
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,686
- Last year, you died.
- I'm dead?

110
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:21,757
Obviously not. You just sort of died.

111
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:27,036
Actually, you ascended to
a higher plane of existence.

112
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,039
Last time I saw you,
you were helping us fight Anubis.

113
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:31,116
Anubis?

114
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:35,883
Yeah, kind of an over-the-top,
cliché bad guy.

115
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:39,437
Black cloak, oily skin, kind of spooky.

116
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:48,082
Anyway, obviously, since then,
you've retaken human form somehow.

117
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:57,043
Actually, I can see how
this might sound a bit unusual.

118
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:59,083
A bit?

119
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:02,603
- Why am I here?
- Hey, why are any of us here?

120
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:13,041
Honestly, I don't know. But you gotta
trust me: You are Daniel Jackson.

121
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:16,437
Think of it this way.
Out of all the planets in the galaxy,

122
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:20,315
why this one, if not for us to find you?

123
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:23,562
So you're saying
a higher power put me here?

124
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:27,117
I don't know.
That was generally your department.

125
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:36,879
- Thanks very much.
- You're welcome.

126
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:44,318
Jonas and Teal'c are helping SG-3 and 5
begin the preliminary sweep.

127
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:47,717
Remember when I said
it was like talking to a wall?

128
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,163
We know someone who's ascended
can choose to retake human form.

129
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:54,000
You think he also chose
to forget everything?

130
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:57,557
Maybe the part about his memory
isn't voluntary.

131
00:11:57,647 --> 00:12:00,480
Maybe it's punishment
for trying to help us.

132
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:03,320
He did say he was breaking
some big rules.

133
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,477
So? What?

134
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,279
It's gonna take time to search all the ruins.

135
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:12,677
There could be weapons
or a power source hidden anywhere.

136
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:18,763
In the meantime, we try to help Daniel
remember... if that's even possible.

137
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,838
Tag. You're it.

138
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,758
Can I come in?

139
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,478
Sure.

140
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:50,043
So.

141
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:53,358
What did you say your name was again?

142
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:55,881
Samantha Carter.
You used to call me Sam.

143
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:59,562
- Yeah, well, like I already told Jim...
- Uh, Jack.

144
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:02,115
Jack?

145
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:04,482
Yeah. I told him.

146
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:08,842
I don't understand why you aren't
dying to know all about who you are.

147
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:11,282
I am.

148
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,244
And I'm not.

149
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:18,924
- See, it's the "not" part...
- What if I don't like who I was?

150
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,079
What if I don't want to be that person?

151
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:29,921
What if I don't have it in me to make up
for something I've done wrong?

152
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:35,205
I have to admit,
that never occurred to me.

153
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:38,484
Look, we all thought we'd
lost you at one point.

154
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,560
It was one of the hardest things
I have ever been through.

155
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:44,877
You were - you are brilliant.

156
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,238
One of the most caring, passionate...

157
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:57,000
You're the type of person who'd give his
life for someone he doesn't even know.

158
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,555
That doesn't sound so bad.

159
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:02,958
If you had one fault,

160
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:08,041
it was that you wanted to save people
so badly, to help people so much,

161
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,483
that it tore you apart when
you couldn't make a difference.

162
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:16,083
That actually sounds
kind of hard to live up to.

163
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:22,356
All I know is that, if I were you, I would
definitely want to get to know me... you.

164
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,678
- I get it.
- Come back with us.

165
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:29,362
Let us show you who you are,
instead of just telling you.

166
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:31,597
I'll think about it.

167
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:34,878
OK.

168
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:41,724
Samantha Carter?

169
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,241
Yeah?

170
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:47,922
Was there ever anything... between us?

171
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:51,043
Us?

172
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:53,880
No. No, not in that way.

173
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:59,005
We were really, really good friends.

174
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:01,317
OK.

175
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,398
Carter.

176
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:22,681
Shamda here was just telling me a story
about a dog and some dancing monkeys.

177
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:25,645
The moral is:
Appearances can be deceptive.

178
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,285
I got that.

179
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:31,326
Very good story. Wonderful.
Full of nuances. I like that.

180
00:15:31,407 --> 00:15:35,400
- We sent up a UAV.
- The ruins are quite extensive.

181
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:39,560
Yeah. It's gonna take us weeks
to scour this place properly.

182
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,640
- What of Daniel Jackson?
- He's going home.

183
00:15:57,647 --> 00:16:03,199
- Welcome back, Dr Jackson.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

184
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:06,916
- You have no memory of who I am?
- None whatsoever.

185
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,804
Neither do I, sir.

186
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:14,996
That way.

187
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:18,079
Did I mention you owe me 50 bucks?

188
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:35,439
I'm happy to say, sir, that he's in perfect
health, except for one small exception.

189
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:41,997
Wow. That's different.

190
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:43,918
You recognise me now?

191
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:50,360
- Has your hair always been that way?
- What way?

192
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:52,438
Never mind.

193
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:10,718
Not exactly home,
but we unpacked some of your stuff.

194
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:16,403
You kept all this
even though you thought I was dead?

195
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:19,763
To be honest, we tossed out a ton of junk.

196
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:24,837
A lot of which seemed to be very valuable.

197
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:40,318
I... kept a few of your
personal things alive there.

198
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:47,203
- I know her.
- Really?

199
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,875
I mean, I must, right?

200
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,764
Yeah...

201
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:56,362
- Who is she? What's her name?
- You tell me.

202
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:37,523
- Sorry. Am I interrupting?
- You are not.

203
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:43,476
I am unable to kelno'reem as I once did,
since I began using tretonin.

204
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,877
- Well, that sounds complicated.
- Indeed.

205
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:48,958
Enter.

206
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:03,396
Her name is Sha're.

207
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:06,875
Yes.

208
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:10,164
No one told me that.
I remembered that by myself.

209
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:12,966
I dreamed about her
and when I woke up I knew her name.

210
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:18,075
- That is good news, Daniel Jackson.
- Yeah, I believe I might have a chance.

211
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:22,604
If I can remember a name, there's a
chance it's all in there somewhere, right?

212
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:23,881
Indeed.

213
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,844
So, where is she?

214
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,798
She's dead.

215
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:45,242
I loved her very much.

216
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,405
This being, Oma Desala,
is very powerful, right?

217
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:03,876
- That is correct.
- Why would she do this?

218
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,764
If she wanted me to forget...

219
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:09,999
You spoke of the rules to which you were
subjugated as one of the ascended.

220
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:13,875
Perhaps she was required to erase
your memories by laws of the Others,

221
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:17,642
but, as your friend and mentor,
she wished you one day to regain it.

222
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:21,242
You think she cheated?
Found a way around the rules?

223
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:23,318
You do not agree?

224
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:30,401
Tell me about this Anubis.
Why did I break the rules to fight him?

225
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:32,876
Is it not wise to remember
on your own accord?

226
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:37,199
No. I need to know why
this is happening to me.

227
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:49,477
At this point, we believe that we've
mapped the full extent of the ruins.

228
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:53,003
No fancy guns, or anything cool?

229
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:56,079
We've only completed
a preliminary investigation.

230
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:08,004
Sorry I'm late. I forgot
what time the meeting was.

231
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:14,719
That's a little joke there.
It's the memory thing.

232
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,241
Dr Jackson, this briefing is classified.

233
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:20,160
Yeah, Jonas mentioned that, but...

234
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:23,762
you all said that I used to be
part of this, so...

235
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:30,478
Look, I can't really give you a good
reason. I just... feel like I should be here.

236
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:36,198
Good enough.

237
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:43,526
Besides, who will I tell?
I don't remember anybody, right?

238
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,276
- Good one.
- Thanks, Jim.

239
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,077
Oh, so, there are extensive writings,

240
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:55,080
all in the oldest known Ancient dialects,
all yet to be translated.

241
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:59,479
But so far we haven't found any signs of
any advanced weapons or power sources.

242
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:04,925
The original name of the city, Vis Uban,
does translate as "place of great power",

243
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:08,124
but it doesn't mean we'll find a way
to defeat Anubis there.

244
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:10,243
You won't.

245
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:16,400
- It's not the Lost City.
- How do you know?

246
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:19,399
Because Jonas translated "lacun"
to mean "of the lost".

247
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:21,557
- But that's...
- The wrong place.

248
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:26,198
- But the translations in your notes...
- Also wrong. I was way off.

249
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:30,565
- How do you know that?
- I don't know. I know what the tablet says.

250
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:32,046
How?

251
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:35,119
I don't know. I just
looked at it and understood it.

252
00:22:35,207 --> 00:22:39,325
Are you saying the Ancients
actually lost one of their own cities?

253
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:44,925
No, they didn't lose it. They made it lost...
to other people that might try to find it.

254
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:47,965
I'm guessing that they camouflaged it

255
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:51,039
and removed all reference to it
from the written history.

256
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:52,685
So...

257
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:56,396
the Lost City is... still lost.

258
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:58,239
I'm pretty sure.

259
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:02,083
You told me to give Anubis that Eye.

260
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:06,763
According to our allies, Anubis is quickly
conquering the other System Lords.

261
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,077
He will dominate the galaxy very soon.

262
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:13,558
I did it cos you said we could whup his
ass with what we'd find in this Lost City.

263
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:17,481
If I said that, then I hope it's true, but...

264
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:22,957
Look, all I know is that the place
you're searching right now is not it.

265
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:26,005
Then where is "it"?

266
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:29,318
Did I just say "all I know"?

267
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:33,161
Everyone turn away.

268
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,802
I want no witnesses.

269
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:45,438
Yeah?

270
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:47,566
Hey.

271
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:48,921
Sorry to bother you.

272
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:53,637
You're not. I was just...
reading about us, actually.

273
00:23:57,007 --> 00:24:01,159
You said that Anubis was part-ascended,

274
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:05,240
that the Ancients tried to send him back
to our level of existence but failed,

275
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,557
and now he's trapped
somewhere in between.

276
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:08,966
So I've heard.

277
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:12,960
Anubis wouldn't know everything there is
to know about the Ancients, right?

278
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:17,279
- Or he'd have already found the Lost City.
- I know I read that tablet but...

279
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:19,483
I'm just thinking out loud here.

280
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,764
If Anubis were to
accidentally find the tablet,

281
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:25,520
he's not gonna make
the same mistake I did.

282
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:27,165
I don't know.

283
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:33,004
But if we were to make a replica
of the tablet, change what it says...

284
00:24:33,087 --> 00:24:34,566
Why?

285
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:08,999
As you all know, we've had
little success using naquadria

286
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:12,636
to power the F-302's hyperspace
generator for any length of time.

287
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:15,321
However, if our calculations are correct,

288
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:19,116
we believe a short, controlled burst
would send the 302 into subspace

289
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:21,675
long enough to bypass
the mother ship's shields.

290
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:24,406
And if your calculations are incorrect?

291
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:29,117
The 302 would bypass the mother ship
altogether - or worse, re-emerge inside it.

292
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:32,882
- But let's not go there right now.
- Of course. Let's not dwell.

293
00:25:33,927 --> 00:25:37,806
According to
intelligence provided by the Tok'ra,

294
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:40,082
the power core of Anubis's new weapon

295
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:43,716
must be cooled by a ventilation shaft
on the exterior of the ship.

296
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:47,766
If that can be targeted and destroyed
just as the weapon is powering up,

297
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:51,556
the crystals will overheat
and be destroyed.

298
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:55,796
Where is this shaft, exactly?

299
00:25:57,967 --> 00:26:03,200
As Colonel O'Neill is well aware,
we don't know exactly where the shaft is.

300
00:26:03,287 --> 00:26:07,485
Our operative in Anubis's ranks has been
unable to get aboard the new ship

301
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,798
and has only a very limited
working knowledge of it.

302
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:15,881
Anubis's computer systems use elaborate
ciphers in the oldest Ancient dialect.

303
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:17,958
We are unable to translate them.

304
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:23,804
Jonas and Daniel will sneak aboard
Anubis's ship and access the computer.

305
00:26:23,887 --> 00:26:26,560
We have devised
an injectable radioactive isotope

306
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:30,959
that will allow them to move freely,
undetected by sensors for eight hours.

307
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,926
They'll decode and relay the target's
location to Colonel O'Neill and me,

308
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:36,998
who will be flying the F-302.

309
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:41,000
- No problem, right?
- Hey, sounds easy to me.

310
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:48,319
Good. Anubis's ship is destroyed,
and we all live to save another day.

311
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:53,720
Again, as the Colonel is well aware,
we have reason to believe

312
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:57,436
that eliminating the crystal power core
of the ship's main weapon

313
00:26:57,527 --> 00:27:00,041
won't destroy the entire ship.

314
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:03,199
Its defences and auxiliary weapons
will remain intact.

315
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:05,721
Why don't we dwell on that
for just a minute?

316
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:08,765
Our goal is to take out
Anubis's new superweapon.

317
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:12,601
It gives him a clear advantage
over the other Goa'uld mother ships.

318
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:18,876
We've heard from Teal'c that Yu will bring
the System Lords' fleet down on Anubis

319
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:20,958
once we've succeeded.

320
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:27,245
OK. Everyone who thinks this is
an insane idea, raise your hand.

321
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:31,846
Come on, be honest.
Let's go. Get 'em up there.

322
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:37,799
Keep your hands up, people,
because the next question is:

323
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:40,560
Who is going to make this happen?

324
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:46,239
It's going to take us at least a week
to relocate the inhabitants of the ruins.

325
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:48,921
Which will give us time
to build a makeshift runway

326
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:51,521
and get the 302
through the gate and reassembled.

327
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:57,125
And once everything is established,
the Tok'ra will plant our fake tablet,

328
00:27:57,207 --> 00:28:00,119
and, with any luck,
we'll lure Anubis to the planet.

329
00:28:00,207 --> 00:28:02,801
Let's move.

330
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:15,003
Look, I realise I wasn't
the most positive voice in the room.

331
00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:17,237
We all know it's an extreme long shot, sir.

332
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:21,923
My big problem is that all this depends
on us trusting a Goa'uld to back us up.

333
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:24,999
This is our only chance to take Anubis
out of the picture,

334
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:27,078
and Yu has helped us in the past.

335
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:30,079
All I'm saying, just for the record,

336
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,806
this is the wackiest plan
we've ever come up with.

337
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:36,004
Wackier than strapping
an active Stargate onto the X-302?

338
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:37,645
Oh, yeah.

339
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:39,797
Wackier than blowing up a sun?

340
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:41,798
Yep.

341
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:47,558
He's probably right.

342
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:10,997
My lord, the fleet is ready.

343
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:15,117
- I say when the fleet is ready.
- Of course, my lord.

344
00:29:19,447 --> 00:29:23,360
It is time we moved them into position
to prepare for the ambush of Anubis,

345
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:25,199
as you agreed, my lord.

346
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:29,758
Speak to me as if I am a fool again
and you will not take another breath.

347
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:31,360
Yes, my lord.

348
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:45,042
Move the fleet into position.

349
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:58,002
That's your son.

350
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,885
- Yeah.
- Charlie, right?

351
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:06,563
He's why I know you. You took that first
mission to Abydos thinking it'd be suicide.

352
00:30:06,647 --> 00:30:09,639
- Things change.
- Yeah. Sorry.

353
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,560
You sure you're ready for this?

354
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:20,563
Despite what you say, I don't think you'd
be doing this if it wasn't worth doing.

355
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:25,721
You obviously don't remember everything.
You never used to follow my lead.

356
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:27,798
I didn't?

357
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:33,036
Hey.

358
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:38,679
I may not remember everything but...
I remember enough.

359
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:44,918
Good.

360
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:05,883
- Sir, welcome to base camp.
- Thank you, Major.

361
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:08,481
I have to admit,
it's strange to see you offworld.

362
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:12,162
This is not your usual
alien-planet operation, is it, Major?

363
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:13,236
No, sir.

364
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:16,319
- What's our status?
- We're ready to go, sir.

365
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:20,116
- You'd better get yourself out to the F-302.
- Yes, sir.

366
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:45,318
We just received word. Anubis's ship will
be arriving in the system momentarily.

367
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:55,356
Air Strike, this is Command Base.
You are a go for take-off.

368
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:59,686
I thought we were going
with Red Leader on this one.

369
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:01,598
All systems go, sir.

370
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:05,646
Uh... Command? There is one more thing.

371
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:09,083
Colonel, Major...

372
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:10,566
Godspeed.

373
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:13,286
All right, that's better.

374
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:15,918
Thank you, sir.

375
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:17,641
- Thanks, guys.
- Good luck.

376
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:42,879
Holy crap! Look at that thing. It's huge!

377
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:47,916
I think they know we're coming, sir.
Tally four gliders, nose, 400 kilometres.

378
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:24,361
Extending. Max burn.

379
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:28,201
- You're heading right for them.
- I want to see what this is made of.

380
00:34:28,287 --> 00:34:33,486
- I could tell you exactly, sir.
- Another time... maybe... please?

381
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:49,638
Fox 4-2.

382
00:34:57,927 --> 00:35:01,363
Pitching back, left, 1-3-5.

383
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:07,843
Daniel, Jonas, we are
under attack. We need that intel.

384
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:12,125
- We're close.
- We can't hold these guys off for long.

385
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,915
Great. We got company.

386
00:35:25,727 --> 00:35:28,082
- My lord.
- Take the fleet to Chodawa.

387
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:32,558
My lord, that is across the galaxy.
We are in position to ambush Anubis...

388
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:36,401
Do not question me. I am your god.

389
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:38,842
Do as I say.

390
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:41,566
- You cannot.
- I have no choice.

391
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:43,046
Take him to a holding cell.

392
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:47,120
If you do not eliminate Anubis, you
are dooming yourself and your master.

393
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:49,482
I must do as my god commands.

394
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,318
My lord.

395
00:36:06,607 --> 00:36:10,282
Our ground troops confirm that
there is a human base on the planet.

396
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:15,441
- The search of the city?
- No energy signatures.

397
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:29,323
That'll hold 'em off for a while.

398
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:32,843
A little while.

399
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:36,082
That's it. I'm in.

400
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:38,727
This may take more than a little while.

401
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:41,879
Can't you do some kind
of a keyword search?

402
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,958
For what? "Achilles"?

403
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:49,041
I'm glad to see your memory's coming
back, not to mention your razor-sharp wit.

404
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:53,518
But why don't we try something like...
"power-core venting"?

405
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,804
That's it, that's it.

406
00:36:58,327 --> 00:37:01,444
Jack, Sam, we got it. Transmitting data.

407
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:11,078
We gotta go, Carter.

408
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:14,364
Sir, I've got the data, but
we need Anubis to power the weapon.

409
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:19,237
Airborne, we have not heard from Teal'c.
The Goa'uld fleet is long overdue.

410
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:22,205
See?
I had a problem with this plan.

411
00:37:22,287 --> 00:37:27,281
My lord, the attack vessel
continues to elude our gliders.

412
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:30,439
Send in another squadron.

413
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:34,963
I do not believe
what you are searching for is here.

414
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:37,959
- I agree.
- Shall I target their base, my lord?

415
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,642
No. Recall the ground troops.

416
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:45,126
Yes, my lord.

417
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:50,765
I don't think we're gonna get
back to the ring room that way.

418
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:54,726
- What's that?
- They're targeting the planet.

419
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:57,879
- Base camp, this is Jonas. Come in.
- Go ahead.

420
00:37:57,967 --> 00:38:03,405
Your position's been compromised.
The Stargate is being targeted.

421
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:05,603
The naqahdah will amplify the blast.

422
00:38:05,687 --> 00:38:09,157
Roger that. Evacuate all personnel.

423
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:16,040
We go at it now, right?

424
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,119
We need the Goa'uld mother ships
here to finish the job.

425
00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:23,120
- Sir, four more gliders headed this way.
- Can we go at it now?

426
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:25,482
Activating hyperdrive.

427
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:29,918
Extending, straight up.

428
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:38,797
Damn, that was close.

429
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:42,323
Transferring target data
to your terminal, sir.

430
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:49,518
The human attack vessel
has breached our shields.

431
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:50,722
Shoot it down.

432
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:54,717
- Let's get outta here.
- Yeah.

433
00:39:21,687 --> 00:39:24,326
Target is locked. Fox 4-2.

434
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:36,083
- Nice shot, sir.
- Well, thank you, ma'am.

435
00:39:37,247 --> 00:39:40,364
The core is overloading.
We must power down the weapon.

436
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:09,596
Daniel, come in. Do you read?

437
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:11,962
Yeah. I'm still on the ship.

438
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:16,923
- Hey, congratulations. You hit the mark.
- Thanks. It was fun.

439
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:20,966
We'll wait until Anubis's ship goes
and rendezvous with you at the Stargate.

440
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:24,039
As far as that goes,
we may have a little problem.

441
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:30,721
You will suffer gravely.

442
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:36,078
Yeah, I figured as much.
Although I am consoled by the fact

443
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:40,365
that we succeeded in destroying
the power source for your new weapon.

444
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:42,915
You are in no position to gloat.

445
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:48,127
We just wiped out your single advantage
you had over the Goa'uld.

446
00:40:48,207 --> 00:40:52,166
I would say that's about
as good a reason as any.

447
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:54,636
Enough.

448
00:40:54,727 --> 00:41:00,757
- I won't tell you anything.
- Oh, yes, you will.

449
