1
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:02,343
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:03,952
<i>on Stargate SG-1...</i>

3
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:07,632
<i>Unfortunately,
that ship is now in the hands of the Lucian Alliance.</i>

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,926
<i>- The who?
- It's a coalition...</i>

5
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:16,849
of former smugglers and
mercenaries who've banded together to take advantage
of the power vacuum left by the demise of the Goa'uld.

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,154
We received a communiqué
from a Goa'uld named Nerus.

7
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:24,299
- Ring any bells?
- He is a Goa'uld known for his many...

8
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:25,743
appetites.

9
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,395
I was the one

10
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:34,091
who figured out how to activate all the Stargates
in the galaxy at once!

11
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,202
Didn't Ba'al mention that?

12
00:00:36,212 --> 00:00:37,979
You will descend

13
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:44,244
to a small, dark room in the basement of Area 51,
and you'll stay there till you come up with a defense

14
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:49,533
- against the Ori.
- What would possibly compel me to do that?

15
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:51,127
Hunger.

16
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:09,296
- What did you say to them?
- Look, obviously, it didn't go so well.

17
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:14,083
I did advise that you were a most
unlikely drug smuggler, Colonel Mitchell.

18
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:16,929
Can we please just fall back to the Gate?

19
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:36,784
We cannot hold this position.

20
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:42,898
What's taking so long?

21
00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:44,533
Guys?

22
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:50,006
- We've got a problem!
- Yes, bad men are shooting at us!

23
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:53,451
Just hurry up and open the damn...

24
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:02,060
Gate.

25
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:07,309
Season 9 - Episode 16
Off The Grid

26
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:14,859
<i>- It's called kassa.
- Looks a lot like corn.</i>

27
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:16,969
Which I always thought
was indigenous to North America.

28
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,647
Must be pretty damn tasty
if it's causing all this fuss.

29
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,718
I believe lieutenant
Mooney described it as "sweet corn heaven."

30
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:25,003
What's his condition?

31
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:27,236
He still craving it, Sir.

32
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:28,871
He didn't even want to leave the planet.

33
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:30,665
I had to restrain him to get him back here.

34
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:31,582
That's amazing.

35
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:35,409
Obviously you've never had
my grandma's corn bread and black-eyed peas.

36
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:37,124
No.

37
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,752
What about the rest of the population?
Were they demonstrating any of
the same addictive behaviors?

38
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:43,304
Everybody was fine when we first got there.

39
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:48,128
A fight broke out in the marketplace when supplies ran
low, and my men and I had to move in to restore order.

40
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:51,597
That's what made Mooney
want to taste it in the first place.

41
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:54,388
<i>- I just didn't think it would...
- it's all right.</i>

42
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:56,501
What does Dr. Lee have to say about it?

43
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:00,528
He's still analyzing the sample now, Sir,
to determine whether or not it's naturally occurring.

44
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:03,079
Which makes me wonder
if the Ori have something to do with this.

45
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,986
Get all the population jonesing for space corn?

46
00:04:07,465 --> 00:04:08,741
I don't know.

47
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:11,133
I also do not believe that to be unlikely.

48
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:13,007
It doesn't really fit their M.O., does it?

49
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:16,077
Besides, there was no evidence
that a Prior had ever been there before.

50
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:22,257
In the last session of the interim
council, several Jaffa leaders complained
of erratic behavior on several planets.

51
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,450
We did not suspect tampering with the food supply.

52
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:27,758
Colonel, were you able to
determine where this kassa came from?

53
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:32,224
I pressured one of the vendors for a Gate address,
but to be honest, I don't know if it's accurate.

54
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:33,938
It's worth checking out, Sir.

55
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:37,168
Well, find out what you can,
but try to stay under the radar.

56
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,444
<i>Will do.</i>

57
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,481
Taste-testing the produce...?

58
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:18,474
Please...

59
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:19,540
I have two daughters.

60
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,903
Don't worry. We're not gonna hurt you.

61
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,015
Who are you?
What do you want?

62
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:26,208
We're looking to buy some kassa.

63
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:28,122
It is available at every market.

64
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:32,628
We're looking for a sizable quantity.

65
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,333
I can maybe spare you one or two carts full.

66
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:39,765
How much for the whole field?

67
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:45,068
- This is not the way the Alliance does business.
- As in the Lucian Alliance?

68
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:46,941
How many alliances do we know?

69
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,855
Many.

70
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:52,563
The Lucian Alliance will know you have come.
They have eyes everywhere.

71
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:53,599
Great,

72
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,188
because we're looking to set up a meeting.
Maybe you can arrange that.

73
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:59,341
Worrel returns this afternoon.

74
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,730
- Worrel is...?
- This is his land, his crop.

75
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,923
He lives in the house just up the road.

76
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,195
Well, tell him Mr. Shaft...

77
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:09,030
would like to meet with him.

78
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,704
Any specific time, or

79
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:13,056
should I just block off the whole afternoon?

80
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:15,449
I will arrange it, but I must warn you

81
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:17,761
he will not take kindly to your request...

82
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,475
or to your presence.

83
00:06:29,244 --> 00:06:31,038
What the hell was that?

84
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:32,592
What was what?

85
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,606
We're supposed to stay under the radar.

86
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:38,035
- I doubt if this world possesses such technology.
- See, when he's right, he's right.

87
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:40,298
Sam has a point.
We're not equipped to take these guys on right now.

88
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:44,175
I have no intention of taking anybody on.
I'm just going to pose as a buyer...

89
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:44,893
You?

90
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:49,079
No offense, Jackson, but you do not strike me as
the drug-dealer type. In fact, you're not even close.

91
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:52,249
- I think I'm as close as you are.
- Come on, you're miles away.

92
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,641
Teal'c, which one of us is closer?

93
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:59,506
- I believe the three of you to be equidistant.
- Oh, please! Mary Poppins is not even in the running.

94
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:01,539
And neither are you...

95
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:04,290
because I'm going.

96
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:08,077
I'm just gonna ask some
questions about the operation,

97
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,666
find out what I can,
tell them their price is too high, and then

98
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:13,460
high tail it out of there.

99
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,697
<i>This was a bad idea.</i>

100
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:30,285
It's been four hours now. When do we call this thing?

101
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,233
They are heavily armed.

102
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:48,924
This is the man I told you about, Mr. Shaft.

103
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:50,559
Hey.

104
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:55,543
You must be Worrel.

105
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,453
Where are your friends, Mister?

106
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:01,045
I figured you'd rather deal one-on-one.

107
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:02,899
Call me Shaft.

108
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:05,651
Who told you kassa was grown here?

109
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,281
In my business, you get to know the right people.

110
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,598
What right people?

111
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:12,189
You know, the good, hardworking type

112
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:15,219
tell you what you want to know and then disappear.

113
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:25,585
You can go.

114
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:30,409
We'll talk inside.

115
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:32,522
Great.

116
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:37,188
If we remain here, we will be discovered.

117
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:39,182
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

118
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,259
Fellows...

119
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:53,614
do you think I'd carry a weapon?

120
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:55,089
Enough.

121
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:57,840
Alright, Mister.

122
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,555
What can I do for you?

123
00:09:00,552 --> 00:09:07,609
I represent a coalition of seven planets with a
combined population of 30 million kassa-hungry souls.

124
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:09,603
We're looking for a supplier.

125
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,238
I don't have that kind of inventory.

126
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:13,271
Nah, nobody does.
That's why I need more than one.

127
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:15,543
- So, if you could just refer me...
- Refer you?

128
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,779
Higher up.

129
00:09:18,115 --> 00:09:20,547
So you wish to speak to my superior?

130
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:23,538
I think our needs are big
enough to warrant his attention.

131
00:09:24,415 --> 00:09:25,651
Your needs?

132
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:31,791
Ooh, that didn't look good.

133
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,260
- Just exactly who do you think you are?
- I already told you my name.

134
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:36,057
"Mister?"

135
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:38,887
Actually, it's just "Shaft." "Mister" is more of a

136
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:43,353
courtesy title, so if you could just pass it
along to your superiors, that's all I'm asking.

137
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:45,785
I'm forced to wonder what someone like yourself...

138
00:09:45,905 --> 00:09:47,340
a businessman representing...

139
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:49,334
- how many planets did you say again?
- Seven,

140
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:53,859
- but one of 'em is actually a moon, so...
- So, 30 million potential customers,

141
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:56,869
and you need me
to arrange a meeting with my superior?

142
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,284
See, now,

143
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:00,477
you're selling yourself short.

144
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:08,650
Yeah, I think he's in trouble.

145
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,272
As are we.

146
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:45,371
- What did you say to them?
- Look, obviously it didn't go so well.

147
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:10,429
Guys?

148
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,223
What's taking so long?

149
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,612
We've got a problem!

150
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:18,084
Just hurry up and open the damned...

151
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,610
Gate.

152
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,760
Okay. Here's an obvious question...

153
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,112
You're surrounded!
Drop your weapons.

154
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:06,586
<i>Chevron four encoded.</i>

155
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,978
Chief, how long are they overdue now?

156
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:09,944
Two hours, Sir.

157
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:11,789
Colonel Mitchell's never missed a check-in.

158
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,480
Chevron five encoded.

159
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,976
General Landry, Sir?

160
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,709
I just spoke with Dr. Lee.

161
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:20,460
He's determined that the plant contains
a highly addictive psychostimulant...

162
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,534
Which just confirms what we already knew.

163
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:26,351
But we didn't know it as engineered,
which means it didn't evolve naturally.

164
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:27,836
Chevron six encoded.

165
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:37,006
- Chevron seven will not lock.
- Why not?

166
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:39,399
I don't know, Sir. I'm not showing
any malfunction at this end.

167
00:12:39,438 --> 00:12:42,110
- Run a diagnostic and try again.
- Yes, Sir.

168
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:50,383
The infamous SG-1.

169
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,337
Everybody, this is Worrel.

170
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,170
Trust me, Mister,

171
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,045
you won't get the best of me again.

172
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:57,799
Actually, it's Mitchell. Cameron Mitchell.

173
00:12:57,838 --> 00:12:59,802
I tried to explain the "Mister" thing.

174
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,885
- I don't think he gets it.
- How did you steal the Stargate?

175
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:03,630
What?

176
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,826
SG-1 shows up on my little backwater
planet, and the Stargate vanishes.

177
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:09,182
I'm not a fool.

178
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:10,498
<i>Perhaps not.</i>

179
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:12,272
But we are not responsible.

180
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:14,665
We were here on a reconnaissance mission.

181
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:17,864
So you were done slaying System Lords

182
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:20,704
and decided to move on to
more pressing agricultural concerns?

183
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,937
That's exactly it. Corn patrol.

184
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:26,815
Oh, I have a question.

185
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:31,530
Why would we make the Gate magically disappear
before we had a chance to escape through it?

186
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:32,566
Bad timing?

187
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:34,998
That's got to be the single
stupidest thing I've ever heard.

188
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:38,307
Do things always go according to
plan in your world, Dr. Jackson?

189
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:42,135
No. Not usually, no.

190
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:44,567
Then I would guess
this is another one of those times.

191
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,272
And until my Stargate is returned...

192
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:51,704
things will continue to go wrong.

193
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:59,179
We've made repeated attempts to connect, Sir.

194
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,854
There's no signal whatsoever.

195
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:02,797
It's got to be a problem with the offworld Gate.

196
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:05,877
- Get me colonel Emerson on board the Odyssey.
- Yes, Sir. Right away.

197
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:19,095
- Sir, I have general Landry for you.
- On screen.

198
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:21,536
Colonel, how goes the shakedown?

199
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:24,138
90% of our primary systems are up and running, Sir.

200
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:25,055
Care to take a ride?

201
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:26,371
Another time.

202
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:30,318
I just need you to tell me that
your hyperdrive is part of that 90%.

203
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,710
We've lost contact with SG-1.

204
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:35,481
They were on P6G-452.

205
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,874
Estimate 22 hours, Sir.

206
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:43,106
I wouldn't want to go into battle just yet, but I think
we can reach 452 and extract SG-1 inside of a day.

207
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,073
Glad to hear it.

208
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:46,305
I assume they have the new locator chip implants?

209
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:49,077
They were the first, after the events on Tegalus.

210
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:53,094
I can't think of a better first operational
mission for the Odyssey than to bring home SG-1.

211
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:54,539
Neither can I, Colonel.

212
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:56,373
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Sir.

213
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:57,689
Landry out.

214
00:14:58,486 --> 00:15:01,317
Major Marks, set a course for P6G-452.

215
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:02,533
Yes, Sir.

216
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,281
Attention, all decks. This is Emerson.

217
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,434
Prepare to engage hyperdrive.

218
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:11,624
Take us out.

219
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:13,178
With pleasure, Sir.

220
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:27,173
Seriously.

221
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:32,237
Why would we take the Stargate away
before we had a chance to escape through it?
And don't say "bad timing."

222
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:35,865
Are things continuing
to go wrong for you, Dr. Jackson?

223
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:38,407
It's within your power to change that.

224
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:41,247
Torturing us is not going to get
you the answer you're looking for.

225
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,201
I don't want to torture you.

226
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,989
In fact, if you tell me the location of
the Stargate, I'm prepared to release you.

227
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,291
Oh, you are not.

228
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:52,410
- I can't... can you believe he just said that?
- You've already blown your chance.

229
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,644
Whoever took your Stargate is long gone.

230
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:58,631
And when your superiors discover that
you have let the real thieves escape,

231
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:01,063
it is you who will be tortured.

232
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,765
Someone is stealing Stargates?

233
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:09,635
Well, four that we know of, Sir,
according to the Tok'ra dispatch.

234
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:13,702
Which could explain why we haven't
been able to dial 452 and contact SG-1.

235
00:16:13,742 --> 00:16:14,659
Exactly, Sir.

236
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,011
In fact, the Trust tried this once with our Gate.

237
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:22,273
Isn't any Goa'uld mothership or similar
class vessel capable of taking a Gate?

238
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:26,819
Not with Asgard beaming technology,
which one eye-witness apparently
confirmed is the method being used.

239
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,783
Send an encrypted databurst of all available
intel to colonel Emerson on board the Odyssey.

240
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,259
- Yes, Sir.
- Oh, and chief?

241
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:35,571
Call Peterson Air Base.

242
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:37,982
I need to take a little trip to Area 51.

243
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:38,860
Right away, Sir.

244
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:57,718
General.

245
00:16:58,276 --> 00:16:59,990
They told me you were coming,

246
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,625
but I didn't believe them.

247
00:17:01,665 --> 00:17:02,582
I said,

248
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,256
"I don't believe you."

249
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,207
Well, here I am.

250
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:15,978
You come to visit
a condemned prisoner empty-handed?

251
00:17:16,058 --> 00:17:18,371
You're not a condemned prisoner, Nerus.

252
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:23,234
But if you tell me what I need to know...

253
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,062
I'll arrange a feast,

254
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:30,850
the likes of which you have not seen
since you set foot on this planet.

255
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:32,724
Feast?

256
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:35,395
I do not use the word lightly.

257
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:37,389
Nor do I.

258
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:41,694
How may I be of service, my dear General?

259
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,127
Someone out there is stealing Stargates.

260
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:47,177
<i>I need to know who, how, and why.</i>

261
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:48,174
Stealing them?

262
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:51,882
Beamed right off the planets with
Asgard technology, as far as we know.

263
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:54,114
Well, that must be maddening for you.

264
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:56,746
It is.

265
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:02,766
- I already have an idea who it might be.
- Well, if you're so smart,

266
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:04,322
what do you need me for?

267
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:05,417
I have a theory.

268
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,172
I still need some answers.

269
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:12,754
But such a quandary must be worth more to you
than a single, solitary indulgent meal.

270
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:15,265
Perhaps we could discuss my...

271
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:21,007
- dietary requirements on a more permanent...
- Every minute you waste trying to negotiate,

272
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:23,798
I take one item off the menu.

273
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,360
Can we talk over appetizers?

274
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:37,514
General!

275
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:50,153
Look, for what it's worth, guys,

276
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:52,744
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

277
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,458
Oh, it happens all the time.

278
00:18:58,924 --> 00:19:00,479
Ah, my friend...

279
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:04,725
You wear the furrowed brow of a...

280
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:06,799
deeply worried man.

281
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:08,871
How's your day going?

282
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:10,904
We've been recalled by the Alliance.

283
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:14,233
Well, you can't say we didn't tell you so.

284
00:19:14,493 --> 00:19:16,168
It is far worse news for you.

285
00:19:16,526 --> 00:19:19,198
I no longer have any reason to keep you alive.

286
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:21,789
No, wait, I... can think of a reason...

287
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,135
We're more valuable alive.

288
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:28,607
Yes, we're more valuable alive. Good one.

289
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,637
No.

290
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:35,026
My instructions were quite clear.

291
00:19:36,062 --> 00:19:38,336
Take care of Mr. Shaft last.

292
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:40,808
I want him to watch the others go first.

293
00:19:42,283 --> 00:19:47,107
Your deaths will serve as a warning to your people
never to meddle with our operations in the future.

294
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:01,759
General.

295
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:05,715
<i>This chicken is most plump and delicious.</i>

296
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:08,675
<i>- You spoil me, General!
- It's called turkey.</i>

297
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:11,905
<i>- Turkey?
- Another rare delicacy.</i>

298
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,895
Well, I must have more turkey!

299
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:17,726
What's this?

300
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:21,155
- I'm losing patience, Nerus.
- Well, you already know who it is.

301
00:20:21,295 --> 00:20:24,923
- So it is Ba'al?
- Of course it's Ba'al. Who else would it be?

302
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:26,079
Why is he doing it?

303
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:29,628
You're the genius. You tell me.

304
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:33,615
Ah, maybe there's no need to go
into the third and fourth courses.

305
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,047
No, General, no, no, no, no...

306
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:38,438
<i>I meant that as
the most sincere form of flattery.</i>

307
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,585
You are one of the more intelligent human beings
I have ever had the pleasure of meeting

308
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:44,379
and I assure you, General,

309
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:48,247
that this meal has just begun.

310
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:51,118
I'm glad to hear that.

311
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:59,591
Hey, the other three had nothing to do with this.
I was running the operation.

312
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,348
Cam...

313
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:01,783
Worrel knows this.

314
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,378
Tell him to get back here.

315
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:13,345
SG-1...

316
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:16,096
I'm colonel Paul Emerson.

317
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:18,887
Welcome aboard the Odyssey.

318
00:21:19,764 --> 00:21:20,921
Thank you, Sir.

319
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,392
- How about that timing, Jackson?
- Good timing.

320
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:26,542
Airman, let's get these people out of
these bindings and to the infirmary.

321
00:21:39,202 --> 00:21:39,799
Sir.

322
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,713
I know you people have been through a lot...

323
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:43,946
Yeah, we'll live. Hand it over.

324
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,773
We received this intel from
Stargate Command a few hours ago.

325
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:52,079
Damn, Ba'al's been busy.

326
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:55,548
He's been gathering up Stargates from
all over the sector for the last several weeks.

327
00:21:55,588 --> 00:21:57,421
Yeah, we saw one of them disappear.

328
00:21:57,462 --> 00:21:58,578
Do we know why?

329
00:21:58,657 --> 00:21:59,455
Not yet.

330
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:00,931
Nor do we know where he is.

331
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,446
What of the Lucian Alliance?

332
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:06,153
For the moment, General Landry
considers this our top priority.

333
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:07,868
Where's he getting his intel?

334
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:09,901
Nerus.

335
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:13,330
Oh... jimdandy.

336
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,160
Such intelligence cannot be considered reliable.

337
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,257
I'm not sure.

338
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:20,756
Nerus did work for Ba'al for centuries.
It's a good place as any to start.

339
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:23,796
And general Landry can be pretty
persuasive when he needs to be.

340
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,348
Nerus, you have the most atrocious
table manners of any person I've ever met.

341
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:30,912
Oh, General, please.

342
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:34,541
You forget that, despite appearances,

343
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,352
- I am not human.
- Oh, my goodness.

344
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:40,561
Why does Ba'al want a dozen Stargates?

345
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,107
Nerus?

346
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:47,898
Dessert!

347
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:53,160
Young man, you have positively read my mind!
Come in, come in.

348
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,191
Make room for dessert!

349
00:22:56,868 --> 00:22:58,782
Just put... Ooh, what are...?

350
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:05,759
Individually frosted cakes!

351
00:23:07,872 --> 00:23:08,511
<i>Well,</i>

352
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,660
you're so clever you figured out the perpetrator.
What do you think?

353
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,687
We assume he intends to offer them back
to the planets he's stolen them from.

354
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,199
In exchange for some form of payment.

355
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:20,272
You're not very intelligent, are you, General?

356
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:22,086
Sorry to disappoint you.

357
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:27,150
Well, you're just thinking too small, that's all.
You've got to think more like a Goa'uld.

358
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:32,173
What is it...

359
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,642
that Ba'al once had?

360
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,114
<i>Think of it.</i>

361
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,546
Now think...

362
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:43,776
of what he has lost.

363
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,805
He's starting over.

364
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:47,902
Precisely.

365
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:48,740
See?

366
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:50,933
There's still hope for you yet.

367
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:54,521
See, some time ago, Ba'al came to me,

368
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,072
looking for a way to rebuild,

369
00:23:57,232 --> 00:24:01,817
in the event that the Jaffa ever
succeeded in conquering the Goa'uld.

370
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:05,246
Now, I had been studying the
Stargate system for months...

371
00:24:05,286 --> 00:24:08,595
to help you defeat the Replicators, incidentally...

372
00:24:08,634 --> 00:24:13,938
and I stumbled upon a way to disable
the correlative update program.

373
00:24:13,977 --> 00:24:15,572
So you could move a Stargate

374
00:24:15,612 --> 00:24:18,363
and not have it transmit its new position
to the rest of the network.

375
00:24:18,503 --> 00:24:19,660
Precisely.

376
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,051
So it would seem that Ba'al

377
00:24:22,091 --> 00:24:24,802
has put my research into practice.

378
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:26,038
Which leads us

379
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,872
- to where?
- I

380
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,026
have a theory,

381
00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:34,132
General, but no assortment of

382
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:36,006
cheeses,

383
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:40,590
however delicious,
could possibly compel me to tell you that.

384
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,186
What did you have in mind?

385
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:43,581
My freedom.

386
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:44,976
Absolutely not.

387
00:24:46,372 --> 00:24:51,356
Once he has set the program,
it will be impossible to detect.

388
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:54,067
Your freedom just isn't on the table, Nerus,

389
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:56,539
but I'm sure there is something else we could offer.

390
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,133
My dear General,

391
00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:02,021
I rarely say this,

392
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:04,812
so please take it to heart when I say

393
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:06,406
that, for the moment,

394
00:25:07,603 --> 00:25:08,959
I'm full.

395
00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:32,621
What were you thinking, Worrel?

396
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:33,977
Please don't kill me.

397
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:35,811
Why would I do that?

398
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:38,961
<i>- The last time I heard you say
that to someone, they...
- I'm just stunned</i>

399
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:42,380
that you would honestly believe
that SG-1 would steal the Gate

400
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,383
and trap themselves on the planet.

401
00:25:44,782 --> 00:25:46,257
Well... I...

402
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:50,962
You had them for almost two days,
and you learned nothing.

403
00:25:52,157 --> 00:25:55,148
And now two-thirds of our crop will rot uselessly.

404
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:58,139
- If we could bring in cargo ships...
- Cargo ships?

405
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,923
Do you have any idea
how many it would actually take?

406
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,176
I promise I will avenge this.

407
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:06,930
Don't worry about SG-1

408
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,405
and Earth.

409
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:11,595
They are of little consequence.

410
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:14,386
We have spies all over the galaxy.

411
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:20,865
Find out who really took
the Stargate and get it back...

412
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:25,151
or don't bother returning yourself.

413
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:27,642
Yes, Netan.

414
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:35,337
<i>I trust you're all packed.</i>

415
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:37,769
Yes, with a sizable assortment of...

416
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:39,305
what do you call them?

417
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:40,341
Cupcakes.

418
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,298
Yes!

419
00:26:41,537 --> 00:26:45,086
A most generous point to concede
in our negotiation, General.

420
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:47,678
- Consider it a going-away present.
- Well, I'm touched.

421
00:26:47,717 --> 00:26:51,864
Yes, well, I admit it took some convincing.

422
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:55,253
Well, superiors can sometimes be difficult.

423
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:57,645
They do have reason not to trust you.

424
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,037
Yes, but... but you did...

425
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:03,227
you did convince them that it was a fair bargain?

426
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:06,416
Me giving the coordinates for my freedom?

427
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:09,407
Unless, of course,

428
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,799
you don't intend to honor...

429
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:14,690
I think you know by now I'm a man of my word.

430
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:16,883
Well, yes, of course you are.

431
00:27:16,922 --> 00:27:19,474
Then you should have
no trouble believing me when I say

432
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:24,259
that if you're lying about these coordinates,
there will be nowhere in this galaxy for you to hide.

433
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:25,574
I... I believe you.

434
00:27:25,614 --> 00:27:26,650
I'm glad.

435
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:30,039
Farewell!

436
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:44,095
Putz.

437
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:48,281
Should I dial the coordinates he left, Sir?

438
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,071
No, it's probably a black hole, or worse.

439
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:56,852
If I've learned one thing in this command, it's never
to trust a Goa'uld, especially if his name is Nerus.

440
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,747
Yes, Sir.

441
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,315
Come in.

442
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:11,804
Sir, we're picking up a
subspace signal from the beacon.

443
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:14,196
- That was fast.
- Yes, Sir. It looks like you were right.

444
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:15,621
He went back to Ba'al.

445
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:17,784
Send the coordinates to Odyssey, A.S.A.P.

446
00:28:17,824 --> 00:28:18,940
Yes, Sir.

447
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:21,652
Sir, if you don't mind my asking...

448
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:24,163
How did we plant the beacon on Nerus?

449
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:25,659
Yes, Sir.

450
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:27,952
It was a piece of cake.

451
00:28:39,713 --> 00:28:40,510
Sir?

452
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,401
I'm receiving a subspace transmission from SGC.

453
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,195
It's a set of coordinates.

454
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:46,192
Ba'al.

455
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,584
General Landry's indeed persuasive.

456
00:28:49,282 --> 00:28:51,076
Colonel, is the Odyssey ready to fight?

457
00:28:51,116 --> 00:28:55,262
Our shields have only been tested in simulations,
but our weapons and navigation are online.

458
00:28:55,302 --> 00:28:56,858
Let's take him down.

459
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:13,104
How nice!

460
00:29:13,144 --> 00:29:16,095
You came to greet me in person.

461
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:20,081
Oh, oh! I have this fabulous
innovation I want you to...

462
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:22,075
it's called a "cupcake."

463
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:23,471
It's so good...

464
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,461
Why have you returned?

465
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,950
My old friend, you wound me deeply.

466
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:33,139
I am capable of wounding you much more deeply.

467
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:36,627
I thought you made yourself
quite comfortable with the Tau'ri.

468
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:38,720
Or was it the Ori?

469
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:41,910
You actually believe that...

470
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,701
that I would defect to the Ori?

471
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:51,300
No, no. It was a temporary lapse of judgment,
I admit,

472
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,306
but...

473
00:29:52,316 --> 00:29:55,266
I have never, in my...

474
00:29:55,306 --> 00:30:00,649
in my life ever
wavered one iota in my devotion for you...

475
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:02,443
Sire.

476
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:10,218
Are you certain you were not followed?

477
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:13,208
I am a genius, you know.

478
00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:15,202
So you insist.

479
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:20,185
Yes, and so I have proven in my
service to you time and time again.

480
00:30:21,182 --> 00:30:24,292
Do you know how many Stargates
I had to go through to get here?

481
00:30:24,332 --> 00:30:24,970
Five

482
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:26,196
Stargates!

483
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:29,884
And that kind and naive general promised me...

484
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,844
anyway, he gave me
his word that he wouldn't follow me.

485
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:38,327
If you wish to return to my court,
Nerus, you shall have to prove yourself.

486
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:41,197
- How?
- Find me planets suitable for my new empire.

487
00:30:41,238 --> 00:30:45,104
- I am ready to begin anew.
- Well, first I must recover from my...

488
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,500
harrowing

489
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:48,693
ordeal.

490
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,680
It would be wise not to defy me, Nerus.

491
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:56,866
Things have changed considerably since you left.

492
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,644
From what little we know of Ba'al's ship,

493
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:06,774
there's only one cargo hold
big enough to store the Stargates

494
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:07,651
and that's here.

495
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:09,087
We beam onto the ship,

496
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:11,200
make our way to the cargo hold and

497
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,911
- tag the Gates with these suckers.
- Locator beacons.

498
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:16,502
They only operate through subspace,
so they shouldn't be detected.

499
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:20,210
Once we lock on to their signal, we beam back
the Gates, beam ourselves out, and hopefully be gone

500
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,586
before Ba'al knows the difference.

501
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:24,178
But won't Ba'al be able to detect the Odyssey?

502
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,969
And even if they don't,
how do you beam through his shields?

503
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:29,560
Let's just say that's been taken into consideration.

504
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,495
Oh, dear.

505
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:54,478
General Landry had Dr. Lee program
a virus into several of Nerus' devices.

506
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,067
As soon as he interfaces one of them with the ship,
it should kill all their systems...

507
00:31:58,107 --> 00:32:00,499
<i>- shields, sensors, weapons...
- Colonel Emerson,</i>

508
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:03,051
<i>this is flight deck.
We're coming out of hyperspace now, Sir.</i>

509
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,643
Understood. We're on our way.

510
00:32:10,626 --> 00:32:12,021
Ba'al's ship should be dead ahead, Sir.

511
00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:13,437
Have they detected us?

512
00:32:13,477 --> 00:32:16,706
Negative, Sir, but I am receiving
a subspace locator code.

513
00:32:16,746 --> 00:32:19,099
It was programmed to transmit
when the virus went active.

514
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:21,490
Nerus didn't waste time for a change.

515
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:25,029
What is happening?

516
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,913
All our systems have failed.

517
00:32:27,391 --> 00:32:28,508
How can that be?

518
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:32,016
I have limited power back online.

519
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:36,044
It looks like the systems are being
disrupted from within the ship.

520
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:48,383
Come with me.

521
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:10,651
This way.

522
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,034
We're in.

523
00:33:16,592 --> 00:33:19,422
Understood. We will hold the
station within beaming range.

524
00:33:29,828 --> 00:33:31,144
Oh. Hello.

525
00:33:31,284 --> 00:33:33,477
Oh, it's just a teeny tiny virus.

526
00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:35,549
<i>I'm sure I can eradicate it in short order</i>

527
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:38,561
<i>as soon as I regain control of the terminal.</i>

528
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:40,096
Oh, general,

529
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,344
you're a lot more devious than
I thought you were. You disappoint me.

530
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:46,654
I'll... I'll keep you informed.

531
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:48,010
Thank you.

532
00:33:59,732 --> 00:34:01,247
Oh, here you are again.

533
00:34:01,884 --> 00:34:04,237
Oh, well, I don't think that...

534
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:07,666
that shooting the console will help,
but you can try.

535
00:34:08,723 --> 00:34:10,397
Oh. I see.

536
00:34:13,546 --> 00:34:16,297
I don't suppose there's anything I can say.

537
00:34:20,803 --> 00:34:22,996
But I'm so interesting.

538
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,404
We have an intruder on the ship.

539
00:35:03,344 --> 00:35:04,341
Oh, boy.

540
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,567
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... twelve...
- We're going to need more locators.

541
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:17,518
Colonel Mitchell.

542
00:35:19,153 --> 00:35:20,229
Company!

543
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:23,898
Ideas?

544
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:41,122
Houston, we have a problem.

545
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,959
What is it?

546
00:35:43,473 --> 00:35:44,031
Sir!

547
00:35:44,231 --> 00:35:46,264
Another three motherships
just dropped out of hyperspace.

548
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,023
What?

549
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,378
Intercepting a hail, Sir.

550
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:51,786
<i>Ha'tak vessel, this is Netan of the Lucian Alliance.</i>

551
00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:54,418
<i>Surrender now or you will be destroyed.</i>

552
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,618
Lucian Alliance,

553
00:36:06,837 --> 00:36:07,963
this is colonel Emerson,

554
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:10,326
commander of the Earth vessel Odyssey.
Please respond.

555
00:36:10,644 --> 00:36:12,399
Sir, they've powered up weapons.

556
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:14,273
Target appears to be Ba'al's ship.

557
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,901
SG-1, this is Odyssey. What's your status?

558
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:28,626
Jackson, a little help!

559
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,484
Our position has been compromised,

560
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:38,155
but we're attempting to proceed with the mission.

561
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:40,467
Be advised, the Lucian Alliance just showed up.

562
00:36:40,507 --> 00:36:42,660
You can't go up against all
of them with an untested ship.

563
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,172
<i>They're targeting Ba'al's ship.
We got to get you out of there now.</i>

564
00:36:45,212 --> 00:36:47,285
That's a negative. I'm still tagging the Gates.

565
00:36:47,644 --> 00:36:50,674
<i>Colonel, without shields, Ba'al's ship
won't be able to withstand anything.</i>

566
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:52,588
We know. Thank you.
SG-1 out.

567
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:03,532
Status?

568
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:08,237
Managed to restore sensors and communications.

569
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,788
I am detecting four other ships in close proximity.

570
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:11,686
What?

571
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,680
We're being hailed.

572
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,510
Put them on screen.

573
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:21,135
This is Netan of the Lucian Alliance.

574
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,687
You have cargo that belongs to us.

575
00:37:23,726 --> 00:37:25,959
You will surrender it and your ship now.

576
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,670
You are in no position to make such demands.

577
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:31,063
You have no shields and no weapons.

578
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:33,894
Surrender immediately or prepare to be boarded.

579
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:36,086
Go ahead and try.

580
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:39,515
Fire on them.

581
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,425
Target weapons and hyperdrive engines.

582
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:51,755
Get me my shields!

583
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:54,307
Sir, the Lucian Alliance vessel has opened fire.

584
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:56,779
SG-1, stand by for extraction.

585
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,347
I'm attaching the last beacon now. Go!

586
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,022
Activating transport.

587
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:09,637
I have managed to restore shields.

588
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:10,754
Sir?

589
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:12,388
We've got a problem.

590
00:38:13,106 --> 00:38:15,060
Ba'al's shields just went back up.
You're going to have to sit tight.

591
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:16,654
We can't sit for long!

592
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:18,449
Fall back.

593
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:33,160
Bring us about.

594
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,832
Captain, fire forward rail guns at the lead ship.

595
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:39,400
It looks like we're going to be testing our shields.

596
00:38:47,573 --> 00:38:48,930
Evasive.
Report.

597
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:51,082
Shields are holding, but down 11%, Sir.

598
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,677
<i>The Lucian Alliance ship shows minimal damage.</i>

599
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:54,342
What about Ba'al's ship?
Can we get them out of there yet?

600
00:38:54,352 --> 00:38:55,268
Negative, Sir.

601
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:57,979
Last mag.

602
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,445
Alright, we need to find another way off this boat.

603
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:06,772
Carter?

604
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,167
I have an idea.

605
00:39:08,486 --> 00:39:09,203
Nice.

606
00:39:09,244 --> 00:39:10,678
Jaffa.

607
00:39:11,117 --> 00:39:12,393
Covering fire.

608
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:16,480
Forget weapons.

609
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,075
Bring our hyperdrive online.

610
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:22,341
My Lord, I'm showing imminent shield failure.

611
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,730
- Sir, Ba'al's ship just lost shields.
- Get them out of there now.

612
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:27,883
Hangar deck, report.

613
00:39:27,962 --> 00:39:29,837
<i>Sir, we've got all the Gates but one.</i>

614
00:39:29,876 --> 00:39:31,591
<i>We couldn't get a lock on its beacon.</i>

615
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,746
What about SG-1?

616
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,903
<i>Negative, Sir.</i>

617
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,904
Ba'al's ship has been destroyed.

618
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,296
Concentrate all weapons fire on the Earth vessel.

619
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:52,363
All three Lucian Alliance vessels
are targeting us now, Sir.

620
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:54,994
Engage hyperdrive.

621
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:14,192
Glad to see you.

622
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:16,983
I'm a little surprised
to see you come through the Gate.

623
00:40:17,022 --> 00:40:21,966
Colonel Carter successfully reprogrammed
one of the DHDs in Ba'al's cargo
hold so that we could in fact escape.

624
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:23,094
Well done.

625
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:25,774
With your permission, Sir, we should let
the Odyssey know that we're okay.

626
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:27,090
They probably fear the worst.

627
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,057
The worst?

628
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:31,177
That we were blown up with Ba'al's ship
in the Lucian Alliance's attack, Sir.

629
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:33,010
So the Stargates were destroyed?

630
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,340
No, hopefully, the Odyssey managed
to beam the Gates off in time.

631
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:38,951
An eventful few days.

632
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,225
Debrief in one hour.

633
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:45,630
We have got the best jobs in the world, don't we?

634
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:47,783
I'm gonna hit the shower.

635
00:40:48,381 --> 00:40:50,214
I'm gonna find a doctor.

636
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,202
We are indeed suitably employed.

637
00:40:56,793 --> 00:40:58,986
Yeah, it was a good day.
