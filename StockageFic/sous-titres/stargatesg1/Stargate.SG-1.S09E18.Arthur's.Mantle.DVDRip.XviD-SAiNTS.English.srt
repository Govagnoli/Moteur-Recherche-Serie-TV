1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:02,384
<i>Previously,</i>

2
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:03,901
<i>on Stargate SG-1...</i>

3
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:04,785
Merlin?

4
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:07,715
"King Arthur and the knights
of the round table" Merlin?

5
00:00:07,857 --> 00:00:08,372
Yes.

6
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:10,191
- Was an Ancient?
- I think so.

7
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:13,369
What does this have to do with where
this alleged treasure is buried?

8
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:15,798
<i>Certain threads point to
the knights of the round table</i>

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,133
<i>gathering great treasures from
the far corners of Arthur's domain,</i>

10
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,645
<i>and hiding them in a magical stronghold at Avalon.</i>

11
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:31,248
<i>All free Jaffa have always had the greatest
respect for the warriors of the Sodan.</i>

12
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,211
Granting my freedom changes nothing, Mitchell.

13
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,252
We will meet again.

14
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:58,959
You are still working on that thing.

15
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,220
Oh, hi.

16
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:03,221
Did you sleep here last night?

17
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,149
Of course not.

18
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:07,010
I slept down the hall in my quarters.

19
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,829
Sam...

20
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:11,638
This device was recovered from
the cave under Glastonbury.

21
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:13,567
Who knows what Ancient secrets it may hold?

22
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:15,344
Well, obviously not you.

23
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,157
<i>Or Dr. Lee, who's been working on
that thing for, what, six months?</i>

24
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:23,809
I think it's time we let the eggheads
at Area 51 take a crack at it.

25
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:24,653
Not yet.

26
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:27,306
I'm actually making some progress here.

27
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:29,859
That's what you said last night.

28
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:32,695
And I'm hankering for hash browns so,

29
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:34,889
let's go grab some breakfast.

30
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,083
This is interesting.

31
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:42,238
This is the first time one of my verification scans
kicked back a positive result.

32
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:45,031
Does this mean I'm not getting my hash browns?

33
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,711
It means this device is interactive.

34
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:52,374
I'm reading an E.M. output that keeps fluctuating
between high and low frequencies.

35
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:54,066
I'm gonna try to stabilize it.

36
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:54,758
Sure.

37
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:56,145
What have you got to lose?

38
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:14,858
Season 9 - Episode 18
Arthur's Mantle

39
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:13,877
You okay?

40
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:15,518
Yeah, fine.

41
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:17,278
What just happened?

42
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:24,160
Nicely done.

43
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,201
Can you read that?

44
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:28,202
My Ancient's a little rusty.

45
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,962
Right. We need Jackson.

46
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:33,724
Hey, Bill, good timing.

47
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:34,724
Take a look at this.

48
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:47,768
Yo, doc, amazing discovery over here.

49
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,289
Bill, you okay?

50
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,570
Oh! What the hell?

51
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,453
What was that?

52
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:02,773
I don't know.

53
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:10,336
Okay, you're solid.

54
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:17,258
<i>It's the device.</i>

55
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:21,580
By initiating it, we must've triggered
some sort of localized effect...

56
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,741
"Local" meaning you and me?

57
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:25,541
Yeah.

58
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,502
Try picking up that coffee cup.

59
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:37,345
Oh, boy.

60
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:38,705
We need to find Daniel.

61
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,546
"Out of phase?" What does that mean?

62
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:43,027
It means we may have shifted
to an alternate dimension.

63
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,907
And there are an infinite number
of alternate dimensions.

64
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:46,588
No, no, no, that's alternate realities.

65
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:50,229
- So when the other SG-1s showed up...
- Completely different problem.

66
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:53,550
See, according to M-theory,
that unites the five superstring theories,

67
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,230
there are several spatial dimensions...

68
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:59,792
eleven, actually, that exist in parallel
with our physical reality.

69
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,433
<i>- Now, these higher dimensions...
- No, I'll take your word for it.</i>

70
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:05,033
That was alternate reality.
This is alternate dimension.

71
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:09,075
Hell, all I need is a good time-travel adventure
and I've scored the SG-1 trifecta.

72
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:10,675
Now, how is Jackson supposed to help us with this?

73
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:13,597
Well, a similar thing happened
to him a few years ago.

74
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:18,037
PX7-377 the Crystal Skull!

75
00:05:18,178 --> 00:05:21,499
You really did read every report from
every mission we ever went on, didn't you?

76
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,500
I was in that hospital a long time,
and they were all riveting.

77
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:27,241
Anyway, when Daniel was out of phase,
nobody could see him,

78
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:29,841
except for his grandfather,
Nicholas Ballard.

79
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:33,002
And because the same thing
happened to Ballard in Belize,

80
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:35,083
Jackson should be able to see us

81
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:36,444
because we're all part of the same club.

82
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:37,485
Right.

83
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:39,285
Perfect.

84
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,008
Teal'c, have you seen colonel Mitchell?

85
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:49,328
I have not.

86
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:51,088
I'm gonna need to talk to your team.

87
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:56,170
SG-12 just got back from P8T-474
and it looks like we may have a timeline

88
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,291
for whatever it is the Priors are planning.

89
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,132
According to the natives,

90
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,693
this "doomsday" the Priors keep talking about...

91
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,293
may be only days away.

92
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:07,694
I will inform the others.

93
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:18,338
Jackson... just the guy to help us
with a little problem.

94
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:22,419
Or not.

95
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,421
The dimension we're occupying must be
different from the one he was shifted to.

96
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,022
Alternate alternate dimensions?

97
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:31,902
Something like that, yeah.

98
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,503
Okay. So, what do we do?

99
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:39,384
We have to find a way to communicate with them.

100
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:42,065
Any ideas?

101
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:44,626
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation!</i>

102
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:51,068
What have we got?

103
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:52,349
No I.D.C, Sir, but

104
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:54,069
I am receiving a radio signal.

105
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,110
Let's hear it.

106
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:00,512
What's wrong with it?

107
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:02,572
<i>Sounds like harmonic
distortion in the data stream.</i>

108
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:03,533
I'm not sure, Sir.

109
00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:04,582
<i>Can you clean it up?</i>

110
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:05,553
I can try, Sir.

111
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:13,356
Okay, that sounded like something hitting the iris.

112
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:15,317
Any way to know for sure what it was?

113
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:16,637
<i>We can run some tests.</i>

114
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:17,717
Do it.

115
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:20,118
And get Colonel Carter down here
to help unscramble that message.

116
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:21,238
Yes, Sir.

117
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:31,922
I can't make heads or tails of this.

118
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:34,962
That's because the filter coefficient
has to be adaptive.

119
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,084
The filter coefficient has to be adaptive.

120
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:41,284
Hey, wait a minute...

121
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:42,325
There you go.

122
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:44,565
Notice the slight variance in the output.

123
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,007
Notice it...

124
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,768
Come on! Notice it!

125
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:53,128
Never mind.

126
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:01,051
What do you mean, they're missing?

127
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:04,812
They are not in their quarters, nor are they
responding to any attempt to contact them.

128
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:06,693
Is it possible they aren't even on the base?

129
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,894
We checked the front gate.
Neither of them signed out.

130
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:10,294
What about security footage?

131
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:13,335
We're reviewing tapes for both
the labs and the cafeteria,

132
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,336
but beyond that, well, there are...

133
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:18,137
hundreds of cameras and hours of tape, so...

134
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:19,938
Then we'll screen them all if we have to.

135
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,738
I want them found.

136
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,940
Why am I getting
that Patrick Swayze in Ghost feeling?

137
00:08:33,862 --> 00:08:34,782
<i>General.</i>

138
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,743
We need a Whoopi.

139
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:46,146
Walter.

140
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:48,747
- We managed to clean up the message, Sir.
- Finally.

141
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,448
<i>We noticed a slight variance in the output,</i>

142
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:54,548
so we ran it through a sequence of
digital filters and we came up with this.

143
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:57,769
<i>Stargate Command...
...the Sodan.</i>

144
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,540
<i>- Please respond...
- Did he say Sodan?</i>

145
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,951
<i>under attack... many have fallen.
We request immediate assistance.</i>

146
00:09:04,352 --> 00:09:06,352
That's when we heard the impact against the iris, Sir.

147
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:08,153
General Landry, we should investigate.

148
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:10,154
Agreed. Assemble a team.

149
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:13,754
Sir, colonel Mitchell is the one who should go.
He's the one who knows the Sodan the best.

150
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:17,356
I agree, but colonel Mitchell isn't here right now.

151
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,558
Oh, hey, have you seen colonel Carter?

152
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,759
- Hey, I was just coming to ask you the same thing.
- Really?

153
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,660
'Cause she left her laptop in my lab.

154
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,190
- She did?
- Yeah, yeah.

155
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,361
It's hooked up to that device
that you picked up in Glastonbury.

156
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:41,664
<i>There she is.</i>

157
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:45,566
Fast forward.

158
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,767
There's colonel Mitchell.

159
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:03,171
What just happened?

160
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:05,472
Looks like the camera went offline.

161
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,473
<i>Probably a power surge.</i>

162
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:13,174
They're gone.

163
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:20,176
Okay, bring up the security camera
for the corridor outside Dr. Lee's lab.

164
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,377
<i>Sync them up to 8:16</i>

165
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:24,878
and run them simultaneously.

166
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:42,083
Okay, if they didn't go through the doorway,

167
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,384
how did they get out of the room?

168
00:10:57,789 --> 00:10:59,829
More staff blasts, just like back at the Gate.

169
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,290
Indeed.

170
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,490
A battle took place here as well.

171
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:07,182
The Sodan have been hiding
here for thousands of years.

172
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:10,993
The only reason we got the transporter codes
is because colonel Mitchell won their trust.

173
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:13,694
I doubt they would've given them to anyone else.

174
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:15,895
And yet evidently they were attacked.

175
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:17,295
By who?

176
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:37,302
My God.

177
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:42,363
Conway, Stevens, get back to the Gate on
the double. Tell SGC we need med teams.

178
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:43,664
Yes, Sir.

179
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,104
Check the area for survivors.

180
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:24,717
Whomever did this knew well
the most efficient way to kill a Jaffa.

181
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,918
Their symbiotes have been targeted.

182
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,319
They were shown no mercy.

183
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:41,923
Haikon.

184
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:47,425
- Pulse is weak.
- He will not survive long.

185
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:48,815
His symbiote is dead.

186
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:49,826
Lieutenant,

187
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:51,627
help me get him into one of these huts.

188
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:54,327
We need to get some tretonin in him, stat.

189
00:12:58,188 --> 00:12:59,429
Roast beef.

190
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:01,630
The one time I can't eat, and they serve...

191
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:05,831
roast beef. Do you know
how many times I've requested roast beef?

192
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:08,231
This is torture.

193
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:10,232
It's only been a few hours.

194
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:12,433
You're not the least bit concerned about this?

195
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,433
No one can see us or hear us. We can't...

196
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:16,985
touch anything, ergo no eating,

197
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:20,035
no drinking, and I'm not gonna speculate
on the other bodily functions.

198
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:23,037
If they don't figure out a way to get us back...

199
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:24,436
They'll figure it out.

200
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,600
What have you got, Doctor?

201
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:36,441
Well...

202
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,662
we know that Sam was working on the device.

203
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:45,744
We know the device does not give off
any typical energy signature emitted by
Ancient transporter technology.

204
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:51,145
This leads us to the conclusion that
they disappeared without leaving the room.

205
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:53,146
How is that possible?

206
00:13:57,148 --> 00:13:58,948
Miniaturization.

207
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:01,149
Don't panic.

208
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:04,770
I have calculated the distance
they could possibly travel on tiny legs,

209
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,051
designated by this roped-off area.

210
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,252
All we have to do is find them.

211
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,852
Ronald, start with section 1-A.

212
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:24,056
I was unable to locate any other survivors.

213
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:27,658
What is his condition?

214
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:29,658
We don't know if the tretonin is going to take.

215
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:30,819
Even then,

216
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:33,259
his injuries are pretty severe.

217
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,060
Without a symbiote...

218
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:38,061
<i>Volnek...</i>

219
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:41,662
Haikon.

220
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:43,262
Haikon...

221
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:45,943
fear not, brother.

222
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:47,664
You are among friends.

223
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:49,865
Teal'c...

224
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:52,466
save yourself.

225
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:54,026
You shouldn't be here.

226
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:56,467
Tell me who has done this.

227
00:14:56,506 --> 00:14:59,468
Tell me who has caused this devastation.

228
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,469
Volnek.

229
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,470
<i>It was Volnek.</i>

230
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,271
One man did this?

231
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:11,871
Why would he turn on his people?

232
00:15:12,472 --> 00:15:13,473
Tell me.

233
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:14,993
Haikon...

234
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:17,674
Haikon?

235
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:19,434
<i>Major, come in!</i>

236
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:20,675
This is Hadden. Go ahead.

237
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:22,276
<i>We're under attack, Sir!</i>

238
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:24,075
<i>Requesting backup immediately...</i>

239
00:15:25,277 --> 00:15:27,077
McKenzie, you stay with him.

240
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:40,981
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

241
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:44,412
It was just a theory. Anyway, if I'd been right,
you'd all be calling me a genius right now.

242
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:46,184
Yes, but you weren't right.

243
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:48,684
So, anything?

244
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:51,244
Ah... nothing significant.

245
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:57,647
Fairly constant power readings,
and slight traces of lepton radiation...

246
00:15:57,686 --> 00:15:58,487
What?

247
00:15:58,887 --> 00:15:59,887
What?

248
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:01,688
Lepton radiation?

249
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,889
Lepton... lepton radiation?

250
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,090
Yeah, but like I said, only traces.
I mean, there's nothing significant there.

251
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:10,291
Got to go.

252
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,092
Stevens!

253
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,094
This one is alive.

254
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:30,298
I never saw him.

255
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:32,818
The shots...

256
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:34,458
came out of nowhere.

257
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:37,420
No doubt Volnek is using a Sodan cloak.

258
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,901
We got to get him back to the Gate, now.

259
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:50,624
What's wrong?

260
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,425
The code is not working.

261
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,830
Someone has removed
one of the control crystals.

262
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,271
Then how are we supposed to get out of here?

263
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:14,312
We cannot.

264
00:17:20,134 --> 00:17:23,255
Come on, Jackson, figure it out.
I've already missed breakfast and lunch.

265
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:27,896
<i>- General.
- Dr. Jackson.</i>

266
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:31,457
I just came from Dr. Lee's lab.
Please tell me you have better news.

267
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:32,698
I've been going over some of the

268
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:34,788
texts we recovered from the cave in Glastonbury.

269
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:35,399
And?

270
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,840
Well, a lot of them seem to make oblique references
to Arthurian legend. For instance, the word "anawyn",

271
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,201
which shows up several times, is,
I believe, a variation on annwyn,

272
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:46,923
the Celtic underworld, where king Arthur
journeyed in search of 13 sacred objects,

273
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,243
one of which

274
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:49,203
was a cloak...

275
00:17:49,243 --> 00:17:52,404
- What, the picture of the guy
with the big billowing robe?
- Said to render the wearer invisible.

276
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:58,207
It was called "the mantle of Arthur," and was kept
at Bardsey Island by none other than
our friend Myrddin, whom we know better as...

277
00:17:58,246 --> 00:17:59,687
- Merlin.
- Exactly.

278
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,328
I have no idea where you're going with this.

279
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:03,418
Me either.

280
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:09,229
Well, it wasn't until Dr. Lee told me that he detected
trace amounts of lepton radiation from the
device that I was able to put it together. You see,

281
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,530
<i>the crystal skull</i>

282
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,051
that transported me to
another dimension also released lepton radiation.

283
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:16,853
And you think the same thing happened
to colonel Carter and colonel Mitchell?

284
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:17,813
You're damn right!

285
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:20,414
According to legend,
the mantle makes the user invisible.

286
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:24,615
Now, given what I've read and what's happened today,
I'm guessing it wasn't literally a cloak at all.

287
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:26,775
It was the device we recovered.

288
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:27,855
<i>It makes sense, Sir.</i>

289
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:31,777
Medieval historians could well have attributed
the powers of the device to a cloak,
simply because they didn't understand it,

290
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:35,458
<i>and they could have credited its
recovery to Arthur, out of deference to the
king who was in power at the time.</i>

291
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:36,699
<i>Now given what we know now,</i>

292
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:39,939
it seems much more likely
that it was Merlin who actually built the device.

293
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,302
So why would Merlin build a device that
could transport him to another dimension?

294
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:46,062
Ooh. Today's "daily double".

295
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,532
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't quite figured out yet.

296
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,263
- So close...
- But at least it points to the possibility that

297
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:56,005
both colonel Mitchell and colonel Carter
may still be somewhere here on this base.

298
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:59,626
We just can't see or hear them.

299
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:16,632
<i>We could make our way back to the Gate on foot.</i>

300
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:18,392
I do not believe that would be wise.

301
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:21,673
The journey would take months, and
the terrain is most treacherous.

302
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:23,234
There's not much for us here.

303
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:25,795
We're going to run out of supplies before long.

304
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:30,397
General Landry will send an
extraction team when we fail to report.

305
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,877
And they'll end up stranded here, just like us.

306
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:38,679
We have food for the moment
and we can build shelter.

307
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:42,120
Perhaps when the extraction team
arrives, we can repair the obelisk.

308
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:44,280
What about Volnek?

309
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:46,001
He's still out there.

310
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,322
Leave him to me.

311
00:19:47,962 --> 00:19:49,002
<i>Teal'c...</i>

312
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,083
he took out an entire village.

313
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:58,806
It is my understanding that those
who use a Sodan cloaking device are
invisible to everyone but each other.

314
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,486
So if you use that thing,

315
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:01,886
<i>you'll be able to see him?</i>

316
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,327
Indeed.

317
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:06,848
Didn't help that guy much, though, did it?

318
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:25,935
Now, when I was out of phase, I could see
and hear everything going on around me,
so it follows if they're in the same situation,

319
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,655
they're hearing what we're saying right now.

320
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:28,976
Except they can't respond.

321
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:30,856
Maybe they can. They just don't know it.

322
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,297
Now, what does that look like to you?
First reaction.

323
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:34,217
A keyboard,

324
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:36,818
except there's no visual interface.

325
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:37,779
Not here.

326
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:40,219
You mean it's on the other side?

327
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:44,741
Well, it stands to reason that Merlin
would want the device to be interactive
on both sides this and the alternate dimension.

328
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:47,061
Now, the interactivity on this
side is difficult to access.

329
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:50,543
Now, I'm guessing as a type of safeguard
against just anyone using the device.

330
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,223
But there'd be no reason
to hide it on the other side.

331
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:55,584
Did you see that?

332
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:56,904
Oh, yeah.

333
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,345
Yeah!

334
00:20:58,385 --> 00:20:59,225
Sam?

335
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:01,226
Mitchell? If...

336
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:02,987
if you can hear me...

337
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:06,948
okay, let's call this button
"yes," and this button "no".

338
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:11,469
Okay, first question.

339
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:12,990
Are you guys okay?

340
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,150
- Yes
- Yep.

341
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,191
"Yes." Oh, thank god.

342
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:18,232
<i>- I mean, now we're getting somewhere.
- Okay,</i>

343
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:22,233
besides the interactivity, is there
anything else unusual on your end?

344
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,193
"Yes".

345
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,154
Something connected to the device?

346
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:28,635
- Would you call it connected?
- Yes, Yes.
- Yes.

347
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:30,795
<i>"Yes".</i>

348
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,756
Is it some sort of display?

349
00:21:33,636 --> 00:21:36,797
- That's... that's an emphatic "yes".
- Okay, thought so.

350
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:38,638
Can you read it?

351
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,041
It's in Ancient, isn't it?

352
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:51,163
Okay.

353
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:53,122
Alright.

354
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:55,404
Now...

355
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:59,765
you guys are going to have to help
me translate what you see. But,

356
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:02,326
<i>you see, we don't know what
pressing buttons randomly will do, so</i>

357
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:04,126
<i>we're going to have to stick with "yes" and "no",</i>

358
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,247
<i>and just do it...</i>

359
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:07,687
one letter at a time.

360
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:09,809
<i>- This is going to take a while?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

361
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:11,409
Just keep me posted.

362
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:12,570
Yes, Sir.

363
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,450
Okay... first letter...

364
00:22:58,024 --> 00:22:58,904
Status?

365
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,625
Still no word from Teal'c or SG-12.

366
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:03,066
How long are they overdue?

367
00:23:03,105 --> 00:23:04,066
Over an hour.

368
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:06,487
<i>Tell colonel Reynolds to prep an extraction team.</i>

369
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,428
- Have them ready to move out ASAP.
- Yes, Sir.

370
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,031
Okay. First letter, next word.

371
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:20,831
Stop me when you see the right symbol.

372
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:22,562
<i>How's it going?</i>

373
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:23,332
Fantastic.

374
00:23:23,372 --> 00:23:25,463
We've almost completed the first sentence.

375
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:27,593
Listen, you think you'll be okay
on your own here for a while?

376
00:23:27,734 --> 00:23:28,934
<i>Sure. Why?</i>

377
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:31,535
We've lost contact with Teal'c.

378
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:36,496
Landry's sending SG-3 and 22 to check on him
at the Sodan village. I figured I'd tag along.

379
00:23:36,637 --> 00:23:37,527
Offworld?

380
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:39,178
Yeah, well, Jackson was able to

381
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:42,138
travel through the Gate
when he was out of phase, so, yeah.

382
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,789
Well, that's my point.

383
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,050
<i>- You're out of phase.
What do you hope to accomplish?
- Sam,</i>

384
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,021
Teal'c could be in trouble. I want to check it out.

385
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:52,542
<i>No one can see me, I can't get hurt...</i>

386
00:23:53,342 --> 00:23:56,143
I can gather intel that no one else can.

387
00:23:57,544 --> 00:24:00,144
<i>- Sam? Mitchell? Did you see it?
- Listen,</i>

388
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,945
I promise I'll come back through the Gate
when they dial to check in.

389
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:07,346
- I'll only be gone a couple of hours.
- Hello? You guys still there?

390
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:08,948
<i>- Cameron...
- Sam.</i>

391
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:11,548
Teal'c may need help,

392
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:14,149
and I have friends among the Sodan.

393
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:16,149
I'll be back soon,

394
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:17,950
promise.

395
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,851
Like...

396
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,452
slap a button or something.
Okay, thank you.

397
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:27,153
First letter, next word,

398
00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:29,554
and stop me when you see the right symbol.

399
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:46,979
Yes. Okay.

400
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,770
Next word...

401
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,580
<i>That's it.</i>

402
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,982
My God, I finally figured out what colonel Carter
did to trigger the device.

403
00:25:56,582 --> 00:26:00,184
I had to run a reverse scan on all the energy
fluctuations that we've been recording,

404
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:02,384
put them through a program designed to...

405
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:03,184
anyway.

406
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:07,876
<i>I isolated the algorithm she used to synchronize
the energy emissions coming from the device.</i>

407
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:08,686
What?

408
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:10,087
Don't you see?

409
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:14,318
That means if I counteract
Sam's algorithm from my computer,

410
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:17,290
allow the emissions to return
to their normal frequencies...

411
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,491
that could well reverse the process.

412
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:25,692
Oh, just... give me a sec. This is brilliant.

413
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:33,495
That should do it.

414
00:26:44,198 --> 00:26:44,878
Sam.

415
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:46,199
Daniel.

416
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:49,699
Bill, I will never doubt you again.

417
00:26:55,202 --> 00:26:56,802
Oh, boy.

418
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:02,904
Dr. Jackson, can... can you hear me?

419
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:10,107
If you can, press this button for yes.

420
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:25,411
Teal'c!

421
00:27:26,132 --> 00:27:27,212
You alright?

422
00:27:28,072 --> 00:27:29,513
It is a light wound.

423
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:32,914
Lieutenant.

424
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:35,314
What happened?

425
00:27:36,415 --> 00:27:37,616
I found Volnek.

426
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,116
Then you're...

427
00:27:39,436 --> 00:27:41,516
lucky to be alive.

428
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:44,117
Haikon!

429
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:49,039
Others were not so fortunate.

430
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,920
<i>He woke up a few minutes ago.</i>

431
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,921
What has happened to Volnek?

432
00:27:55,121 --> 00:27:56,522
Ten days ago,

433
00:27:57,221 --> 00:27:59,623
he went to a neighboring world to

434
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:02,923
acquire supplies for our village.

435
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:09,726
<i>On the way back to the Chaapa'ai,
he encountered a Prior.</i>

436
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:16,729
<i>He was told that the Sodan had committed
unforgivable treason against the Ori.</i>

437
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:21,130
<i>The Prior vowed that great ill would befall us,</i>

438
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:24,731
<i>then planted his staff into the ground.</i>

439
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:31,133
<i>Volnek returned to the village
and told me of the encounter.</i>

440
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:36,134
<i>We took the threat seriously,
keeping a watchful eye on the Chaapa'ai.</i>

441
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:42,136
<i>Several days passed without incident</i>

442
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:44,057
<i>until...</i>

443
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:48,139
<i>Volnek fell ill.</i>

444
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:51,420
<i>He became irrational...</i>

445
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,140
<i>incoherent.</i>

446
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,541
<i>We isolated him,
and treated him with our best medicines,</i>

447
00:28:58,142 --> 00:29:00,343
<i>but his condition worsened.</i>

448
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:11,546
Yesterday,

449
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:15,948
he broke the bonds that were meant to restrain him.

450
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:19,549
<i>Our finest warriors attempted to subdue him,</i>

451
00:29:19,949 --> 00:29:23,150
but he killed them all with very little effort.

452
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,951
He then turned on everyone in sight.

453
00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:29,752
His own brother, Jolan, was

454
00:29:29,873 --> 00:29:32,153
killed in the carnage that followed.

455
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:35,554
<i>Women and children fled to the woods and</i>

456
00:29:35,594 --> 00:29:38,955
Volnek followed them, and slaughtered them all...

457
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:40,956
without mercy.

458
00:29:41,956 --> 00:29:43,756
To the best of my knowledge,

459
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:46,558
I am the only one to have survived.

460
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:50,359
Rest, brother.

461
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:51,759
Rest.

462
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:55,761
<i>SG-22, establish defensive perimeter!</i>

463
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:59,162
SG-3, stick close to me.

464
00:30:06,164 --> 00:30:07,364
Colonel Reynolds.

465
00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:09,165
Teal'c, what the hell happened here?

466
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:10,685
Why haven't you checked in?

467
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:14,366
- The eye of the gods has been damaged.
- We're trapped here. So are you.

468
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,888
The Ori had a hand in what has transpired here.

469
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:17,728
The Ori?

470
00:30:17,888 --> 00:30:19,568
We have much to discuss.

471
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,169
Come.

472
00:30:35,574 --> 00:30:39,375
<i>Okay, if you're still there,
I've given it some thought, and my guess is</i>

473
00:30:39,415 --> 00:30:41,976
it should be a simple matter of reversing the process.

474
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:43,176
I'm on it.

475
00:30:45,496 --> 00:30:46,978
Is that supposed to be reassuring?

476
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:51,579
Where's Mitchell?

477
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,060
He went offworld with the extraction team.

478
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,980
What?

479
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,381
He was convinced he could help Teal'c.
I couldn't talk him out of it.

480
00:30:58,581 --> 00:31:00,382
Why doesn't that surprise me?

481
00:31:00,581 --> 00:31:02,583
There's no sense in worrying about that now.

482
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:04,063
On the bright side,

483
00:31:04,103 --> 00:31:06,784
the translation will go a lot
quicker now that you're here.

484
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:16,987
<i>Okay, this is interesting.</i>

485
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:19,988
It appears to be a log of some kind.

486
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,589
Merlin was conducting research
on some kind of new invention.

487
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,591
And it was something big.

488
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,793
He went to great lengths to try and hide it.

489
00:31:36,793 --> 00:31:40,395
This device was invented for the sole purpose
of keeping his research a secret.

490
00:31:40,995 --> 00:31:43,196
He needed a way to conceal it from...

491
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:46,797
Daniel?

492
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:50,598
Merlin needed to conceal his research from...

493
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:52,598
His fellow ascended beings.

494
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,120
But,

495
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,401
if he was ascended, he must have retaken
human form to perform his research.

496
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:02,252
I don't get it.
What invention could have been so important

497
00:32:02,262 --> 00:32:04,903
that it would have led him to give up his ascension?

498
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,404
A weapon.

499
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:11,005
A weapon capable of destroying ascended beings.

500
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,888
You hit him with two P-90s, and he didn't die.
How's that possible?

501
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:23,209
We have encountered something like this before.

502
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:26,450
An Ancient device
capable of reanimating dead tissue.

503
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,531
Anubis used a similar technology
to give life to his Kull warriors.

504
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,411
I'm assuming there's no cure.

505
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:32,972
The Volnek we knew is dead.

506
00:32:33,012 --> 00:32:34,852
So how do we stop him...

507
00:32:34,892 --> 00:32:36,493
it, whatever?

508
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:39,054
By destroying the body entirely.

509
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:41,174
Claymores?

510
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:42,975
Oh, that's what I'm talkin' about.

511
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:46,936
We just plant two of them opposite each other
and run a tripwire right through the middle.

512
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:48,818
Then all we got to do is lure him in.

513
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:50,998
Piece of cake.

514
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:54,339
While we're at it, maybe we can
teach him how to speak japanese.

515
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:56,740
I will do it.

516
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,860
What?

517
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,021
<i>Teal'c, the kill zone is going to be huge.</i>

518
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:02,021
You'll have to be awful quick to get out of it.

519
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:03,142
Understood.

520
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:05,302
No, no. Now, that's just crazy.

521
00:33:05,342 --> 00:33:07,583
Let's at least wait for reinforcements.

522
00:33:07,623 --> 00:33:10,104
Waiting will only put the lives of others at risk.

523
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,905
Volnek was clever enough
to disable the eye of the gods.

524
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:15,706
Undoubtedly, the missing crystal is in his possession.

525
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:18,147
<i>The only way we can return to Earth is to retrieve it.</i>

526
00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:21,788
And the only way that we
can do that is by killing Volnek.

527
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:25,309
There is no other way.

528
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:36,513
Merlin believed that the Ori represented
a significant threat to the safety of this galaxy,

529
00:33:36,553 --> 00:33:38,484
including the Ancients themselves

530
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:41,775
who refused to take any action
to protect themselves against them.

531
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:43,775
So he went ahead and developed the weapon anyway?

532
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:45,815
Well, he found a way of doing it
without their knowing about it,

533
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:48,217
by shifting his research to another dimension.

534
00:33:48,657 --> 00:33:51,337
So, the weapon, did...
did he ever complete it?

535
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:57,059
See, this is all technical way over my head.
I wish you understood Ancient.

536
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,940
These notes seem to indicate that
he completed the weapon here on Earth,

537
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,621
and then had to relocate it to...

538
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:11,384
I don't need to know Ancient
to understand what that is.

539
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:14,625
A Gate address to where he hid the weapon.

540
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:28,950
Claymores are ready.

541
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,191
You and your men establish a perimeter.

542
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:35,312
I will lead Volnek into the trap.

543
00:34:36,432 --> 00:34:38,113
You sure you want to do this?

544
00:34:39,034 --> 00:34:39,994
I am.

545
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:50,117
Okay...

546
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,759
<i>I'm going to try to make
an adjustment to the algorithm.</i>

547
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,639
It's a bit of a long shot, but

548
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,880
if I can get this to sync up...

549
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:08,883
Oh... no.

550
00:35:14,685 --> 00:35:16,805
Hello? This is Dr. Lee. I...

551
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:20,047
I'd like to speak with general Landry, please.

552
00:35:20,206 --> 00:35:22,167
<i>Yeah, it's a bit of an emergency.</i>

553
00:35:25,048 --> 00:35:30,890
You know, there's a fine line between crazy-brave
and crazy-crazy, my friend, and you are walking it.

554
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,271
You realize he took out an entire Sodan village?

555
00:35:44,094 --> 00:35:47,336
You know, the last thing I need is
for you to get yourself killed.

556
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:50,377
Do you realize how long it'll
take me to find a replacement?

557
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:53,017
You worry far too much, Colonel Mitchell.

558
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,018
You can hear me now?

559
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:58,499
And see you.

560
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,421
- You're not surprised?
- What is it?

561
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,311
What's going on?

562
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:07,402
I'm not sure, but I may have accidentally

563
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,783
drained a significant portion
of the machine's power supply.

564
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:12,184
How significant?

565
00:36:12,223 --> 00:36:13,464
According to these readings,

566
00:36:13,664 --> 00:36:16,545
it could reach critical failure inside 15 minutes.

567
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,806
And what happens to Carter, Mitchell, and Daniel?

568
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:23,807
In all likelihood, we'll be permanently stranded.

569
00:36:25,588 --> 00:36:28,069
So, we can see each other when you're cloaked.
That means,

570
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:30,990
if Volnek is cloaked, he'll be able to see me.
All I've got to do is get his attention

571
00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:32,590
and lead him right back to Reynolds.

572
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,551
I do not feel comfortable
allowing you to shoulder all the risk.

573
00:36:35,591 --> 00:36:36,592
Ain't no risk.

574
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:38,032
I'm out of phase, remember?

575
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:42,393
And you are certain you will not be injured?

576
00:36:42,553 --> 00:36:43,994
Absolutely.

577
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:46,394
Hey, take your best shot, if you don't...

578
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:50,676
Good luck, Colonel Mitchell.

579
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:54,318
Hey, did you even think twice about that?

580
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:55,837
I did not.

581
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,440
Volnek!

582
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,561
Hey, Volnek!

583
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:12,663
Volnek!

584
00:37:13,544 --> 00:37:15,184
Where are you, homeboy?

585
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:18,945
Come on out and show me some
of those monster moves!

586
00:37:21,426 --> 00:37:22,587
Oh, there you are.

587
00:37:22,847 --> 00:37:24,167
I was getting worried.

588
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:33,591
Sorry. You got to do better than that.

589
00:37:37,871 --> 00:37:39,633
Come on, big fella!

590
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:07,721
There you go. Come on and get you some.

591
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:20,505
We're running out of time.

592
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:23,946
Okay, I think I've got it. This looks like
some sort of master control screen.

593
00:38:24,547 --> 00:38:25,828
Yeah. Here it is. It's a...

594
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:27,788
it's a button combination.

595
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:31,119
If this works,

596
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:32,609
what happens to Mitchell?

597
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:34,130
I don't know.

598
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,291
It's possible there's still a subspace
connection linking him to the device.

599
00:38:39,732 --> 00:38:41,212
And if there isn't?

600
00:38:45,854 --> 00:38:46,735
<i>Doctor.</i>

601
00:38:46,974 --> 00:38:47,974
<i>Okay...</i>

602
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:51,415
I'm gonna try and make an adjustment
to the algorithm. It's a bit of a long shot...

603
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:57,798
You better be sure about this, Doctor,
because if you make me disappear there
won't be a dimension safe enough for you.

604
00:39:11,862 --> 00:39:12,623
Come on,

605
00:39:12,763 --> 00:39:14,363
don't give up!
Come on!

606
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:15,823
<i>Come on!</i>

607
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:28,148
Oh, crap.

608
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:32,669
<i>You did it.</i>

609
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:39,351
No, actually, I didn't.

610
00:39:39,492 --> 00:39:41,932
It was Daniel.
He figured it out.

611
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:45,093
Where's colonel Mitchell?

612
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:45,012
You know, the whole point of my coming here

613
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,533
was for me to rescue you.

614
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:51,415
You are most welcome, Colonel Mitchell.

615
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:54,776
Now, let's see him get up from that one.

616
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:58,177
Unfortunately, we must now locate the crystal.

617
00:40:58,217 --> 00:41:00,178
What, you talking about this crystal?

618
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:01,778
<i>I took it off him during the fight.</i>

619
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:03,298
You know, if we hurry...

620
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:05,179
we'll make it in time for dinner.
