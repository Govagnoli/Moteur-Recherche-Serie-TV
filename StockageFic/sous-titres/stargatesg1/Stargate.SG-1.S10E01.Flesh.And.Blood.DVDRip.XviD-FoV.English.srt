Let's see what they do.

We've lost all contact
with both Earth ships.

181
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,498
We would be lucky if either survived.

Supergate.

184
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,604
They lay waste to all that stood
in their path and then moved on.

185
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,407
We need to get at least one ship out
to the scene of that battle,

186

find out exactly what happened,
and if there's anybody left who needs help.

187
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,306
Agreed.

188
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,784
Walter, dial it up.

Can you fix it in time?

194
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,451
I am unsure of
where the instability is occurring.

195
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,077
Simple answer.

196
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,055
I will have to go through
the program code again, line by line.

That's a no. It's time for Plan B.

you're thinking, it won't work.

I have already told you
all I know of the Ori.

Our only hope of defeating their followers
is to unite our forces and work together.

You have nothing to gain by torturing me.

The Ori wove their knowledge
into my genetic makeup,

00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:11,328
at least as much as
my human brain could hold.

288

All their knowledge is far too much
for us to possibly comprehend.

Contrary to what they've told you, the Ori
most certainly do ascend their followers.

309

And the Ancients are the ones sapping
energy from humans in this galaxy

to victory.

or are you just hoping I will?

over your daughter.

339
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,801
Oh, I had a baby.

340
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,894
You know, I never thought
I'd agree with my father,

341
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,997
but now, I'm starting to remember about
how he used to go on about

342
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:48,045
you nurture them and then you raise them,
and you teach them the best that you can,

343
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,341
and then all they do is break your hearts.

344
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,575
I always assumed that his experience
was just tainted by me.

345
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,673
What are you talking about?

346
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,276
Well, she started off all sweet
and innocent to begin with,

347
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,754
and now she's hell-bent on
domination of the galaxy.

348
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,792
- What? How old is she?
- A few hours.

349
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:08,164
The Ori used me to sneak one of their own
over the border.

350
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,497
This child is their way of cheating
the ascended rulebook.

351
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,231
Well, they couldn't exactly encroach
on our galaxy themselves

352
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,137
without getting into a confrontation
with the Ancients, right?

353
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,042
So they created their own human
representative with their knowledge

354
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,807
to lead their armies.

355
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,643
Sort of an uber-Prior, like the Doci?

356
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,547
Oh, but she's much worse than that.

357
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,745
The Priors are just pawns.

358
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:33,756
She knows the score.
She's complicit with the Ori.

359
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,292
You should have heard the propaganda
that she just tried to feed me.

360
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,089
Wait, wait, wait.
We're talking about a baby here, right?

361
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,027
Oh. She's been genetically altered.

362
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,328
She'll be a fully grown figurehead
in a day or so.

363
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,097
If she takes after her mother,
she'll have a pretty good figure, too.

364
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,694
- This is bad.
- You're telling me.

365
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,673
Origin is about to become a lot more
appealing to the males of this galaxy.

366
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,436
Do you have any idea where we're going?

367
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,809
No. That she wouldn't tell me.
She knows I'm not on her side.

368
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,405
She's still hoping I'll see the light.

369
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,110
Part of her can't help but feel tied to me.

370
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,948
She wanted me to give her a name.

371
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,045
- And...
- Adria. I told her it was my mother's...

372
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,215
- Not?
- Stepmother. Witch of a woman.

373
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,520
The more I get to know you,
the more I'm starting to understand.

374
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,186
- Huh?
- Nothing.

375
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,322
- Do you know what's strange, Daniel?
- No.

376
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:18,835
She has the knowledge of ascended
beings, twisted though it may be,

377
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:22,065
but I sense that there is a part of her
that is just like any other kid

378
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,663
that wants her mother's approval.

379
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,675
So I'm hoping I can use that somehow.

380
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,142
I mean, why else would
she care what I think?

381
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,713
Right now, we're a little more concerned
about getting off this ship.

382
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,406
- There's only so long I can hide.
- Hide!

383
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:32,778
- Yeah.
- Hide!

384
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:33,976
(COUGHS)

385
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,084
- (COUGHING) Hi.
- What?

386
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:40,316
- Hi. Long day?
- Ah, I'm exhausted.

387
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,919
I see you're up and around.

388
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,220
(GRUNTS)

389
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,059
Much better.

390
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,332
Three more ships just emerged
from hyperspace.

391
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:02,209
- They're flanking us.
- Receiving hail. On screen.

392
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,248
<i>- Greetings.</i>
- Bra'tac. Greetings back at you.

393
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,013
Heads up, the Lucian Alliance
is getting ready to open fire on us.

394
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,022
<i>I have already demanded that</i>
<i>they stand down or face us in battle.</i>

395
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,148
They're firing weapons.

396
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,257
- What the hell are they doing?
- Carter, now or never.

397
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,127
I have a lock.

398
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,211
Bridge, we have Teal'c. Are you okay?

399
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,811
I have been better.

400
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,046
Medical team to Auxiliary Control Room 2.

401
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,557
I guess we've all had enough fighting
for one day.

402
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,650
They just didn't want us to be able to
salvage the ship

403
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,854
when they turned tail and ran.

404
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,762
After everything you've been through,
after everything you've seen,

405
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,800
how can you still not believe in the Ori?

406
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,198
You think I don't?

407
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,100
The Orici is a truthseer.

408
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,038
She is a child. Little girls always have
issues with their mothers.

409
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,870
Are you saying you do believe in the Ori?

410
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,843
Why are you here with me
if you doubt my devotion?

411
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,538
Because I love you.

412
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,451
Because I'm still hoping
I can save your soul.

413
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,055
What? Where are you going?

414
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,462
I'm called to duty.

415
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,866
And here I was hoping I could save him.

416
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:38,599
(SIGHS)

417
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,541
I am glad to see you alive.

418
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,346
It is good to be alive, old friend.

419
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,444
We just got some bad news.

420
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,281
The Ori ships have been located.

421
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,459
Moments ago, they emerged
from hyperspace over Chulak.

422
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,765
Why Chulak?

423
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:47,072
Perhaps because it is where the
Jaffa rebellion against the Goa'uld began.

424
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,840
No matter. We must not abandon them.

425
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,145
Well, as soon as we get our hyperdrive
back, we have to head to Earth for repairs.

426
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,685
Someone's got to stick around,
keep an eye on that supergate.

427
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,755
We may not be able to stop the Ori ships
from coming through,

428
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,983
but we should at least know if they do.

429
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:03,959
We will leave a small contingent
in a cloaked scout ship behind.

430
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,030
Can you expect backup?

431
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:10,567
It is unlikely.
The remaining Jaffa fleet defends Dakara.

432
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:11,726
You've only got three motherships.

433
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:15,704
We had a lot more than that here
and we couldn't stop them.

434
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:19,334
We cannot merely stand by
while our brothers and sisters fall.

435
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:24,210
- Sam, I'm going with them.
- Me, too.

436
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,146
It's suicide.

437
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:29,152
Well, for Teal'c and Bra'tac, that's
not really an argument against going.

438
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,415
EMERSON: What about you?

439
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,319
However remote, there is still a chance

440
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,018
that Daniel's alive on board
one of those Ori ships.

441
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,925
- He may need our help.
- You really believe that?

442
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,260
You don't know him like we do.

443
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,991
Good luck.

444
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,081
Looks like a ground incursion
is about to begin.

445
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,652
We're on Chulak.

446
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,026
With most of the warriors out there
fighting Jaffa,

447
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,826
we might be able to get off
this ship undetected.

448
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,230
We have an opportunity here.

449
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,098
Yes. I was thinking that, but we don't
know what powers that child might have.

450
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:20,534
She is the key to the whole invasion.

451
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:24,404
If we could somehow capture her,
take her with us, turn her against the Ori,

452
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,069
then she would become the most powerful
weapon we could have against them.

453
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,805
- That's a big if.
- What have you got?

454
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,437
- Nothing.
- Worth a try, then?

455
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,550
You're going to need a better disguise.

456
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,051
I know where the armory is.

457
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,916
They have stun weapons like Zat guns.

458
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:45,086
I'll distract her
while you sneak up and stun her.

459
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,031
It's kind of a skeleton crew on board.

460
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,633
How many more Jaffa
do you have on the other ships?

461
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,403
Not many.

462
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,207
Getting the council to relinquish
three Ha'tak was difficult enough.

463
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,839
The crew I had to assemble personally.

464
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,319
So we're outmatched in manpower,
firepower and technology.

465
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,582
Do we have any sort of battle strategy,
or are we just planning on

466
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,126
dropping out of hyperspace
and getting our asses kicked again?

467
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,024
Hey, I'm all about noble death.

468
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,824
Pointless noble death, on the other hand...

469
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,062
The <i>Korolev</i> log indicated that
they were attempting to use the rings

470
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,365
to get a nuke through a fluctuation
in the Ori ship's shields

471
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,771
that was coinciding with the firing
of their main weapons.

472
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,002
Great. So we'll use the other two ships
to draw their fire,

473
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,569
while we sneak around the backside
and jam a big old nuke up their tailpipe.

474
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,205
But we don't have any nukes.

475
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,840
You have any fancy Jaffa bombs?

476
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,317
We have explosives
that should be effective.

477
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,581
All right.
As soon as we drop out of hyperspace,

478
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,884
I'll start broadcasting
on all radio channels.

479
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,516
If Daniel's still alive, hopefully
he'll get the message that we're here

480
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,891
and he can ring aboard.

481
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,224
There you go.

482
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,597
Now we got a plan.

483
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,733
You know, if she's anything like the Priors,
she may have powers like them.

484
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,366
That's why I'll go in first, try and get
her back turned toward the door,

485
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,001
so she doesn't see you coming.

486
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,670
Now, you've learned that
the Priors need to be focused

487
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:10,907
in order for their powers to work,

488
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,848
so when you hear the catchphrase,
come in firing,

489
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,919
and anyone else in the room
shouldn't be a problem.

490
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,420
Now, you're sure this thing just stuns?

491
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:22,789
The staff thing kills, that's less potent,

492
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:27,456
but if you shoot that at someone
several times, it will probably kill.

493
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,911
Adria? It's me.

494
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,447
Come in, Mother.

495
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,755
Are you all right?

496
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,227
Why are you sitting here alone
in the dark?

497
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,430
(NERVOUS CHUCKLING)

498
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,800
The knowledge in my mind
is growing as I am.

499
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:15,743
It's a lot to take in.
It makes my head ache.

500
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,747
I can imagine.

501
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:25,845
Actually, no, I can't.
But I'm sure it's rough.

502
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,491
It's chasing them.

503
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,668
Moving into flanking position.

504
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,708
What are you doing?

505
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,617
Looking out on Chulak.

506
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,248
Are you interested in the planet
you're conquering?

507
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,921
Have you been here before?

508
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,920
Once.

509
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,857
What do you know of the Jaffa?

510
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:11,560
They are proud people,
confused about the ways to salvation.

511
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:16,870
They have been misled by parasites
posing as gods for many generations,

512
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:22,640
but in their hearts, I believe they know
ascension is the true goal of our existence.

513
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,715
Then why are you slaughtering them?

514
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,083
This is Lieutenant Colonel
Samantha Carter

515
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,589
calling any survivors of the
Earth ship <i>Korolev.</i> Please come in.

516
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,622
<i>ON RADIO: Repeat. This is</i>
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter</i>

517
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,129
<i>calling any survivors of</i>
<i>the Earth ship</i> Korolev.

518
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,699
<i>Please come in.</i>

519
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,290
Sam, it's me, Daniel.

520
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,527
Daniel, I knew you made it!

521
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,605
Yeah. It's good to hear you, too.

522
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,731
Listen, I'm kind of in the
middle of something right now.

523
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,241
We're in orbit trying to blow up
one of the Ori ships.

524
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:53,578
Yeah. I'm on one of the ships
that's landed on the planet.

525
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,102
Yeah. I'm on one of the ships
that's landed on the planet.

526
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,273
I'm gonna have to tell you the rest later.
Requesting radio silence.

527
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,987
I am detecting the fluctuation
in their shields.

528
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,791
Almost in range.

529
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,859
The good news is
I just made contact with Daniel.

530
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:21,171
<i>We were right. He's alive and on board</i>
<i>the Ori ship that's landed on the planet.</i>

531
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,103
Hallelujah. What's the bad news?

532
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,840
We just lost one of our motherships.

533
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:29,310
If our plan doesn't work,
this will be a very short battle.

534
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,607
We are in range.

535
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,343
<i>CARTER: Now. They're firing. Send it.</i>

536
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,094
It should have gone off by now.

537
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,962
They must embrace their destiny.

538
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,204
Well, then, hallowed are the Ori.

539
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,399
Please, Mother.

540
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:00,272
It is blasphemous for an unbeliever
to speak those words.

541
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,870
No, really, you're starting
to make sense to me now.

542
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,506
I'm really coming around.

543
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,177
Hallowed are the Ori.

544
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,910
We just lost another mothership.

545
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,950
Let's get Jackson on board
and get the hell out of here.

546
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:44,715
I am sorry, Colonel Mitchell.
That is not the plan.

547
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,021
Bra'tac, what are you doing?

548
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,152
I believe he intends to ram
the enemy vessel.

549
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:55,562
Yeah, I got that. But that will kill us.

550
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,293
- I think he knows that.
- Indeed.

551
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,926
Teal'c, this is crazy.
Not the good kind of crazy. You know that.

552
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,470
What would you have me do,
Colonel Mitchell?

553
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,096
Talk to him.

554
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:08,201
Chances are we'll just impact the shield.
We won't do any damage to them.

555
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,042
What do you think,
you're making some kind of a statement?

556
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,412
Hey, I know this is your ship
and we didn't have to come along,

557
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,745
and maybe it is better to die in battle.

558
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,150
I don't know.
I was never really hoping to find out.

559
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,915
But I do know one thing.

560
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,959
There's no point in dying
when you're going to lose anyway,

561
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,652
not when you have a choice.

562
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,129
- They were conspiring against you.
- Yes, I know.

563
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,537
- Kill him.
- No!

564
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,105
Wait.

565
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,740
- We want to talk to you.
- Move!

566
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:46,305
- I said, kill him.
- No!

567
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,112
Mother.

568
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,948
(GASPING)

569
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,231
You couldn't have waited
until she'd finished healing me?

570
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,768
Well, she was distracted.

571
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,737
- Leave me. Grab her.
- Oh, yeah, like that's going to happen.

572
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,850
Colonel Mitchell, Colonel Carter,
this is Emerson. Come in.

573
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,714
<i>What's your status?</i>

574
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,809
Beam us on board.

575
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,583
Enemy ships have detected our presence.
Moving into range.

576
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,920
You should have
four beacons transmitting.

577
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:32,689
I planted one on you earlier, just in case.

578
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,030
Do it.

579
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,554
No!

580
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,180
We were lucky the ship on the planet
had lowered its shields.

581
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,313
You should have grabbed for Adria,
not me.

582
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,824
No, I'm thinking I should have shot her
when I had the chance.

583
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,486
Daniel, you couldn't have killed a child.

584
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,292
She's not a child.
She's an Ori in the body of a human.

585
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,298
Isn't that cheating?

586
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,425
Well, Orlin broke the rules
by taking human form

587
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,969
and telling us the truth about the Ori.

588
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,902
Yeah, and he paid for that.

589
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,942
No offense, but I think
this kid's going to be a big problem.

590
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,203
She'll be fully grown
within a matter of days.

591
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,439
See? Cheating.

592
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:58,845
Yeah, I gotta admit,
the ascended rulebook

593
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,940
is getting a little hard to understand.

594
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,643
You know, I don't think there really is one.

595
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,914
There usually never are rules in a war.

596
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,855
Unfortunately, right now, there is no war.

597
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,451
In a war, you've got two sides fighting.

598
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,498
All we have is a lot of winning
by the bad guys.

599
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,931
They have troops and ships
in our territory,

600
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,367
and a supergate to bring in more
anytime they need them.

601
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,405
I remember
when we first opened the gate.

602
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,565
The Goa'uld had total domination
over the galaxy.

603
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,872
They had massive technological
superiority over us.

604
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,003
A lot of people didn't think
we had a chance.

605
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,275
I'm not saying we should give up.

606
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,351
I'll fight to my dying breath.

607
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,745
I just think we need a new plan.

608
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,853
A damn good one.
