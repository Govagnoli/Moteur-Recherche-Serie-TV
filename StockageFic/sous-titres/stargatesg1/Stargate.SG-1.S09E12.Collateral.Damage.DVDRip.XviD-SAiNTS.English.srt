1
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:48,308
<i>Open up this door!</i>

2
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,056
<i>- I got him.
- What the hell is going on?</i>

3
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:57,501
Colonel Mitchell.

4
00:00:57,626 --> 00:00:58,710
Yeah.

5
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:00,612
What happened?

6
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,139
Bring him.

7
00:01:19,824 --> 00:01:22,118
- Oh my God...
- Colonel Mitchell,

8
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:25,897
I'm placing you under arrest
for the murder of Dr. Reya Varrick.

9
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:36,577
Season 9 - Episode 12
Collateral Damage

10
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:45,394
Sorry to keep you waiting Emissary,
I wasn't expecting anyone.

11
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:48,491
Well, I apologize for coming so late,

12
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:52,991
but the Committee
just completed its deliberations.

13
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:55,395
You've chosen a new leader for the project?

14
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:57,197
Yes, we have.

15
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,284
Congratulations.

16
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:03,605
I'm honored.

17
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:05,048
We expect...

18
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:08,772
great things from you Doctor.

19
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:12,338
Along with your...

20
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:16,663
new responsibilities,
you will have a higher security clearance.

21
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:18,786
You already know about the ring of course.

22
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:21,309
- Yes, Sir.
- What you don't know...

23
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:23,232
is that we've used it to visit

24
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:25,955
over a dozen inhabited worlds...

25
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:28,800
and there may be thousands more out there.

26
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:29,961
My God.

27
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:36,610
As ambassador to those worlds, I've seen first
hand the kind of technologies that exist in the galaxy.

28
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,535
Giant ships capable of traveling between the stars...

29
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:43,780
weapons of immeasurable power...

30
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,304
Galar is vulnerable Doctor...

31
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:48,906
the project...

32
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:51,670
may be our only hope for survival.

33
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,335
We'll do our best Sir...

34
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:05,589
Colonel?

35
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:07,792
How do you feel?

36
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:14,441
That's just weird.

37
00:04:15,562 --> 00:04:17,645
I was having a conversation with you.

38
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:20,008
It was about a year ago...

39
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,571
but we just met yesterday.

40
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:25,896
I was the one
who had a conversation with Dr. Varrick.

41
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:29,060
What you experienced, was my memory.

42
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:33,025
- That's amazing.
- Believe me Dr. Jackson, this is just the beginning.

43
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:37,632
The memory was copied from
the Emissary's mind and spliced into yours.

44
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:38,994
Once there...

45
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:41,277
it was incorporated into your consciousness,

46
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:44,721
like a transplant organ becoming part of a new body.

47
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:48,566
I could swear I was there.

48
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:53,934
I don't really know what we were talking about...

49
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,657
but we were talking.

50
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:59,942
Of course this was just a small
demonstration, we're still perfecting the process

51
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:01,424
but we believe

52
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:04,989
eventually the device
will become an invaluable educational tool.

53
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:05,910
Imagine...

54
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:13,560
your most brilliant surgeons or
engineers instantaneously transferring the full memory
of their education and experience to young students.

55
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,604
You could conceivably cut their training time
from years to mere weeks.

56
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:19,848
And you say you adapted
this technology from a Goa'uld memory device.

57
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,171
That's correct.

58
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,735
If you don't mind our asking,
where did you get your hands on one?

59
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:30,983
This planet has been under the protection
of the Asgard for many generations.
But it was originally occupied by the Goa'uld.

60
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:34,108
That device
was discovered by archeologists over 100 years ago.

61
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:41,197
But it wasn't until recently that our understanding
of the technology, advanced to the point
where we could create the memory transfer.

62
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:44,692
It was Dr. Varrick,
who made the final breakthrough.

63
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:46,105
The Emissary is exaggerating.

64
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:49,128
I was just the last in a long line
of scientists working on the project.

65
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:52,172
The last is the one who gets it right.

66
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:56,097
What?

67
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:03,758
The Galaran's haven't perfected
the memory implant technology to the point
where it would have widespread applications.

68
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:06,611
But from colonel Mitchell's experience
it sounds like they're well on their way.

69
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:10,417
If they succeed it could
artificially accelerate their technological advancement.

70
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,299
I think that's the point.

71
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,021
I'm saying it could be dangerous.

72
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:16,265
We're hardly in a position to judge Dr. Jackson,

73
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:22,593
for the past nine years SG-1
has been routinely employing technologies
that are well beyond our level of advancement.

74
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:24,115
<i>The Asgard are busy rebuilding,</i>

75
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:26,318
which means
they haven't been around to do much protecting.

76
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,641
The Galaran's feel like they need to play catch up.

77
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:32,246
In all likelihood that is the reason
they are seeking a relationship with the Tau'ri.

78
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:35,531
They are undoubtedly aware
of our success against the Goa'uld.

79
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,173
<i>So what exactly do they want?</i>

80
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:39,656
I mean aside from our goodwill and fellowship?

81
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:43,181
Well right now they have no
interstellar capability except for the Gate itself.

82
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:46,144
They've been working on hyperdrive technology
but without much success.

83
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:49,429
And they want to offer
this memory device in exchange for our help?

84
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:52,994
Well the emissary was reluctant to get into specifics.
I think he wanted to...

85
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:55,517
wet our appetite
for the technology before we started bargaining.

86
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:56,349
Well, it worked.

87
00:06:56,359 --> 00:07:01,365
The joint chiefs are already salivating over
the idea of training jet pilots in a manner of days.

88
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:03,087
We need to set up another meeting.

89
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:04,089
<i>No need sir.</i>

90
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:08,455
We've already been invited back
for a reception in honor of the scientists
who developed the implant technology.

91
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,818
I'm hoping there'll be dancing.

92
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,001
Sir.

93
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,065
Check that out...

94
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,718
even on an alien world. A wallflower.

95
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,922
Dr. Amuro,
he's worked on the project for many years.

96
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:31,566
Well, it doesn't look like he's enjoying the party.

97
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:32,927
You know how it is with scientists,

98
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:36,492
we spend so much time in the lab,
I think that's where we feel most comfortable.

99
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:38,976
In your case I find that hard to believe.

100
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:41,540
Are you suggesting,
I don't work as hard as my colleagues?

101
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:43,902
No, no, God no.

102
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,747
That's supposed to be a compliment.

103
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:48,830
Guess I'll have to take your word for it.

104
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:52,915
No, it's not that I don't appreciate
the potential of the technology, it's just
that we're talking about your memory here.

105
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:55,998
It's fundamental to your identity
if you can't trust it... you're lost.

106
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,243
Your memory is already less objected
than you think it is Dr. Jackson...

107
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:00,605
Well he's got a point...

108
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:03,369
I mean just ask any
cop whose had to take eyewitness testimony.

109
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:06,133
Yes, but there's a difference between
getting a license plate number wrong and

110
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:08,896
not knowing if the four years
you spent in college ever actually happened.

111
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:10,618
Yes, but that would never be the case.

112
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:14,663
Because everyone receiving the treatment
would be aware of what they will getting.

113
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:16,626
So long as the technology is not abused.

114
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,750
Well that's a risk with all new technologies.

115
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,794
Easily said by one who has not
been the victim of such abuse.

116
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:23,556
Excuse me.

117
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:26,920
Reya.

118
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,366
Dr. Marell, this is lieutenant colonel Mitchell.

119
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:33,489
We have to talk.

120
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,772
Excuse me.

121
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:41,941
How's it going?

122
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,945
I don't think the diplomacy is my thing.

123
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:47,268
That's what you're doing.

124
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:48,550
What?

125
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,312
Nothing, nothing.

126
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:01,687
Reya wait.

127
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,369
Why wasn't I informed of this?

128
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,512
Excuse me. What?

129
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:07,105
You moved up the test schedule

130
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:10,039
and you selected a group of volunteers.
When did this happen?

131
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:13,283
We've been very impressed with your progress.
We thought it was time

132
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,726
to take your research to its next level.

133
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:17,528
You should take this as a compliment.

134
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:20,733
I noticed all the test subjects are
military officers. How should I take that?

135
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:22,695
This is still a classified operation.

136
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:26,621
You gave me your personal assurance this
project would remain under civilian control.

137
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:30,506
And so it has. The military is
simply making their contribution.

138
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:32,909
Well I've seen what those contributions can lead to.

139
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:36,714
You're overreacting and in any case,
this is hardly the place to discuss it.

140
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:38,356
This conversation isn't over.

141
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,362
I'll be back.

142
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,727
<i>Reya! Wait up.</i>

143
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,531
What was all that about?

144
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:51,253
I should have seen this coming.

145
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:53,697
They're going to take the project away from me.

146
00:09:53,978 --> 00:09:56,821
Why would they do that?
You're the one that figured it out.

147
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,423
Which means they no longer need me.

148
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:01,587
I know where this is coming from.
It's the general staff.

149
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:05,272
They want to control the technology without
any interference from civilian scientists.

150
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:07,475
I swore I wouldn't let that happen.

151
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:10,440
Why am I telling you this?

152
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,242
<i>You're a military officer yourself.</i>

153
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:15,006
If you get your hands on the device the
same thing will happen on your planet.

154
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:19,632
I'm not a big fan of
misusing technology on any planet.

155
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:22,215
And I might be able to help you out.

156
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:23,457
What do you mean?

157
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:28,304
Well, obviously your government is keen
on forming a relationship with mine.

158
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:30,586
That gives us some leverage.

159
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:32,749
You'd use your influence to help me?

160
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,072
I could try.

161
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:37,917
Well.

162
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,721
I really don't want to go back out there.

163
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,365
Maybe you could do me a favor and walk me home.

164
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:45,727
It's not far.

165
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,650
But I don't like to walk alone at night.

166
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:50,694
Really?

167
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,818
<i>Don't they have crime on your planet?</i>

168
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,061
Oh yeah.

169
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:14,806
Don't move.

170
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,813
The night the emissary...

171
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:22,837
told you that they put you
in charge of the project,

172
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:24,979
he came here, right?

173
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,141
That's right.

174
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:29,105
This is weird.

175
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:31,709
I mean, I know I've never been here before but,

176
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,633
I recognize this place.

177
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,486
Then you know where the drinks are.

178
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,939
Help yourself and pour me one too.

179
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:58,023
It's impressive.

180
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:02,049
Do all government scientists live like this?

181
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,814
The success of the project has
brought me a few privileges.

182
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,857
Sometimes I feel a little guilty.

183
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:11,822
Most of my colleagues from my days at
the academy don't live nearly so well.

184
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:13,585
Well, I'm sure you deserve it.

185
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:25,441
That doesn't pull any punches does it.

186
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:28,044
After the day I just had that's the whole point.

187
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,372
So, you...

188
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:35,374
live here on your own?

189
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,097
Why do you ask?

190
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,339
That's a big place.

191
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:41,703
I don't know. Just...

192
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:43,866
just curious I guess.

193
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:48,312
I thought that was your clever
way of asking if I was married.

194
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:50,375
I'm not that clever.

195
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,138
Well, anyway the answer's yes. I live alone.

196
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,183
I was married for a while,
but the job got in the way.

197
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:00,868
Well, that much I understand.

198
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:03,993
Then we're not so different after all.

199
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:14,728
We shouldn't do this.

200
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:17,611
You wouldn't have come here
if you didn't want to.

201
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:21,817
I didn't say...

202
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:23,579
I didn't want to.

203
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,483
Emissary what's going on?
Where's colonel Mitchell?

204
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:43,205
He's been taken into custody.

205
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:44,768
Why?

206
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:46,370
He killed Dr. Varrick.

207
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,222
- What?
- That's insane.

208
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:51,157
<i>When we found him, his blood alcohol
level was extremely high.</i>

209
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:55,482
I suspect it was probably some kind
of unpremeditated crime of passion.

210
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:57,925
We all know they left the reception together.

211
00:13:58,126 --> 00:13:59,648
That's hardly evidence.

212
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:02,091
We also found her blood on his hands

213
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:04,534
and his fingerprints on the murder weapon,

214
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:06,056
but most importantly,

215
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:07,458
he confessed.

216
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:16,830
Cam, what happened?

217
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:18,453
I don't know.

218
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:22,438
I mean, the whole night is just a blur.

219
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:29,968
<i>I just remember feeling this insane...</i>

220
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:31,030
<i>anger.</i>

221
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:33,533
I don't know why...

222
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,461
I picked up the statue...

223
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:44,067
and I hit her with it.

224
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:49,995
She was lying there,

225
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,719
helpless, and I...

226
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:57,205
It wasn't you, ok?

227
00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:59,248
These people can implant memories.

228
00:14:59,388 --> 00:15:01,230
Yeah, I've been trying to tell myself
the same thing all morning

229
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,693
but it doesn't stop me from still seeing her face.

230
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:09,862
What if I told you everything that happened
to you yesterday was a false memory?

231
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:14,989
How would you know the difference?

232
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:19,475
The Emissary would like to speak with the prisoner.

233
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:23,560
<i>We need to talk about this so-called evidence
you have against colonel Mitchell.</i>

234
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:25,002
That won't be necessary.

235
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:27,966
Colonel Mitchell is free to return to Earth.

236
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:30,890
I'm what?

237
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,135
I'm trying to convince the Cabinet
to maintain your diplomatic status,

238
00:15:34,214 --> 00:15:35,537
but I may not succeed.

239
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:40,543
Wait a minute. If they think I'm guilty
why are they letting me go?

240
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:44,028
They believe it is in the best interest
of interplanetary relations

241
00:15:44,148 --> 00:15:46,231
to put this difficult business behind us,

242
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,594
<i>as quickly and as quietly as possible.</i>

243
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,796
Colonel Mitchell has been falsely accused.

244
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:52,639
Which means
there could still be a murderer out there.

245
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,202
<i>Let's be realistic here.</i>

246
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:55,844
Very few people

247
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:58,127
have access to the memory device.

248
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:01,211
Even fewer have the skills
to manipulate it in this manner.

249
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,534
And none that I can think of have any motive.

250
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:06,457
Colonel Mitchell should be grateful.

251
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:09,582
Under our rules of evidence
he would be convicted of this crime.

252
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:14,589
I should be grateful to walk away and have
this memory stuck in my head for the rest of my life?

253
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:15,510
<i>Alright then.</i>

254
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,754
If you agree to close the matter,
we can have the incident removed from your mind

255
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:19,876
and replace it...

256
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,799
with a memory of a pleasant, uneventful evening.

257
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:24,362
Just like that?

258
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:26,565
Forget it ever happened?

259
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:27,847
Precisely.

260
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:29,969
<i>On the other hand,</i>

261
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,975
<i>if you insist on a full investigation
I won't be able to protect you.</i>

262
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:36,458
If the evidence continues to point to your guilt,

263
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,781
<i>you will be subject to the full force of our laws.</i>

264
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:40,504
And the penalty for murder is death.

265
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:43,668
Cameron, we need to be really careful here,

266
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:45,831
we have no idea how their legal system works,

267
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:47,433
<i>- we don't know what kind of rights...
- Sam.</i>

268
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:50,477
I need to do this.

269
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,641
I want to know what really happened.

270
00:16:55,043 --> 00:16:59,689
You can tell the Galarans that until colonel Mitchell
is returned all trade talks are suspended.

271
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,411
He doesn't want to come back.

272
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,855
He wants to force them
to conduct a full investigation.

273
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:05,337
I don't give a damn what he wants.

274
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:06,459
<i>Look, General...</i>

275
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:09,983
It's easy for us to sit here and be certain he
didn't do it, but look at it from his point of view.

276
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:14,229
No matter what we say he's still gonna have the memory
of murdering that woman with his own hands.

277
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:17,313
You said the Emissary offered
to have the memory removed.

278
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:19,757
Well he'd still know that she'd been killed and

279
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:22,740
I'm sure he'd be curious why no one
was held accountable for it.

280
00:17:24,163 --> 00:17:25,805
He's taking an awful chance.

281
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,369
I believe it highly unlikely that the Galarans
would execute colonel Mitchell.

282
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,335
It would severely hinder the possibility
of future relations with the Tau'ri.

283
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:35,538
<i>Sir, I've already spoken with Dr. Marrell.</i>

284
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:39,423
He says they can use the implant technology
to determine if the memory is genuine or not.

285
00:17:40,304 --> 00:17:43,748
I don't want him hooked up to that damn
machine again without one of you present.

286
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,391
I'll be observing the analysis.

287
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,474
In the meantime Teal'c and Daniel
have been granted access

288
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:49,756
to all the material relevant to the investigation.

289
00:17:51,158 --> 00:17:52,400
Very well.

290
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,224
Dr. Marrell and Dr. Amuro will
be conducting the analysis.

291
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:13,488
<i>Now, if there's anything else you require.</i>

292
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:15,191
As a matter of fact there is.

293
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,196
I understand a sample of colonel Mitchell's
blood was taken, when he was arrested.

294
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,680
In order to determine his blood alcohol level, yes.

295
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,165
We'd like a portion of that sample
sent back to Stargate Command.

296
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:28,088
Just to corroborate your results, of course.

297
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,331
I'll see to it.

298
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:31,973
<i>You can take the guards with you.</i>

299
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:34,217
This man has been accused of murder.

300
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:36,079
I don't want them in my lab.

301
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:39,424
You can wait outside.

302
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:44,751
And you fellas sure
you want to be left alone with me?

303
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:47,925
Dr. Varrick was our colleague.
If we thought for one minute you actually killed her,

304
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,856
we wouldn't be helping you.

305
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:50,418
Then who do you think did kill her?

306
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:55,465
Reya was going to do everything she could to
oppose the militarization of the project.

307
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:58,449
So they got rid of her.

308
00:18:58,629 --> 00:18:59,710
Why frame me?

309
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,646
They assumed you'd claim diplomatic immunity and
therefore no prosecution would be necessary.

310
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:05,699
<i>Whole thing was to be swept under the carpet.</i>

311
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:07,441
They assumed wrong.

312
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:09,004
And for that we are grateful.

313
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:10,535
Can you prove the memory's false?

314
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:13,429
Well, unfortunately Dr. Varrick was
the most qualified to do this work.

315
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:15,051
I'm sure you'll do fine.

316
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:17,214
Please.

317
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:39,184
Brain activity is extremely fluid.

318
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:43,189
<i>We can't read a memory like
opening a drawer and pulling out a file.</i>

319
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,713
Patterns shift and mutate.

320
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:48,026
<i>One memory colors another.</i>

321
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:50,639
That's why it's so difficult
to create a successful graft.

322
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,483
You have to be careful not to
cause too many inconsistencies.

323
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:55,566
Alright Colonel,

324
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:57,668
we need to establish a base line.

325
00:19:57,788 --> 00:20:01,314
What I have done is identify a series of
key memories from your childhood.

326
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:04,819
<i>These are seminal moments,
they stand out like signposts</i>

327
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:07,221
and they influence everything that came after them.

328
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:09,244
I'm gonna activate one now.

329
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:20,800
<i>Dr. Peters to examination room 1.
Dr. Peters.</i>

330
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,202
<i>You alright?</i>

331
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:24,505
Yeah. It's just... weird.

332
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:26,207
What are you seeing?

333
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:30,613
I'm in the V.A hospital where they
brought my father after his accident.

334
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:33,176
He was a test pilot, right?

335
00:20:33,217 --> 00:20:34,018
Yeah.

336
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:59,652
<i>It's the first time I saw him after the crash.</i>

337
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:03,858
Scared the hell out of me to see him like that,

338
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,660
<i>somehow he</i>

339
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,063
<i>made it seem that everything was gonna be OK.</i>

340
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:10,867
We're moving into a related memory now.

341
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,678
It's a couple of months later.

342
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:23,685
<i>We're watching the launch of the first space shuttle.</i>

343
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:25,286
<i>God, I can't be much more than</i>

344
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:27,189
<i>ten years old.</i>

345
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:28,942
<i>Go baby, go!</i>

346
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:30,393
<i>What do you think of that Cam?</i>

347
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:31,895
<i>Space planes.</i>

348
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:33,257
<i>I tell you what,</i>

349
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:34,790
<i>if they can pull that off,</i>

350
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,403
the least I can do is walk again, right?

351
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:43,411
<i>Well done Colonel.</i>

352
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:50,921
So what's next?

353
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:54,726
With this data, we should be able
to precisely calibrate the equipment

354
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:56,929
and then comes the hard part.

355
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,133
We'll need to run through your memories of the murder.

356
00:22:00,173 --> 00:22:01,935
We may have to do it several times.

357
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:04,740
Great.

358
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,548
Teal'c, Dr. Jackson, what can I do for you?

359
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:11,749
We've got a problem.

360
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,954
This data file was supposed to contain all the
materials relevant to the murder investigation but

361
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:19,760
large sections of Dr. Varrick's
personal records have been deleted.

362
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,465
Well, she was involved in a number
of our most top secret projects.

363
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:26,368
The deletions were made
in the interests of national security.

364
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:29,773
But I'm sure there's nothing in the missing
material that has any baring on the investigation.

365
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:31,015
How are we to be certain?

366
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:32,217
Because I'm telling you.

367
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,607
<i>We must be missing something.</i>

368
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,810
<i>We've been through it three times.</i>

369
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:57,811
What's the problem?

370
00:22:57,851 --> 00:23:01,216
- Well, maybe we should run another diagnostic.
- It's not gonna change the result.

371
00:23:01,816 --> 00:23:03,018
I need some air.

372
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:08,425
So far we can't find any evidence
that the memory is false.

373
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:12,631
According to these results,
colonel Mitchell really did murder Dr. Varrick.

374
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:29,650
Dr. Marrell, you have to continue
with the analysis, please.

375
00:23:30,051 --> 00:23:33,055
- You know he didn't do this.
- That's not what the machine says.

376
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:34,557
Look.

377
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:38,763
- I know Dr. Varrick was your friend.
- She was more than that, Colonel.

378
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,069
She was my wife.

379
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:48,777
We had been separated for two years.

380
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,581
I guess I was still hoping there might be a chance.

381
00:23:54,504 --> 00:23:56,187
I can't help you.

382
00:24:03,997 --> 00:24:07,401
Sir, Dr. Liam's in surgery, but
she wanted you to see this right away.

383
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:10,806
It's the results of the analysis of
colonel Mitchell's blood sample.

384
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:12,008
Anything useful?

385
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:17,815
Yes Sir. She wanted you to know that the troponins
were negative but the C.K and the myoglobins were up.

386
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:24,625
No wait. The myoglobins were negative
but the C.K and the troponins were up.

387
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:26,267
- No wait.
- Walter...

388
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:27,468
Sir, whatever it was,

389
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:32,856
it means that when the sample was taken
colonel Mitchell had been recently either stunned or

390
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:35,619
rendered unconscious
by some kind of electrical charge.

391
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:36,740
Like a Zat Gun?

392
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:39,585
Yes Sir, or some such similar...

393
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:41,748
thing.

394
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:55,606
This is hardly proof of colonel Mitchell's innocence.

395
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:57,969
Well, on Earth you have to prove guilt.

396
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,372
I know, we're not on Earth.

397
00:25:00,413 --> 00:25:04,778
I'll admit, its enough to suggest to them
that the investigation should continue

398
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:08,784
but Dr. Marrell has expressed
reluctance to help you any further.

399
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:12,389
At least let us talk to him.

400
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:16,795
I'm sorry about Reya.

401
00:25:18,597 --> 00:25:20,799
She told me she'd been married,

402
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,602
she didn't tell me it was you.

403
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:24,005
Would it have made any difference?

404
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:27,209
I didn't kill her.

405
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,344
Even if I wanted to help you
there's nothing more I can do.

406
00:25:31,354 --> 00:25:32,115
Why not?

407
00:25:32,255 --> 00:25:36,350
Well, as you know we used colonel Mitchell's own
memories to establish a comparative standard,

408
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,565
and normally that should have been
enough to identify any false readings, but...

409
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:41,128
we were unable to do so.

410
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,611
Which means either the memory is genuine or

411
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:47,737
the transfer was so expertly done that the
ordinary methods of detecting it are useless.

412
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,338
What other methods are there?

413
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:55,827
Well, the only way would be to compare
what happened the other night with a genuine
memory of similar content and emotional resonance.

414
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:59,752
So, unless colonel Mitchell's made
a habit of killing innocent people,

415
00:26:00,754 --> 00:26:02,156
<i>we're out of options.</i>

416
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:05,360
I may have what you need.

417
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:10,767
Hook me up.

418
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:23,985
There it is.

419
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:26,639
<i>What are we looking at?</i>

420
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:30,895
The emotional resonance pattern of this memory
is very similar to that of Dr. Varrick's murder.

421
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:44,312
Mustang leader this is Mustang 3.
Do we have a confirmation on the target yet?

422
00:26:44,713 --> 00:26:49,119
<i>Negative Mustang 3, AWACS reports we're
still waiting on intel, maintain cap.</i>

423
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,124
I have tallied a three vehicle convoy
just like the man said.

424
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:57,650
<i>Copy that 3, we're still trying
to confirm that the target is in the convoy.</i>

425
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:01,695
Triple A on my three... breaking left.

426
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:09,666
His heart rate just shot up.

427
00:27:09,747 --> 00:27:11,468
Breathings shallow.

428
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:15,754
<i>I'm taking fire, do we have a confirmation yet?</i>

429
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:24,226
Not exactly friendly skies out here boys and girls.
Can I get a confirmation on that target?

430
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:28,131
<i>Mustang 3 you are cleared hot.
Repeat you are cleared hot.</i>

431
00:27:28,832 --> 00:27:29,994
Pretty sure about this?

432
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:34,299
<i>That's affirmative.
Bump up to 1500 for reacquisition.</i>

433
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:36,142
Roger that.

434
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:47,197
<i>Weapon is armed...</i>

435
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,641
<i>Bomb away.</i>

436
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:53,005
<i>Mustang 3! Mustang 3! Abort! Abort!</i>

437
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:54,717
What? No... no, no, no...

438
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:56,129
The bomb is away.

439
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:58,652
What the hell's going on Mustang leader?

440
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:00,945
<i>We've lost confirmation on the target.</i>

441
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:02,638
You've got to be kidding me.

442
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:04,160
<i>Can you confirm hit?</i>

443
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,601
Stand by.

444
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:12,451
The target is destroyed.

445
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,216
Oh shit.

446
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:22,365
<i>Sorry about that Captain.</i>

447
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:28,492
<i>We were relying on local ally intelligence,
so obviously someone dropped the ball.</i>

448
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:30,695
Who was the target?

449
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:35,061
Was he in the convoy or not?

450
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:37,424
Don't do this to yourself?

451
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:41,951
Who was in the convoy, Sir?

452
00:28:43,152 --> 00:28:45,875
As far as we know it was a group of refugees.

453
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:48,840
This wasn't your fault.

454
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:55,248
But it doesn't change the fact
that I have to live with it...

455
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:57,211
for the rest of my life.

456
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,863
Please tell me you got what you need?

457
00:29:05,942 --> 00:29:09,507
We're analyzing the results now,
just give us a few moments.

458
00:29:16,277 --> 00:29:17,559
You OK?

459
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,322
No.

460
00:29:23,406 --> 00:29:25,048
<i>It worked.</i>

461
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:29,815
The new data indicates that the memory
of Reya's murder was implanted.

462
00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:31,858
Thank God.

463
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:34,341
<i>- I'll inform the Emissary.
- Hang on a second.</i>

464
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:38,427
We may have proved that I didn't kill her
but we're not finished, not by a long shot.

465
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:41,631
I have to know who did it.

466
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:45,636
And I'm not leaving here until we find out.

467
00:29:50,742 --> 00:29:52,665
<i>What exactly are we looking for?</i>

468
00:29:53,006 --> 00:29:56,530
Because we know the memory was implanted
we can expect to find anomalies.

469
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:02,409
Little moments where the brain is simply
incapable of dealing with the inconsistencies
that arise as a result of the graft.

470
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:05,863
Now, often these take the form of missing time, or

471
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:09,207
sudden changes
in the identities of people around us.

472
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:11,541
Typically they centre on the splice points

473
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:13,242
where the memory starts and stops.

474
00:30:13,252 --> 00:30:16,217
The problem is
they can often be difficult to detect.

475
00:30:21,064 --> 00:30:23,306
Hey Sam.

476
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,109
Thanks.

477
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:29,034
He's ready.

478
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:39,768
You wanted to see us?

479
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:45,937
I understand Dr. Marrell and Dr. Amuro were able
to determine that the memory was an implant.

480
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:49,261
I must say, I'm relieved.

481
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:52,986
A trial could have been extremely
detrimental to relations between our worlds.

482
00:30:53,026 --> 00:30:55,550
Not to mention inconvenient for colonel Mitchell.

483
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:57,272
Yes, of course.

484
00:30:57,473 --> 00:31:00,076
I'm sure he'd like to return
to Earth as soon as possible.

485
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:01,487
Actually, he's still in the lab.

486
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:04,102
<i>Colonel Mitchell believes
that an analysis of the false memory</i>

487
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:07,966
could prove useful in determining
the true identity of the murderer.

488
00:31:08,887 --> 00:31:11,051
I'm sorry...

489
00:31:13,494 --> 00:31:16,057
but I won't allow it.

490
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:18,861
We've already been more than generous

491
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,428
in putting our most important scientists
and facilities at your disposal to
determine colonel Mitchell's innocence.

492
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,952
But now it's time they get back to their research.

493
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:29,035
Look, all we're asking for is a little more time.

494
00:31:29,074 --> 00:31:31,157
The project is already behind schedule.

495
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:34,161
Dr. Marrell is the most qualified
to lead the research now

496
00:31:34,201 --> 00:31:38,487
and his new responsibilities preclude him
from participating in this investigation anymore.

497
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:40,650
<i>Colonel Mitchell was assaulted.</i>

498
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,255
His memories were manipulated against his will
and an innocent woman was murdered.

499
00:31:44,295 --> 00:31:49,102
Now, I've only worked with the guy
a short period of time but I'm pretty sure
he's not gonna let this one go.

500
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:51,745
<i>And if you want to get in his way...</i>

501
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,227
let's just say...

502
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:56,551
when it comes time to decide
if we want to pursue this relationship

503
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:59,796
his opinion's gonna carry a lot of weight.

504
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:09,088
Cam?

505
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:10,630
No, I'm good...

506
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:13,004
<i>Well, are you sure you wanna continue this?</i>

507
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,138
It's possible that there are no anomalies
or that they could be buried so deep,

508
00:32:16,178 --> 00:32:19,062
we'll never find them
even if we go over it 100 times.

509
00:32:19,263 --> 00:32:21,466
It's the least I can do for her now.

510
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:23,188
Let's keep going.

511
00:32:23,228 --> 00:32:24,429
<i>Alright.</i>

512
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:38,087
There's nothing here.

513
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:39,109
There has to be...

514
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:41,182
I'll find it...

515
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,556
Marrell I know she meant a lot to
you but how much longer can we
put the poor man through this?

516
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,318
He wants to do it!

517
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,763
Look, we know the memory's false by comparison.

518
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:51,205
There must be some other indication.

519
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:54,209
We've been through this a dozen times.
The splice points are indistinguishable...

520
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:58,615
I know, but I now realize that's because
he was rendered unconscious before
the procedure was begun.

521
00:32:58,655 --> 00:33:00,669
And he was still
unconscious long after it was completed.

522
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,801
The whole thing has the quality of a dream, it's...

523
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:05,765
<i>- jumbled up in his mind.
- Alright, so what can we do about it?</i>

524
00:33:05,905 --> 00:33:08,639
Focus on the inconsistencies in the memory itself.

525
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:09,650
But what if there aren't any?

526
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:13,134
I'm wasting my time explaining this to you!
Can I do my work?

527
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:19,383
How's he doing?

528
00:33:19,423 --> 00:33:20,584
Not too good.

529
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:22,908
Doesn't sound like
you're making a lot of progress.

530
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:24,950
Marrell's determined but,
I don't know.

531
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,474
The graft appears to be flawless...

532
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,172
I've got something...

533
00:33:42,294 --> 00:33:43,896
<i>There... you see it?</i>

534
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:44,977
Yes.

535
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:46,460
What is it?

536
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:48,302
It's what we've been looking for.

537
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:50,104
Colonel Mitchell can you hear me?

538
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:51,065
Yeah.

539
00:33:51,106 --> 00:33:53,909
We've identified a point in the memory
where we think there may be an anomaly.

540
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,151
I'm gonna activate it now.

541
00:33:55,191 --> 00:33:56,953
I want you to tell me what you see.

542
00:34:03,162 --> 00:34:04,454
<i>I'm in the house.</i>

543
00:34:04,464 --> 00:34:07,348
I'm walking down the hallway...

544
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:12,534
<i>No.</i>

545
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,729
No, whoa... I...
I've lost it... go back.

546
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,181
Just a minute.

547
00:34:18,943 --> 00:34:20,144
Stop!

548
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,827
<i>There.</i>

549
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:27,194
Can you run it again?
Maybe slow it down a little.

550
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:37,188
I see my reflection,
my reflection in the mirror.

551
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:40,221
But the face is blurry.

552
00:34:40,231 --> 00:34:41,473
<i>It's an anomaly.</i>

553
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:44,317
If the reflection in the mirror is not your own.
Your brain can't deal with it...

554
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:45,919
That's why it's blurry.

555
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,842
Can you clean it up?

556
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,004
I think so.

557
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,223
What did you see.
Who was it?

558
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:21,988
It was him.

559
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:27,716
Are you sure?

560
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:29,639
Positive.

561
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,241
It was Marrell.

562
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:32,402
<i>That's impossible.</i>

563
00:35:32,442 --> 00:35:33,204
If he killed her,

564
00:35:33,243 --> 00:35:38,049
why would he be helping us? I mean,
he wanted to reveal the identity
of the murderer more than anyone.

565
00:35:38,811 --> 00:35:40,333
What if he doesn't know?

566
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:43,577
What you're saying, he killed her and
then implanted the memory in colonel Mitchell...

567
00:35:43,657 --> 00:35:45,179
And then erased it from his own mind.

568
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:46,140
Is that possible?

569
00:35:46,181 --> 00:35:48,504
- Theoretically yes, but...
- This is insane...

570
00:35:48,544 --> 00:35:50,026
I loved her.

571
00:35:50,146 --> 00:35:52,308
But she left you, didn't she?

572
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:55,072
<i>And you never got over it.</i>

573
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,797
Then you saw me leave the party with her.

574
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:04,766
<i>- Look, it's impossible.
- Well, there's one way to find out for sure.</i>

575
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:08,971
If he really did erase his own memory,
he would have had to replace it with something else.

576
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:13,437
We can check for anomalies the same way,
we did with colonel Mitchell.

577
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:15,200
Go ahead.

578
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,903
You won't find anything.

579
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,325
<i>We found that he had two identical memories.</i>

580
00:36:26,335 --> 00:36:29,018
One from the night of the murder
one from several nights before.

581
00:36:29,058 --> 00:36:32,102
Except no two memories are exactly the same,
it's like signatures.

582
00:36:32,143 --> 00:36:34,866
<i>When they're identical that's when
you know they've been forged.</i>

583
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:37,830
As far as he knows he was in
bed sleeping the whole time.

584
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,274
He didn't want to just fool us
he wanted to fool himself.

585
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:41,876
To get rid of the guilt.

586
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:44,519
And that's what did him in.

587
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:56,575
We're done.

588
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:00,581
How do you feel?

589
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:02,263
Fine...

590
00:37:02,543 --> 00:37:03,545
I guess.

591
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:06,709
I've erased the implants.

592
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:09,672
You should no longer have the image
of killing Dr. Varrick in your mind,

593
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:13,277
but all of your genuine memories should be intact.

594
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:22,450
I still remember her.

595
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:24,693
<i>Thanks.</i>

596
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:29,500
Dr. Amuro.

597
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:34,407
And you must be our visitors from Earth.

598
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:36,529
Are you alright?

599
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,213
Well... no.

600
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:42,337
Obviously you've heard what happened to Reya.

601
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,784
To be honest I still can't
believe she's really gone.

602
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,708
<i>But I...</i>

603
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:54,273
I talked it over with the emissary
and we both agreed that the best thing for me now is to

604
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,915
get back to work.

605
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:03,605
It was nice to meet you.

606
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:11,736
What the hell is this?

607
00:38:12,177 --> 00:38:15,100
He thinks she died in an accident.

608
00:38:15,141 --> 00:38:18,906
And he'll continue to think that,
for the rest of his life.

609
00:38:18,946 --> 00:38:21,349
You're gonna just let him get away with murder.

610
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,233
He doesn't know he killed her.

611
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:28,078
There was no way to recover that memory.

612
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,964
And that's supposed to make it OK?

613
00:38:32,364 --> 00:38:35,448
It was for the good of the project.

614
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:39,293
And Dr. Varrick would have understood that.

615
00:39:02,404 --> 00:39:04,487
I read your report.

616
00:39:04,828 --> 00:39:10,556
Not sure I've ever seen language like that used
in an official Air Force document before.

617
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,037
Sorry about that, Sir.

618
00:39:12,078 --> 00:39:15,722
Oh, you should have seen what
colonel Carter and Dr. Jackson wrote.

619
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:17,084
Yes, Sir.

620
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:21,130
Colonel Carter told me
what you had to do to prove your innocence.

621
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,692
Something about...

622
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:25,335
reliving a difficult memory.

623
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,857
Of course...

624
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:30,182
she didn't know what it was all about, she...

625
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:33,466
hasn't read your service record like I have.

626
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,913
I hadn't thought about it in a long time...

627
00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:42,879
but I guess something like that
never goes away, does it?

628
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,242
No.

629
00:39:47,325 --> 00:39:48,967
When it happened...

630
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:53,173
I almost resigned my commission.

631
00:39:57,058 --> 00:39:59,141
I'm glad you didn't.

632
00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:06,550
<i>I understand how you feel.</i>

633
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,674
<i>But leaving the air force
won't change what happened.</i>

634
00:40:09,715 --> 00:40:11,718
Won't make you feel any better.

635
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,171
You know you suck at pep talks dad.

636
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:16,264
I'm just being realistic.

637
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:18,908
What else are you gonna do?

638
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:20,510
Become an airline pilot?

639
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:24,755
Fly the New York - DC shuttle five times a day.
Mow the lawn on sundays?

640
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:26,568
That doesn't sound too bad.

641
00:40:26,578 --> 00:40:27,940
Yeah well...

642
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,944
for someone else maybe but now for you.

643
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:35,450
It could have been easier
if you'd grown up to be more like your mother.

644
00:40:37,953 --> 00:40:39,916
But you're just like me.

645
00:40:40,556 --> 00:40:44,282
Always looking to the horizon,
always looking for something more.

646
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,845
No, I'm not like you dad.

647
00:40:47,086 --> 00:40:48,848
I'm not that strong.

648
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:51,792
No, that's where you're wrong kid.

649
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:56,277
You just don't know it yet.
