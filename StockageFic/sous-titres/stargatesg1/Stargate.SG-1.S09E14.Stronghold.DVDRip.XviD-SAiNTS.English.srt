1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:06,648
Democracy

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,526
is the future of our great nation.

3
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:13,238
We must proceed with the dissolution
of this Council, which we have seen

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,922
<i>can be influenced and corrupted.</i>

5
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:19,710
I hereby formally propose
we hold a public referendum of the subject,

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,222
so that all Jaffa can participate

7
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:24,906
<i>in the decision before us.</i>

8
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,308
Thank you,

9
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,903
Brother Maz'rai.

10
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:31,947
Your wisdom is always
greatly appreciated by the Council.

11
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:36,628
Now I call sister Ka'lel as the last speaker

12
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:40,157
<i>before rebuttal will be heard.</i>

13
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:46,530
Brother Bra'tac, I'm afraid I must begin
rebuttal against dissolution of the Council

14
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:51,568
<i>- Our people are not yet ready for this burden Bra'tac.
- You underestimate them, Sister.</i>

15
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:55,874
My position on this Council
was secured by the might of the Haktyl,

16
00:00:55,915 --> 00:01:03,847
but it is well known that many regions
do not yet recognize any rights for females,
let alone the right to vote on their destiny.

17
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:05,275
I agree,

18
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:09,703
- there must be change.
- Such change must occur prior to a general vote

19
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:15,344
so that its results
can be viewed as fair and representative.

20
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,820
Kal'el...

21
00:01:24,304 --> 00:01:25,638
Kal'el!

22
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:29,417
Did she not just speak of
her support for our proposal just this morning?

23
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,253
Privately, yes.
I would not have called on her otherwise.

24
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:34,647
Then why would she betray us in session?

25
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:37,192
Someone has influenced her.

26
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:39,995
Still, I have always
believed Kal'el to be honorable.

27
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:44,332
Is there no end to this duplicity we must face?

28
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:47,393
Sometimes I fear
I have gotten too old for this, Brother.

29
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:48,737
Indeed,

30
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:53,826
and yet this is what results
when we leave such decisions to the rash of youth.

31
00:01:55,252 --> 00:01:57,796
I will speak with her.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,585
Kal'el...

33
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:04,961
please forgive the intrusion.

34
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:06,196
Not at all.

35
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:07,806
I'm glad you are here.

36
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:09,666
We must speak.

37
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:12,944
May I ask why you did not support our proposal?

38
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:17,208
- Now is not the time.
- We have no choice, Kal'el.

39
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,303
I'm afraid, as far as you are concerned,

40
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:23,190
that is true.

41
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:32,293
Season 9 - Episode 14
Stronghold

42
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:35,461
Hi. I'm Lieutenant colonel Mitchell.
I'm here to see Bryce Ferguson.

43
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:36,781
- Colonel Mitchell?
- Yes, Ma'am.

44
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:39,541
- Hello. I'm Dr. Kelly.
- Nice to meet you.

45
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:41,341
I've had a chance to see your friend.

46
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:44,061
Great. Dr. Lam says you're the best.

47
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:48,102
Well, that's very nice of her to say.
I'm not aware of any official ranking system.

48
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:51,422
Well, I'm sure you'll be
a little better than Fergie's H.M.O. back in Iowa.

49
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,902
Well, I'll do what I can.

50
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:56,062
I've ordered some tests. They should give us
a better idea of what we're looking at.

51
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:56,892
Yeah.

52
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:59,782
He's had that shrapnel for a while.
They just found the aneurysm a few weeks ago.

53
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:02,092
He probably had it
the whole time and didn't know it.

54
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:04,671
He said his doctors back home
have thrown in the towel on this one.

55
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:07,321
Well, I won't lie to you.
It's in a tricky spot,

56
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:11,541
but as you know, we have access to certain technology
not available to everyone else just yet.

57
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:13,261
Yes, Ma'am. Thanks.

58
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:16,181
- I was told he's not privy to classified material.
- No.

59
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,262
So, you got him in here,
but you couldn't get him clearance?

60
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,982
That is a whole other ball of wax.

61
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:26,382
The irony is, he probably would've had my spot
in the 302 program if he hadn't been injured.

62
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:28,422
He's a better pilot than I ever was,

63
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:29,972
better than most, actually.

64
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:33,822
This must be important to you. I imagine you
had to pull some pretty big strings to make this happen.

65
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:38,421
Ferguson got that chunk of metal in
his head saving my sorry ass four years ago.

66
00:04:38,702 --> 00:04:40,061
I'll do what I can.

67
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:41,622
Thanks.

68
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:47,542
And so, upon further reflection,

69
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:50,222
I have come to agree with Kal'el...

70
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:55,622
<i>more debate over the
proposed state of government is required.</i>

71
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:59,582
We must take our time in such grave matters.

72
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:07,341
For now, we must maintain the present high Council and
not bow to the pressure of brothers Bra'tac and Teal'c.

73
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:15,981
Maz'rai.

74
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:22,342
I am entitled to be swayed by reason, Bra'tac.

75
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:25,342
You are the one who
tabled this proposal for a referendum.

76
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:29,141
You have always believed democracy
was essential for the future of our nation.

77
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:31,102
Indeed, that is still the case.

78
00:05:31,142 --> 00:05:34,942
- I have merely been convinced that
we should not act in such haste.
- Brother...

79
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:38,581
it was you who feared that Gerak's
followers were gathering strength,

80
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:42,222
<i>that there was a danger that if we did not
dissolve this Council, they could still vote</i>

81
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:45,382
to support the unilateral
submission to the religion of the Ori.

82
00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:49,262
All our dreams for
a free Jaffa nation would be lost forever.

83
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:54,462
All I am saying is that I believe
there is yet more time for healthy debate.

84
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:58,781
We cannot let this proposal die.

85
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:02,102
There are still
Council members who remain uncommitted.

86
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:04,342
Brother U'kin was not in session today.

87
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:08,221
I will visit him later this evening after
I confer with our allies on Chulak.

88
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:10,462
And I will see what I can learn here.

89
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:12,822
If Maz'rai's vote was influenced,

90
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,182
I shall expose it.

91
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:30,102
Ferguson!

92
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:32,142
It's about time.

93
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:35,781
Son of a bitch drags me out here to get
poked and prodded and turned upside down,

94
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:39,452
and he can't spare a minute from
his big important job to visit his dying friend.

95
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:42,941
Ah, it's good to see your
bad attitude hasn't changed much.

96
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:45,142
What do you expect?
I'm dying, for God sakes.

97
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:49,262
- Don't have to get up, you idiot.
- Oh, Cam, I'm not gonna break.

98
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:54,662
- You look like you're feeling good.
- Yeah, I'm doing pretty good

99
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:56,832
for a guy with a ticking time bomb in his head.

100
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:59,242
Well, why don't we see
what the doctors have to say about that?

101
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:01,822
Oh, I'm just doing what the flyer says.

102
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,862
It was in the waiting room of the shrink's
office they sent me to a couple weeks back.

103
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:08,421
So you're gonna bite the big one. Now what?

104
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,582
First thing on the list is accept it.
Learn to talk openly about it. So,

105
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:12,982
that's what I'm doing.

106
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:16,182
Did I mention I'm gonna die?

107
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:19,162
Yeah...

108
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,022
I think you did.

109
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:22,541
Okay.

110
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:27,142
So, how about you?
How's the big important top-secret job?

111
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:28,382
Still top secret.

112
00:07:28,502 --> 00:07:30,822
Oh, come on, man, you can tell me.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

113
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:34,061
I'm gonna die, you know.

114
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:39,022
- No flowers?
- No.

115
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:41,182
No, hell I thought about it, but...

116
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,582
I decided on this instead.

117
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:48,341
Oh, yes, me likey a lotty.

118
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:52,482
Colonel, Dr. Jackson.

119
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:55,982
Bra'tac has information
concerning a situation on Dakara.

120
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:57,902
It is Teal'c.

121
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:01,371
He left last night
to consult with one of our allies.

122
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,942
He was due back this morning but did not return.

123
00:08:04,142 --> 00:08:05,621
You sure he's not just late?

124
00:08:05,662 --> 00:08:07,982
<i>He missed an important Council session.</i>

125
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:12,452
There have been unusual goings on as of late.

126
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:15,942
I am here because I no longer
know who I can trust on Dakara

127
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:19,582
and I am certain something is gravely wrong.

128
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:11,492
I will divulge nothing.

129
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:13,142
<i>That is not my intention.</i>

130
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:15,382
My purpose...

131
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,901
is to teach you.

132
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:32,322
Obviously this motion to dissolve the Council in favor
of elected officials has spawned strong opposition.

133
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:37,822
Many who have reaped benefits under the current regime
would lose their status upon passage of the vote.

134
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:42,671
Anybody in particular you think would resort to
kidnapping and blackmail to influence the situation?

135
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:46,521
I used to believe in the honor
of many who have disappointed me of late.

136
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:50,302
Well, we should probably start
at Teal'c's last known whereabouts.

137
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,581
Let me know if you need additional personnel.

138
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:54,982
Colonel Mitchell is taking some personal time.

139
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:56,002
Thank you, Sir.

140
00:09:56,702 --> 00:09:58,141
Come on, come on...

141
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:01,202
No, you don't want none of me.

142
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:02,522
No, you don't.

143
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:06,582
Oh, oh, now, don't look now.
You'd better back down.

144
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:12,102
Die! Yeah, that's what I'm talking...

145
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:16,612
What the hell was that?

146
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:18,062
Are you even trying?

147
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:22,142
You know what? I'm just... I'm kind of tired.
But this, this, this was great, really.

148
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:24,612
<i>- This was just like old times.
- Tell you what.</i>

149
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:26,822
I'll play left-handed,

150
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:29,162
- with one eye.
- Yeah, I'm done.

151
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,222
Alright,

152
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:32,862
fine.

153
00:10:32,902 --> 00:10:34,742
I reserve the right for a rematch.

154
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,042
Fair enough.

155
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:41,182
Look, I... I appreciate you taking some time, but...

156
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:42,702
What are you talking about?

157
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:46,262
I'm just saying, you did your duty.
You can go now.

158
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:48,502
I've got nowhere else to be.

159
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:51,022
Really.

160
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:54,362
Seriously, Cam, it's fine.
You don't have to stick around.

161
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:55,662
Yes...

162
00:10:58,302 --> 00:10:59,302
I do.

163
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:08,182
I wish I could be of more help, Bra'tac, but Teal'c
left last night, barely an hour after arriving.

164
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:09,962
Did he say where he was going?

165
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,422
He said he was needed back on Dakara.

166
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,802
<i>- Was anybody with him?
- He traveled alone.</i>

167
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:18,102
Please let me know as soon as you
have learned what has happened.

168
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:24,042
What is the matter, Brother?

169
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:26,163
You call yourself a friend,

170
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:29,322
yet you speak lies to my face!

171
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:30,722
Whoa, Bra'tac...

172
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:32,262
He is deceiving us.

173
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:33,822
Where is Teal'c?

174
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:36,702
Bra'tac, what has come over you?
I have told you what I know.

175
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:39,462
I will not ask again.

176
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:44,942
He was taken from here. I do not know where.

177
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:46,822
Please!

178
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:56,542
What was that all about?

179
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,342
I believe he speaks the truth.

180
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:00,623
He does not know where Teal'c is.

181
00:12:00,662 --> 00:12:02,732
But he admitted he helped
arrange for Teal'c's kidnapping.

182
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:04,622
And he shall be dealt with accordingly.

183
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:07,982
Unfortunately for us, this situation
is much worse than I imagined.

184
00:12:08,222 --> 00:12:09,422
How?

185
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:13,582
U'kin has always been one of the
strongest supporters of our cause,

186
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:16,302
a Jaffa whose honor I never would have doubted.

187
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:19,582
There is but one possible explanation for his actions.

188
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:21,222
I saw it

189
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,342
in his eyes.

190
00:12:24,262 --> 00:12:25,822
He's been brainwashed.

191
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:27,702
You know,

192
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:32,142
I never did buy
that you went down in a test flight.

193
00:12:33,382 --> 00:12:35,102
Why? That's what happened.

194
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:40,582
Okay, so you, you were testing a plane
in a dogfight over Antarctica?

195
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:42,542
Dogfight?

196
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:45,182
I did some checking,
I still have friends in intelligence.

197
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,622
Right, you think you're

198
00:12:46,762 --> 00:12:48,892
getting your hands on classified information.

199
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,022
Not exactly.

200
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:51,982
I pieced some things together.

201
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:55,862
Come on, we were both up for
that big important classified position.

202
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:59,382
I just want to know what I missed out
on that almost got you killed.

203
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:01,463
I wish I could tell you.

204
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:02,662
I really do.

205
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:03,942
No, you don't.

206
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:07,782
No, you probably feel guilty as hell that you're doing
what you're doing while I'm waiting to die.

207
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:10,302
<i>Read the flyer, man. It's called survivor's guilt.</i>

208
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:15,182
Now, it also says that you need to be
honest with yourself and those around you.

209
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:31,102
Speak.

210
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,182
It does not seem to be working.

211
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:35,262
As I feared.

212
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:37,462
His will is strong.

213
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:39,262
I will break him...

214
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:40,982
whatever it takes.

215
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:41,982
No, no.

216
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,142
I'll deal with this.

217
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:49,463
Hello, Teal'c.

218
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,703
You!

219
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,862
Seems it's time we had a little chat.

220
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:04,263
I've recalled colonel Carter and SG-3 from Chulak.

221
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,382
Do we have any idea how widespread
this brainwashing might be?

222
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:09,063
It is impossible to tell,

223
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:13,902
but it explains how many alliances have shifted so
dramatically over the course of the last three weeks.

224
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:16,502
For all we know, half the high Council
may have been compromised.

225
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,302
You believe Goa'uld technology is behind this?

226
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:21,862
Teal'c once fell prey to it at the hands of Apophis.

227
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:25,462
But he was able to break its hold
by enduring the rite of M'al Sharran.

228
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:28,062
Anyone, including a Jaffa, could have
their hands on that technology now.

229
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:31,102
<i>Still, the fact that Teal'c overcame
such manipulation in the past</i>

230
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,942
should make him more able
to resist its effects again.

231
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:36,623
Which may actually put his life at greater risk.

232
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:40,422
Bra'tac, you said a close
friend of yours, Maz'rai, had a

233
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,702
similar change of opinion, virtually overnight.

234
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:45,462
Yes, it is likely he too is brainwashed.

235
00:14:45,622 --> 00:14:47,183
Right. I guess what I'm getting at is...

236
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:51,702
is it possible you could get him to defeat
the brainwashing the same way Teal'c did?

237
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:54,743
And if so, at the very least,

238
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,422
he might be able to give us
an idea as to who is behind this.

239
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:02,222
<i>I admit we've certainly
had our differences in the past,</i>

240
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,863
but you need to hear what I have to say.

241
00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:08,463
I will not hear the words of a false god.

242
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,863
Ah, yes, the whole god issue.

243
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:16,182
Maybe we did take it a little too far, but...

244
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:17,783
Can you blame us?

245
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:18,822
We gave you

246
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:19,742
strength,

247
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:20,742
vitality,

248
00:15:21,102 --> 00:15:22,142
long life.

249
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:25,422
I know you don't
quite see it that way, but no matter.

250
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:27,062
It's all in the past now.

251
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:36,023
Come now, Teal'c.

252
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,303
We're smart enough
to know we're not actually gods.

253
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:45,102
Well, some of us are anyway. There are always
those who will begin to believe their own propaganda.

254
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:49,102
I suppose all you need is enough
people to worship you and then,

255
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:52,343
what's the difference? You're pretty
much a god by definition, are you not?

256
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:55,783
So is the case with the Ori.

257
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:59,942
<i>Granted, they do seem to have some very
interesting powers to back up their claims.</i>

258
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:02,542
I've seen what happens to those who resist.

259
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,983
They are a formidable enemy.

260
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:07,543
How does this concern you and I?

261
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,502
We worked together to defeat the Replicators.

262
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:12,582
This is working together?

263
00:16:12,943 --> 00:16:14,782
Taking me against my will,

264
00:16:14,902 --> 00:16:16,903
brainwashing the Council to do your bidding...

265
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:20,662
The Jaffa number in the millions, spread
across the vastness of the galaxy.

266
00:16:20,902 --> 00:16:25,143
Your backgrounds are diverse and rich
in a history of warfare with each other.

267
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:26,503
Because of the Goa'uld!

268
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:29,223
As a united nation, you are young and inexperienced,

269
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:32,302
too weak to face an adversary as powerful as the Ori.

270
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:33,542
Gerak proved that.

271
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,343
What you need right now
is a strong leader, one with the

272
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:39,702
mind and experience
to wage war on such a foe.

273
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:41,303
You?

274
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,182
<i>I'm not asking you to worship me.</i>

275
00:16:45,263 --> 00:16:47,942
I do not plan to undermine your freedom.

276
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:49,783
I care nothing

277
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:53,302
for your rights and traditions or
what you wish to do with your daily lives.

278
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,062
What I do not want to see
happen is the utter subjugation

279
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:59,302
of this entire galaxy at the hands of the Ori.
That...

280
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,863
would be an utter shame for all of us.

281
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:04,463
Don't make this personal, Teal'c.

282
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:07,103
Your people are in need, and I can help them.

283
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:11,183
I can help all of us defend ourselves against the Ori.

284
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:16,703
<i>That is an absurd accusation.</i>

285
00:17:17,022 --> 00:17:18,702
You know me, Bra'tac.

286
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,503
I choose my opinions carefully.

287
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:21,702
<i>That's true.</i>

288
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:23,303
No, really, it is.

289
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,902
We checked these out of the hall
of records before coming here.

290
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:32,303
Six months ago, you co-authored policy measures
designed to prevent voting abuses by Gerak's coalition.

291
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:38,103
Four months ago, you voted in favor of increasing the
size of Council to give unrepresented Jaffa a voice,

292
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:42,102
and just three weeks ago, you introduced a motion
to set limits on the Council's legislative power.

293
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:44,402
Are we seeing a pattern here?

294
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:47,303
You believe in democracy, Maz'rai.

295
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:49,903
How else do you explain your actions?

296
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:51,503
I do not deny my beliefs.

297
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:56,262
My thinking on the proper timing and strategy
for implementation is what's changed.

298
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:57,902
Two evenings ago...

299
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,702
do you remember clearly what you did?

300
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:02,903
Bra'tac, I do not remember what I ate yesterday.

301
00:18:02,943 --> 00:18:06,503
That is sad, I admit, but proof
of nothing other than old age.

302
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:10,303
Age has taken away everything
but our wisdom, old friend.

303
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:12,583
<i>Those were your words to me</i>

304
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:15,622
<i>just before
you tabled a referendum for democracy.</i>

305
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:20,403
Tell me one thing that happened the night
before last. Then I will let this rest.

306
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:37,102
Please, leave me.

307
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:40,702
I am weary.

308
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,503
<i>Bra'tac...</i>

309
00:18:58,102 --> 00:18:59,502
We have reached him.

310
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:00,802
Trust me.

311
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,503
Facing the rite of M'al Sharran

312
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,942
is something one must do with clear mind

313
00:19:06,222 --> 00:19:07,702
and conviction.

314
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,503
We must give him time.

315
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:18,942
<i>Dr. Peterson to room 5-B.</i>

316
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:22,102
<i>- Dr. Peterson to room...
- Do you know what I think you're doing?</i>

317
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,902
Sleeping.

318
00:19:25,503 --> 00:19:27,303
I think you're fighting aliens.

319
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:34,503
I think that chunk of metal you've got in
your cranium has caused a lot of damage.

320
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:37,902
I know you weren't test-flying
a plane down in Antarctica.

321
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:41,423
You were fighting an alien armada

322
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:45,503
in human-built alien hybrid fighters,
and we've got, like,

323
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:50,133
a whole fleet of them, and at least
a couple of interstellar battleships.

324
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,703
Whatever you say, man.

325
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:53,102
<i>The info's out there.</i>

326
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:58,503
The military, they couldn't build all that stuff
themselves. They'd have to contract it out.

327
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:03,863
I did some consulting for an aeronautics firm
called Zephyr when I first went on disability.

328
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,182
<i>Come on man,</i>

329
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:08,182
<i>I'm seasoned enough to see through all the</i>

330
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:11,533
<i>bogus cover stories they've been
blowing around the last couple of years.</i>

331
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,543
I mean,

332
00:20:13,023 --> 00:20:16,302
what really happened to that
building in Seattle a couple months back?

333
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:22,103
And that strange new influenza
outbreak that swept the globe?

334
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,703
Didn't that start in a hospital near here?

335
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:29,103
- Look, Ferguson...
- No, I know, I know, you can't tell me.

336
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:31,263
<i>It doesn't really matter. The point is,</i>

337
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:33,302
I know that whatever you're into, it's big.

338
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:37,703
I mean, it's bigger than we ever dreamed of,
even back when we were cadets, and we swore that

339
00:20:37,743 --> 00:20:41,703
<i>blood oath that we'd make it
into the space program or die trying.</i>

340
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:45,902
<i>Look, I'm not some crazy conspiracy nut, Cam.</i>

341
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:47,503
<i>I know.</i>

342
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:52,902
You've got things to do besides
sitting here waiting for me to die.

343
00:20:55,903 --> 00:20:56,703
Go.

344
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:09,502
I find it helps if you hit it.

345
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,503
Oh, that's alright. I probably
shouldn't have any more caffeine.

346
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:16,502
I got the results back from the cat scan.

347
00:21:18,303 --> 00:21:19,102
And?

348
00:21:19,502 --> 00:21:22,703
Well, it pretty much confirmed
Mr. Ferguson's own doctor's findings.

349
00:21:22,743 --> 00:21:26,223
The shrapnel originally lodged itself
against an intracranial artery,

350
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:29,503
<i>and over the course of the next
few years formed the aneurysm.</i>

351
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:31,903
Given its size and relative position,

352
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:34,903
we risk doing more damage
if we attack it surgically.

353
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:38,703
Even an intravascular approach
would likely cause a major rupture.

354
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:40,303
Okay.

355
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:42,303
So, what's the plan?

356
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,702
Well, I know you were hoping for better news, Colonel.
I'm sorry.

357
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:49,103
I'm afraid there are no options.

358
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:51,303
It's only a matter of time.

359
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:04,903
Sorry, Doc, you were wrong.

360
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:07,503
Hitting it doesn't help.

361
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:10,503
I'll pay for that!

362
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:23,503
Thank you.

363
00:22:24,903 --> 00:22:26,302
Now please leave us.

364
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:36,703
You think he did this to himself?

365
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:40,303
He removed his own symbiote.

366
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:42,902
The rite of M'al Sharran.

367
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:45,903
I don't understand.
Why would he do this on his own?

368
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:48,103
I mean, he had to know how dangerous it would be.

369
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:49,303
Indeed.

370
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:52,703
It requires that you bring
yourself to the edge of death

371
00:22:52,743 --> 00:22:55,223
in order to find your own true spirit.

372
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:56,503
Should you fail...

373
00:22:57,103 --> 00:22:59,503
He was ashamed that he'd been brainwashed.

374
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:02,703
<i>If he failed to overcome it, he didn't
want anyone here to save him.</i>

375
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:08,303
I pushed you to this, old friend.

376
00:23:13,263 --> 00:23:14,303
Bra'tac...

377
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:21,503
Kal'el.

378
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:26,863
<i>Bra'tac is tailing Kal'el.</i>

379
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:29,263
<i>He's hopeful it will lead to Teal'c's whereabouts.</i>

380
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:34,183
Colonel Carter is putting together a rescue operation
that we can implement the moment we get confirmation.

381
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:35,303
I'll be there.

382
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:39,743
Under the circumstances, everyone will
understand if you choose to stay back on this one.

383
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:41,223
<i>I'm sorry, Sir,</i>

384
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:43,103
we're talking about Teal'c.

385
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,703
I understand.

386
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:45,903
How's your friend doing?

387
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:48,303
Not so good.

388
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:51,303
On that front, Sir,

389
00:23:52,303 --> 00:23:53,743
there's something I need to ask you.

390
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,903
So, have you given some thought to my proposal?

391
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,503
To be honest, you've looked better, Teal'c.

392
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:10,103
Don't tell me your spirit is waning.

393
00:24:12,303 --> 00:24:14,903
I know you need tretonin to live.

394
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:21,503
Give in. Don't threaten the future
of your people because of personal pride.

395
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:24,303
You are frightened.

396
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:27,103
<i>You seek to control the Jaffa</i>

397
00:24:27,463 --> 00:24:29,183
because you recognize

398
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:30,343
the power

399
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:31,703
of the Ori,

400
00:24:31,743 --> 00:24:33,023
and you are

401
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:34,423
helpless

402
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:36,623
to do anything about it on your

403
00:24:36,663 --> 00:24:37,903
own.

404
00:24:38,703 --> 00:24:44,463
I've tried to be nice. I've tried to present reason,
convince you in a most merciful fashion,

405
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:46,703
but my patience wears thin.

406
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:51,103
Now, rest assured, I will prevail over you
precious Council and control the Jaffa.

407
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:53,303
Ultimately, it is for their own good.

408
00:24:53,503 --> 00:24:55,703
If you keep resisting me,

409
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:58,903
I will have no choice but to let you die.

410
00:25:05,383 --> 00:25:06,583
Cameron...

411
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:08,263
Sam...

412
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:15,223
Bra'tac got us a Gate address.

413
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,223
Kal'el led him to a planet
with a mothership parked on a pyramid.

414
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:20,383
He believes Teal'c's being held there.

415
00:25:20,423 --> 00:25:21,663
That's good news.

416
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:22,743
We're briefing in an hour.

417
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:24,103
I'll be there.

418
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,103
Do you need some help with this?

419
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:28,823
No, I've got it.

420
00:25:30,343 --> 00:25:32,263
Does this make me a hypocrite?

421
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:34,663
I told my dad.

422
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:36,903
He was getting a Tok'ra symbiote.

423
00:25:36,944 --> 00:25:37,823
Pete...

424
00:25:38,023 --> 00:25:39,463
Got shot

425
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:44,023
by a Goa'uld with a laser blaster.
That's not really the point.

426
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:46,303
I mean, about using that thing.

427
00:25:46,743 --> 00:25:49,183
I know, after what happened to me, I was

428
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:51,303
opposed to anyone ever having

429
00:25:51,344 --> 00:25:55,583
anything to do with that technology,
and now I'm going out of my way to make use of it.

430
00:25:56,863 --> 00:25:59,743
Is showing your friend
the truth gonna make him feel any better?

431
00:25:59,984 --> 00:26:02,744
He wants to know
I'm not going to be burdened with guilt

432
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:05,823
over the fact that he died because of me.

433
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,123
The truth gonna to change that?

434
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:12,764
Not for me.

435
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:17,503
Hey.

436
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:18,463
Hey.

437
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:20,524
So you're finally getting the hell out of here?

438
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:23,263
<i>- Actually, yes.
- Good.</i>

439
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:26,143
I might not be here when you get back, though.

440
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:28,063
Don't you quit on me.

441
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:30,143
No, I just meant that I'm checking out...

442
00:26:30,383 --> 00:26:31,783
<i>of the hospital.</i>

443
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:34,744
I'm going home.
There's nothing more they can do for me here.

444
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,383
What is that?

445
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:39,783
It's a little something
I picked up on another planet.

446
00:26:39,823 --> 00:26:41,983
Yes, very good. That's hilarious.

447
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:44,783
You know, you never really could tell a joke...

448
00:26:45,703 --> 00:26:47,223
We've made some modifications

449
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:49,663
since we got our hands on this, but basically,

450
00:26:49,703 --> 00:26:51,183
here's how it works.

451
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:56,063
Some of my memories from the last year
have been downloaded into this device.

452
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:58,144
Attach these leads to your head,

453
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:01,584
and you get to experience
some of the things I've gone through.

454
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:04,024
You're serious?

455
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:06,224
You want to know the truth.

456
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:09,143
I'm gonna show it to you.

457
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,703
You can continue to resist me and die,

458
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:20,583
or you can take the tretonin and save yourself.

459
00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:22,183
Join me,

460
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:24,263
and you will save many more.

461
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,064
It's up to you.

462
00:27:35,263 --> 00:27:38,103
<i>Mayday, mayday.
We are going in! Repeat, we are going in!</i>

463
00:27:38,343 --> 00:27:40,333
<i>Colonel, you're here to lead SG-1.</i>

464
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:41,703
<i>- Teal'c!
- Daniel Jackson!</i>

465
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:44,913
<i>- Hey, we've got a little problem in here!
- You done this before?</i>

466
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:48,334
<i>- Fight a knight in armor? No, can't say that I have.
- It appears to be a hologram.</i>

467
00:27:48,344 --> 00:27:49,503
<i>A hologram?</i>

468
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:52,374
<i>And we do not want to get into a God-off.</i>

469
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:55,343
<i>These priors want to show us
they're gonna play hardball.</i>

470
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,904
<i>The mark 9 gave them almost...</i>

471
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:01,303
What are you doing? Why did you stop?

472
00:28:01,423 --> 00:28:03,584
Teal'c is in trouble.

473
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:06,623
There's a rescue op about to leave.
I have to go.

474
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:08,423
Go save him, for God sakes.

475
00:28:08,663 --> 00:28:12,863
Yeah, I just don't want you to give up,
not when there are so many possibilities out there.

476
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:14,144
Just get out of here.

477
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:16,823
Look, before I go, I have to say something.

478
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,263
You may not like it,

479
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:21,303
but I'm gonna have
to live with it no matter what you say or do.

480
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:23,143
I'm sorry.

481
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:26,464
I'm doing what I'm doing, and you're not

482
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:30,304
because I acted rashly.

483
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:32,303
I'm a hothead,

484
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:33,943
<i>and you're suffering because of it.</i>

485
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:36,263
No, you're doing what
you're doing because of who you are.

486
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:40,304
Yeah, I'm impatient. I lose control.
I'm not particularly fond of that side of myself.

487
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:41,473
I didn't mean that.

488
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:43,763
When you see an opportunity, you take it.

489
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:46,624
With the kind of things that you
and me were asked to do, that you're doing now,

490
00:28:47,063 --> 00:28:48,853
I mean, you've got to be a little angry,

491
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:50,423
<i>you've got to be out of control.</i>

492
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:53,003
<i>I mean, if you think too much,
you're just gonna freeze up.</i>

493
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:57,143
My God, you... are going to other
planets through a freaking wormhole!

494
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,904
<i>You have be a little nuts.</i>

495
00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:01,783
I just don't want to screw up again.

496
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,344
Well, you'd better not. This...

497
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:06,384
Teal'c, he seems like a pretty decent guy, or...

498
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,063
alien, whatever he is.

499
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:10,264
<i>- Jaffa.
- Jaffa.</i>

500
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:15,383
Just be yourself, Cam.
Trust me, that's pretty damn good.

501
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,343
Thanks.

502
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:26,144
I would have done it for anyone.
You know that.

503
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:28,423
It's part of the job.

504
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:31,584
Yeah, it is.

505
00:29:36,664 --> 00:29:38,744
Can I use this thing a little more?

506
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:42,584
Play.

507
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:44,504
Stop.

508
00:29:45,024 --> 00:29:46,223
Rewind?

509
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:51,624
Way cool.

510
00:30:05,863 --> 00:30:07,144
Hey.

511
00:30:07,783 --> 00:30:09,904
When you get to the part with the flight attendant?

512
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:10,864
Yeah?

513
00:30:11,224 --> 00:30:13,144
Skip over that. That's private.

514
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:15,624
I promise nothing.

515
00:30:21,704 --> 00:30:26,783
At which point,
we should receive radio confirmation from
Bra'tac that the Gate on P2M-903 is clear.

516
00:30:26,823 --> 00:30:30,383
We can expect intense but limited
resistance upon approaching the mothership.

517
00:30:30,543 --> 00:30:33,263
It will be visible roughly half a mile from the Gate.

518
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:36,263
Bra'tac should be able to provide aerial cover.

519
00:30:37,783 --> 00:30:39,263
Thank you for joining us, Colonel.

520
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:40,344
Sir.

521
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:48,183
We will secure the Gate,

522
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,464
proceed to the pyramid,
gain access to the mothership,

523
00:30:50,604 --> 00:30:52,053
and locate and retrieve Teal'c.

524
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:54,624
Keep in mind all evidence suggests
Teal'c's been brainwashed.

525
00:30:54,863 --> 00:30:58,104
There's no guarantee he's even
gonna cooperate with this rescue.

526
00:30:58,224 --> 00:30:59,903
Teal'c is family.

527
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:03,944
I don't like people screwing with my family.

528
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,703
We're with you, Sir.

529
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:09,944
Let's bring him home.

530
00:31:49,464 --> 00:31:51,464
Shall we try again?

531
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:08,344
Alkesh shak'tel!

532
00:32:22,384 --> 00:32:23,224
Colonel Carter...

533
00:32:23,424 --> 00:32:24,783
<i>the Gate has been cleared.</i>

534
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,384
Alright, let's go. Move out.

535
00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:28,144
Let's go! Move, move, move!

536
00:33:06,863 --> 00:33:08,663
Bra'tac, watch your back!

537
00:33:22,184 --> 00:33:24,304
Go, go, go, go!

538
00:33:38,344 --> 00:33:39,344
Mitchell!

539
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:37,504
Cam wait for backup!

540
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:53,944
I see you're feeling better.

541
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:58,384
Seems your friends have come to rescue you.
I expected nothing less.

542
00:34:58,424 --> 00:35:01,624
Unfortunately, it is too little, too late.

543
00:35:06,183 --> 00:35:08,264
The mothership's engines are powering up.

544
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:09,784
It's taking off.

545
00:35:28,024 --> 00:35:29,464
I'm curious,

546
00:35:30,424 --> 00:35:32,784
are you merely feigning allegiance?

547
00:35:33,024 --> 00:35:35,984
Waiting for the right time to strike at me?

548
00:35:51,764 --> 00:35:52,844
Dammit!

549
00:35:53,824 --> 00:35:54,704
Shel kree!

550
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,024
Kill him.

551
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:18,744
Teal'c.

552
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:30,784
Shel noc!

553
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:42,224
Took you guys long enough.

554
00:36:44,424 --> 00:36:45,904
Not you guys.

555
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:51,984
The rest of the Jaffa guard are retreating back here.

556
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:54,304
I can't get these damn rings to work.

557
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:57,704
If we all go, we could be cut off
with no way of getting back off the ship.

558
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:00,064
You go. We got your back.

559
00:37:00,104 --> 00:37:01,104
You sure about that?

560
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:03,904
- Am I gonna be able to stop you?
- I don't think so.

561
00:37:04,144 --> 00:37:06,144
I'm in a bad mood today.

562
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,704
Teal'c...

563
00:37:30,104 --> 00:37:33,144
- you must resist.
- Silence, old man.

564
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:35,704
Your words are meaningless.

565
00:37:56,144 --> 00:37:58,585
I take it this means I don't have to shoot you.

566
00:37:59,184 --> 00:38:00,505
You do not.

567
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:02,384
Good.

568
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:07,064
Sounds like somebody's still driving
this rust bucket. We should get the hell
out of here before they jump to hyperspace.

569
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:08,204
Indeed.

570
00:38:22,704 --> 00:38:23,904
Would you please stop?

571
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:26,344
It's kind of making me nervous.

572
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:27,544
Sorry.

573
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,664
It's just that

574
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:31,624
the implications of this
referendum are tremendous. I mean...

575
00:38:32,384 --> 00:38:35,224
we take democracy for granted, but these Jaffa...

576
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,824
The referendum passed.

577
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:51,224
For the first time in our history,
we will have leaders voted upon by every free Jaffa.

578
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:52,944
Congratulations.

579
00:38:53,104 --> 00:38:54,744
Welcome to the club.

580
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:57,784
Two months from now, we hold general elections.

581
00:38:58,184 --> 00:39:00,424
Well, let the campaigning begin.

582
00:39:01,265 --> 00:39:04,024
What about those Jaffa
affected by Ba'al's brainwashing?

583
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:08,304
It will take much
dedication on their part to overcome,

584
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:10,384
but with our help,

585
00:39:10,904 --> 00:39:12,505
they shall prevail.

586
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,824
Where is colonel Mitchell?

587
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:33,544
Colonel Mitchell...

588
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:41,024
you should know that your actions were
instrumental in bringing about a successful
vote for a democratic Jaffa nation today.

589
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:43,264
Yeah, I heard about that. That's great.

590
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:45,025
Sorry I missed it.

591
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,184
I understand,

592
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:50,464
and I am sorry about your friend.

593
00:39:51,144 --> 00:39:52,464
Yeah, I was...

594
00:39:53,665 --> 00:39:55,705
hoping to see him again.

595
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:01,424
I am in your debt, Colonel Mitchell,

596
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:03,744
not only for saving my life,

597
00:40:04,164 --> 00:40:06,284
but for saving the life of Bra'tac as well.

598
00:40:06,545 --> 00:40:10,624
Teal'c, no offense,
but I would have done the same for anyone.

599
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:13,344
You don't owe me a thing.

600
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:18,225
We watch each others' backs
because that's our job, right?

601
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:21,304
Indeed.

602
00:40:27,304 --> 00:40:28,104
Hey,

603
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,624
<i>Teal'c...</i>

604
00:40:32,824 --> 00:40:35,345
how'd you resist the brainwashing?

605
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:36,344
I figure I might

606
00:40:36,384 --> 00:40:40,825
be in that situation someday, and I don't reckon
I'm going through the rite of M'al Sharran.

607
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:45,024
To resist the influence of others,

608
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:47,504
knowledge of oneself

609
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,384
is most important.

610
00:40:52,144 --> 00:40:53,544
Right.

611
00:40:54,624 --> 00:40:56,104
Thanks.

612
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:02,704
Yeah...

613
00:41:02,824 --> 00:41:04,425
I'm working on it.
