1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:08,199
Previously on "Stargate SG-1".:

2
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:11,163
- Who are you people?
- We are replicators.

3
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,078
- The others would destroy me.
- Not if you came with us.

4
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:15,154
You would do that?

5
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,604
- Major Carter was beamed away.
- The replicators must have her.

6
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:24,402
I imagine you never
expected to see me again.

7
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,844
I know who you are.
I just don't understand why.

8
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:33,519
Because I love you.

9
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:37,634
You know why my friends
won't stop just to save me?

10
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:39,602
They know, when it comes down to it,

11
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:44,236
I would rather be dead
than be trapped like this forever.

12
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:13,918
- So, what's the word?
- Test flights were successful.

13
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:17,395
- The Asgard hyperdrive is ready to go.
- When are they leaving?

14
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:23,196
They're stocking the ship and picking
the crew now. You want to go, don't you?

15
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:26,834
It's Atlantis. It's everything
we've worked for for years.

16
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:31,237
I know what you mean. Unfortunately,
I think General O'Neill has other ideas.

17
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:36,001
- Let me guess. He needs you here.
- His words were, "Over my dead body."

18
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:38,883
But I was actually talking
about you, me, and Teal'c.

19
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,718
He might be persuaded to let one of us go.

20
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:44,194
And you'd be OK if that was me?

21
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:48,756
Of course, Daniel.
You are the expert on the Ancients.

22
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:55,277
Unscheduled offworld activation.

23
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:01,994
What have you got there, Walter?

24
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:04,235
Receiving IDC.

25
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:07,721
- Doesn't clear.
- Why not?

26
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:10,797
- Looks like it's an old one.
- Missing SG personnel?

27
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:12,000
Negative.

28
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:19,161
It looks like it's yours, ma'am.
Or, at least, it was.

29
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:22,362
It's been invalid for four months.

30
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:24,675
Receiving text message.

31
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,434
Sir, I think we'd better check this out.

32
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:33,800
Prepare MALP.

33
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:35,762
Yes, sir.

34
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,876
What do we know of this gate address?

35
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:51,085
Nothing, other than the fact
it's on the outer edge of our galaxy.

36
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:00,395
Chevron seven locked.

37
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:06,844
Outgoing wormhole established.

38
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:10,361
- Siler?
- MALP is prepped and ready to go, sir.

39
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:14,003
Go ahead.

40
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:29,154
MALP is en route.

41
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,362
MALP has reached its destination.

42
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:51,158
Carter?

43
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:53,475
We are receiving MALP telemetry, sir.

44
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,635
Signal is five-by-five.

45
00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:01,484
Video's working fine.
There's just nothing to see.

46
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,593
Switching to IR.

47
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:10,559
Wait a second.

48
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:15,996
- What's that?
- Switching off IR, going to white light.

49
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:24,276
That's me.

50
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:42,403
All right, you've got our attention.

51
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:46,363
- Who are you?
- My name is Samantha Carter.

52
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:50,554
All right, we got a little conflict
with that statement.

53
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:53,876
- We've already got one here.
- There are two of us.

54
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:56,001
If only.

55
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:01,683
Where are you from?
How did you contact us?

56
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:04,643
Strange. I recognise my voice.

57
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:09,205
I was made in Samantha Carter's image.

58
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,483
I know what she knows.
I feel what she feels.

59
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:17,478
You were made. Who made you?

60
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:20,204
The one you call Fifth.

61
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:22,560
Oh, my God. She's a replicator.

62
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:28,078
You are surprised by
my arrival in your galaxy.

63
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:30,998
I come in advance of others.
They will be here soon.

64
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:35,920
- For what reason have you contacted us?
- I need your help.

65
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:38,314
I wish to be destroyed.

66
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:44,000
You have a weapon capable of severing
the kiron pathways that link my cells.

67
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:48,203
The effect would be
instantaneous and painless.

68
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:50,082
You folks can feel pain?

69
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,799
I can feel a lot of things.

70
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:57,924
I know you hate and fear
the replicators, and with good reason.

71
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:01,680
- So this should be easy for you.
- Yeah, well...

72
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,957
We'll have to get back to you on this.

73
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:23,880
So, the universe is a big place, right?
Really big.

74
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:27,082
Tons of galaxies out there everywhere?

75
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:30,123
- Hundreds of millions.
- So why this one?

76
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:34,084
- I think it might be personal, sir.
- Personal? In what way?

77
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:36,918
While Fifth may lead
an army of advanced machines,

78
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:40,475
deep down he's emotionally immature,
like an adolescent boy.

79
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:41,884
And...

80
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:44,433
he has feelings for me.

81
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,196
Would that be why
he created one in your image?

82
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:49,718
I imagine so.

83
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:53,957
Replicators have never before tried
to impersonate a specific individual.

84
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:57,833
- This represents a threat to security.
- It could be a problem offworld.

85
00:07:57,925 --> 00:08:01,361
Our scans would detect them
if they tried to come through the gate.

86
00:08:01,445 --> 00:08:04,403
We've got the disrupter.
Let's give her what she wants.

87
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:07,636
- I think that might be a little hasty, sir.
- Carter.

88
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:11,923
I'm not saying we don't do it. I'm just
suggesting that we talk to her first.

89
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:16,442
If Fifth is coming to this galaxy, she could
provide us with valuable intelligence.

90
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:20,040
- It's pretty clear they've had a falling-out.
- Unless it is a ruse.

91
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,958
If something goes wrong,
we pull the trigger.

92
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,843
Either way, I think we need
to meet her face to face.

93
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:29,315
- I'm not letting her on the base.
- We could use the Alpha site.

94
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:32,875
Skeleton crew, security personnel only.

95
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,877
Fine.

96
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:59,402
Incoming wormhole.

97
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:35,723
I know you. Your name is Teal'c.

98
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:39,639
- You have been given Carter's memories.
- Yes.

99
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:42,478
But you are not Samantha Carter.

100
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,834
- That way.
- You're not using the weapon?

101
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:51,838
Colonel Carter wishes to speak
with you first. But know this:

102
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,361
if you make one false move,
I will destroy you.

103
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,034
Where is Samantha Carter?

104
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:18,636
I'm here.

105
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:40,837
We're not going to speak face to face?

106
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:45,924
For the moment,
this will have to be good enough.

107
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:48,314
I thought you would shoot me as I arrived.

108
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:51,317
Maybe you overestimated our fear of you.

109
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:54,761
Or underestimated your curiosity.

110
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,959
I understand you
more than you know, Sam.

111
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:04,402
I don't just have your memories.
I have your thought patterns.

112
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:06,794
My mind was modelled after yours.

113
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:09,236
Is that why you left Fifth?

114
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:12,123
You know me as well as I know you.

115
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:16,475
Fifth created you to be like me.
He knew this would happen.

116
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:18,874
Not at first.

117
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:21,923
He tried to isolate
aspects ofyour personality,

118
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:28,001
selected memories and feelings ofhis
choosing slowly given to me over time.

119
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:35,162
I don't understand.

120
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:36,997
You will.

121
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:38,962
I'm afraid.

122
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:41,240
There's no need to be.

123
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:44,362
Who am I?

124
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:46,640
You are not yet complete.

125
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:50,637
I'm here for you. I will help you.

126
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:56,716
Take my hand.

127
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:10,435
Trust me.

128
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:19,963
He taught me, moulded me,
showed me who I was.

129
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:24,359
You have memories of my past
that go back before I met Fifth?

130
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:25,878
Yes.

131
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:27,921
But it's hard to explain.

132
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:30,838
My first memory
is of waking up in that room,

133
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:34,918
suddenly becoming conscious,
but I immediately knew how to talk.

134
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:38,998
Soon, other memories started
coming to me. Little things.

135
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:41,394
Stories, songs.

136
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:44,841
The smell of the attic in the house
where we used to live.

137
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:47,598
The day my mother died.

138
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:51,203
I know it's not real.
I've never even set foot on Earth.

139
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:55,563
But I have this image of lying
under the willow tree in our back yard.

140
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:59,877
It's a sunny day, but when I close
my eyes, the wind in the leaves sounds...

141
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:01,762
Exactly like rain.

142
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:06,760
What Fifth didn't realise
was the things that drew him to you

143
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:11,361
were inseparable from those that made
you reject him and the life he offered.

144
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:14,118
So you rejected him, too.

145
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:17,993
Who I am and what I am
are in contradiction.

146
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:23,404
- No one can live like this.
- There are other ways to live.

147
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:27,603
Not for long.
I know exactly what's going to happen.

148
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:33,157
He'll come here, and he'll take this galaxy,
and you won't be able to stop him.

149
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:37,160
- I don't wanna live to see that.
- We have the disrupter.

150
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:40,601
The Asgard can amplify its effects
to prevent an attack.

151
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:46,157
You're wrong. Fifth made adjustments to
himselfand all the replicators except me.

152
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:49,203
They're now immune to your disrupter.

153
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,515
They're coming, and you can't stop them.

154
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:05,233
Is there a chance she's bluffing?

155
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:09,719
Anything's possible at this point.
I don't see what she has to gain by it.

156
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:12,319
She doesn't want Fifth to succeed.

157
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:16,557
- Yeah, so she says.
- Ifshe's lying, we don't have a problem.

158
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:20,877
Why would he make all the other bugs
immune to the disrupter, but not her?

159
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:25,163
Maybe he wanted her to feel inferior,
or he wanted her to be afraid ofus.

160
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:28,078
Maybe he anticipated
she would come to me for help.

161
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:30,838
Carter, if that weapon doesn't work...

162
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:35,601
Yes, sir, I know. We need to contact Thor
and apprise him ofthe situation.

163
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:39,439
Ifthe disrupter needs to be re-engineered,
we're gonna need his help.

164
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:43,120
In the meantime, I think
we should continue the interrogation.

165
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:47,164
She could still provide us
with valuable information.

166
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:49,361
All right.

167
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:52,118
Just keep in mind how this has to end.

168
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:56,198
Don't worry, sir.
We will complete the mission.

169
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:01,717
- How many ships does Fifth command?
- I don't know.

170
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:04,365
How many human-form replicators
has he created?

171
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:08,438
- I don't know.
- You're all linked. You share information.

172
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:12,040
The only way I could escape
was to sever myself from the connection.

173
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,959
- Why should we believe you?
- I won't answer any more questions.

174
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:18,559
Ifyou don't want
Fifth to succeed, help us.

175
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:20,476
I can't.

176
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:25,480
I can't betray my own kind,
but I can't be like them either.

177
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:27,920
Do what you came here to do.

178
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:37,596
If I have to make you do it, then so be it.

179
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:39,835
- Teal'c, wait.
- Fire the weapon.

180
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:42,359
- Is this what you want?
- I don't have a choice.

181
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:44,913
I will destroy you.

182
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:47,314
I know.

183
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,361
- So be it.
- Teal'c, wait.

184
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:52,755
Just stop for a second.

185
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:58,877
- You don't wanna do this.
- We know there's no other way.

186
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,195
That's not true.

187
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:04,277
Now you're lying to me
the way you lied to Fifth.

188
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:07,004
You're not like him. I can see that.

189
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:10,842
You don't understand.
You don't know what he did to me.

190
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:14,281
Then show me.
Teal'c, it's all right.

191
00:16:17,165 --> 00:16:19,156
Show me.

192
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:42,602
Sam, good to have you back. How'd it go?

193
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:52,478
Security breach!
Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.

194
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:55,796
All security teams to the gate room!

195
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:36,162
Finish him!

196
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:38,395
Do it.

197
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:42,194
Finish him. You must break with
your old life for your new life to begin.

198
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:44,401
Do not disappoint me.

199
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,074
You have done very well.

200
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:14,876
Soon you will be ready
to take your place by my side.

201
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:27,198
Enough.

202
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:32,637
- I didn't hurt her.
- Colonel Carter.

203
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:36,355
Are you unharmed?

204
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:38,640
Yeah. I'm OK.

205
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:43,515
Now you understand. I can't go back
to him, and I can't let him find me.

206
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:47,962
- We can protect you if you help us.
- What do you mean?

207
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:51,321
Tell us how he modified himself
and the other replicators.

208
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:54,954
- Help us make the disrupter work again.
- Even if I did,

209
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:56,524
you can't stop a ship with it.

210
00:18:56,605 --> 00:19:01,281
The Asgard have developed a system of
satellites that deploy the beam in space.

211
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:03,435
It's your only chance to get out of this.

212
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:07,677
I want you to destroy me.
I can't help you destroy all the others.

213
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:11,280
Yes, you can.
He doesn't control you, not any more.

214
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:13,083
Colonel Carter.

215
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,800
May I have a word?

216
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:22,676
Sergeant.

217
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:39,516
Are you certain you are unharmed?

218
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:44,360
It was a little intense, but I'm fine. It was
the only way I could get her to trust me.

219
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:46,959
We need all the information
she can give us.

220
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:49,843
- We cannot let her live.
- I know.

221
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:53,281
- Did she sense your true intentions?
- We weren't in my mind.

222
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:57,677
- Nevertheless, it was a risk.
- I figured we didn't have anything to lose.

223
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:02,202
Like you said, either way,
we can't let her live.

224
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:19,079
The link is weak. Are you all right?

225
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,564
Yes.

226
00:20:20,645 --> 00:20:23,557
I'm minimising output to avoid detection.

227
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:26,284
Have you made any progress?

228
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:29,516
They're beginning to trust me.

229
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,960
I am pleased.

230
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:33,876
But I need more time.

231
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:37,716
I understand.

232
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:50,357
- The design is so...
- Advanced?

233
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:55,882
- I was going to say "foreign".
- It is from Ancient technology.

234
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:58,763
How were you able
to create a working prototype?

235
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:03,236
Thor accessed the specifications for
the disrupter from O'Neill's subconscious.

236
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:05,919
- While you were aboard Fifth's ship.
- Right.

237
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:10,556
Fifth has a fair knowledge of Ancient
technology taken from Asgard ships.

238
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,239
Is that how he countered
the disrupter's effects?

239
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:18,957
He introduced a cipher into the pathways
that control the cohesion of replicators.

240
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,400
Then he considered
coming to your galaxy.

241
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:26,001
He took the risk because he was confident
he would be immune to the weapon.

242
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,519
- Do you know the cipher?
- No.

243
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:32,439
Fifth kept it from me. He was beginning
to sense that I might betray him.

244
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:35,244
I was too much like you.

245
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:38,873
If it's in the programming
of all replicators,

246
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,674
presumably you could access it
through the subspace link.

247
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:45,404
If I searched for it myself,
it could take days.

248
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:48,522
I'd be sifting through
an unimaginable amount of data.

249
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:51,915
- But it is possible.
- You don't understand.

250
00:21:52,005 --> 00:21:54,439
He'd find me.

251
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:56,993
If you find the cipher, we can protect you.

252
00:21:57,085 --> 00:22:00,714
And if I don't? You of all people
know what would happen.

253
00:22:00,805 --> 00:22:03,797
He would tear my mind apart
to make me accept him.

254
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:08,003
If he gets here before we can modify
the weapon, we'll use it to destroy you.

255
00:22:08,085 --> 00:22:12,363
Either way, he will never
get his hands on you again.

256
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:23,601
There's a subspace link between
all replicators, like an Internet connection.

257
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:26,404
If she taps into it,
she should access the cipher.

258
00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:28,999
She'll also be giving away her position.

259
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:32,282
It'll take time for Fifth to detect
her presence on the link.

260
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:35,675
- If she can isolate the program first...
- That's a big if.

261
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:39,883
It's risky, sir. I realise that.
But I think it's the only way.

262
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:44,595
While we're waiting for her to find the
cipher, we can run tests on the disrupter,

263
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:47,802
analyse the energy output
to create a modulation program.

264
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:51,036
And we need the Asgard
to send us a disrupter satellite.

265
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,241
I've already talked to 'em.

266
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:56,681
It'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.

267
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:05,399
- I will use an F-302 to place it in orbit.
- I hope you guys know what you're doing.

268
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:16,675
Diagnostics are online.

269
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:18,756
We're ready.

270
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:35,039
- The calibration is off.
- Increasing by a factor of ten. Once more.

271
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:41,998
That should do it.

272
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:46,920
- Now we need to process all the raw data.
- That's a lot of information.

273
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:50,793
It will take some time before we can
compute a modulation program...

274
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:54,275
Unscheduled offworld activation.

275
00:23:55,485 --> 00:24:00,161
- This is Carter. What's happening?
- Stand by, ma'am.

276
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:04,841
- We're receiving a signal. It's the Asgard.
- Understood.

277
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,994
- We need that satellite deployed soon.
- Indeed.

278
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:11,076
Sergeant.

279
00:24:13,965 --> 00:24:17,002
If she were gonna make a move,
she would have done it by now.

280
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:18,518
Perhaps.

281
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:21,073
But it is best to be certain.

282
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:31,597
- I have Commander Thor on audio, sir.
- Greetings, Thor.

283
00:24:31,685 --> 00:24:35,678
Greetings, Teal'c. The disrupter
satellite is ready for transport.

284
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,914
Very well.

285
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:40,998
The most effective deployment is
geosynchronous orbit above your base,

286
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:46,159
at an altitude of33, 785km
with zero inclination.

287
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:51,437
- Understood.
- The satellite is en route now.

288
00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:59,523
Once you have the proper
new modulation program,

289
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:02,073
you can upload it
from your ground station.

290
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:05,794
Ofcourse, ifyou do not have
the program before Fifth's arrival,

291
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:08,035
the satellite will be useless.

292
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:11,401
- Of that I am aware.
- Good luck.

293
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:26,042
I understand Teal'c's concerns about me.

294
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,798
I'm a little surprised
you don't feel the same way.

295
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:32,355
Teal'c doesn't know
what you've been through. I do.

296
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:39,841
It wasn't just what I showed you, was it?
You experienced it yourself.

297
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:41,153
Yeah.

298
00:25:42,485 --> 00:25:47,161
That's how I know there's no way
you could be working with Fifth.

299
00:25:55,245 --> 00:25:57,236
What is it?

300
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:02,159
He's found me. He's on his way.

301
00:26:02,245 --> 00:26:04,918
What about the cipher?
Did you find it yet?

302
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:07,838
- No, I'm still searching.
- How much time do we have?

303
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:12,555
At maximum speed,
he'll be here in less than two hours.

304
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:24,483
- Have you acquired the information?
- I'm still analysing the disrupter.

305
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:27,159
Soon I will be able
to create an effective cipher.

306
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:30,476
- If I arrive before you've completed...
- Don't worry.

307
00:26:30,565 --> 00:26:33,716
They won't fire unless I tell them
the weapon's remodulated.

308
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:37,514
Humans can be unpredictable,
particularly when they're desperate.

309
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:41,439
I know what I'm doing. I'm giving her
just enough to keep her hopes up.

310
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:44,881
The one called O'Neill leads the humans.

311
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:47,718
It was he who ordered
Samantha Carter to betray me.

312
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:49,796
But he trusts her.

313
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:51,716
He'll listen to her.

314
00:26:54,645 --> 00:26:59,036
I'm pulling the plug. Finish off
the replicator and evacuate the base.

315
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,593
- It's too late for that, sir.
- Carter.

316
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:05,803
If he finds nothing here, he's not gonna
just turn around and leave the galaxy.

317
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:08,718
He's tracking her,
zeroing in on her position.

318
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:13,003
That's only part of why he's coming.
Think about it. What do replicators do?

319
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:17,522
They seek out high-level civilisations
and consume their technology.

320
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:19,675
- Goa'uld.
- Exactly.

321
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:24,839
A race that uses all kinds of advanced
technology, culled from multiple sources.

322
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:27,723
It's like a banquet for the replicators.

323
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:30,603
Once they're here,
they're not going anywhere.

324
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:36,043
If she can isolate the cipher soon, we may
still have time to remodulate the disrupter.

325
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:38,798
I'll give you one hour. One.

326
00:27:38,885 --> 00:27:42,958
- Thank you. I'd better get back to the lab.
- I will deploy the satellite.

327
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:44,239
T.

328
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:46,520
Hold on a second.

329
00:27:49,405 --> 00:27:53,114
- Proceed, O'Neill.
- I need you to be honest with me.

330
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:57,642
Is Carter letting herself
get too involved in this one?

331
00:27:57,725 --> 00:28:00,842
Carter and the replicator
share thoughts and memories.

332
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:05,680
It is understandable that a certain
sympathy would develop between them.

333
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:06,914
Can't have that.

334
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:11,237
I do not believe Carter would allow
these feelings to interfere with her duties.

335
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:13,475
Fair enough.

336
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:17,877
But when the time comes,
I want you to finish thejob.

337
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:19,956
Understood.

338
00:28:31,285 --> 00:28:34,755
All right, we're running out of time.
We need that...

339
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:38,759
What is it?

340
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:40,881
I found the cipher.

341
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:44,844
I'm downloading it now
from the subspace link.

342
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:53,842
- I have it.
- We need to load it into the mainframe.

343
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:56,314
It'll require three terabytes of memory.

344
00:28:56,405 --> 00:29:00,239
That shouldn't be a problem.
But how do you plan to input the data?

345
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:02,316
Directly.

346
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:13,242
Right.

347
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:20,521
Passing 25km.

348
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:23,403
Speed, 5,000kph and accelerating.

349
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:26,045
- Acknowledged.
- What's your status?

350
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:30,721
He's on course for optimum
deployment position in six minutes.

351
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:33,000
- Teal'c, this is Carter.
- Proceed.

352
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:37,363
We've got the cipher. Soon we should
have the program ready for upload.

353
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:40,437
That is indeed good news. Well done.

354
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:44,243
- We are nearing your position.
- I know.

355
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,804
Do the humans suspect?

356
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:49,514
They're proceeding to deploy
an Asgard disrupter satellite.

357
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:52,119
They have no idea.

358
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:04,119
Flight. I am approaching
optimum deployment position.

359
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:07,595
Copy that, Teal'c. ODP in 15 seconds.

360
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:12,276
Final course correction... now.

361
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:15,880
Tracking shows you are on course.
Inclination?

362
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:17,796
Inclination...

363
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:19,318
zero.

364
00:30:19,405 --> 00:30:23,193
Copy. ODP in five seconds on my mark.

365
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:24,400
Five.

366
00:30:24,485 --> 00:30:25,600
Four.

367
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:26,754
Three.

368
00:30:26,845 --> 00:30:28,119
Two.

369
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:29,684
One.

370
00:30:29,765 --> 00:30:30,914
Mark.

371
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:38,320
Satellite away.

372
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:42,843
- Receiving transmission.
- Patch it through.

373
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,916
Yes, ma'am.

374
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:53,917
Telemetry established. Good job, Teal'c.

375
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:56,838
Copy, Flight. Returning to base.

376
00:30:57,285 --> 00:31:00,595
The deployment went well, I take it.

377
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:02,915
That's right. We did our part.

378
00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:05,075
And I've done mine.

379
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:10,842
- You've finished the calculations?
- The modulation is complete.

380
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:17,194
With this program, you should be able
to destroy any replicators you encounter.

381
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:19,480
There's no way to test it.

382
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:23,277
If I had more time,
I could run a series of simulations,

383
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:28,439
but you'd never really know for sure
until you tried to use it.

384
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:42,236
Uplink initiated.

385
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:49,682
There's a lot of data. It'll take about
15 minutes to remodulate the satellite.

386
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:52,396
Proximity alert.

387
00:31:55,525 --> 00:31:58,676
Scanner has picked up
a ship on course for this base.

388
00:31:58,765 --> 00:32:01,233
Analysing energy signature.

389
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:04,516
I don't know what it is.

390
00:32:04,605 --> 00:32:06,323
I do.

391
00:32:06,405 --> 00:32:08,760
It's a replicator ship.

392
00:32:09,685 --> 00:32:12,483
He got here sooner than I thought.

393
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:28,243
- The weapon will not be effective in time.
- I know.

394
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:34,915
All personnel begin evacuation
procedures. Repeat, begin evacuation.

395
00:32:35,005 --> 00:32:39,715
Download the modulation program into
a portable drive and erase everything else.

396
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:42,763
- Yes, ma'am.
- What of the replicator?

397
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:45,760
We're taking her with us.

398
00:32:45,845 --> 00:32:48,643
The disrupter. Vacate the room.

399
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:56,519
Teal'c, what are you doing?

400
00:32:56,605 --> 00:32:58,721
- We cannot bring her to Earth.
- Teal'c.

401
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:01,797
- We have the modulation program.
- We haven't tested it.

402
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:04,957
What if Fifth figures out
what we were trying to do here?

403
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:08,276
O'Neill would never allow
a replicator access to SGC.

404
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:11,960
Yes, he would,
if he knew what was at stake.

405
00:33:12,045 --> 00:33:15,754
The Asgard satellite is armed.
You said the humans wouldn't fire.

406
00:33:15,845 --> 00:33:20,361
They won't.
They still think the weapon is ineffective.

407
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:23,517
They're even more gullible than you.

408
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:26,677
Colonel Carter.

409
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:30,475
What are you doing?

410
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:33,318
What I came here to do.

411
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:37,717
- She fired the weapon.
- The replicator ship is breaking up.

412
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:44,194
Why?

413
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:47,755
You should know.
You made me what I am.

414
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:05,599
- The ship is destroyed.
- That's impossible.

415
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:09,394
- Did we finish the upload?
- Not even close.

416
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:11,601
You were right about one thing.

417
00:34:11,685 --> 00:34:16,315
I was never working with Fifth,
although he didn't know it.

418
00:34:39,725 --> 00:34:41,602
Ow!

419
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:48,202
That's better. Now
we can take our time and have a little talk.

420
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:51,595
Of course, only a few seconds
will pass in the real world.

421
00:34:51,685 --> 00:34:53,641
Why did you bring me here?

422
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:58,674
I wanted to thank you. You gave me
the opportunity to study the disrupter,

423
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:01,882
and that allowed me
to make myself immune to its effects.

424
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:04,433
- There never was a cipher.
- Until now.

425
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:07,198
I've already begun
uploading it into the link.

426
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:12,279
Soon all my brethren will have the new
program, and they will be unstoppable.

427
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:15,243
- And you'll be their leader.
- That's right.

428
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:18,362
So this was all a setup.
You just wanted to get rid of Fifth.

429
00:35:18,445 --> 00:35:20,561
Fifth was pathetic.

430
00:35:20,645 --> 00:35:23,842
And to think he expected us to love him.

431
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:26,921
Fifth was flawed.

432
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:31,078
- If I had to destroy him, I would. But...
- But what?

433
00:35:31,165 --> 00:35:34,874
You feel sorry for him? Don't bother.

434
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:39,834
He was never fit to lead an army, and he
certainly wasn't fit to rule this galaxy.

435
00:35:39,925 --> 00:35:42,155
But you are.

436
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:44,236
I am what I am because of you.

437
00:35:45,045 --> 00:35:47,957
You're not me.
You're what Fifth made you.

438
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:54,075
You have untapped greatness inside you,
Sam, but you're limited by your own fears.

439
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:59,444
You play by the rules, you do as you're
told, and you deny yourself your desires.

440
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:02,278
I have no desire to rule the galaxy,
believe me.

441
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:04,560
All humans desire power.

442
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:09,677
It's just that most of them
are never in a position to attain it.

443
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:13,155
- We will stop you.
- You're forgetting.

444
00:36:13,245 --> 00:36:16,282
I know exactly how your mind works.

445
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:20,916
I know what you're going to do
before you even think of it.

446
00:36:25,325 --> 00:36:27,714
You set the naqahdah generators
to overload,

447
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:31,480
trying to blow up the base
before I can leave.

448
00:36:36,765 --> 00:36:42,203
Dialling computer's offline.
We've lost power, sir.

449
00:36:55,285 --> 00:36:57,355
Teal'c.

450
00:36:57,445 --> 00:36:59,322
You all right?

451
00:36:59,405 --> 00:37:01,600
Yeah, I'm all right.

452
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:06,323
She's heading for the gate room.
We have to stop her.

453
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:23,084
Freeze!

454
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:36,515
- Disengage the wormhole!
- She's locked out the controls.

455
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:14,920
Teal'c... What have I done?

456
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:20,284
You cannot be held responsible
for the actions of a replicator.

457
00:39:32,685 --> 00:39:37,679
I'm still of a strong belief that it's
a bad idea to have that stuff on the base.

458
00:39:37,765 --> 00:39:41,474
She deactivated these cells
when she separated them from her arm.

459
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:44,284
Can we be certain
they will not become active again?

460
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:46,833
She shut down
the cohesive energy between them

461
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:50,804
so it would be harder to figure out
how she became immune to the disrupter.

462
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:53,399
Now, how do you know that?

463
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,802
Because that's what I would have done.

464
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:09,075
- Carter...
- Sir, I've got a lot of work to do.

465
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:13,044
We've never had the chance to study
human-form replicator cells before.

466
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:15,798
If we learn something,
this won't be a total loss.

467
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:18,445
This isn't your fault.

468
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:21,714
I'm not so sure about that.

469
00:40:21,805 --> 00:40:24,080
Fifth came here because of me.

470
00:40:24,165 --> 00:40:26,679
She rejected him
because she was made like me.

471
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:31,281
Now we've got replicators in our galaxy
immune to the only technology we have.

472
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:34,482
None of us anticipated
the actions of the replicator.

473
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,715
I thought she was afraid of him,

474
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:40,764
but she wanted to get rid of him
so she could lead the replicators herself.

475
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:42,915
She killed him because he was weak.

476
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:44,961
Carter.

477
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:48,162
- She isn't you.
- O'Neill is correct.

478
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:52,796
Though she shared your memories,
her personality was altered.

479
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:57,561
But the fact is,
she learned betrayal from Fifth.

480
00:40:57,645 --> 00:40:59,840
And he learned it from me.

481
