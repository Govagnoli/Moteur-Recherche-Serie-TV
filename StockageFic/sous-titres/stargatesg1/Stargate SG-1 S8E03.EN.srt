1
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:25,582
What's going on?

2
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:28,102
It's our Russian team on the space station.

3
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:33,706
They're adjusting the orbit to avoid debris
left over from our... incident in Antarctica.

4
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:07,299
It worked.

5
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:23,138
He said if the Americans keep
blasting alien ships out of orbit,

6
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:27,187
they've got to do a better job
of tracking their own mess.

7
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:39,943
- What's going on?
- I don't know. We lost contact.

8
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,858
Come in.

9
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,586
General O'Neill.
It is an honour to meet you,

10
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:18,183
and an even greater honour
to finally serve under your command.

11
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:20,828
Wow. That was a load.

12
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:24,783
Who are you?

13
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:30,022
I am Colonel Alexi Vaselov, sir.
I assumed you were expecting my arrival.

14
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:33,623
Yeah. Sure.

15
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,619
Uh...

16
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,859
Yeah. Here's the memo. Right there.

17
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:43,146
I want you to know, sir,
that I personally requested this transfer.

18
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:45,981
After my many years of service
with Russian Air Force,

19
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:51,461
I feel confident that I can make a positive
contribution to Stargate Command.

20
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:53,743
Great.

21
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:57,581
If I may be so bold, sir,

22
00:03:57,668 --> 00:04:01,024
I understand that with your appointment
as base commander,

23
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:04,942
a position has become available on SG-1.

24
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:08,816
I would relish the opportunity
to serve on the SGC's elite team.

25
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:12,821
Yes. You and everyone else on this base.

26
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:19,297
Colonel, not gonna happen.

27
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,901
I understand your reluctance, sir,
but if you look at my record,

28
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:26,741
I think it will satisfy any of your concerns.

29
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:31,504
I have over 3,000 flight hours on more
than 35 types of aircraft and prototypes.

30
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:34,944
I have been awarded
the High Order of Russia - the Gold Star...

31
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:39,385
Yes, yes, yes.
That's very impressive. Very.

32
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:42,460
But it's not gonna get you on SG-1.

33
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,300
Understood.

34
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:49,937
I am, of course, willing to accept
a position on a different team.

35
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:54,465
Colonel, until you go through
the proper training,

36
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:58,177
you're not going anywhere near that gate.

37
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:04,024
Perhaps I could assume a role as an
observer on one of the exploration units.

38
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:07,305
It was nice meeting you. Very nice.

39
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:11,383
You're dismissed.

40
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:32,657
If all goes according to plan, I will acquire
possession of my apartment on Tuesday.

41
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:37,776
- Hey, congratulations.
- When's the apartment-warming party?

42
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:43,299
When someone gets a new place,
it's customary for them to throw a party.

43
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:48,178
- Would I be required to prepare a meal?
- No. We'll all bring something.

44
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:51,180
Very well. Next Saturday.

45
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,424
I'm only gonna say this once, Carter.
At ease.

46
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:07,024
- How's the new job?
- Oy. One crisis after another.

47
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:11,659
This morning the mess got a shipment of
Yukon Gold potatoes instead of Russets.

48
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:13,864
- No.
- Oh, yes.

49
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:19,261
The Golds don't make for good mash.
Consistency's all wrong.

50
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:24,578
I hear the new Russian colonel came
to see you. Made a pitch to join SG-1.

51
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,898
- Yeah.
- What did you say?

52
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,866
- Told 'em to make French fries.
- About the Russian.

53
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:33,657
Oh. I made it clear
he shouldn't expect preferential treatment.

54
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:36,979
That he'd have to prove himself
before I'd consider him.

55
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:40,981
He is one of the most highly decorated
officers in Russian military history.

56
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:46,096
- He has over 20 years' flight experience.
- And exactly no years in offworld travel.

57
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:51,581
I'm not gonna risk the lives of anyone
under my command on a slick résumé.

58
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:56,696
- Uncharacteristically cautious of you, sir.
- Yes, there's that.

59
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:59,860
The Russians must be pressuring you
to put him on the team.

60
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:01,506
Yes, there's that too.

61
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,580
We can't blame them.
We haven't been keeping our promises.

62
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:06,943
- We gave them their own team.
- Two years ago.

63
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:11,704
- What have we done for them lately?
- Forget it. I'm not putting him on SG-1.

64
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:16,145
Do you have someone else in mind
for the position, O'Neill?

65
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,298
- No.
- So we're sticking with three?

66
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:21,107
Why not? It's one less decision
I have to deal with.

67
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:26,899
There's nothing in the regulations that
says an SG team has to be four people.

68
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,422
There you go. Problem solved.

69
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:34,943
Thank you.

70
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:10,547
Colonel Vaselov.

71
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:13,222
Dr Jackson, of course. Come in.

72
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,142
Your reputation precedes you.

73
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:20,617
I'm well acquainted with your work.

74
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:23,668
I wanted to welcome you
to the neighbourhood.

75
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:28,776
That's very kind of you. I only wish
others were as open to my presence here.

76
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:33,498
Yeah. Don't take
General O'Neill's decision personally.

77
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:40,061
It's difficult not to. His attitude is offensive.
I wonder if he knows the Cold War is over.

78
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:45,302
It's nothing to do with your being Russian.
He's an equal-opportunity offender.

79
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:51,020
- I am supposed to find this comforting?
- He doesn't respond to outside pressure.

80
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:54,225
Our nations are partners
in the Stargate programme.

81
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:59,177
- I'm aware of the deal. I helped broker it.
- Then you can understand our frustration.

82
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:03,705
What you have to realise is
Colonel O'Neill -

83
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:07,463
General O'Neill -
just assumed command of this facility.

84
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,904
He's got a lot on his plate.
Making demands on him right now

85
00:09:10,988 --> 00:09:14,742
is just bad timing
on the part of your government.

86
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,904
Colonel?

87
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:21,420
Colonel!

88
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:39,900
What happened?

89
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:42,661
I don't know.
We were talking and he collapsed.

90
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:48,744
All right. I know you're scheduled
to go offworld. We'll take care of him.

91
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:14,376
- How's he doing?
- Confused.

92
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:17,141
The last thing he remembers
is being in Russia.

93
00:10:17,228 --> 00:10:19,583
He doesn't know where he is
or how he got here.

94
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:23,024
He's also exhibiting physical symptoms
which have me concerned.

95
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:26,464
He has lesions over 40% of his body
and a high white blood count,

96
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:30,143
which indicates some sort of infection.

97
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:34,107
- Is he contagious?
- It's a distinct possibility.

98
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:39,865
Sir, we need to examine everyone
who's been in contact with this man.

99
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,783
Daniel.

100
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:04,226
Report back to the infirmary.

101
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,223
Open the gate!

102
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:12,583
Do it. Now!

103
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:32,980
Daniel!

104
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:05,661
He's lost a lot of blood, but his life
is no longer in any immediate danger.

105
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:09,502
The members of SG-11
insisted he seemed perfectly normal.

106
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:13,547
Did you notice anything peculiar
about him, sir?

107
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:16,461
I thought it odd
he was shooting up the gateroom.

108
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:18,698
He reacted after the gate was shut down.

109
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:22,258
Why was he so desperate to go through?

110
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:25,101
Does he have
any of Colonel Vaselov's symptoms?

111
00:12:25,188 --> 00:12:29,704
No lesions, but it may be a matter of time.
He has an elevated white blood count.

112
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:32,541
Colonel Vaselov displayed
no unusual behaviour.

113
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,461
That doesn't mean
it's not the same condition.

114
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:38,984
If an infection reaches the brain,
it can manifest itself in any way

115
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:41,901
from memory loss
to full-blown psychosis.

116
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:45,503
- You don't think it's a coincidence?
- Seems unlikely, sir.

117
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:51,299
I think there's a high probability
that we have a contagion on the base.

118
00:12:57,468 --> 00:13:00,062
Contact all teams that are offworld.

119
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:03,584
Tell them that the SGC is off limits.

120
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:06,626
Have them proceed to the Alpha site
until further notice.

121
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:11,020
Effective immediately,
the SGC is under lockdown.

122
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:28,787
- Hi. How's Daniel?
- Still unconscious, but he's improving.

123
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:32,224
He's responding to treatment.
His white cell count is coming down.

124
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:34,947
- What about Colonel Vaselov?
- He's not so good.

125
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:38,577
We're treating him with antibiotics,
but he is deteriorating.

126
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:42,627
Until we know more about the source of
the infection, there's not much we can do.

127
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,859
It started with Vaselov,
so it didn't come through the gate.

128
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:50,260
I'm waiting to hear from the Russians
about possible sources of the infection.

129
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:53,818
- Anyone else showing symptoms?
- Not yet.

130
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:09,657
How is he?

131
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,501
Dr Jackson?

132
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:15,785
Dr Brightman told me what happened.

133
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:20,019
His condition is improving.

134
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:23,020
- Good.
- And your condition?

135
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:26,862
Not so good.

136
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:32,147
But not so bad as the time I went drinking
with General Dashkewytch in Novgorod.

137
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:34,901
That was worse headache.

138
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:39,705
Dr Jackson is good friend of yours, yes?

139
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:42,143
Indeed he is.

140
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:49,782
Despite what you are thinking, you bear
no responsibility for what has transpired.

141
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:54,259
My presence here has resulted in
the quarantine of this entire complex.

142
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:58,978
In your homeland, you would have faced
a similar situation in a different setting.

143
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:01,901
Again, through no fault of your own.

144
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,785
Perhaps.

145
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:09,263
But at the moment
I can't be sure of anything.

146
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:14,698
- Has your memory not yet returned?
- In my dreams I...

147
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,224
I have begun to see flashes -

148
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:21,106
glimpses of these past few days.

149
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:24,021
Walking these halls, talking to people,

150
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:27,305
and yet it's as if I am not even here.

151
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:35,020
I am just a helpless observer
inside my own body.

152
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,946
One month ago,
Anatole Konstantinov fell ill

153
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:45,418
after completing a tour
on the international space station.

154
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:50,104
I remember. We monitored it. We lost
contact and we never figured out why.

155
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:54,898
I don't know if they're connected, but
he died less than a week later in Moscow.

156
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,627
Officially, the cause of death
was renal failure,

157
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,940
but, unofficially, the Russian authorities
haven't a clue what killed him.

158
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:05,418
- Our mystery disease?
- Among the symptoms he exhibited

159
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:08,818
were memory loss, skin lesions
and a high white blood count.

160
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:11,058
Is there any connection to Vaselov?

161
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:14,379
Vaselov visited Konstantinov
in hospital before he died.

162
00:16:14,468 --> 00:16:17,221
They were friends.
They served together in the air force.

163
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:20,106
- Why didn't they tell us?
- The Russians determined

164
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:24,067
that Konstantinov wasn't contagious.
He came into contact with many people

165
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:26,946
between returning to Earth
and checking into hospital,

166
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,338
but no one else
ever showed any signs of being infected.

167
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:32,544
Makes it an oddly selective disease.

168
00:16:32,628 --> 00:16:34,698
Perhaps we are not
dealing with a disease.

169
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:39,225
Colonel Vaselov possessed only vague,
random memories of his time at SGC.

170
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:43,460
He described himself as a mere observer
to the actions of his body.

171
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:47,780
- Like being host to a symbiote.
- Tests ruled out possibility of a Goa'uld.

172
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:50,621
Could it be some other form
of alien possession?

173
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:55,418
Yeah, it's possible. An entity capable
of moving from individual to individual.

174
00:16:55,508 --> 00:17:01,265
- It might explain the inconsistencies.
- If that's true, it could be in anyone now.

175
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:08,427
Hello.

176
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:10,499
I'll be right there.

177
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:13,421
Daniel's awake.

178
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,459
What's going on?

179
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:21,381
- You're recovering from a bullet wound.
- What?

180
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:25,700
- You have no recollection of the incident?
- No. Who shot me?

181
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:29,497
Don't change the subject.
What do you remember?

182
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:32,659
I went to see Colonel Vaselov.

183
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:36,502
In the middle of our conversation
he collapsed, I went to help him

184
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,818
and that's it.

185
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:42,787
- Remember taking him to the infirmary?
- No.

186
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,984
Who shot me?

187
00:17:56,908 --> 00:18:00,537
- You were shooting up the gateroom.
- You wounded two guards.

188
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:03,381
We may be dealing
with a foothold situation.

189
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:08,781
An alien entity capable of taking over
human hosts, not unlike the Goa'uld.

190
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:11,541
It seems to be able to travel
from person to person.

191
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:17,100
Although, at present we have
no knowledge of how this is possible.

192
00:18:19,988 --> 00:18:21,660
Daniel?

193
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:27,704
Anubis.

194
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:30,097
- Daniel Jackson.
- I was Anubis.

195
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,501
Or rather, Anubis was controlling me.

196
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:42,183
- Anubis is dead.
- No, he's not.

197
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:46,096
And he's here in the base.

198
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:53,939
You'd think getting blasted out of orbit
would have slowed the guy down.

199
00:18:54,028 --> 00:18:58,067
According to Daniel, Anubis surrendered
his mortal form when he was ascended,

200
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:00,537
only to be cast down by the Ancients.

201
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:04,621
As a result, he exists
purely as an immaterial being.

202
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,859
In the past,
the physical form we were seeing

203
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:10,746
was a force shield
designed to contain his essence.

204
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:13,501
When it was destroyed,
that essence was released.

205
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:17,137
Anubis was trapped in Earth's orbit,
inhabiting debris from his ship,

206
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:21,426
- many light years away from his base.
- So he hitched a ride on a cosmonaut?

207
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:24,580
Yes, sir. And then abandoned him
for Colonel Vaselov.

208
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:26,704
Attempting to escape through our gate.

209
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:32,897
Why doesn't he just use his freaky
super-cosmic powers and just...

210
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:35,696
go?

211
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:39,497
Doing so would alert the Ancients
and bring down their wrath upon him.

212
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:43,103
To interact with the physical world,
he has to get a new shield.

213
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:47,579
He can't do that here on Earth. He'll need
a body to dial the gate and get through.

214
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:52,025
Eventually, Anubis will attempt
escape again.

215
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:56,579
Well, he's on the base,
obviously not going anywhere.

216
00:19:58,468 --> 00:20:01,744
Tell me there's something we can do.

217
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:05,298
Well, as a matter of fact, sir,
I think there is.

218
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,820
- Hey.
- What's going on?

219
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:23,777
General O'Neill has ordered compulsory
physicals for all the SGC personnel.

220
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:28,419
We're assuming that retaining Anubis'
essence exacts a toll on the carrier.

221
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:32,626
You were exposed for two hours,
but you reacted as if fighting an infection.

222
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,700
So whoever has his essence
should start showing symptoms?

223
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:37,938
Yeah. That's the theory.

224
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,858
What about Vaselov?

225
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,700
Well...

226
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:46,745
His is a more extreme case.

227
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,662
He was exposed for over a week, that's
why his symptoms are more advanced.

228
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:54,184
You mean, with the lesions and the...

229
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:57,419
It's actually more than that.

230
00:20:57,508 --> 00:21:00,739
His entire immune system was affected.

231
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:05,777
But Anubis is out of him.
He should start getting better, right?

232
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:07,507
Sam?

233
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:13,903
Dr Brightman says he's not responding.
The exposure may have gone on too long.

234
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:17,981
- The damage is done.
- There has to be something we can do.

235
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:22,061
We can help him manage the pain.
That's about it.

236
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:38,897
I said the situation was contained,
I did not say it was resolved.

237
00:21:38,988 --> 00:21:45,541
No, I can't do that. Command will stay
under lockdown until I decide otherwise.

238
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:49,663
Yes, sir. It is my call.

239
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,903
Yes, sir.

240
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:58,427
The Pentagon. Getting a little antsy.

241
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:02,387
They're not the only ones. You got
a bunch of anxious people out there.

242
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:07,019
Yeah, I'll bet.
What can I do for you, Doctor?

243
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:12,057
It's Vaselov. His condition hasn't improved
and he's not responding to treatment.

244
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:17,586
Unless circumstances change,
I'd give him a week, two weeks tops.

245
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:21,581
- I'll inform the Russians.
- Thank you, sir.

246
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:31,784
Dr Jackson?

247
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:34,018
Sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you.

248
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:40,217
No, no. I am glad to see you are
up and about. Have you been discharged?

249
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:46,304
Yeah. Dr Brightman caught me stealing
Jell-O from the other patients' trays.

250
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:49,545
Doctor,

251
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:55,178
I wonder if you could do me a favour.

252
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:02,342
I have a sister in Bryansk.

253
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:07,625
When the lockdown has ended,
could you see that she gets this?

254
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,345
Alexi...

255
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,738
The nurses have been careful
not to say anything.

256
00:23:11,828 --> 00:23:14,979
That is always a bad sign.

257
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:18,381
Please.

258
00:23:25,188 --> 00:23:28,180
You know, in Russia we have a saying.

259
00:23:35,108 --> 00:23:39,898
"The cord may curl long,
but an end will appear."

260
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:47,579
That holds true for everything
in this world. Myself included.

261
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:49,943
I accept this.

262
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:58,384
"In the kingdom of hope,
there is no winter."

263
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:04,585
- I prefer that one.
- Da. It's a nice saying.

264
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:09,103
I'll come see you.

265
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:26,461
- His pulse is weak.
- He's lost a lot of blood. Dr Jackson?

266
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:43,381
Dr Jackson?

267
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:48,019
Lieutenant Evans.
He's in Lieutenant Evans.

268
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:02,747
I was examined by Dr Brightman
a couple of hours ago. She said I was fine.

269
00:25:02,828 --> 00:25:06,264
It's possible you haven't started
manifesting signs yet.

270
00:25:06,348 --> 00:25:08,179
I would know.

271
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:13,183
If something like that happened to me,
I would know. I"m not lying.

272
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:17,304
Lieutenant, tell me what you did
Tuesday afternoon.

273
00:25:17,388 --> 00:25:20,186
- I don't understand.
- Just tell me.

274
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:28,147
- Lieutenant?
- I don't know.

275
00:25:28,228 --> 00:25:30,344
You don't know?

276
00:25:31,348 --> 00:25:33,908
I can't remember.

277
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:38,865
O'Neill.

278
00:25:38,948 --> 00:25:42,941
Airman Malcolm McCaffrey has
missed his appointment at the infirmary.

279
00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:45,622
He remains unaccounted for.

280
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:50,865
Carter.

281
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:05,620
Head down there.

282
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:08,097
What have you got?

283
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:16,545
Argh!

284
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:23,060
- General O'Neill.
- Yeah, O'Neill here. Go.

285
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:27,983
This is Major Kearney. I've got a wounded
man here, jumped by Airman McCaffrey.

286
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:32,858
We think he's headed for the control
room. Advise caution, the target is armed.

287
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:35,382
On our way.

288
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:50,219
Dial the gate.

289
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:34,265
Mind if I come in?

290
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:37,146
You're not supposed
to be walking around.

291
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:39,423
It's my arm.

292
00:27:40,948 --> 00:27:43,781
- You were shot.
- I know. You shot me.

293
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:46,623
Not the point.

294
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,461
I heard what happened.
Anubis is still here.

295
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:54,668
Daniel, he can pass through walls. He's
welcome to leave the base at any time.

296
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:57,945
He has to go through the Stargate,
or else he's trapped on Earth.

297
00:27:58,028 --> 00:28:00,826
Yeah. Well, there's not much we can do.

298
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:02,227
- Can't kill him.
- No.

299
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:03,536
- Can't catch him.
- No.

300
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:06,540
- So...
- We let the Ancients deal with him.

301
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:09,665
Yes. Because they've always been
so helpful.

302
00:28:09,748 --> 00:28:13,627
If he uses his powers as ascended being,
he's breaking the rules.

303
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:16,859
They will take action. Ow.

304
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:18,984
We have to take away his other options.

305
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:20,660
Uh-huh.

306
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:24,626
I assume you have a plan.

307
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:32,342
Anubis has tried twice
to get through the gate.

308
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:37,058
In both instances we stopped him,
but there's no guarantee we will next time.

309
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:40,538
We have to make it
as difficult as possible to access the gate.

310
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:43,779
To that end, we're proposing
a division of the facility

311
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:47,861
into three separate sections,
designated zones 1, 2 and 3.

312
00:28:47,948 --> 00:28:51,702
The gate has been shut off, and will not
be accessible from the control room.

313
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:57,545
It can now only be re-established from
a relay centre, located here in zone 1.

314
00:28:57,628 --> 00:29:01,906
The control room, gateroom
and surrounding areas are zone 2.

315
00:29:01,988 --> 00:29:05,105
Corridors linking the two zones
will be sealed.

316
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:08,021
Corridors linking to the gateroom
will be sealed.

317
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:12,579
The only means of unsealing the corridors
will be from a security control centre,

318
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:15,466
located here in the section
designated zone 3.

319
00:29:15,548 --> 00:29:17,857
Personnel will be restricted to one zone.

320
00:29:17,948 --> 00:29:20,667
Food supplies will be divided
amongst the sections.

321
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:25,742
Dr Brightman's team will be split and will
monitor personnel through daily exams.

322
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:27,898
No one, not even General O'Neill,

323
00:29:27,988 --> 00:29:31,947
will be permitted access to
a neighbouring zone until lockdown ends.

324
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:34,588
Any questions so far?

325
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:39,667
Given everything we know about Anubis,

326
00:29:39,748 --> 00:29:43,502
do you really think
this is going to stop him?

327
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:47,183
The point is to make it impossible
for him to get through the gate.

328
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:49,418
When he realises
he can't get out that way,

329
00:29:49,508 --> 00:29:54,218
he'll have no choice but to risk
revealing himself to the Ancients.

330
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:32,057
Zone 1 secure.

331
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:39,419
Zone 3 secure.

332
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:45,500
Zone 2 secure. Good luck.

333
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,545
O'Neill.

334
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:27,017
Yes, Mr President.

335
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:31,304
Yes, sir. Six days without incident.

336
00:31:32,628 --> 00:31:35,984
Yes, all SG personnel
present and accounted for.

337
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:38,707
No, no one has shown
any physical symptoms, sir,

338
00:31:38,788 --> 00:31:42,542
but that doesn't mean Anubis has gone.

339
00:31:42,628 --> 00:31:45,301
It's the president.

340
00:31:47,228 --> 00:31:51,904
Of course I understand the importance
of the programme, but I would be...

341
00:31:54,308 --> 00:31:56,503
I understand, sir.

342
00:31:58,788 --> 00:32:00,585
Hello?

343
00:32:06,588 --> 00:32:11,378
I've got 24 hours to re-establish
"normal" gate operations.

344
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:16,588
It was unreasonable to assume lockdown
could be maintained indefinitely.

345
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,182
Yeah. I suppose.

346
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:26,983
Attention, all personnel.

347
00:32:27,068 --> 00:32:29,457
This is General O'Neill.

348
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:33,665
I know the current situation
has been tough on all of you.

349
00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:37,661
You"ve been cut off from
your families, your homes.

350
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:41,980
You"re wondering
how much longer this can go on.

351
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:48,780
But the fact is, there"s a threat on this
base that cannot be allowed to escape.

352
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:55,182
Knowing that, the president"s authorised
me to maintain this lockdown indefinitely.

353
00:32:56,628 --> 00:32:59,461
We've only got food enough
for another month.

354
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:04,497
So we'll find a secure way
to bring supplies down from the surface.

355
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:08,979
In the meantime,
I suggest you all get comfortable.

356
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:11,662
We're not going anywhere.

357
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:31,262
I need to run a diagnostic.

358
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:17,747
Hey, Sam.

359
00:34:17,828 --> 00:34:19,307
Argh!

360
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:18,578
- Teal'c, this is Daniel.
- Proceed, Daniel Jackson.

361
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:21,660
Anubis has got Sam.
She's headed your way.

362
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:25,305
Understood.

363
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:51,020
Argh!

364
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:17,465
- Jack.
- Go ahead.

365
00:36:17,548 --> 00:36:21,336
Anubis got into the security system. He
set up a sequence of timed commands.

366
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:26,218
- We're trying to override, with no luck.
- Keep me posted.

367
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:33,537
Keep an eye on them.
Kearney, you're with me.

368
00:36:38,868 --> 00:36:40,460
General.

369
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:42,140
Major.

370
00:36:44,948 --> 00:36:46,540
Sir?

371
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:50,587
Ready your key.

372
00:36:54,308 --> 00:36:59,507
Base security is being compromised.
Ready your key. That's an order.

373
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,379
Yes, sir.

374
00:37:11,948 --> 00:37:14,542
Counting down. From three,

375
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:16,858
two, one.

376
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:18,745
Turn.

377
00:37:21,388 --> 00:37:26,303
Five minutes till self-destruct.
Five minutes till self-destruct.

378
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:35,100
You did good, son.

379
00:37:41,948 --> 00:37:47,625
Four minutes till self-destruct.
Four minutes till self destruct.

380
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,699
Sir.

381
00:37:57,788 --> 00:38:01,337
- Come no further.
- Give me access to the base computer.

382
00:38:01,428 --> 00:38:04,147
Someone activated the self-destruct.
I'll shut it down.

383
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:09,177
- You are infected.
- I was infected. Anubis left me.

384
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:14,217
- Of this I cannot be certain.
- Teal'c, I'm not Anubis. It's me, Carter.

385
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:16,458
Three minutes till self-destruct.

386
00:38:16,548 --> 00:38:19,062
Teal'c, please.

387
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,663
Very well.

388
00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:42,698
Self-destruct aborted.
Self-destruct aborted.

389
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:44,983
Well done.

390
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:01,062
Someone's activated the gate.

391
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:10,257
Teal'c, this is Daniel.
I think Anubis is headed for the gateroom.

392
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,022
Understood.

393
00:39:12,108 --> 00:39:14,941
I'll see if I can override
the dialling sequence.

394
00:39:19,348 --> 00:39:20,747
O'Neill.

395
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,744
Aargh!

396
00:39:31,948 --> 00:39:34,985
- Stand aside.
- Nyet.

397
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:46,378
You need a body to go through the gate.

398
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,663
Take mine.

399
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:51,143
Take mine or I'll kill us both.

400
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:30,227
- Oh!
- General.

401
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:32,344
I'm OK...

402
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:34,020
..ish.

403
00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:37,705
Wait.

404
00:40:40,028 --> 00:40:44,226
- He got through, didn't he?
- Sort of.

405
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:49,063
I was able to override the dialling
sequence and input an alternate address.

406
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:52,345
I sent him to KS7-535 instead.

407
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,058
Chilly.

408
00:41:17,548 --> 00:41:19,425
