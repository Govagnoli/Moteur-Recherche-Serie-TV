but your attempt to destroy the Ori

Oh, whatever.

00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:32,554
The answer you were looking for
to the Clava Thesaurusy thingami-jigamy.

The Clava Thessara Infinitas?

54
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,898
Right, that's the one. I know where it is.

55
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,207
The Clava Thessara Infinitas, literally,
"The key to infinite treasure,"

56
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,402
is the Ancient tablet
Athena was seeking from Qetesh.

57
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,912
Now, it supposedly holds the clues to
the whereabouts of a vast storehouse of...

58
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,041
Daniel, this is very interesting.
Get to the good part!

59
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,987
The good part?

60
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,488

You solved the Clava Thessara Infinitas?

62
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,152
Yes, I most certainly did.

63
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:09,163
Daniel shared some of his findings
with me last night before I went to sleep,

64
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,896
and after a rather, well, nasty dream

65
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,972
in which I appeared on
a television program where it seemed

66
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,598
you had to dance with supposedly
well-known personalities

67
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,802
in front of a panel of judges,

68
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,004
a shape came to my mind.

69
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,444
The symbol for infinity?

70
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,986
Yes, infinite treasure, infinity. You see?

71
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:37,228
And it intersects with six symbols, which,
when combined, correspond with

72
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,258
a gate address.

73
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,199
Why would the Ancients use the Earth
symbol for infinity to hide their treasure?

74
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,736
Actually, no one knows the exact origin
of the symbol itself.

75
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,466
It's been found on Tibetan rock carvings
dating back over a thousand years,

76
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,666
as well as a host of other places.

77
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,109
For all we know, it could well
have originated with the Ancients.

78
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,579
You can rotate that symbol
any which way you want.

79
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,879
Yes, but this is how
it appeared in my dream,

80
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,353
and when we put these six symbols
into the database,

81
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,016
it came up with only one address.

82
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,655
Why does this all sound familiar?

83
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,798
Did Adria not send you information
in dream form to lure us to the planet

84
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,061
where the Sangraal was hidden?

85
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,967
Yes, but, no, this is different.
I came up with this on my own.

86
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,734
Okay, I suppose it is possible
that Qetesh knew its location

87
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,106
and this is simply a latent memory
being dredged up by Athena.

88
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,406
There you go.

89
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:31,005
Do we have any idea what
this Ancient storehouse actually contains?

90
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,177
No idea, sir, but it must be big if Athena
was so eager to get her hands on it.

91
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,051
I feel very strongly about this, General.

92
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,189
What can it hurt to send a team?

93
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,663
I didn't send you that information.

94
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,631
That's what I tried to tell them,
but they didn't believe me,

95
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,133
especially when the
reconnaissance team returned.

What happened?

105
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,502
It was an ambush, sir.

106
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,437
Ori soldiers made our position
as soon as we stepped through the gate.

107
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,100
I lost two men, a couple more injured.

108
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,734
That's not possible. That can't be.

109
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,437
You tell that to the men who died.

110
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,177
- Colonel, debrief in my office.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,317
I was so certain that I was right,
I couldn't leave well enough alone,

112
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,259
and the very next night...

113
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,097
I had the same dream again.

114
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:59,001
Only this time, the infinity shape appeared
vertically rather than horizontally.

115
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:03,136
Note that, again,
it intersects with six symbols,

116
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:08,279
and that, again, the six symbols
only match one address in our database.

117
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,141
What?

118
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,325
What's the problem?
We need to investigate this.

119
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,521
- Vala.
- What?

120
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,530
- Do you not see what's going on here?
- No.

121
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,624
This is Adria telling us where to go
so she can pick us off.

122
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,965
Next, you'll have a dream
where the symbol is on a slight angle,

123
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,598
and I'll bet it will still correspond
to one single gate address.

124
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,505
- She's using you, Vala.
- No. I would know.

125
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,910

129

But I didn't do anything wrong.
I was trying to help.

130
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,880
It doesn't matter
what your intentions were.

131
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,684
If Adria can manipulate you like this
any time she wants to,

132
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,985
then you've become a security risk.

133
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,755
They're talking about removing you
from the team.

134
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:30,886
What?

135
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,828
They're also not comfortable
with the idea of letting you go,

136
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,958
given everything you've learned
about Earth's defenses.

137
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,098
I don't understand.

138
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:44,432
They're talking about confinement, Vala,
at Area 51.

139
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,919
You don't believe me either.

140
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,252
You can't lie to me, Mother.
I can read the truth in your mind.

141
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,086
I'm just surprised.

142
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,554
So was I.

143
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,655
How did you convince them to let you go?

144
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,858
I didn't. That's the funny thing.

145

<i>could hold me.</i>

<i>I'd make it off the base.</i>

147
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,100
What do you plan to do now?

148
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,194
Well, I had just won myself a cargo ship

149
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,240
when you dropped by
and broke up the game, so...

150
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,270
Is that really what you want?
A life alone, always on the run?

151
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,143
That life no longer suits you, Mother.
You belong with me.

152
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,376
Return with me to my ship, and take up
your rightful place as Mother of the Orici.

153
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,477
Adria, stop it. I am not your mother.

154
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:06,656
I may have given birth to you,
but we are not family,

155
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,454
so stop pretending.

156
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:17,232
You just need time to think about it.
We will talk further on our way.

157
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,768
- Where are we going?
- To find the Clava Thessara Infinitas.

158
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,003
- You think it's real?
- I think Colonel Carter was right.

159
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,239
This might be knowledge from your time
as a Goa'uld

160
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,542
being dredged up
through your subconscious.

161
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,207
Well, you're too late.

162
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,949
Despite the fact that they didn't trust me,
they thought they should check out

163
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,387
the second gate address anyway,
just to be safe.

164
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,353
I overheard them planning the mission
as I was leaving.

165
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,623
Yes, but there's something
you're not telling me.

166
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,365
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Don't play games with me, Mother.

167
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:53,529
If I have to force this information
out of you, it will be quite unpleasant.

168
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:01,068
They were worried about an ambush,
so they're taking the ship.

169
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,612
We can beat them if we travel by stargate.

170
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,877
Let's go. Now.

171
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,924
Howdy!

172
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,905
You didn't really think
we'd invite you to a party

173
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,238
and not disable
your funky powers, did you?

174
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,334
I have no idea what's going on.

175
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,310
Don't worry, Vala, it's all part of the plan.

176
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,008
Don't you ever speak to me, ever again.

177
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,082
Lower your weapons.

178
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,682
Buddy, I think you've got
the wrong planet.

179
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,523
Lower your weapons or we will all perish.

180
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,860
My master Lord Ba'al has targeted
this location from orbit.

181
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,113
What are you doing?
Carrying out my orders.

182
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,229
Okay, that wasn't part of the plan.

183
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,900
Welcome.

184
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,828
Don't waste your time.

185
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,669
I've learned a thing or two
from my Tau'ri friends.

186
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,706
This room is being flooded with
the same kind of EM field they generate

187
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,610
with that clever little device of theirs,

188
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,206
the one that prevents you
from using your mind powers.

189
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,012
You should know
that won't hold me forever.

190
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,712
Of course not.

191
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,225
But that won't be a problem
after I'm done with you.

192
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,361
They got the jump on us.
We had no time to react.

193
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,963
Exactly how did Ba'al
manage to pull this off?

194
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,235
I don't know,
but they had detailed intelligence.

195
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,402
He was aware of both our locations
and intentions.

196
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,639
The bigger question is,
what does Ba'al want with Adria?

197
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,308
Perhaps he intends to negotiate
for shared control of the galaxy.

198
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,544
She doesn't strike me as the sharing type.

199
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,917
Either way, we do not want
those two hanging out together.

200
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,718
Exactly. We have to get her back.

201
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,485
- We're on it, sir.
- Wait.

202
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,658
How's Vala?

203
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,824
Pissed.

204
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,231
Is somebody going to fill her in?

205
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,996
Absolutely. Just not us.

206
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:48,439
This isn't right, you know.
I escaped fair and square.

207
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,015
Bringing me back here
is tantamount to kidnapping.

208
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,449
Listen, we know you're upset, but you
have to understand, this is part of a plan.

209
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,818
Upset? Why would I possibly be upset?

210
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,619
Maybe because I was
betrayed and abandoned

211
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:05,060
by the only people in the entire galaxy
I thought were my friends. Don't be silly.

212
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,558
We are your friends,
and we did not betray you.

213
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,602
You didn't exactly back me up,
now, did you?

214
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,729
What she means is,
none of it actually happened.

215
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,204
What are you talking about?

216
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,243
This device is a slightly altered version
of the memory implant technology

217
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,813
we received from a race
called the Galarans.

218
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,906
We used it to create a fictional memory
and implant it in your mind.

219
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,609
And we knew you'd have trouble
understanding all of this,

220
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,482
so we took the liberty
of making a recording

221
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,851
before you underwent the procedure.

222
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,212
Look.

223
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,987
<i>Tilt it up, all right. Oh, yeah.</i>

224
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,756
<i>Thank you, now I can see.</i>

225
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:38,887
<i>JACKSON: We're rolling!</i>

226
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,489
<i>Oh, we're on? Why didn't you say so?</i>

227
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,624
<i>JACKSON: Gum!</i>

228
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,596
<i>Thanks! Hello, gorgeous.</i>

229
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,670
<i>If you're watching this, you're obviously</i>
<i>back at Stargate Command</i>

230
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:56,009
<i>and you are probably thinking that</i>
<i>everyone around you has gone completely</i>

231
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,372
<i>- wonko.</i>
- Wonko.

232
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,610
<i>With the possible exception of Daniel,</i>
<i>who, let's face it,</i>

233
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,413
<i>was always a little bit...</i>

234
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,912
<i>JACKSON: Vala!</i>

235
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:08,592
<i>Sorry. Seriously, though,</i>
<i>substituting our memories was my idea.</i>

236
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,959
<i>Brilliant, I know, and incredibly brave,</i>

237
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,396
<i>but it was the only way</i>
<i>for the plan to work,</i>

238
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,161
<i>so if you are watching this,</i>

239
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:20,500
<i>you have obviously made it back,</i>
<i>and let me be the first to say, well done.</i>

240
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,205
<i>And enjoy the substantial pay rise</i>
<i>that's been promised to you</i>

241
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,297
<i>if the mission succeeds.</i>

242
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,071
<i>JACKSON: Okay,</i>
<i>that's enough. Thank you.</i>

243
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,167
<i>VALA: Okay.</i>

244
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,071
<i>How was...</i>

245
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,548
We heard that Adria had returned
through the supergate.

246
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,779
Now, if the Ori are dead,
we thought we might be able

247
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,049
to convince her to leave quietly
with her army.

248
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,022
We knew that she'd be able to tell
if you were lying to her,

249
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,889
so, as far as you were concerned,
it wasn't a lie.

250
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,325
I escaped using a Sodan cloak.

251
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,893
You allowed me to be exposed to radiation
so that you could carry out your plan.

252
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,801
Your plan.

253
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,397
And no, that was also
part of the false memory.

254
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,477
We escorted you to the planet where
Adria found you and we dropped you off.

255
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,637
You slept through it like a baby.

256
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,817
So, no I.O. A?

257
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,415
No Reynolds' men?

258
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,186
No television program
about dancing with supposed celebrities?

259
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,192
Actually, that part was real.

260
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,196
How very disturbing.

261
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,428
Yeah.

262
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,888
- Comfy?
- You've made a terrible mistake.

263
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,357
Release me now and I will be merciful.

264
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,449
You're so much more pleasant

265
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,223
when you lack the ability
to snap my neck with your thoughts.

266
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,823
You're a fool, dealing with powers
way beyond your means.

267
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,060
When my army catches up to you...

268
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,501
Don't waste your breath.
Your army has no idea where you are,

269
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,403
and it'll be days before they even begin
to question your disappearance.

270
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,604
Even then, all their queries
will lead them to the Tau'ri.

271
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,270
If you intend to kill me,

272
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,214
you should know the Ori
will not halt their attacks on this galaxy.

273
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,878
I have no intention of killing you.

274
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,649
As a matter of fact, my whole plan
hinges on your being very much alive.

275
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,351
So you can ransom me for your freedom?

276
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,293
Far from it. You can offer me something
far more valuable,

277
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,490
control of your army.

278
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,864
- They'll never listen to you.
- No.

279
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,528
But they do listen to you.

280
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,973
There's nothing you can do
to make me bend my army to your will.

281
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,043
(CHUCKLES)

282
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:46,045
Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

283
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,653
Agent Barrett has some information
regarding Ba'al's whereabouts.

284
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,458
I got a call from one of my agents,

285
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,401
undercover inside Ba'al's operations
here on Earth.

286
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,706
Apparently, the clones are planning
to meet as a group.

287
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,434
Apparently, the clones are planning
to meet as a group.

288
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,700
Where and when?

289
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,276
P3R-112, today.

290
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,111
- Not a lot of notice.
- I just got the intel an hour ago.

291
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,807
How reliable is it?

292
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,008
My guy's embedded at the top.

293
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,948
He wouldn't break cover
unless he was sure.

294
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,521
Well, we've been here before.
We have a pretty good idea of the layout.

295
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,386
- Take a Marine unit.
- Yes, sir.

296
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,865
Kind of a quiet spot
for such a big meeting.

297
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,310
- I think that's the idea.
- I'm not seeing a lot of movement.

298
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,380
I think I know why.

299
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,363
Looks like somebody got here before us.

300
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,835
No wounds. No sign of combat.

301
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,999
- Symbiote poison?
- I believe so.

302
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,907
Why would the Ba'als kill their own Jaffa?

303
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,875
I don't think the Jaffa were
the intended target.

304
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,012
At last, the guest of honor.

305
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,188
(SHRIEKING)

306
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,929
You two are about to become
very well acquainted.

307
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:28,212
Well, you've got to hand it to him.
The man throws a mean dinner party.

308
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,338
Well, he knows we're coming after him.
He's covering his tracks.

309
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,609
Indeed.

310
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:32,684
(BEEPING)

311
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,783
Stand back! I'm warning you!

312
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,186
- Just take it easy.
- We're not going to hurt you.

313
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,919
Much.

314
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,361
I thought they were all dead.

315
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,057
Apparently not.

316
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,600
And I believe I know why.

317
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,476
We've got a lead.

318
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:09,145
Once he woke up, our Jaffa friend
was surprisingly forthcoming.

319
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,723
He confirmed the fact that Ba'al was
behind the attack that killed all his clones.

320
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,257
Apparently, he had assembled them
for what they thought

321
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,384
was a meeting on the Adria situation.

322
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,861
Instead, he beamed in canisters
of symbiote poison.

323
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,454
Quite the door prize.

324
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,159
Yeah, whatever Ba'al's up to,
he doesn't want any witnesses.

325
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:26,328
Lucky for us, he didn't realize
one of his Jaffa uses tretonin.

326
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,100
- Any idea where he is now?
- Actually, yes.

327
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,574
The Jaffa was able to provide us with the
coordinates where Ba'al's ship is located.

328
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:37,341
The <i>Odyssey</i> is standing by.
You move out again in one hour.

329
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,723
Assuming for a moment
this Jaffa's telling the truth

330
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,856
and we actually find Ba'al's ship,
how do you propose we capture Adria?

331
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:58,902
Same way he got her off the planet.
We beam in, tag her and beam out.

332
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,904
It's a big ship, Colonel.
How are we going to find her?

333
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,167
Well, actually, it shouldn't be that difficult.

334
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,209
We're assuming Ba'al has
some sort of technology

335
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,834
similar to our own anti-Prior device.

336
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,469
Otherwise,
she would have used her powers

337
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,172
the instant he beamed her on board.

338
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,443
If we scan for those
specific EM frequencies,

339
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,748
we should be able to pinpoint her location
with a fair degree of accuracy.

340
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,982
All this presupposes that we get the drop
on him, and he doesn't raise his shields.

341
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,148
Yeah.

342
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,051
All right, then. Good luck.

343
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,965
Vala, you got a sec?

344
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,229
Sure.

345
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,740
You're welcome to sit this one out.

346
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,675
(STUTTERING)
Why? I mean, why would I?

347
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,713
You know why we're
bringing Adria back, right?

348
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:47,444
Sure, to tell her to take her army
and clear off.

349
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,516
And if she resists, we will take action.

350
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,649
By killing her?

351
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,888
- You're okay with that?
- Of course.

352
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,569
All right.

353
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,580
Wow. I take it we are cloaked?

354
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,111
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

355
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,192
Colonel, the result of your scan is here.

356
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,599
This room shows a pronounced level
of the same EM radiation

357
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,535
generated by the anti-Prior device.
Looks like you were right.

358
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,231
Let's go get her.

359
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,284
That's it.

360
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,832
Don't worry. This will all be over soon.

361
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:09,992
(BEEPING)

362
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,534
Jaffa!

363
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,893
<i>Odyssey,</i> we are good to go.

364
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,739
Hey. Wake up.

365
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,348
Sorry.

366
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,089
It's not very comfortable.
Believe me, I know from experience,

367
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,456
but we're not taking any chances.

368
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,222
It's over, Adria.

369
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:17,431
(IN BA'AL'S VOICE) I'm afraid you're
mistaken. Adria is no longer available.

370
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,311
<i>LANDRY: (ON SCREEN)</i>
<i>Ba 'al is in Adria?</i>

371
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,815
Yes, sir.
It's the bad-guy equivalent of cordon bleu.

372
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,385
It actually makes sense
from his perspective, sir.

373
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,387
CARTER: Not only has he taken on
a more powerful host,

374
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,753
but Adria's also in control of the Ori army.

375
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,656
<i>So he convinces them to do his bidding</i>
<i>and not hers?</i>

376
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,355
When you think about it,
their goals aren't all that different.

377
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,863
Control of the galaxy,
worshipped by millions.

378
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:51,800
And if the Ori are dead, he'll never be
called to the carpet by the boys upstairs.

379
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,165
<i>What do we do now?</i>

380
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,863
Kill them both.

381
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,345
Hard to argue with that logic. It's a twofer.

382
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,973
Well, there's no guarantee that her army
would stop fighting even if she was dead.

383
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,847
The only way to be certain is
for her to order them to stand down.

384
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,317
Then how do we get her to do that?

385
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,481
Well, if Ba'al's symbiote is suppressing
Adria's consciousness,

386
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,182
we should be able to do the same thing.

387
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:18,422
- Swap Ba'al out for someone we can trust.
- The Tok'ra.

388
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,664
Doesn't suppressing the host
go against their fundamental beliefs?

389
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,734
Well, I'm sure they'd make
an exception in this case.

390
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,327
We've been trading intelligence with
the Tok'ra since the Ori ships first arrived.

391
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,532
They want to get rid of them
just as much as we do.

392
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,632
<i>Get in touch. See if you can set it up.</i>

393
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:35,338
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>keep a close eye on your guest.</i>

394
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,817
So, have you decided
what you intend to do with me?

395
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:51,723
Well, we're still weighing our options.
Teal'c here had a good idea.

396
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,395
- I can imagine.
- No, you cannot.

397
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:00,003
I must caution you against
doing anything too rash.

398
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,370
In fact, your best course of action
would be to release me.

399
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,376
I think we have
a difference of opinion there.

400
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,970
My whole plan was to order the Ori army
back out of this galaxy.

401
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,379
You let me carry it out,
we'll be rid of them forever.

402
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:16,648
That is our plan as well,
only without your participation.

403
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,814
What do you mean?

404
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,687
He means we're going to bring in
someone a little more reliable.

405
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:25,160
See, right now, you're like a Pinto engine
in a '71 Mustang.

406
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,356
We've got to swap you out
for a big-block Tok'ra.

407
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:31,231
It takes a great deal of effort
to suppress a consciousness this powerful.

408
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,463
The Tok'ra don't have the strength.

409
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:37,865
Not to mention the fact that I'll kill Adria
the moment you try to remove me.

410
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,137
Well, that's great. We can live with that.

411
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:44,614
Perhaps, but remember,
I'm sharing Adria's mind.

412
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,844
You would lose all access
to the knowledge I possess.

413
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,418
For example?

414
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,015
For one thing,
I can confirm the Ori are dead.

415
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,825
And that's just the beginning.

416
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:03,490
With my knowledge and your pluckiness,
we can accomplish a great deal.

417
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,034
Remember how we worked together
to locate the Sangraal?

418
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,835
As I recall,
your efforts were not particularly helpful.

419
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,142
Of course, it's your decision.

420
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:16,043
But it seems you only have two options:

421
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,115
Work with me to our mutual benefit,

422
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:22,585
or kill us both and miss out on
everything I have to offer.

423
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:35,062
You're just in time.
The Tok'ra contingent's about to arrive.

424
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,531
I am Ta'seem.

425
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,737
I will be performing the surgery.
These are my assistants.

426
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,678
Welcome on board the <i>Odyssey.</i>
I'm Colonel Davidson.

427
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,478
I'm sure you know Colonel Carter,
Dr. Jackson, and Vala.

428
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:57,112
Yes. I knew you as Qetesh.

429
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,755
Things have changed a little since then.

430
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,458
News that the leader of the Ori army
had been captured

431
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,723
came as a ray of hope to my people.

432
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:10,358
That being said, the extraction procedure
that we are about to undertake

433
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,197
is extremely difficult.

434
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,237
Even though we have refined
the process considerably,

435
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,797
there remains a very real risk
that Adria will not survive.

436
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,139
Well, the only other option we have
is to leave Ba'al in

437
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,338
and trust he's telling the truth, so...

438
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,948
Then we should begin immediately.

439
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,815
Zanuf, the symbiote that we brought,
cannot survive outside of a host for long.

440
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,911
The infirmary is this way.

441
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,263
Time to go.

442
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,067
What about our arrangement?

443
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,829
Oh, you mean the part
where you string us along

444
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,770
till you overcome the effects
of the anti-Prior device?

445
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,670
We'll pass.

What's up?

454
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,054
Nothing.

455
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,725
Just didn't feel like sticking around
for the surgery.

456
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,825
You know, weak stomach and all that.

457
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:55,770
Hey, you sure you're okay with this?

458
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,435
Why does everyone keep asking me that?

459
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,340
Because she's your daughter.

460
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,278
And no matter what she's done, it must be
difficult to see her treated this way.

461
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,748
Let's get something clear.
She's not my daughter, Daniel.

462
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,412
The Ori impregnated me against my will
and forced me to bring her into the galaxy.

463
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:14,048
I was an incubator,
a shipping crate and nothing more.

464
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,650
I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe
that you don't feel something.

00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:21,755
I do. Satisfaction at seeing their plan fail.

- Trouble with the surgery.

What happened?

474
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,504
Ba'al decided to be
even more difficult than usual.

475
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,098
We were able to extract him,
but not before he released

476
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,939

into Adria's nervous system.

477
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,647
Can't the Tok'ra symbiote heal her?

478
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:14,616
Unfortunately, we were unable
to complete the implantation.

479
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,051
The host body was simply too weak.

480
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,782
Adria is unconscious at the moment,

481
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,859
but when she wakens,
she will suffer greatly before she dies.

482
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:25,122
The one thing we can do for her
is an increased dosage of the toxin.

483
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,288
It will kill her instantly.

In the interest of patient care
and for our own safety,

I recommend that
we administer it immediately.

<i>You got it.</i>

502
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,567
There's an auxiliary control console
on this level.

503
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,608
If I can get to it,
I might be able to override it.

504
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,698
Go.

505
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,744
(MOANS)

506
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,283
You can quit acting.
You're obviously not sick.

507
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,511
No, this body really is dying.

508
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,653
I just want to use what little time
I have left as wisely as possible.

509
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,952
By doing what?
Destroying me and my friends?

510
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,755
Don't be silly, Mother.

511
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:14,490
If I wanted to kill you,
I could have done it a long time ago.

512
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,960
No, I need time to prepare.

513
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,798
Prepare for what?

514
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,197
Ascension.

515
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,505
- Vala!
- Don't.

516
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,975
Vala, can you hear me?

517
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:35,711
Guys, it's Daniel. I can't reach Vala.

518
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,955
Daniel Jackson, what is your location?

519
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,390
Just outside the infirmary.
Adria's locked them in.

520
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,927
We are blocked as well.

521
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,623
Colonel Mitchell is attempting
to cut through one of the doors.

522
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,199
Well, you better hurry up.

523
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,598
I think I figured out
what she's trying to do.

524
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,693
Adria's trying to ascend.

525
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,742
Adria, you don't have to do this.

526
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,337
Granted, this wasn't part of my plan,

527
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:08,818
but I can still accomplish a great deal,
perhaps even more.

528
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,580
More what?
More deaths, more enslavement?

529
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,350
Don't attempt to play on
my compassion, Mother.

530
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,386
As you said, I'm not your daughter.
I'm an Ori.

531
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,292
Part Ori, part human.

532
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,129
That will soon change.

533
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,721
Great. Carter, how's that override coming?

534
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,520
Well, it's not.
I mean, it wouldn't do any good.

535
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,690
What the hell does that mean?

536
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,560
She's not actually in control of the system.

537
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,066
I think she's just holding the doors shut
with her mind.

538
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,569
Cutting torch will take too long.

539
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,070
- What is it?
- Your friends are very determined.

540
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,689
Daniel, I'm showing a coolant leak
in the hallway you're in right now.

541
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:28,322
Spotted that, thanks. It's Adria.
She's trying to distract us.

542
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,593
Well, it's a hell of a distraction.
That stuff's toxic.

543
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,168
You need to get out of there right now.

544
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,169
<i>JACKSON: Yeah,</i>
<i>that's going to be a problem.</i>

545
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,795
Can you shut it down?

546
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,535
I'll have to re-route coolant out of
the entire section. I'm on it.

547
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:46,581
Vala, if you can hear me,
I really need you to open the door!

548
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,219
Adria, stop it, please!

549
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,315
That's it.

550
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,890
I always wondered
if you had it in you to kill me.

551
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,027
Goodbye, Mother.

552
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:48,142
- Nice work.
- It wasn't us. Adria let go.

553
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:16,740
(COUGHING)

554
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,670
- Jackson!
- I'm okay.

555
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,883
Where's Adria?

556
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,811
She's gone.

557
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,932
JACKSON: And once Adria realized
she couldn't save herself,

558
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,030
she had no choice but to ascend.

559
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,909
What do you suppose this means for us?

560
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,206
To be honest, I'm not sure.
If the Ori are still out there,

561
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,008
then, presumably, she's joined the fight,

562
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:01,107
but if Ba'al was telling the truth
and the Ori are dead,

563
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,743
then she just assumed
all the power they once had.

564
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,687
Either way, we could see some incarnation
of her again down the road.

565
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,951
Holding a serious grudge.

566
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,994
At least we may take comfort
in the knowledge that Ba'al is dead.

567
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:15,065
Wouldn't put a deposit down
on that just yet.

568
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,028
When we were breaking Adria
out of Ba'al's ship,

569
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,537
I ran across another clone guarding her.

570
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,704
Killed him, but where there is one...

571
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,173
There may be more.

572
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:29,278
We captured and killed Adria and Ba'al
on the same day.

573
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,372
- Are you telling me this is all a wash?
- No.

574
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:36,776
We dealt the Ori movement
a serious blow today,

575
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:40,015
and we rid ourselves of Adria
for the time being.

576
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,820
That is definitely a step ahead.
