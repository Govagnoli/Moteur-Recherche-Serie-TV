1
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:09,679
The war between Baal and the System
Lords has reached a critical stage.

2
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:14,077
According to intelligence, Bastet and
Olokun are dead, Morrigan's capitulated,

3
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:18,681
Lord Yu and Amaterasu are rallying their
armies for what will be their last stand.

4
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:21,962
As we predicted,
the Jaffa were no match for the Kull.

5
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:24,513
The Tok'ra also said
that in the face of defeat,

6
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:27,915
some of the System Lords
are actively seeking areas of refuge.

7
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:32,760
Planets they abandoned long ago are now
being scouted as possible sanctuaries.

8
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:35,279
And this affects us how?

9
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:38,402
One of these planets,
which fell under the domain of Ares,

10
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:43,036
happens to be where the Tok'ra dropped
off one Harry Maybourne two years ago.

11
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,400
And this affects us how?

12
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:50,717
The Tok'ra have their hands full
with pressing matters.

13
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:55,321
They strongly suggest we get
to Maybourne before the Goa'uld do.

14
00:00:55,405 --> 00:01:00,604
If we do not retrieve him,
Harry Maybourne faces certain capture.

15
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:03,764
Torture. Interrogation.

16
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:06,040
Perhaps even death.

17
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:11,125
All right. Fine. Go get him.

18
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:13,956
Yes, sir.

19
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:32,044
The people of this world
are fairly primitive.

20
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:37,199
No phones, no lights, no motor cars. I bet
Maybourne jumps at a chance to leave.

21
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:39,753
What about the other inhabitants?

22
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:42,040
We'll relocate them.

23
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:47,245
We may not have a lot of time.
Ares could be here in a matter of days.

24
00:01:57,005 --> 00:01:59,599
We don't mean you any harm.

25
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:03,679
We are allies of the Tok'ra.

26
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:08,401
Looking for a friend. Harry Maybourne.
Maybe you've heard of him.

27
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,998
Shifty fella.

28
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:12,553
Beady eyes. No?

29
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:15,682
You will follow us to the village
and meet King Arkhan.

30
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:19,075
He will discern your true intentions.

31
00:02:57,525 --> 00:03:00,039
Not exactly the trusting type.

32
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:03,598
Which leads me to wonder
whether Maybourne is alive.

33
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:06,324
Presumably the Tok'ra
put in a good word for him.

34
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:10,080
Maybe we should get them
to do the same for us.

35
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:31,114
Maybourne.

36
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:33,594
This is King Arkhan.

37
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:38,677
My lord, our hunting party encountered
these offworlders by the gate.

38
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,323
Hey, guys.

39
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:42,999
Long time no see.

40
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:52,241
I should have known. I should
have known you'd be the ones to come.

41
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,441
You were expecting us?

42
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:57,403
Sort of. Where's Jack?

43
00:04:57,485 --> 00:05:00,795
- General O'Neill's back at the SGC.
- No kidding?

44
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:04,321
General O'Neill? That doesn't sound right.

45
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:07,283
Good for Jack. Nice to hear
he's doing well for himself.

46
00:05:07,365 --> 00:05:09,481
As, evidently, are you.

47
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:10,964
Uh...

48
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,684
This? Yes, well...

49
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:15,915
It's a long story.

50
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:18,039
Food!

51
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:21,599
Drinks for our guests!

52
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:29,520
We don't have time for this.

53
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:34,434
You should try one of these. It's called...

54
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:36,322
- Ojen fruit.
- Right.

55
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:40,842
- It's a cross between guava and mango.
- Sort of a "guango"?

56
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,916
I like that.

57
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:49,394
People. Henceforth,
ojen fruit shall be called "guango".

58
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,840
So shall it be.

59
00:05:55,485 --> 00:06:00,195
I get to name all kinds of stuff. You should
see the Grateful Dead burial ground.

60
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:03,118
You have to get out of here.
You're in danger.

61
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:06,561
I know. The Goa'uld are coming.

62
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:10,684
You should peel it before you eat it.
I find the skin kind of tart.

63
00:06:10,765 --> 00:06:13,563
- You know about the Goa'uld?
- Oh, yeah.

64
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,037
You were warned by the Tok'ra?

65
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:24,243
I haven't heard from the Tok'ra
since they dropped me off.

66
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:25,758
Then how?

67
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,723
I can read the future.

68
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:31,921
Mm.

69
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:35,315
- Really.
- What are you trying to pull?

70
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:38,442
He speaks the truth.
King Arkhan is a prophet.

71
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:42,438
He foresaw your arrival and the hand
you will play in defeating our enemy.

72
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:46,313
Garan's right. It's all part of the prophecy.

73
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,595
Maybourne,
what the hell is going on here?

74
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:58,154
Let's go for a walk.

75
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:05,076
OK.

76
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:06,996
Here we are.

77
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:13,081
I found this place about ten months ago
when I was out on an afternoon stroll.

78
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:17,878
- It is quite a distance from the village.
- I enjoy long walks.

79
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:22,481
Right. Long walks,
rainy nights, and candlelit dinners.

80
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:26,274
- Why are we here, Maybourne?
- This writing is in Ancient.

81
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:31,122
- What do the locals know about these?
- Well, not much.

82
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:34,641
They avoid the area
because it's close to the naqahdah mines,

83
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:37,922
the site of their former enslavement.
Bad luck and all.

84
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:40,280
- This is incredible.
- No. No.

85
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:43,038
This is... interesting.

86
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,923
This is incredible.

87
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,918
What is it?

88
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:57,839
It's a record of the planet's history,
covering major events -

89
00:07:57,925 --> 00:08:00,439
only some of them haven't happened yet.

90
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:05,235
- What are you talking about?
- They have a complicated lunar calendar.

91
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:08,874
Took me a while to figure it out,
but once I did, I realised...

92
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:14,801
there were references in the text to things
that are gonna happen in the future.

93
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:17,319
I know, it sounds crazy.

94
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:20,363
I didn't think much of it either at the time.

95
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:26,441
But then this big meteor shower happened
exactly on the date the stone predicted.

96
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:28,675
You sure you're reading it correctly?

97
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:32,360
My skills may not compare
with Dr Jackson's,

98
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,881
but I've picked up
a decent understanding of Ancient writing.

99
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:42,313
As a result of my translations, I predicted
a major flood would destroy the village

100
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,397
unless I convinced the elders
to move to higher ground.

101
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:49,000
And, of course, you told them
where these predictions came from?

102
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:51,963
No. Well, not in so many words.

103
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:57,281
Look, these are simple people.
This stuff would mean nothing to them.

104
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:59,959
I had to play the role of prophet
to convince them.

105
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:03,435
And out of gratitude, they made you king.

106
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,993
Like I said, it was their idea.

107
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,997
Well, he's partly right, anyway.
It is a historical log.

108
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:19,113
"In the 45th cycle, the ground will tremble
and devastation will be wrought."

109
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:22,675
Yeah, yeah. Big earthquake
couple of years back. Before my time.

110
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:26,075
Skip ahead. We're in the 54th cycle.

111
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:35,476
- "In the third moon of the 54th cycle..."
- Which is now, give or take a few days.

112
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,557
- "..the oppressors of old will return..."
- The Goa'uld.

113
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,955
"..to seek dominion over the land."

114
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:45,435
- "Those of a distant world will come..."
- That's you guys.

115
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,642
"..to vanquish the evil
and restore order once again."

116
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:51,922
You see? They come, you defeat them.

117
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:55,077
Happy ending. That's the prophecy.

118
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:59,434
Sorry, but we didn't come here
to fight the Goa'uld.

119
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:03,920
- We should get going.
- Actually, um, this is interesting,

120
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:06,678
and there's a lot here to translate.

121
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:24,118
- Sam.
- Go ahead.

122
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:28,235
- Maybourne was right.
- What do you mean?

123
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:31,635
Well, from what I've been able to decipher,
it's pretty clear.

124
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:34,922
The script is a historical log
compiled by an Ancient

125
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:38,714
who travelled through time
to study the evolution of life.

126
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,036
Daniel, we know the Ancients
experimented with time travel,

127
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,685
but we have no evidence
that they mastered it.

128
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:49,395
We do now. To my knowledge, these
are only a couple of hundred years old.

129
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:52,443
Which means they were carved
after the Goa'uld had left.

130
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,641
But the Ancients predate the Goa'uld.

131
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:57,876
The only explanation is
an Ancient travelled to the future

132
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:01,594
and then back to a time not too long ago.

133
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:04,961
- I don't know.
- There are references to the travel device.

134
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:09,561
It's described as being inside a small ship.
Now, if I'm right, it may still be here.

135
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:11,795
I think it's worth a look.

136
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,994
All right. We're on our way.

137
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:34,001
Daniel.

138
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:35,643
Go ahead.

139
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:39,957
We've been at it a while.
Are you sure it's around here?

140
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:43,598
Just give it a little more time.

141
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:49,474
I hate to say it, Daniel,
but we can't risk staying much longer.

142
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:14,394
I'm scrubbing the search.
Fall back to the gate.

143
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:15,759
Sam.

144
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:19,201
Daniel, we have no way ofknowing
when the Goa'uld will get here.

145
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:24,564
- It could be days.
- And it could be hours.

146
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:26,476
Colonel Carter, Daniel Jackson.

147
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:31,479
I have found something.

148
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:19,195
- It certainly looks like a ship.
- These appear to be flight controls.

149
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:21,276
So what's this?

150
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:27,079
Could be the time device.

151
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:33,160
It bears little resemblance
to Ancient designs we've encountered.

152
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,555
Judging from Maybourne's wall,
it worked at some point.

153
00:13:36,645 --> 00:13:41,673
I'm guessing it manifests some energy
field that encompasses the entire ship,

154
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:45,041
allowing the traveller
to literally fly though time.

155
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,764
- I wonder.
- Uh-uh.

156
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:50,359
Let's not touch anything just yet.

157
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:53,994
- I'm kind of fond of this era.
- OK, so what do we do?

158
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:57,755
We bring it back.

159
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:02,475
Judging by the dimensions, it looks like
it was designed to fit through the gate.

160
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:06,763
- OK, how do we get it there?
- This vessel appears to be undamaged.

161
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,915
The engine may yet be functional.

162
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:11,394
This is Ancient technology.

163
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,753
We'd need an Ancient to make it work.

164
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:18,882
Or someone close.

165
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,522
Jack.

166
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:43,563
It's great to see you. How long's it been?

167
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:50,437
Oh, since that time you got us
stranded offworld and tried to kill me.

168
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:55,474
That takes me back.
I guess congratulations are in order.

169
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:58,443
- You made general.
- You made king.

170
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:01,915
Right. Well, it's, uh, not a contest, hm?

171
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:05,403
Do you mind?
These guys are torturing that ditty.

172
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:10,036
Uh, right. Take five, guys.
I taught 'em that expression.

173
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,524
Ah.

174
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:17,441
I'm hoping that you can stay for a while.
You know, check out the sights.

175
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:22,683
Take in the culture.
I want you to feel at home here.

176
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:28,203
Harry, you're aware this place is going to
be overrun by a gaggle of bad guys soon?

177
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:30,082
Yeah, well, maybe.

178
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:31,883
Right.

179
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,844
Carter told me about this prophecy.
It's not going to go down that way.

180
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:38,359
Come on.
You've defeated System Lords before.

181
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:42,723
No. You've got to tell these people to start
packing. We'll take as many as we can.

182
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:46,639
I can't.
I already told them you'd save the day.

183
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:50,039
Let me ask you a question.

184
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:55,962
Did this prophecy mention
anything about casualties?

185
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:58,957
How many people
would die in the fighting?

186
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:05,722
- It's not really that detailed.
- Anything about the king surviving at all?

187
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:12,356
Actually, there's... no reference
to me specifically.

188
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:15,596
- I just assumed...
- Do you really wanna take that chance?

189
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:18,279
Do you wanna roll those dice?

190
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:27,161
- It's not gonna be easy to convince 'em.
- You can do it, Harry.

191
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:29,759
You're the king.

192
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:32,439
And remember, it's good to be king.

193
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:46,758
- Nice ride.
- Yeah, Ancients like to fly in style.

194
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,802
Nice!

195
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:58,323
Whoo-hoo!

196
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:06,003
You're gonna have to help me, Carter.
Got any quarters?

197
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:09,236
I can't help you with this one, sir.
You're on your own.

198
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:11,122
Fine.

199
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:17,801
How do we know we're not
gonna end up back at the Alamo?

200
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:20,001
For one thing, that was on Earth.

201
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:25,682
But, more importantly, I've separated
the time device from the control circuits...

202
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:27,756
I think.

203
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:32,435
Concentrate on powering up the engines.

204
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,197
Concentrate?

205
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:51,074
Got nothing.

206
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:55,158
You've proven your Ancient gene
allows you to operate Ancient technology.

207
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:58,362
It's no different
than the device in Antarctica.

208
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,322
Just...

209
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:02,999
focus your mind.

210
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:26,121
Good.

211
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:28,316
Good.

212
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:39,756
Not so good.

213
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:52,602
Tempus fugit, girls. Tempus fugit.

214
00:18:57,565 --> 00:19:01,524
I sure collected a lot in only a couple
of years. I guess I'm a bit of a pack rat.

215
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:04,722
- When will you address your people?
- I'm getting to that.

216
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:07,763
I'm thinking about what I'm going to say.

217
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:11,440
- Perhaps you should consider the truth.
- That's one strategy.

218
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,961
Whatever you decide, we are running
out of time. We must leave soon.

219
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:18,003
Yeah, I know. I know.

220
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,604
No, no. Just leave that.
That stuff, over there.

221
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:36,840
The primary power source is depleted. We
need to re-route to the secondary output,

222
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,361
which was originally designed
to power the time device.

223
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,005
Of course we do.

224
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,399
OK.

225
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,919
Try it now, sir.

226
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:21,444
Dammit!

227
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:33,481
I'm just not that familiar with
Ancient technology. I need a little time.

228
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,717
- That is one thing I can't give you, Carter.
- You can't be serious.

229
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:40,444
Sir, this technology is too valuable to lose.

230
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:43,358
What do you want me to do?
Call in reinforcements?

231
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:46,005
We're not throwing down
with a couple of Jaffa.

232
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:50,636
We're taking on a System Lord
and his band of merry bad guys.

233
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:56,081
Inside and out. I want that thing gone.

234
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:07,877
Surrender your weapons,
or die where you stand.

235
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:11,360
Oh, if I had a nickel...

236
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:14,755
Lower your weapons.

237
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:18,474
I... don't think so.

238
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:21,955
We will not allow you
to take King Arkhan from us.

239
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:24,843
Good King Arkhan is a fraud.

240
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,793
Our king is wise. He is a seer.

241
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:30,763
He may be your king, but he's no seer.

242
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:34,758
He can only interpret what's been
written on pillars of the temple ruins.

243
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:39,202
Those hold the prophecies. Anyone who
can read them can make the predictions.

244
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:42,197
That is a lie!

245
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:47,643
Why don't we just go back to the village
and let King Arkhan explain everything?

246
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:50,034
First, lower your weapons.

247
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:55,956
- Jack?
- Daniel?

248
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,039
They're not going to shoot.

249
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,116
Are you?

250
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:20,081
God, I miss going offworld.

251
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:21,678
Oh, yeah.

252
00:22:32,045 --> 00:22:35,833
- Who'd have thunk?
- Oh, hey, Jack.

253
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:39,915
I, uh, spoke with Garan.

254
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:43,680
I'm sorry to hear about what happened.
I had nothing to do with it.

255
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:47,963
I know, Harry.
You're always the victim in these things.

256
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:52,436
OK, look, I'll admit
that when I first found the ruins,

257
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:56,362
I did plan to use them
to my personal advantage.

258
00:22:56,445 --> 00:23:00,279
- But all that changed once I became king.
- Oh, please.

259
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:02,435
It's true, Jack.

260
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:04,880
I care about these people.
I wanna help them.

261
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:08,719
Then tell 'em the truth.
Come clean on all this stuff.

262
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:14,163
I've already arranged
for an assembly with the village elders.

263
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:17,996
I'm gonna tell 'em we have to leave.

264
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:42,235
Well...

265
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:44,919
Here goes nothing.

266
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:56,960
My friends.

267
00:23:57,045 --> 00:23:59,764
I wish I were here
under better circumstances,

268
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:03,724
but the fact is I come
before you all to deliver a warning.

269
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:10,195
The village is in danger,
and the time has come for us to leave.

270
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:14,233
We must abandon our world.

271
00:24:14,765 --> 00:24:18,804
Arrangements are being made to help us...

272
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:22,683
temporarily relocate to a safe place.

273
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:28,442
But the prophecy was clear.
The enemy will be defeated.

274
00:24:28,965 --> 00:24:30,796
Uh, yes. Uh...

275
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:33,763
The prophecy was clear,
but only up to a certain point.

276
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:36,518
After that, it was somewhat unclear.

277
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,561
Sort of a...

278
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,954
murky clarity.

279
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:50,681
Of course the enemy will be defeated.

280
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:55,919
But there is a chance that some of us
may get hurt or even killed in the process.

281
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:58,235
- I am not willing...
- Impossible.

282
00:24:58,325 --> 00:25:00,520
You assured us we would be safe.

283
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:02,923
Yes, I...

284
00:25:03,805 --> 00:25:05,796
I remember that.

285
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:07,841
However...

286
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:28,196
The truth is...

287
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,994
I've not been entirely honest with you.

288
00:25:35,445 --> 00:25:37,959
I am not a seer.

289
00:25:38,045 --> 00:25:44,962
I don't possess insight into the future,
or... divine powers that set me apart.

290
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:48,921
I'm just a regular guy,

291
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,883
no more or less special than any of you.

292
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,560
But the prophecies.

293
00:25:57,285 --> 00:26:00,800
The prophecies don't come from me.

294
00:26:00,885 --> 00:26:06,596
They come from the walls of the old
temple, written in stone for all to see.

295
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:11,884
I have the ability
to interpret these writings,

296
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:15,435
and with the proper understanding,

297
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:18,119
any of you could do the same.

298
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:26,198
I am a pretender.

299
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:29,599
I took advantage of you,

300
00:26:29,685 --> 00:26:32,643
and...

301
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:37,401
and for that I am deeply sorry.

302
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:41,113
What about the design
for the new water mill?

303
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:43,321
Was this written on the temple wall?

304
00:26:43,405 --> 00:26:45,555
No, that was from me.

305
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,399
And our new medicines. Our legal code.

306
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:53,763
The irrigation system.
Were these things also found in the ruins?

307
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,836
No.

308
00:26:55,925 --> 00:27:00,157
These were not the acts of a pretender,
but of a leader.

309
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:07,003
Guys, I'm touched. Really.

310
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,838
What does it matter
where the prophecies came from?

311
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:13,201
All we need know is that
each one of them has been fulfilled.

312
00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:17,836
- As this latest will be fulfilled.
- Let's not get carried away here.

313
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:22,999
We will defeat this enemy. And we will do
so under the leadership of our great king,

314
00:27:23,085 --> 00:27:27,363
Arkhan the First. Arkhan! Arkhan!

315
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,242
Arkhan! Arkhan!

316
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:31,481
Arkhan! Arkhan!

317
00:27:31,685 --> 00:27:33,437
Arkhan! Arkhan!

318
00:27:33,645 --> 00:27:35,283
Arkhan! Arkhan!

319
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:37,521
Arkhan! Arkhan!

320
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:39,477
Arkhan! Arkhan!

321
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:41,437
Arkhan! Arkhan!

322
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:50,038
Jack. Look, sorry about that.

323
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:54,915
Not my problem, Harry. If these folks
don't wanna go, they don't have to go.

324
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:57,917
Teal'c, you and Daniel
head on back, secure the gate.

325
00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:01,202
Carter, you and I will take care of the ship.

326
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:03,480
Jack, Jack, wait a minute.

327
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:08,116
I know it sounds crazy,
but Garan was right about the prophecies.

328
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:10,196
They have all come true.

329
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:13,118
Harry, we're not staying.

330
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:18,723
And if you wanna come with us, I suggest
you get your royal butt to the gate.

331
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:49,356
Jack, come in.

332
00:28:49,445 --> 00:28:51,401
Go ahead.

333
00:28:51,485 --> 00:28:53,999
We got a little problem here.

334
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:58,636
Ares' Jaffa just came through the gate.

335
00:28:58,725 --> 00:29:03,435
We're cut off. If you blow the ship now,
you'll give away your position.

336
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:06,198
Guess we're staying for a while.

337
00:29:29,805 --> 00:29:33,036
Welcome, strangers.
I am King Arkhan the First.

338
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,480
It is with a joyful heart
that we welcome you.

339
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:39,877
I'm Trelak, first prime
to the great Lord Ares, your god,

340
00:29:39,965 --> 00:29:43,560
who will be returning to reclaim
this land and his loyal followers.

341
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:48,514
Of course, of course.
Glad tidings of comfort and joy,

342
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:50,596
comfort and joy.

343
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:54,121
Lord Ares demands
nothing short of complete obedience

344
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,765
from both you and your people.

345
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:59,882
Any resistance will be dealt with harshly.

346
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,762
Understood.

347
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:07,762
Gather your subjects.
Inform them of our arrival.

348
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:11,440
Of course. I'll address them immediately.

349
00:30:14,285 --> 00:30:17,960
- Do you have something to say, slave?
- I am not a slave.

350
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:22,880
I apologise. My servant spoke out of turn.
She will be punished.

351
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:25,399
Of course she will.

352
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:34,475
Kill me if you want, but know this:

353
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:39,514
in the end, your people will be defeated,
just as the prophecy has foretold.

354
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:42,324
The prophecy?

355
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:45,522
Pay no attention.
She's frightened beyond reason.

356
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:48,563
It foretold of your arrival
and of your defeat.

357
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:52,923
Another predicted rain today with morning
frost, yet what fine weather we enjoy.

358
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:54,996
Silence!

359
00:30:57,365 --> 00:31:00,482
Where may I find this prophecy?

360
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:08,281
If what you say is true, then we would be
fools to stay and meet our certain death.

361
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:14,358
It is written on the walls of the old temple.

362
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,838
Go with her.

363
00:31:31,485 --> 00:31:33,476
Sam, Jack. This is Daniel.

364
00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:36,033
Ares' first prime
sent men to check the ruins.

365
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:39,674
Once they see the Ancient writing,
they will search the area.

366
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,756
Carter. How's it going?

367
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:45,918
- Just a few more minutes, sir.
- I thought you were blowing it up.

368
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:49,998
O'Neill's given me a chance to get
the engines online so we can fly it out.

369
00:31:50,085 --> 00:31:52,724
You're cutting it kind ofclose.

370
00:31:52,805 --> 00:31:55,114
I know.

371
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:06,681
I have prepared a feast in your honour.

372
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:08,756
Come.

373
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:12,121
Please, sit.

374
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:14,355
Partake of our bounty.

375
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:19,517
This fruit, for instance,
it's sort of a cross between...

376
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,403
I'm not interested in your offering.

377
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:27,684
You were warned.
Anyone who refuses to accept us will die.

378
00:32:28,165 --> 00:32:31,157
You've made yourself perfectly clear.

379
00:32:31,245 --> 00:32:33,361
To you, perhaps.

380
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:36,835
But your subjects seem
less than willing to accept our terms.

381
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:40,361
They cling to archaic beliefs,
prophecies, portents,

382
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:43,835
that threaten
to undermine the rule of our god.

383
00:32:46,245 --> 00:32:48,839
That won't happen.

384
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:52,556
I can see to it.

385
00:32:54,365 --> 00:32:56,560
How?

386
00:32:56,645 --> 00:33:00,081
They're simple folk, easily influenced.

387
00:33:00,885 --> 00:33:04,798
With my help, you'll have no trouble
bending them to your will.

388
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:07,996
It's here.

389
00:33:34,085 --> 00:33:35,074
Dammit.

390
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,602
Carter.

391
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:39,482
Sir.

392
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:42,318
They're headed our way.

393
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:44,999
I need more time.

394
00:33:45,885 --> 00:33:48,160
Yeah, of course you do.

395
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,275
Those were Tauri weapons.

396
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:15,515
What's a Tauri?

397
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:42,396
Time's up.

398
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:59,796
You're too late to save this world.
I've already received word.

399
00:34:59,885 --> 00:35:02,353
Lord Ares has just arrived.

400
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:19,195
I'm done, I think.

401
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:23,123
You're good to go, sir.

402
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:25,719
I'm doing the best I can.

403
00:35:25,805 --> 00:35:29,514
What were you and your allies planning?

404
00:35:36,445 --> 00:35:38,800
Know this, shol'va.

405
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:42,915
I'll see to it that you suffer slowly.

406
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:46,884
And I will see to it that you die quickly.

407
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:13,755
I think not. My men guard the gate,

408
00:36:13,845 --> 00:36:17,235
and the mothership
descends as we speak.

409
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:57,242
You were plotting in concert
with the people of this world.

410
00:36:57,325 --> 00:37:00,317
Treachery is something we cannot abide.

411
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:03,363
I couldn't agree more.
You think you feel outraged?

412
00:37:03,445 --> 00:37:07,404
Imagine how I feel.
Betrayed by my own people.

413
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:28,238
Sir, we're detecting another ship. It's big.

414
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:05,562
Shol'va!

415
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:48,517
- You are a man of your word.
- Indeed.

416
00:39:02,485 --> 00:39:04,601
You're doing great, sir.

417
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:09,196
Relatively speaking.

418
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:18,162
Weapons.

419
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:20,284
Weapons.

420
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:29,518
- Keep firing, sir.
- Nothing's happening.

421
00:39:29,605 --> 00:39:33,837
Weapons must be depleted.
Hopefully you hit some vital systems.

422
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:47,804
Think that was vital?

423
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,353
Relatively speaking.

424
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:10,723
- You sure you don't want to leave all this?
- I can't abandon these people, Jack.

425
00:40:10,805 --> 00:40:15,515
I made a life here. I can't walk away
from my home, my friends.

426
00:40:15,605 --> 00:40:17,800
My wives.

427
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:20,240
Wives?

428
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:26,642
Go.

429
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:36,116
Wives.

430
00:41:28,205 --> 00:41:31,515
