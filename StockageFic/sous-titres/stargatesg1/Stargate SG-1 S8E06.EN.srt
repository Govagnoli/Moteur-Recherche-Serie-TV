1
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:12,945
<i>Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>
<i>All security teams to the gateroom.</i>

2
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:22,897
Give me your weapon.

3
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:24,427
Simulation time, 49 seconds.
That's not bad, not bad.

4
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:27,944
- How was it? Was it fun?
- Indeed.

5
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:31,225
You died well in battle, O'Neill.

6
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:35,101
Obviously there's something
defective with this.

7
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:40,660
Agreed. An Anubis drone is a far more
formidable warrior than this suggests.

8
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:44,104
What? No... We've been
working on this chair for two years

9
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,976
to make it a viable virtual-reality
training tool for SGC personnel.

10
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:50,707
You have failed.

11
00:01:51,508 --> 00:01:53,578
He's nothing if not honest.

12
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:55,147
Well...

13
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:58,220
I mean, maybe it could
use a little more work, but...

14
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:01,584
Can you make it harder... more difficult?

15
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:06,298
Well, we can input the parameters
for different scenarios,

16
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:10,586
but the vast majority of the simulation
array comes from the mind of the user.

17
00:02:10,668 --> 00:02:15,139
The programming is actually built
by interfacing memories

18
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:20,018
from the individual's consciousness
with the chair's matrix.

19
00:02:20,108 --> 00:02:24,545
Carter, all I heard was "matrix",
and I found those films quite confusing.

20
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:29,065
What Dr Lee is trying to explain is that
the simulation actually learns its realism

21
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:31,981
- from the person using it.
- What?

22
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:36,539
We've built it. We've tested the software
extensively using a variety of subjects.

23
00:02:36,628 --> 00:02:39,347
Obviously no one
with Teal'c's field experience.

24
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:40,986
Subjects?

25
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:43,502
To whom do you refer?

26
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:53,262
Hey.

27
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:57,023
If Teal'c would agree
to work with us a little more...

28
00:02:57,108 --> 00:03:01,101
All you'd have to do is basically
play the game. Let it learn from you.

29
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:04,260
Come on, it'd be fun. You'd be so good.

30
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,826
Very well.

31
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:12,586
There you go. Just make sure
there's a beginners' level for the rest of us.

32
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:17,822
Oh, yeah. We can always make it easier.
Not that we'd have to for you, certainly.

33
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:21,821
For others, but you would be fine.

34
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:24,979
Carter. Gentlemen.

35
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:36,461
Thanks to Colonel Carter's
new code translation program,

36
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:41,668
we can monitor your progress through
a representation of your point of view.

37
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,627
- You've played <i>Doom.</i>
- I played <i>Def Jam Vendetta.</i>

38
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,380
Exactly. Yes.

39
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:51,939
There is a two-second delay between the
chair's processor and your experience,

40
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:56,101
but you shouldn't notice anything.

41
00:04:56,188 --> 00:05:00,101
Anyway, we can store every aspect of
your activity in the game,

42
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:05,467
then later choose what to incorporate into
our programming of the training scenario.

43
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:09,700
You understand, as before, once
your mind is interfaced with the chair,

44
00:05:09,788 --> 00:05:14,384
we cannot remove the connection
or cut power without endangering you.

45
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:17,301
- Indeed.
- It's a function of the new chair design.

46
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:22,781
Since the gamekeeper incident, the aliens
of P7J-989 built in the shut-off command,

47
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:25,063
so only someone in the chair
can control it.

48
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:27,901
You have previously
given me this information.

49
00:05:27,988 --> 00:05:31,617
This is different this time, because
the game will be learning from you,

50
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,905
then incorporating those changes
into its programming code.

51
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:38,583
If you're killed in the game,
it will reset and you'll start again.

52
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:41,747
The chair will only
end the game under two conditions:

53
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:45,537
once you complete the scenario
or if you engage the internal fail-safe,

54
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:50,986
- which you're free to do at any time.
- That will be unnecessary.

55
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:57,181
Don't be so cocky. The chair is intuitive.
It'll eventually learn everything you know.

56
00:05:57,268 --> 00:05:59,543
If you want to stop it
before the conclusion,

57
00:05:59,628 --> 00:06:03,018
just get to the base elevator,
head for the surface.

58
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:04,860
Ready?

59
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,939
Proceed.

60
00:06:19,348 --> 00:06:24,741
<i>Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>
<i>All security teams to the gateroom.</i>

61
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:34,907
Give me your weapon.

62
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:54,179
- What just happened?
- It looks like the chair induced pain.

63
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:57,704
It's directly linked to his brain.
We knew it was capable of this.

64
00:06:57,788 --> 00:07:00,461
But it's just a simulation.
It doesn't have to hurt.

65
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:02,857
That's the difference
between you and Teal'c.

66
00:07:02,948 --> 00:07:05,940
He knows in a real situation
your tactics would be different

67
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:08,098
if you thought you couldn't feel any pain.

68
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:10,463
Man, that was a heck of a shock.

69
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:14,226
He wanted it to be realistic.

70
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:21,780
Fortunately, we limited the chair from
being able to deliver any sort of lethal jolt.

71
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:31,984
<i>Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>
<i>All security teams to the gateroom.</i>

72
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:08,625
O'Neill.

73
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:12,543
Get outta here, Teal'c.

74
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:23,698
That's twice.
Looks like the chair is learning quickly.

75
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:26,063
Don't count Teal'c out yet.

76
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:33,387
Ooh, that's cold.

77
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:39,262
Colonel, I'm pretty concerned
about some of these bio-readings.

78
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:41,339
Me too.

79
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:48,257
Dr Carmichael, this is Colonel Carter.
Can you join us in Science Lab Five?

80
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:53,186
<i>Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>
<i>All security teams to the gateroom.</i>

81
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:55,259
Teal'c!

82
00:09:57,628 --> 00:10:00,620
- I require your assistance.
- Likewise. SG-3 came in hot.

83
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:04,064
- Our gateroom people could use backup.
- They are all dead.

84
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,423
- Excuse me?
- The gateroom has been breached.

85
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:10,421
Our most effective defence is to seal off
the east and south ends of level 28.

86
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:13,022
If we act now,
we may force them into a crossfire.

87
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:15,781
- Force who?
- The two Anubis warriors.

88
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:18,621
- How can you know that?
- They've chosen the same route

89
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,097
seven of the last ten times.

90
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:40,977
<i>Colonel, two hostiles</i>
<i>are headed your way.</i>

91
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:44,378
Roger that. We're in position.
Heads up, people.

92
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:04,866
Fall back!

93
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:31,578
Well, you were right
to be concerned about these readings.

94
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:34,182
Frequent spikes in his natural adrenaline

95
00:11:34,268 --> 00:11:37,943
are causing blood pressure and heart rate
too high to be sustained long term.

96
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:40,019
That last ambush should have worked.

97
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:43,225
- Why did the weapon have no effect?
- I don't know.

98
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:46,664
Has a Super Soldier been resistant
to that weapon in reality?

99
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,057
- No.
- But it is possible, right?

100
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:53,539
The Goa'uld have adapted technology to
fight something we've thrown at them.

101
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:55,186
Well...

102
00:11:55,268 --> 00:12:01,503
Hopefully the game will also extrapolate
solutions and offer them to Teal'c.

103
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:04,617
I mean, it'd just be fair.

104
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:08,460
<i>Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six...</i>

105
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:14,180
Teal'c! SG-3 came in hot. Sounds like
the gateroom people could use backup.

106
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:17,101
- We gotta move!
- Colonel Carter, listen to me.

107
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:19,656
The SGC has been penetrated
by two Anubis drones.

108
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:23,343
Our weapons are ineffective against
their armour. How is this possible?

109
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:26,226
- That's what I want to know.
- I speak of the armour.

110
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:28,902
It could have been altered
to resist the energy weapons.

111
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:32,663
- Can they now be defeated?
- I've been working on a modulator chip.

112
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:34,739
- Where is it?
- In my lab, but I still...

113
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:38,939
Show me.

114
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:46,659
It's only a prototype.

115
00:12:57,188 --> 00:13:03,138
<i>Warning. Base auto-destruct</i>
<i>sequence has been activated.</i>

116
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:15,579
- Nice of you to join us!
- We've been busy!

117
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:20,537
They've found a way
to counteract our little weapons here.

118
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:31,266
<i>Warning. Base auto-destruct sequence</i>
<i>has been activated.</i>

119
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:33,543
<i>30 seconds to detonation.</i>

120
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:42,579
<i>Base auto destruct has been aborted.</i>

121
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:47,059
- We're clear.
- Then the threat has been eliminated.

122
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:53,541
The threat has been eliminated.

123
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,778
Teal'c, you're injured.

124
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:03,940
Teal'c?

125
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:06,664
I'm fine.

126
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:12,501
- I don't get it. That should be the end.
- You're saying he should have won?

127
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:15,421
That was the conclusion
of the programmed scenario.

128
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:19,820
- But the chair is not disconnecting.
- The game's not resetting either.

129
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:24,186
That's not fair. You can't win a race
if someone keeps moving the finish line.

130
00:14:24,268 --> 00:14:28,625
He said he wanted it to be harder,
more realistic.

131
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,381
In reality,
we haven't defeated the Goa'uld.

132
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:34,824
Are you saying the game won't end
until he defeats all the Goa'uld?

133
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,468
You said the game
learns the rules from Teal'c.

134
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:42,417
Yeah, but the parameters can't go
beyond the base invasion scenario.

135
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:46,103
- Can you get him out?
- Not without risking neural damage.

136
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:50,545
The game has a fail-safe.
All Teal'c has to do is quit.

137
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:53,222
Yeah. Teal'c quit.

138
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:02,022
Anubis drones must have waited for SG-3
to dial the gate, then overwhelmed them.

139
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:05,464
But I can't figure out how they knew
how to set the self-destruct.

140
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:09,177
- I can't believe General O'Neill is dead.
- He is not dead.

141
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:11,224
What?

142
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:16,336
We must focus on the situation.
The threat has not been neutralised.

143
00:15:18,988 --> 00:15:21,866
- What?
- We will search the base immediately.

144
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:24,143
More warriors remain.

145
00:15:25,028 --> 00:15:26,017
What?

146
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:29,817
He also knew the Super Soldiers' armour
was resistant to our weapons.

147
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:33,742
Sergeant Harriman reported
only two intruders before he got killed.

148
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:37,059
They held the control room
long enough to keep the Iris open.

149
00:15:37,148 --> 00:15:39,503
But gate logs would
indicate another wormhole.

150
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:42,421
The threat has not been neutralised.

151
00:15:44,148 --> 00:15:47,777
- There are others. I am certain of it.
- Because?

152
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:50,063
The game has not yet ended.

153
00:15:55,668 --> 00:16:01,300
Teal'c, I know this isn't your strongest
suit, but this is a really bad time for jokes.

154
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:03,663
You are all part of a simulation,

155
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:09,220
designed to test the SGC's
preparedness in case of gate breach.

156
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:12,300
None of you are real.

157
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:19,976
I am fine.

158
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:23,856
<i>Warning. Base auto-destruct sequence</i>
<i>has been activated.</i>

159
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:42,862
- Sam?
- I don't understand it.

160
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:48,545
Somebody must have reactivated
the auto destruct from a remote location.

161
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:54,621
I'm locked out of the system.
I can't shut it down.

162
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,938
How did you know?

163
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:01,468
His heart rate
and blood pressure are too high.

164
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:05,143
- How long can he do this?
- I don't know. A day, maybe less.

165
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:07,264
I thought the chair couldn't kill him.

166
00:17:07,348 --> 00:17:10,624
The physiological effects
it can have at any one time are limited.

167
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,940
Yes, but while each individual pain
stimulus isn't in any way life-threatening,

168
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:18,065
the cumulative effect
is now starting to take its toll.

169
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:21,982
If he doesn't have a heart attack,
he'll eventually run out of adrenaline.

170
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:24,741
Blood pressure will drop.
His organ system will fail.

171
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:26,978
Death by a thousand cuts.

172
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:33,226
- Disable the auto-destruct command.
- What?

173
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:35,583
The SGC will be
breached by Anubis warriors.

174
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:38,740
They will attempt to destroy
the base via the command.

175
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:41,388
- What?
- If you disable the command,

176
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:45,939
they will be forced to use other means.
Only then can we hope to defeat them.

177
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:48,417
Teal'c, how could you know?

178
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:53,184
<i>Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>
<i>All security teams to the gateroom.</i>

179
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:55,828
There is little time.

180
00:17:57,548 --> 00:18:00,858
Colonel? He's at level 28.

181
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:04,861
He's got the modulator chip and he's
used it to kill the first two Super Soldiers.

182
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:07,621
He's hunting for the third.

183
00:18:10,228 --> 00:18:13,140
Man, he's not in good shape.

184
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:35,143
This is ridiculous. It's torturing him.

185
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:38,220
Why won't he quit?

186
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:42,142
- Wait. He's headed for the elevator.
- He's gonna use the fail-safe.

187
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:15,385
<i>Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>
<i>All security teams to the gateroom.</i>

188
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:29,065
It didn't work. He's back in the game.

189
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:46,782
I always thought a fail-safe system
was supposed to be somewhat safe...

190
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:49,541
..from failure.

191
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:54,224
From the beginning, in Teal'c's mind,
the goal was to make the simulation real.

192
00:19:54,308 --> 00:19:58,301
As much as he must now want to quit,
we think the game evaluated his character

193
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:02,984
and decided that if this were a real
situation, Teal'c would never give up.

194
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:06,227
Well, it's right. It's also just a game.

195
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:08,902
But the game doesn't know that.

196
00:20:11,508 --> 00:20:13,499
So how do we get him out?

197
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:18,901
Removing the connections while
the system is operating is potentially fatal.

198
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:20,341
On the other hand,

199
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:25,138
the physical stress that the chair is putting
him under will eventually kill him anyway.

200
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:29,016
Right now, the only way out
is for Teal'c to win the game.

201
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:31,941
- Can he?
- It seems to be getting harder and harder.

202
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:35,418
Every time it appears he's won,
the game adds a new twist.

203
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:39,660
- So it's not going to let him win.
- No. The chair doesn't have an ego.

204
00:20:39,748 --> 00:20:44,185
It's not trying to beat Teal'c, just provide
a challenge that's worthy of his abilities.

205
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:48,022
Ironically, it's Teal'c's ego
that created this problem,

206
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:51,100
not that his self-image
isn't entirely accurate.

207
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:55,818
If this continues, he's gonna require
adrenaline to sustain his heart rate.

208
00:20:55,908 --> 00:21:00,140
And the thing is,
I can't keep him going like this for long.

209
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:02,662
There has to be a way for him to win.

210
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:37,626
- I think it's helping.
- Yeah.

211
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,107
Yeah.

212
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,700
- They've adapted their armour.
- Cover me.

213
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:50,987
Colonel Carter.

214
00:22:58,508 --> 00:23:00,578
Teal'c, what's going on?

215
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:05,621
What are you doing
with a thermographic sensor?

216
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:10,382
- There is a third drone.
- Are you sure? I thought only two came.

217
00:23:10,468 --> 00:23:14,541
I'm certain.
He's using a cloak of invisibility.

218
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:43,540
Nice one.

219
00:23:43,628 --> 00:23:46,222
- And it is not yet over.
- There are more?

220
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:49,061
- <i>Colonel?</i>
- Go ahead.

221
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:54,825
<i>I've got a problem with the naqahdah</i>
<i>generator in storage room 2809.</i>

222
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:11,583
I can't stop it.

223
00:24:11,668 --> 00:24:14,944
Someone's rigged it on a feedback loop.

224
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:25,141
There's not enough time
to stop the overload.

225
00:24:27,188 --> 00:24:30,464
Sergeant, dial the gate now! P4M-523.

226
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:33,779
Yes, ma'am. Starting dialling sequence.

227
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:40,619
Chevron one encoded.

228
00:24:46,948 --> 00:24:48,939
Chevron two encoded.

229
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:55,379
Chevron three encoded.

230
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:01,188
Chevron four... Aagh!

231
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:11,545
Daniel? What the hell are you doing?

232
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:26,265
<i>Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>
<i>All security teams to the gateroom.</i>

233
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:55,185
<i>Warning. Base auto-destruct sequence</i>
<i>has been activated.</i>

234
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:36,177
- How's he doing?
- Not well.

235
00:26:36,268 --> 00:26:39,305
His physical exhaustion's
translating into the game.

236
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:44,587
Looks like he's having trouble even
playing any more. It still won't let him go.

237
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:47,865
I spoke to one of
the scientists on P7J-989.

238
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:51,065
He says there's nothing they can do
under the circumstances.

239
00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:52,627
What are you doing?

240
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:55,347
They had a neural imprint
of Teal'c's mind on file

241
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:58,784
from when we were trapped
in the chairs six years ago.

242
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:02,622
- Creepy.
- Yeah. I'm trying not to think about it.

243
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:06,826
I'm running a simulation using the same
parameters Teal'c's dealing with now.

244
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:08,705
And?

245
00:27:08,788 --> 00:27:11,746
The imprint's nowhere near
the same as a live active mind.

246
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:16,743
- Plus, a lot has changed in six years.
- But not the essence of Teal'c's character.

247
00:27:16,828 --> 00:27:20,457
See, that's what worries me. I hope it has.

248
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:25,178
I have run hundreds of simulations. No
matter what he does, the program adapts.

249
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:29,102
Every time it looks like he's won,
the chair makes it harder.

250
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:33,067
It's like the game is reading Teal'c's mind
and somehow seeing this game

251
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:35,378
as a microcosm for our war
against the Goa'uld.

252
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:38,062
That's how Teal'c
probably treats every battle.

253
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:43,142
According to these results, six years ago,
despite what Teal'c led us to believe,

254
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:47,187
deep down, he didn't think
the Goa'uld could ever be defeated.

255
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:50,226
Well, he doesn't think that now.

256
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:53,823
- He can't, after all we've accomplished.
- I hope you're right.

257
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:59,460
Otherwise, no matter how long or hard
Teal'c plays the game, he won't win.

258
00:28:12,988 --> 00:28:14,979
This can't go on for much longer.

259
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:19,584
We're gonna have to make a decision
about forcibly removing the connections.

260
00:28:19,668 --> 00:28:23,422
You know, it's too bad we can't
hook up a joystick to this thing.

261
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:26,386
Give him a little help. Backup, maybe.

262
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:28,026
Actually,

263
00:28:28,108 --> 00:28:32,738
we could link up another chair and send
someone else into the same simulation.

264
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:36,298
That wouldn't make any difference.
The processors would network.

265
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:42,145
The second person would fall victim to the
same elements that have trapped Teal'c.

266
00:28:42,228 --> 00:28:46,187
Unless the new player had an advantage.

267
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:50,467
Sir, you may have done it again.

268
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:52,743
Yes.

269
00:28:52,828 --> 00:28:55,262
How did I do it this time?

270
00:28:55,348 --> 00:28:59,421
These graphics are being generated by
a data recorder that's tracking the game.

271
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:03,547
It's interfaced into the system
between the chair's processor and Teal'c.

272
00:29:03,628 --> 00:29:06,142
The chair decides what happens,
Teal'c responds.

273
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:10,221
Those responses are then incorporated,
processed, and we see the results.

274
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:12,822
It's a continuous loop
of ever-changing data.

275
00:29:12,908 --> 00:29:17,186
Oh. Still waiting on my good idea.

276
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:21,022
The recorder causes a two-second delay
between the programming in the chair

277
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:23,338
and the experience in Teal'c's mind.

278
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,022
He won't know the difference,
but we could use it.

279
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:30,147
If we hook up the second chair to the first,
without using the recorder in the loop...

280
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:34,460
The new player would know what's about
to happen two seconds before it occurred.

281
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:37,142
- Like precognition.
- Exactly.

282
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:42,067
It's not much, but it might give us enough
of an edge to help both players win.

283
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:46,380
That's assuming the chair's programming
won't become aware of it and adapt.

284
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:51,303
Which would mean there's a good chance
the second player is trapped with Teal'c.

285
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:53,379
I'll do it.

286
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:04,985
<i>Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>
<i>All security teams to the gateroom.</i>

287
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:14,619
Teal'c!

288
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:20,463
What are you doing? No, don't!

289
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:32,702
- Why did he shoot him?
- He was a Goa'uld in the last simulations.

290
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:35,260
I should have gone.

291
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:40,422
The last thing we needed was the game
learning from your tactical experience.

292
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:47,259
I gotta get used to this.

293
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:53,139
<i>Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>
<i>All security teams to the gateroom.</i>

294
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:17,819
Easy. Don't shoot.

295
00:31:19,388 --> 00:31:21,424
Just hear me out.

296
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:27,344
OK, it's me. I'm real. I'm not a Goa'uld,
and I'm going to prove that to you. OK?

297
00:31:31,108 --> 00:31:34,145
- Crap.
- <i>Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six.</i>

298
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:37,379
<i>All security teams to the gateroom.</i>

299
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:59,146
I'm sorry, buddy.
You're gonna have to listen to me.

300
00:32:05,308 --> 00:32:08,698
OK. A minute ago, we were in Sam's lab.

301
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:13,339
I was trying to convince you I was real
and you shot me. Remember?

302
00:32:13,428 --> 00:32:16,101
What happened next?

303
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:19,301
The game reset.

304
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:22,027
It's probably happened
so many times it's a blur,

305
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:26,818
but the reason it happened this time
is because I'm playing too.

306
00:32:26,908 --> 00:32:29,342
I'm in a chair, just like you.

307
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:32,022
If either one of us die, we both lose.

308
00:32:52,908 --> 00:32:56,537
- It will not let me out.
- I know.

309
00:32:56,628 --> 00:33:00,507
The game thinks that in a real situation,
you'd never quit.

310
00:33:00,588 --> 00:33:06,424
No matter what I do, it is not possible,
Daniel Jackson. It is not possible!

311
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:09,659
Yes, it is. That's why I'm here.

312
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:14,739
Come on, let's do this. Together.

313
00:33:27,348 --> 00:33:31,660
- We must leave this area immediately.
- Yeah, I heard that.

314
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:40,219
- You are able to foresee the future?
- Yeah. Two seconds into the future.

315
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:43,778
To be honest with you,
it's kind of freaking me out.

316
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:46,666
Two seconds is not a lot of time.

317
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:50,661
I mean, you just get a chance
to see something happen,

318
00:33:50,748 --> 00:33:55,060
and all you can say is, "Watch out".

319
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:57,343
No, seriously, watch out!

320
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:11,467
- We're gonna need a crash cart in here.
- You can't use an electrical impulse.

321
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:13,061
He's right.

322
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:18,859
There's a chance Teal'c is going to go into
cardiac arrest if he suffers one more reset.

323
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:35,579
Teal'c!

324
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:42,657
His heart's stopped.

325
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:51,697
He's got a pulse.

326
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:55,347
That's not gonna work again.

327
00:34:55,428 --> 00:35:00,456
I don't wanna see that again. I thought
they were gonna be able to beat this thing.

328
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:03,699
It may take Daniel a while
to adjust to the precognitive abilities.

329
00:35:03,788 --> 00:35:05,779
Plus, two seconds isn't a lot of time.

330
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:10,658
He'll need the right opportunity
to take advantage of it.

331
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:26,021
We must possess the modulator chip
to compensate for the drone's armour.

332
00:35:26,108 --> 00:35:29,384
- Any idea where she keeps it?
- It changes location each time.

333
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:31,857
Of course it does.

334
00:35:34,028 --> 00:35:36,019
Found it.

335
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,099
Down!

336
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:01,307
Yeah.

337
00:36:01,948 --> 00:36:03,939
This could work.

338
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:43,898
- Why didn't you shoot him?
- Such an action has always proven fatal.

339
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:48,266
In the previous version of the game, when
I've eliminated a drone from this location,

340
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:52,182
it has inevitably attracted
the attention of a third, cloaked drone.

341
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:54,259
So we'll shoot him too.

342
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:59,024
It is merely a diversion designed to allow
a Goa'uld time to destroy the base.

343
00:36:59,108 --> 00:37:01,622
He will use either
our self-destruct mechanism

344
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,983
or a naqahdah generator
designed to overload.

345
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,343
And if you try to stop one,
he uses the other.

346
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:08,225
Indeed.

347
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:11,106
I suppose the identity
of that Goa'uld changes too?

348
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:16,103
Yes. I believe it to be the final component
of the game we must overcome.

349
00:37:57,388 --> 00:38:00,380
- You guys all right?
- Yeah. Thanks.

350
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:08,785
- The naqahdah generator.
- You guys all right?

351
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:16,824
- Almost got it. Just give me a second.
- Step away from the device.

352
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:22,266
What are you doing? We've got less than
a minute before this thing goes critical.

353
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:27,299
- T?
- Step away.

354
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:32,102
I'd do as he says.

355
00:38:43,308 --> 00:38:46,186
What the hell's going on here?

356
00:38:46,268 --> 00:38:49,419
We're all gonna die
if you don't let me stop that overload.

357
00:38:49,508 --> 00:38:52,898
- She may be a Goa'uld.
- It was Siler.

358
00:38:54,188 --> 00:38:56,258
- Siler?
- Siler?

359
00:38:57,028 --> 00:39:00,941
He was in here.
I found him setting the generator.

360
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:05,423
Teal'c, put the weapon down.
That's an order.

361
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:08,659
What if it's not her?

362
00:39:08,748 --> 00:39:12,138
You said you could never tell
who it was until the last second.

363
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:15,345
You may be correct, Daniel Jackson.

364
00:39:15,428 --> 00:39:17,464
Hey!

365
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,426
Now what?

366
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:27,978
Well, I know for a fact it's not me or Teal'c.

367
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:40,341
- Daniel Jackson?
- I don't know.

368
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:42,817
I can't tell.

369
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:56,825
Carter.

370
00:40:05,308 --> 00:40:07,902
- Teal'c!
- Carter!

371
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:44,305
- Is it finished?
- Yeah. You did it.

372
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:52,578
Shutting off power to both chairs.

373
00:40:52,668 --> 00:40:54,659
- O'Neill.
- Hey.

374
00:40:57,068 --> 00:40:59,059
We have won.

375
00:40:59,148 --> 00:41:00,945
Well...

376
00:41:02,108 --> 00:41:04,497
It's what we do.
