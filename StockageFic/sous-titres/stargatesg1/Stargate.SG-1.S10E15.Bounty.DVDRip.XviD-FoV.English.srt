to get to know each other,

98
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,645
we formed a deeper connection.

00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:53,021
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Oh, don't be. I'm not.

344
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,716
You look exactly the same.

345
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,318
I'm surprised you even remember
what I looked like back then.

346
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,591
- Are you kidding?
- No.

347
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,725
You know
I had a major-league crush on you, right?

348
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,566
- No!
- Yes! Yes.

349
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,232
I had your entire schedule memorized

350
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,071
so I'd be in the right place
when I got out of class.

351
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,407
And that sounds creepy
now that I say it out loud.

352
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,448
- How come you never said anything?
- I was 16.

353
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,380
I was 16, and you were always
hooked up with some other guy,

354
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,978
and let's be honest about it,
you were way, way out of my league.

355
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,218
God. I can't believe I just told you that.

356
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,792
Okay, now it's my turn.

357
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,990
I saw every football game
you ever played in.

358
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,965
I can name every class
we shared together.

359
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,093
I even broke up with Bobby Haversham

360
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,672
hoping that you would ask me out
to the senior prom.

361
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,263
But you never did.

362
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,867
I guess you could say
I haven't quite forgiven you for that yet.

I can't find him anywhere.

"Mitchell"? Wow, you two
are on a last-name basis, huh?

386
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,946

I saw him talking to Amy Vandenberg.

is keep quiet, and no one gets hurt.

- Now, shall we get back to the party?
- Yeah. Let's dance.

411
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,140
Unfortunately,
the <i>Odyssey</i> is not available for transport,

412
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,542
but we've got a couple of 302s waiting.
They should get you there pretty quick.

413
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,843
Do we know how the assassins
have been able to target us so precisely?

414
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,973
I think so.

415
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:49,315
During our last mission, we were hit by
what we thought was a scanning beam.

416
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,048
Turns out it was
a little more sophisticated than that.

417
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,454
We were tagged.

418
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,927
We're all emitting low levels of
a particularly exotic form of radiation.

419
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,121
That's what they're tracking.

420
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,061
Now, the good news is
it has a limited half-life,

421
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,497
so it should wear off in a couple of days.

422
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,092
I think it's pretty clear Colonel Mitchell
doesn't have a couple of days.

that would be intimidated

(TRANSPORTER BEAMING)

512
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,714
Over there, please.

513
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:35,319
Colonel Mitchell, Vala,
would you mind joining the others?

514
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,855
Turn around.

515
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,364
So, what's your endgame, Ventrell?

516
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:46,027
You know we're not just going
to let you walk out of here.

517
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,866
Never planned on it.

518
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,355
Hello.

519
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,368
It's okay. You're all safe now.

520
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,495
Yeah, but what happened to Vala?

521
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,534
(ALL EX CLAIMING)

522
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,235
Holy crap.

523
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,582
I knew there was something wrong
with that woman.

524
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,316
VALA: How did you do that?

525
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,386
Oh! Allow me.

526
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:40,515
We located this vessel in a field
several miles from here.

527
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,423
We were onboard
trying to override the command code

528
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,257
when it was remotely activated
and flown onto the roof of the school.

529
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,492
That's right. You brought us to you.

530
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,501
CARTER: After that, it was a simple matter
of activating Chimera.

531
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,094
It's an Asgard holographic
projection system.

532
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,605
It made it look like we'd beamed in.

533
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:59,870
And you might've gotten away with it, too,
if it wasn't for us meddling kids.

534
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,104
So much for your big payday.

535
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,750
Well, I may not be able to collect,
but it doesn't mean others won't try.

536
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,513
Unless there's a bigger payday
waiting somewhere else.

537
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,554
What are you talking about?

538
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,352
Oh, I've had some experience recently
dealing with the Lucian Alliance.

539
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,824
I know for a fact
that some of Netan's seconds

540
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,986
are starting to question his leadership.

541
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,064
After this little fiasco,
it's only going to get worse.

542
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,291
Indeed.

543
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,861
With his failure to eliminate us yet again,
he will only appear weaker than before.

544
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,940
MITCHELL: No doubt about it.

545
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,599
There's blood in the water.

546
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:36,442
Only question is, which enterprising shark
will be the first to take advantage of it?

(GUN FIRING)

550
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,116
Well done.

551
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,447
You saved my life.

552
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,417
You'll be richly rewarded.

553
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,050
I know I will. But not for saving you.

554
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,364
Thank you.

555
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,059
Vala!

556
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,865
You sure you don't want some pie
for the road?

557
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,873
- I couldn't possibly...
- It's your favorite.

558
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,078
Thank you.

559
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:47,679
Well, the General will probably blame me
if we miss our plane,

560
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,151
so we probably should get moving.

561
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:51,983
Cameron!

562
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,450
We have to get moving.

563
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,253
Go wait in the car!

564
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:04,323
I exaggerated the spiritual bond thing
just a little.

565
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,528
Yeah. Yeah, we got that.

566
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,737
Thank you.

567
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,501
Bye.

568
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,640
Move it!

(SIGHS)

570
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:21,314
To be honest with you, Cam,
I don't know what to make of all of this.

571
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,412
Those Air Force people who made us all
sign those papers were pretty scary.

572
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,582
I'm not sure I'm allowed
to even think about what happened,

573
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,283
let alone talk about it.

574
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,224
It's better this way.

575
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,161
People who do talk about it
just end up looking crazy.

576
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:38,895
There's never any proof
and there is always plausible denial.

577
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,102
So you've done this sort of thing before?

578
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,867
I'm just saying...

579
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,773
I know, you can't talk about it.

580
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,937
You can't even tell me
what was really going on the other night.

581
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,713
I do know this much.

582
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,946
That man was trying to kill you
and your friends.

583
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:01,216
Whatever it is you do,
it's obviously dangerous.

584
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:06,218
It's a job that has to be done.

585
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,627
And that's all I'm gonna say about that.

586
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,843
Well, if anybody has to be out there
protecting us

587
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,846
from things
we're not allowed to know about,

588
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,745
I'm glad it's someone like you.

590
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,235
You know,

591
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:55,678
Colorado Springs,
it's not that far away, so,

592
00:41:57,114 --> 00:42:01,983
maybe someday soon,
you might think about taking a little trip.

593
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,348
Maybe.

594
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,358
She's a nice girl. I like her.

595
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,324
Nice? She's a cure for insomnia.

596
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:17,997
Well, we can't all make
the brilliant decisions you've made.

597
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,437
How many times
have you been married, anyway?

598
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,801
VALA: Legally?

599
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,039
Well, it's hard to keep track.

600
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:29,169
Let's see, the first one was part of
a band of traveling entertainers.

601
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,147
He was a good cook, too.
Couldn't make pie, though.

602
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,740
You know, forget it. Forget I asked.
