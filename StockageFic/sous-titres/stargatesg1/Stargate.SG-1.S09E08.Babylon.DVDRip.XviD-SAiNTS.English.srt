1
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:15,040
What you got?

2
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:17,668
- Jaffa?
- Quiet!

3
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:24,325
It is nothing.

4
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:29,722
He's not doing that on purpose is he?
You know, just to keep me interested?

5
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,416
Well that depends. Are you losing interest?

6
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,376
No!

7
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:37,380
We haven't found so much as a snapped twig
on this planet, but hey, hey, it's all good, baby.

8
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:41,891
Teal'c's intel did suggest that the Sodan
were rumoured to have a base of operations here.

9
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:43,361
Teal'c's intel came from a...

10
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:46,389
bunch of Jaffa he used to be at war with, you know?

11
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:48,833
Old enemies and new allies
and all that jazz. But still.

12
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,385
You think the information's bad?

13
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:51,912
I think it's vague.

14
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:55,716
"A world once inhabited by Ancients.

15
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:59,828
A village shrouded in the mists of time."
Sounds like a movie trailer.

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,356
Well we've found some pretty
interesting things based on vague.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,259
Yeah. Still, I'm getting that
grasping at straws feeling.

18
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:06,452
Yeah, just don't tell Teal'c.

19
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:07,411
I already did.

20
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:08,788
Yeah, what did he say?

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,316
"The warriors of the Sodan exist, Colonel Mitchell!

22
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:14,694
I am certain of it."

23
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:16,746
Needs more bass.

24
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:32,880
Go!

25
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:41,088
Fall back to the gate, I got our six. Go, go, go!

26
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:52,683
Where the hell are they?

27
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:12,713
SG-22, this is SG-1.
We are under attack! We need backup!

28
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:17,117
Where the hell is Mitchell?

29
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:19,077
<i>Cameron, what's your position?</i>

30
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:55,557
Cameron, do you copy?

31
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:08,788
His wound is grave my Lord.

32
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:10,665
His symbiote is badly damaged.

33
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,458
No!

34
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,443
Bring him!

35
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:27,757
Shal' Kree!

36
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,006
Season 9 - Episode 8
Babylon

37
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:32,735
<i>He'll be dead by sunset.</i>

38
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:34,416
<i>If not sooner.</i>

39
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:35,656
Then...

40
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,897
you must keep him alive.

41
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:53,143
Carter to SGC. You got anything yet, Chief?

42
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:56,103
Colonel, we're reading
UAV telemetry, five by five.

43
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:58,465
So far, no sign of Colonel Mitchell.

44
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:00,545
Let me know when you've
completed your first sweep.

45
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:02,746
Affirmative. SGC out.

46
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:10,389
- Anything?
- Not yet. How's he doing?

47
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:11,310
Not well.

48
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,970
His symbiote is dying.

49
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,911
If it is not removed,
the host will die also.

50
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:17,752
Sergent, radio Dr Lam.

51
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:20,433
Let her know we have a priority one
medical emergency incoming.

52
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:25,375
<i>No tattoo.</i>

53
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:27,655
He is a warrior of the Sodan.

54
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:30,897
According to legend, no Sodan has been indentured
to the Goa'uld for over 5000 years.

55
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,057
So your intel was correct.

56
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:33,937
Indeed.

57
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,098
<i>Colonel Carter.</i>

58
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:36,579
<i>There's something you need to see.</i>

59
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,781
<i>- This writing.
- Ancient.</i>

60
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,981
<i>Look familiar?</i>

61
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:43,581
Nope. Teal'c?

62
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:45,662
I have never before seen such a device.

63
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:48,704
Well, I'm detecting energy readings.
It's definitely some form of technology.

64
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:51,504
Perhaps this is how the Sodan
managed to escape so quickly.

65
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,185
Actually, that's exactly what it is.

66
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:55,826
This says it's some sort of aperture or gateway to...

67
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:57,546
- To where?
- Enlightenment.

68
00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:01,229
Just enlightenment? Nothing more specific?

69
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,748
That's all it says.

70
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:20,595
Hold still!

71
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:24,757
You know, your bedside manner totally blows.

72
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:28,639
Your wound is infected.

73
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,320
It must be cleansed, or you will die.

74
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,241
This...

75
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,961
will cause you a fair amount...

76
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:38,482
of pain.

77
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:07,293
How's it going in there?

78
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,054
Touch and go.
They've been at it for nearly six hours now.

79
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,095
Most Jaffa would not survive such wounds.

80
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:13,495
<i>Wich means she's very good.</i>

81
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:15,256
That's why she's here.

82
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,898
Looks like you were both right
about the device he was wearing.

83
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:20,819
More Ancient technology.

84
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:22,579
A cloak of invisibility.

85
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,740
That explains how they were able
to ambush you so easily.

86
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,101
What about the transporter?

87
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,781
Carter's with a team on the planet,
working on it right now.

88
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:33,903
So far they haven't been able to even
open up the damn thing. Let alone turn it on.

89
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,943
Yeah, sorry I couldn't have been more help.

90
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:39,545
Well one line of Ancient text
isn't a hell of a lot to go on.

91
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:45,267
We're running surface scans with Prometheus
on several moons and other planets in the system.

92
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:47,928
You believe Colonel Mitchell is no longer on P9G-844?

93
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:49,128
It's a possibility.

94
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:52,250
Ground sweeps and UAV scans are all coming up empty.

95
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,560
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.

96
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,521
You call to the others
and it's goodbye, Jaffa.

97
00:10:16,522 --> 00:10:18,322
It would seem you have me at a disadvantage.

98
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:19,962
It certainly appears that way.

99
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:21,444
Now,

100
00:10:22,084 --> 00:10:23,804
you're gonna tell me how I get...

101
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:32,928
How things seem and how they truly are,
are two very different things.

102
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:34,728
For example.

103
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,490
You are free to leave this place whenever you choose.

104
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,810
What, now you're telling me?

105
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:43,372
But to reach the Chaapa'ai, would take months
on foot to the mountains of Dor'ta'nak.

106
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:46,093
No one who's attempted the journey has ever survived.

107
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,734
- So how did we get...
- We were brought here through the eye of the Gods.

108
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,055
- Which is?
- Your questions can wait!

109
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,376
Now that your strength has returned,
we should begin Joma'Sha'Tal'ac immediately.

110
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:59,698
If that's breakfast, I could eat.

111
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,579
You have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior.

112
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,821
Did you think our mercy was without purpose?

113
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:15,023
Lord Haikon has decreed that you will answer
for your crimes by way of Kel Shak Lo.

114
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:17,305
Which you will battle with another warrior.

115
00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:19,185
And on that day,

116
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,346
you will die.

117
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:36,632
I take it from all the beeping,
our friend is still with us.

118
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:40,273
That he is.
Though how he survived is a mystery to me.

119
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:44,735
I'd say that nine hours you spent working on him
might have something to do with it.

120
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,255
Nice work.

121
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:50,857
I did what I could to save him,
but his symbiote was too badly damaged.

122
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:53,177
We had no choice but to remove it
and start him on tretonin.

123
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,859
As soon as he regains consciousness,
I wanna know.

124
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,100
Why?
So you can interrogate him?

125
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:02,862
Well that might be more up
Teal'c's alibi, but that's the idea.

126
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,903
Well it wasn't exactly the kind of
post op recovery I had in mind.

127
00:12:09,184 --> 00:12:11,144
Well let me know the moment he wakes up.

128
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:12,585
OK.

129
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:48,959
Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell,

130
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,000
United States Air Force.

131
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,121
Earth.

132
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:01,123
I don't know if you know
what's been going on out there,

133
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:03,484
but things are a little different now.

134
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:06,205
<i>The Goa'uld have been defeated.</i>

135
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,327
The Goa'uld should have been defeated
five thousand years ago.

136
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:14,048
My ancestors were one
of the first of the Sodan.

137
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:18,570
They were part of an elite command force
under the Goa'uld Ishkur.

138
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,251
For years, they pillaged and
plundered under his name.

139
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:25,973
Driving fear into the hearts of all those
that would oppose his rule.

140
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,734
The further they ascended among the ranks,

141
00:13:30,195 --> 00:13:32,355
the more they were able
to discern the truth.

142
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:36,357
That he was not a God at all,
but merely an imposter.

143
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:41,439
Our true Gods are those
that came before us.

144
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,359
You're talking about the Ancients.

145
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,682
Ishkur branded my ancestors as
traitors and ordered their deaths.

146
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:55,603
They tried to fight to show
their brothers their faith.

147
00:13:56,244 --> 00:14:01,276
But the odds were too great.
They were forced to flee,

148
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,887
they set out to find Kheb,

149
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:08,489
hoping that their souls would find peace.

150
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:14,130
But instead their search led them to this world.

151
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:19,693
You knew about the Goa'uld,
but you didn't help the other Jaffa defeat them.

152
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:29,936
Look, for the first time in their history,
the Jaffa are free.

153
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:35,059
But it won't last without strong leadership.
They need your help.

154
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:37,940
Their fate is of no concern to us.

155
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,742
I hope you are prepared to die well,
Mitchell.

156
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:01,809
You will not be able to break your bonds.

157
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:09,972
<i>We sought out the Sodan in peace.
Wishing only to open dialogue.</i>

158
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:12,692
Instead you attacked us and took our comrade.

159
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:16,375
All enemies who our transgress
our sacred ground, forfeit their lives.

160
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:18,775
Yeah well, you might want to post a few signs.

161
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:20,856
<i>Look, we just want our friend back.</i>

162
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:24,719
We figured that your fellow warriors may wanna
know that you're still alive and kicking, so

163
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,519
we're thinking straight swap.
Our guy in exchange for you.

164
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:33,020
If your friend was taken, then mourn him.
For if he is not yet dead, he soon will be.

165
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:39,783
Hear me when I say that all free Jaffa have always
had the greatest respect for the warriors of the Sodan.

166
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:44,905
You speak of respect, yet you condemn me.
Without my symbiote, I will be dead soon enough!

167
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:50,067
A medicine called tretonin, courses through your veins.
You have been freed from your burden.

168
00:15:50,627 --> 00:15:52,468
Such a thing is not possible.

169
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:54,009
Oh, but it is.

170
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:56,529
It is very real, I assure you.

171
00:15:56,969 --> 00:16:00,631
It is now used by several thousand
free Jaffa, with no ill effects.

172
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:02,512
Your poisons will not work.

173
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:06,553
Had you any honour,
you would have let me die on the battlefield.

174
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:15,716
So is it you just don't know what's going on
in the rest of the galaxy or you really don't care?

175
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:19,318
The Jaffa made their choice 5000 years ago.

176
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:21,479
Their affairs are no concern to us.

177
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,600
Yeah, but how do you survive?

178
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,600
At some point you gotta go hunting for...you know.

179
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:33,043
We raid Goa'uld strongholds for shipments of symbiotes
that have yet to be implanted in any Jaffa.

180
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:36,885
Such missions are rites of passage
for our youngest warriors.

181
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:38,044
Well it sounds like fun.

182
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:42,846
The fighting style of Sodan has been a closely
guarded secret for a hundred generations.

183
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:46,527
It is a shame you will die shortly after learning it.

184
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:51,250
Attack me.

185
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:56,452
You find me an unworthy opponent?

186
00:16:57,252 --> 00:17:00,413
No,
it's just I don't feel like...

187
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,460
OK.

188
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,981
Let's try that one more time.

189
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:31,305
You are slow and undisciplined.

190
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:34,746
If you fought your opponent today,
you would die without landing a single blow.

191
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,268
And what happens if I refuse to fight?

192
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:40,908
You just kill me?

193
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:44,069
It is an alternative you do not wish to explore.

194
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:54,113
Dr Lam tells me you have refused to eat.

195
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:56,635
The very odour of your food turns my stomach.

196
00:17:56,674 --> 00:18:00,115
If you are to survive without your symbiote,
you require sustenance.

197
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:02,797
It is only because your drug has weakened me.

198
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:05,878
On the contrary brother,
it has freed you.

199
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:10,039
What do you know of freedom?

200
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,440
You, who have served false Gods.

201
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,601
Who chooses to live in this squalor,
rather than among his own people.

202
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:21,363
I know that I have heard stories of the Sodan,
since I was but a child.

203
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:24,705
Your bravery and skill are legend among all Jaffa.

204
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:28,506
It is because of my failure as
a warrior that I languish here now.

205
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:31,708
Prisoner to a former slave and his pitiful allies.

206
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:34,428
Speak not of skill to me.

207
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:38,891
Many Jaffa have fought and died for a cause
that was started by the warriors of the Sodan!

208
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,991
And for what?

209
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:45,392
Instead of respecting the traditions of OUR ancestors,
you would only seek to lead them further astray!

210
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:41,853
That way.

211
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:45,575
Blue is left. Red is right. Got it!

212
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:12,726
- Faster!
- Faster.

213
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,730
How did I do?

214
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,651
Badly.

215
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:29,272
Again!

216
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:34,493
Yeah, yeah. You stop using that gadget,
I guarantee you, I'll be better.

217
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:37,895
A Sodan warrior must anticipate
an attack at any moment.

218
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:41,362
Yeah well, where'd you guys get those things, anyway?

219
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:44,817
The writings of our Gods instructed us how
to construct many of their devices.

220
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:46,538
We use them to protect our sacred ground.

221
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:54,581
Speaking of Gods, I know this is probably taboo,
but I need to talk to your boss.

222
00:20:55,521 --> 00:21:00,203
That visitor you had yesterday.
I'm assuming it's not the first time he's been here.

223
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:03,885
I've met their kind before.
They're bad news.

224
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:09,247
Look, I'll do any crazy,
training exercise you want...

225
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:13,528
within reason.

226
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:16,889
Finish the course in time and I'll consider it.

227
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,872
You know, a bag of sand with a hole in
it is not an accurate timing device.

228
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:28,794
You are an evil man!

229
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:48,961
Please, sit.

230
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:50,602
I'm good...

231
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:57,324
OK.
Maybe I will sit.

232
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:06,688
You know, I'm starting to get an idea
of why you guys attacked us.

233
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:09,209
That Prior is telling you we're enemies.

234
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,490
Is he wrong?

235
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,292
You could have cut us down the second
we stepped through the gate, but you didn't.

236
00:22:16,532 --> 00:22:20,493
Generations of my people fought and died under exile.

237
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:26,355
Praying for the day when we could
seek the path without recrimination.

238
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:30,637
When we pray to the Gods,
do they hear us, Mitchell?

239
00:22:30,678 --> 00:22:34,678
Do they once give us a sign
as proof of their existence?

240
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:40,686
I know that the Ori are not the Ancients.

241
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:44,162
But can there be any doubt that they are Gods?

242
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:50,404
And if they can lead us to the path
of enlightenment, how can I refuse them?

243
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:52,691
You're making a big mistake.

244
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:56,487
These Ori are not what you think they are.
They are not even close.

245
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:57,447
Tek'Hel'Shee!

246
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:07,371
Perhaps, when you finish your debt.
In your final moments, you'll understand.

247
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:13,574
I've already been there.
I understand.

248
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:39,408
You may rest now.

249
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:41,003
No, I'm good, let's keep going.

250
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:44,405
You are not tired?

251
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:49,272
Six weeks airborne training at Fort Benning,
that's tiring. This is nothing. Come on!

252
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:53,008
If I wanna survive this Kel Shak Lo thing, I'm gonna
need a hell of a lot more than you're teaching me.

253
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:56,129
Quit pussy footing around and
stop holding back. Let's go!

254
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:01,131
You believe this staff is what makes you strong.

255
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:13,856
The Kran'too is nothing but an extension of your body.

256
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:18,057
No true warrior depends on a weapon
for strength or advantage.

257
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:21,459
See, that's what I'm talking about!

258
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,620
Drink.

259
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:36,864
I'm not gonna get used to this stuff.

260
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:41,026
Were it not for my teas,
you would have died many days ago.

261
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:46,588
It was self defence, you know.

262
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:51,350
The Jaffa I killed. It was him or me.

263
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:57,513
It does not matter. Blood has been spilled.
Our laws decree you must answer for it.

264
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:01,914
So who was he?

265
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:09,356
His name was Volnek. A most skilled warrior.

266
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,720
Look, for what it's worth?

267
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:22,842
There's nothing I can say, is there?

268
00:25:23,962 --> 00:25:24,762
No.

269
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:34,166
So, who do I fight?

270
00:25:34,206 --> 00:25:36,647
Lord Haikon will determine
that on the eve of your battle.

271
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:39,848
Usually it is the closest blood kin
to the slain warrior.

272
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:41,249
Right.

273
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,250
And the next of kin is just as tough as he was.

274
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:48,051
Do I stand a chance?

275
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:51,853
Never mind.

276
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:56,054
I promise I'll die well and all that jazz.

277
00:25:57,654 --> 00:26:01,656
But before I kick it, I gotta ask.

278
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:05,378
You buying what these Priors are selling?

279
00:26:05,418 --> 00:26:08,459
Lord Haikon has led us for more than a hundred years.

280
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:10,179
He knows what is best for us all.

281
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,462
Yeah, yeah, look, I get it, you are a team player.
I'm asking, what do you think?

282
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:20,063
It is not my place to question Haikon's judgement.
Nor is it yours!

283
00:26:20,103 --> 00:26:23,305
Well somebody better,
because if you guys follow the Ori,

284
00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:30,347
all of your traditions, your Kran'too staffs,
your precious path, your tasty beverages,
it's all going down the drain!

285
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:34,509
Enough!
We're finished for the day.

286
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,195
You say a Prior has come to the Sodan

287
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,236
<i>and you have decided to follow the word of the Ori.</i>

288
00:26:54,376 --> 00:26:58,378
<i>- I walk the path of our true Gods...
- The Ori are not Gods!</i>

289
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:01,659
<i>What did the Prior promise you?</i>

290
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:04,060
A place of honour at his side.

291
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,541
As heralds for your new masters.

292
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:13,824
This Prior will have you hunt down and kill
all Jaffa who refuse to follow the path of Origin.

293
00:27:13,863 --> 00:27:16,584
<i>That is the path you walk.</i>

294
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:23,987
I will learn the codes of the Ancient transporter.

295
00:27:25,988 --> 00:27:28,789
No matter how long it takes.

296
00:27:31,991 --> 00:27:36,752
This is going nowhere. Two weeks and
he hasn't given us so much as a decent high coo.

297
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:38,273
Well, it's understandable, Sir.

298
00:27:38,313 --> 00:27:41,239
Most Jaffa would never break
under normal interrogation techniques.

299
00:27:41,274 --> 00:27:45,355
Not to mention the fact that the Sodan are
an elite group of warriors. I'm sure their minds
are trained to withstand a lot worse.

300
00:27:45,595 --> 00:27:46,796
What about the device?

301
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:49,882
We haven't made much progress, I'm afraid.

302
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:53,758
It seems the code preventing us using it,
is rigged to some sort of defence mechanism.

303
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:57,600
Dr Lee received a few nasty volts,
while trying to implement an override.

304
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,560
How is he?

305
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:02,602
Dr Lam says the feelings should
return to his legs in a few days.

306
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:09,004
Meanwhile, the international committee
is keeping score of all the resources
we're using to try to find Mitchell.

307
00:28:09,045 --> 00:28:11,670
Science teams, orbital scans by Prometheus.

308
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:13,906
All of them coming up empty
certainly doesn't look good.

309
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:18,028
Another few days and they'll tell us
to shut down search and rescue operations.

310
00:28:18,107 --> 00:28:19,028
Shut it down?

311
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:24,710
Sir, with all due respect, in the past we have spent
months searching for our people in the field.

312
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,031
<i>We can't just stop looking.</i>

313
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,072
What she's saying sir,
is we've never left a man behind.

314
00:28:28,592 --> 00:28:33,314
I'm more than familiar with the concept, Dr Jackson.
Give me something I can use, soon.

315
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:37,195
Or the next paperwork I fill out
will declare Mitchell MIA.

316
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,527
I just need a minute!

317
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:12,969
Let him pass.

318
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:14,929
Thank you.

319
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,250
Alright, I'll make this quick.

320
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,732
The Prior represents a race of Ancients, yes!
But believe me when I tell you,

321
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:24,093
they are not the Ancients you wanna worship.

322
00:29:24,252 --> 00:29:27,214
The Prior has healed our sick.

323
00:29:27,814 --> 00:29:30,495
Caused our crops to grow as if by magic.

324
00:29:31,055 --> 00:29:32,856
Why should I doubt the power of the Ori?

325
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:35,977
Look, their power is not what you should question.

326
00:29:36,578 --> 00:29:37,818
It's how they use it!

327
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,899
Anyone refuses to worship them and they die.

328
00:29:40,939 --> 00:29:43,740
And I'm not talking about
a few non believers here and there.

329
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:46,181
I'm talking about whole planets wiped out!

330
00:29:48,102 --> 00:29:50,222
And I should simply take your word for this?

331
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:54,504
You wanna believe my people are godless and inferior?

332
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:56,384
Go right ahead.

333
00:29:57,025 --> 00:30:01,387
But we have never needed proof of
our Gods' existence in order to believe in them.

334
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:06,548
Faith.

335
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:11,910
It was your faith that sustained you
for five thousand years,

336
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:14,071
not the Ancients themselves.

337
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:18,073
Don't throw your history away
for a bag full of magic tricks.

338
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:26,076
Admit it! Haikon has totally lost his mind.

339
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:32,198
A warrior cannot talk and fight at the same time.

340
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:36,520
A fact you refuse to accept.

341
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,041
Got it.

342
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:57,687
You may provide a challenge
to your opponent after all, Mitchell.

343
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,650
Followed by my violent death of course.

344
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,250
Of course.

345
00:31:09,012 --> 00:31:10,772
To my inevitable demise!

346
00:31:14,094 --> 00:31:15,294
Why do you do this?

347
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:16,855
Do what?

348
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,335
Train this hard.

349
00:31:19,216 --> 00:31:20,896
These are the last days of your life.

350
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:23,617
I would think you would spend more time in reflexion.

351
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:26,779
Well all I know is,

352
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,619
the moment you accept your fate,

353
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,901
that's when you're as good as dead.

354
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,901
Till then, all bets are off.

355
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:36,222
You cannot survive Kel Shak Lo.

356
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,464
Well no offence, but

357
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:43,945
I've endured things I wasn't
supposed to survive before and

358
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:45,866
I'm still here.

359
00:31:52,068 --> 00:31:55,269
How can you be certain the Prior speaks falsely?

360
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,751
Because...

361
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:04,473
I've seen entire planets wiped out
because they refused to follow the Ori.

362
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:06,994
Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to think,

363
00:32:08,054 --> 00:32:10,375
but if everything I believed was being threatened,

364
00:32:10,415 --> 00:32:11,695
I'd wanna know.

365
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:18,378
Jolan, your people shouldn't suffer for their faith.

366
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:29,702
You two, again.

367
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:33,184
Yes. Us two, again.

368
00:32:33,544 --> 00:32:35,625
Save your words,
I am not in the mood.

369
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:39,226
We know how you feel,
but we're not here to talk.

370
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:42,707
You require evidence that
the Ori are not to be trusted.

371
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:46,789
<i>This is Tass'an.</i>

372
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:50,790
One of the founders of a free Jaffa
settlement on a planet called Sarvarus.

373
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:55,632
Many families came to live there to enjoy
the freedom that they fought so hard to achieve.

374
00:32:56,592 --> 00:32:57,993
He is Sodan?

375
00:32:59,033 --> 00:33:00,034
Indeed.

376
00:33:00,273 --> 00:33:01,394
Tell him what happened.

377
00:33:03,435 --> 00:33:07,436
A month ago, a man came through the Chaapa'ai.

378
00:33:08,477 --> 00:33:09,958
He called himself a Prior.

379
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:13,399
<i>He told us of powerful Gods called the Ori,</i>

380
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,719
who he claimed would give us protection

381
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:19,681
and show us the path to enlightenment.

382
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:23,482
And he left. He later returned.

383
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:25,904
<i>Told us we had to make a choice.</i>

384
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:28,024
Follow the Ori...

385
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:30,345
or be destroyed.

386
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:33,386
We chose to resist.

387
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:39,989
Continue, brother.

388
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,390
He dialed the Chaapa'ai

389
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,752
and merely placed his staff
in the ground in front of it.

390
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:53,354
Then earth shook with a fierceness
I have never seen nor heard of before.

391
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:55,994
<i>In moments, our city was levelled.</i>

392
00:33:56,675 --> 00:34:00,036
Hundreds of our people wiped out in an instant.

393
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:03,197
Enough of these lies.

394
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:07,439
You expect me to take the word
of this sorry excuse for a Jaffa?

395
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,921
I witnessed the destruction with my own eyes!

396
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:14,041
<i>Heed my words, brother.</i>

397
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:18,043
If a Prior visits your world,

398
00:34:18,403 --> 00:34:19,723
leave.

399
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:45,673
You have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior! Human,

400
00:34:46,353 --> 00:34:47,754
do you deny it?

401
00:34:48,674 --> 00:34:50,715
No, but it wasn't...

402
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:55,957
No, I don't deny it.

403
00:34:56,917 --> 00:35:01,800
If any blood kin of the warrior seek recompense,

404
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,241
let him step forward, now!

405
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,921
I seek it.

406
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:10,642
You?

407
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:12,563
In the name of Volnek of Gashrail,

408
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:15,724
my brother.

409
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:32,971
May the blood spilled here today,
settle this debt once and for all.

410
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:42,575
You may begin!

411
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,376
May you die well.

412
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:47,776
Likewise.

413
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:12,409
The human is dead!

414
00:37:13,808 --> 00:37:16,610
<i>The blood of the Sodan has been avenged.</i>

415
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,610
He fought and died a warrior, my Lord.

416
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:21,812
It is only fitting he be given
the rite of Shel'mak'asah.

417
00:37:22,612 --> 00:37:23,773
Very well.

418
00:37:24,213 --> 00:37:28,014
With your permission my Lord,
I would like to take care of it myself.

419
00:37:52,423 --> 00:37:54,624
I was afraid you would not wake.

420
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,826
Well maybe I shouldn't have.

421
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:00,746
- How long was I...
- Seven hours.

422
00:38:01,827 --> 00:38:02,627
Seven?

423
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:05,332
I thought it was only supposed to be two?

424
00:38:05,428 --> 00:38:07,829
I may have inadvertently made the elixir to strong.

425
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,234
Yeah, that's gonna leave a scar.

426
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:20,339
<i>So, did it work?</i>

427
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:23,535
The elixir was most effective.
They believe you are dead.

428
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,536
Well done, Bones.

429
00:38:28,937 --> 00:38:30,137
Never mind.

430
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:35,739
So, where does this leave you?

431
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,140
If the Prior intends to mislead the Sodan as you say,

432
00:38:41,142 --> 00:38:42,543
then I am his enemy.

433
00:38:43,343 --> 00:38:44,543
And Haikon?

434
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:47,944
It may be too late to convince him of his mistake.

435
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:51,145
But there are several other warriors who feel as I do.

436
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:56,307
We will continue to walk the path of the Sodan,

437
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:59,349
until the others see the error of their ways.

438
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:01,550
Well, for what it's worth,

439
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,950
you won't walk alone.

440
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:16,155
Come!

441
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,156
How did it go?

442
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:18,916
Not well.

443
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,122
Even after we showed him video footage of the damage,

444
00:39:21,157 --> 00:39:24,558
Volnek still refuses to believe the Ori
are responsible for what happened on Sarvarus.

445
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:25,679
What's he doing now?

446
00:39:25,718 --> 00:39:27,759
Nothing.
He hasn't said a word since Tass'an left.

447
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,640
Which puts us back to square one.

448
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,760
Yeah basically.

449
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,961
<i>- Teal'c seems to think that showing him more images...
- Unscheduled offworld activation!</i>

450
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:36,468
What have we got, Chief?

451
00:39:36,503 --> 00:39:38,263
Recieving an IDC Sir. It's Colonel Mitchell.

452
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:39,423
You're kidding?

453
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:40,664
I would never do that, Sir.

454
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:45,506
You have a visitor.

455
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:50,868
You!

456
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:52,468
Yeah, I thought you were dead, too.

457
00:39:52,508 --> 00:39:54,229
Oh, we have unfinished business!

458
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,229
Just take it easy.

459
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,070
You shot me!

460
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,910
You shot me first!

461
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,441
I will have vengeance!

462
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:00,332
You will listen, brother.

463
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,375
I know that you think we're enemies

464
00:40:09,514 --> 00:40:12,476
and right now it doesn't matter if we become allies.

465
00:40:12,616 --> 00:40:15,777
What matters is that you understand the truth.

466
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,381
You are fortunate my brother drugged you.

467
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:29,382
You would never have survived a true Kel Shak Lo.

468
00:40:29,983 --> 00:40:31,183
Don't know.

469
00:40:31,822 --> 00:40:33,524
Took you down pretty good.

470
00:40:33,584 --> 00:40:34,585
You were lucky.

471
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:36,585
Lucky is good.

472
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:44,788
Granting my freedom changes nothing, Mitchell.

473
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:56,693
We will meet again.

474
00:40:58,293 --> 00:41:00,094
Looking forward to it.
