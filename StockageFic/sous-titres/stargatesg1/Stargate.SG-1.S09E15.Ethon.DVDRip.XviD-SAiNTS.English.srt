1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:03,403
<i>Previously, on Stargate SG-1...</i>

2
00:00:03,444 --> 00:00:08,116
The Rand Protectorate and the Caledonian Federation
have been locked in a state of cold war for decades.

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,264
- This is insane
- Soren's forces are moving in on this facility.

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,573
I can get you to the Stargate,
but we have to go now.

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,551
I'm not blind Leda. I know that you and Daniel
have grown close during his convalescence.

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,854
Jared, it's not what you think.

7
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:24,816
I've seen entire planets wiped out
because they refused to follow the Ori.

8
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,569
If a Prior visits your world...

9
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:29,638
leave.

10
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,341
- What's up?
- Incoming wormhole from Tegalus.

11
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:46,162
A Jared Kane is requesting to be let through.
Says he needs to speak to you, and it's urgent.

12
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:47,507
On radio.

13
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,924
Jared, this is Daniel. What's wrong?

14
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:52,035
<i>Dr. Jackson, I have very little time.</i>

15
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:55,147
<i>I've gained access to the Stargate
without my government's authorization.</i>

16
00:00:55,157 --> 00:00:58,702
<i>Please allow me to come through.
I am alone and unarmed.</i>

17
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,980
Open the iris.

18
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:07,519
Okay, Jared, it's safe to come through.

19
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:11,323
Stand down.

20
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:16,520
- Dr. Jackson...
- Jared, this is Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell.

21
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:18,045
Tegalus...

22
00:01:18,055 --> 00:01:23,151
post-apocalyptic warring superpowers
with deep-seated political difference,
that Jared Kane. It's nice to meet you.

23
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:26,664
Your government stopped responding to our
communiques months ago. We'd assumed that you...

24
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:28,625
Completely destroyed each other?

25
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:29,824
Not quite yet.

26
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,344
I was going to say no longer
wanted our help, but that'll do.

27
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:37,609
No, the Rand Protectorate is still
struggling to rebuild and defend itself
from the Caledonian Federation.

28
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:39,510
Okay, what's so urgent?

29
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,288
Five months ago,
a man came through the Stargate.

30
00:01:42,298 --> 00:01:45,634
- He called himself a Prior of the Ori.
- Here we go.

31
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:48,152
Yes, we're aware of the Priors
and what they're preaching.

32
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:51,430
The Prior wasn't just offering us religion.
He offered us power.

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,552
In exchange for our embracing the Ori,
he gave our government designs for
a weapon that could be launched into orbit,

34
00:01:56,562 --> 00:02:00,858
a satellite capable of giving us total
domination over the Caledonians.

35
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:06,362
Okay, assuming your people intend on building
this weapon, how long before it's completed?

36
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:12,594
24 hours ago, a Caledonian military outpost
was completely vaporized in a demonstration.

37
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:15,232
The weapon is already operational.

38
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:26,404
Season 9 - Episode 15
Ethon

39
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:23,984
<i>How long until your government makes its next move?</i>

40
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:27,217
Our President has given their leader,
Minister Chaska, a deadline of five days.

41
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:30,978
After that, if the Caledonians don't surrender
to Rand occupation, they'll be destroyed.

42
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:33,253
And the Prior instructed you to do this?

43
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:36,406
Rand has been in disarray
since the missile attacks last year.

44
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:41,914
Intelligence reports were filtering in
that said the Caledonians were preparing
a full-scale ground assault. They were going to invade

45
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,588
and attempt to topple
what was left of Rand once and for all.

46
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:47,262
Caledonia wasn't
interested in hearing from this Prior?

47
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:50,813
The Prior asked our leaders if he could
spread his word to the Caledonians as well.

48
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:54,047
Of course they would never accept
anything that Rand was already embracing.

49
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:56,401
<i>President Nadal explained that to the Prior.</i>

50
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,474
He said anyone who didn't
accept Origin must be destroyed.

51
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:02,417
Man, these guys got a bottomless bag
of tricks, don't they?

52
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:06,738
I'm guessing it was also the Prior that convinced
your people that having a relationship
with us was no longer necessary.

53
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:12,764
It was already clear your government
wasn't going to offer us the type of weapons
and technology this Prior was offering us.

54
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:13,921
<i>You see...</i>

55
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:17,713
<i>we weren't just on the verge of
suffering defeat at the hands of the Caledonians.</i>

56
00:04:17,753 --> 00:04:20,466
We were on the verge of collapsing as a nation,

57
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:23,759
but now,
after what you've told me of these Ori and the Priors,

58
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:26,014
I fear that may have been a better way to go.

59
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:28,568
We appreciate your situation, but

60
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:33,198
- what exactly do you want from us?
- These are the earliest schematics for the weapon.

61
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:38,306
Unfortunately, they're not complete.
The Prior gave us step-by-step instructions in stages.

62
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:40,282
Making sure he kept you under his thumb.

63
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:45,950
He said it was so he could make sure each stage was
completed properly before we moved on to the next.

64
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,801
It's the best I could do under the circumstances.
Access became restricted soon after some

65
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:52,944
of us in government voiced
our disapproval about building the weapon.

66
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:54,999
You wish us to destroy the weapon.

67
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,801
It's the only chance we have
to stop things before they go too far.

68
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:02,213
Just to be clear...

69
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:05,286
you're doing this to save Caledonians?

70
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:09,277
You don't hate them for bombing
your country and killing so many of your people?

71
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:10,514
I do,

72
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,667
<i>but I refuse to see any more lives,</i>

73
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:16,700
be they Rand or Caledonian, senselessly lost

74
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:20,611
<i>due to archaic prejudices or religious extremism.</i>

75
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,483
- This has to stop.
- Would you excuse us for a moment?

76
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:40,327
- What are we doing?
- Talking privately.

77
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,442
I'm sure general Landry won't mind.

78
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:44,279
You want the big chair?

79
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,434
Not me. I'll sit here.

80
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:48,509
Sam, he's in Washington.

81
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:50,085
Yeah.

82
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:58,047
Right.

83
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,515
<i>Let me just start
this by saying a lot of this is actually our fault.</i>

84
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:06,828
There wouldn't have been a war on Tegalus
if we hadn't gone there in the first place.

85
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:12,056
General O'Neill probably said it best.
"The minute we step through the Gates, we're
sticking our collective noses where they don't belong".

86
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:14,510
We did offer to help them rebuild.

87
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,140
- An offer they eventually declined.
- Because they were being influenced by a Prior.

88
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:23,450
And this satellite thing takes it to a whole new level.
The Ori are now arming their followers.

89
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,730
Who says they won't eventually help them
build ships capable of attacking other planets?

90
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,375
We need to nip this trend squarely in the bud.

91
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:33,487
So, what, we just fly in there and blow it up?

92
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:34,566
Yeah.

93
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,638
Unless you have a better idea.

94
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:41,510
All Tegalans, both Rand and Caledonian alike,
deserve to know the truth.

95
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,623
If we tell them what we know,
who the Ori really are,

96
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:47,776
they might be convinced to
dismantle this weapon themselves.

97
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:49,412
You think they'll listen?

98
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:53,523
Let's just propose it to Kane,
and see if Rand will hear us out.

99
00:06:56,795 --> 00:07:01,185
<i>So can we can use these plans
to build ourselves a satellite weapon?</i>

100
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:03,580
Hey, you've got to ask.

101
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,892
These plans are incomplete.
I mean, it's not even clear what's powering the weapon.

102
00:07:06,932 --> 00:07:10,484
<i>- Kane did say they were early schematics.
- So, not useful?</i>

103
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:14,395
<i>Well, enough to see that it's not very efficient.
For example...</i>

104
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:19,025
<i>these capacitors take several minutes
to store enough power to fire the weapon</i>

105
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:21,379
and then again before it can repeat.

106
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,413
Wow, you'd think an...
Ori weapon would be more advanced.

107
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:30,120
The Ori may have designed it for them,
but Rand still had to build it using the
resources and technology at their disposal.

108
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,627
Now, remember that it wouldn't take
much by our standards to give Rand
vast military superiority over Caledonia.

109
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,903
Then it can be easily destroyed.

110
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:40,258
If these plans are an accurate indication.

111
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:40,975
<i>Right.</i>

112
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:43,051
So we'll take Prometheus for this.

113
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:44,527
Shouldn't be a problem.

114
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:47,641
The satellite appears to be
a predominantly offensive weapon.

115
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,713
- No defenses?
- Well, it stands to reason.

116
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:55,543
Rand knows that Caledonia
has nothing even close to capable of reaching orbit.

117
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,541
Although,

118
00:07:56,581 --> 00:08:01,051
there do appear to be sensors built into the
targeting system, so our approach may be detected.

119
00:08:01,091 --> 00:08:04,124
The Prometheus is protected by Asgard shield technology.

120
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:05,281
<i>Exactly.</i>

121
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:09,631
Now, as I said, even if they do see us coming,
the weapon will take a few minutes to charge up.

122
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:14,261
We should be able to emerge from hyperspace
and take a shot at it before it can respond.

123
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:18,691
If, for any reason, it doesn't go well,
we jump back into hyperspace.

124
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:23,840
Anything yet?

125
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:28,429
Give them some time.
They seemed shocked that you were here.

126
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:30,744
I'm sure they were.

127
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,526
You don't think they'll listen to us?

128
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:44,552
Our people suffered greatly after the war.

129
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:48,384
They needed to believe there was
a reason for what was happening to them.

130
00:08:48,424 --> 00:08:50,259
And the Prior provided that.

131
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,695
He said our suffering was a test

132
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:54,491
to see who was worthy.

133
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:58,601
Well, if it makes you feel any
better, your planet's not alone.

134
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:05,206
Kane, I have to ask.

135
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:07,820
Leda?

136
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:17,738
Five months ago, while Rand was
deciding whether to accept Origin or not,

137
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:19,853
a disease swept through the country.

138
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,644
Thousands became deathly ill.

139
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:28,952
The Prior said those who believed
and embraced the Ori would be cured.

140
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:33,941
That's when people everywhere
began accepting them as gods.

141
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:36,975
We watched...

142
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:38,690
so many

143
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:43,121
barter away their beliefs
in exchange for their lives.

144
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,030
But, Leda... she...

145
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,218
she refused to accept it.

146
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:56,012
I am sorry.

147
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:02,098
Dr. Jackson.

148
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:05,332
We just received
a communique from the Rand government.

149
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:10,360
They want to talk.

150
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:18,661
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.

151
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,413
What happens if your people don't hear from us?

152
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:25,207
<i>I told them to proceed with destroying the weapon.</i>

153
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:40,373
President Nadal.

154
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,328
Senator Kane.

155
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:44,523
This is Dr. Daniel Jackson.

156
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:46,079
I know who he is.

157
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,754
I'm here representing Earth on a diplomatic mission.

158
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:53,343
I am here to officially inform you,
Jared Kane, you are under arrest for treason.

159
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:54,860
<i>Excuse me?</i>

160
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,935
You allowed us to come here under false pretenses?

161
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:01,075
Dr. Daniel Jackson, your government
has knowingly harbored a felon.

162
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:05,795
As well, it seems they are in possession of top-secret
documents vital to the security of this country.

163
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:09,268
As of now,
you are both considered enemies of the state

164
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:12,779
and will be detained until trial can be set.

165
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:30,260
Approaching the planet, Sir.

166
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,211
Prepare to lock on Dr. Jackson's locator
beacon the moment we drop out of hyperspace.

167
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:35,409
Yes, Sir.

168
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:40,357
I guess I can assume that any
kind of trial will be rigged?

169
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:44,667
Honestly, we'll be lucky to get that far.

170
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,977
President Nadal has been paranoid about
Caledonian spies for some time now.

171
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:51,572
Because I betrayed him this way, he...

172
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:54,446
may assume I'm also part of that network.

173
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:55,483
Great.

174
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:58,277
I don't suppose your country
has any laws against torture?

175
00:11:58,357 --> 00:11:59,314
No.

176
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,043
<i>- I applaud your courage, Kane.
- Commander Pernaux,</i>

177
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:11,248
- Dr. Jackson. Dr. Jackson...
- Yeah, I got it.

178
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:14,281
What I don't understand is why you came back.

179
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,471
Dr. Jackson and I thought there were some
things the Rand people needed to know.

180
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:23,060
The only thing I need to know are the names of
those among us who are working for the Caledonians.

181
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:27,880
Just because I went to Earth for help
doesn't mean I've also given information
to the Caledonians or know who might have.

182
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,364
Earth is responsible for our current state of affairs.

183
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:32,879
Turning to them
is an act of a desperate man, Kane.

184
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,790
Kane turned to us in the hopes of preventing
you from making a catastrophic mistake.

185
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,464
The Priors are not telling
you everything about the Ori.

186
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:42,827
You need to hear me out before you use
that weapon to wipe out the Caledonians.

187
00:12:42,837 --> 00:12:46,389
So you admit, you sympathize with Caledonia?

188
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:48,385
That's not what he's saying.

189
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:51,138
<i>How the next few days unfold is entirely up to you.</i>

190
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:53,772
But until I find out who else is working with you,

191
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:57,444
I guarantee neither
of you will know a moment's peace.

192
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:17,838
- I have a signal from Dr. Jackson's locator beacon.
- Beam him directly onto the bridge.

193
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:27,616
I take it this means things aren't going so well.

194
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,727
Coupled with the fact that we haven't
heard from him since he left two days ago...

195
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:34,161
<i>- We have located the satellite.
- Lock on target.</i>

196
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:37,314
This will be perceived as an
act of aggression against Rand.

197
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:41,186
We could be risking any chance of
negotiating for Daniel's safe return.

198
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:47,291
Commander.

199
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,928
Mr. President.

200
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:52,759
The satellite's sensors have detected
a ship closing on its position.

201
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:56,989
<i>- Target has been acquired, Sir.
- We've got the satellite dead to rights.</i>

202
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:00,183
We can hail them and ask for Dr. Jackson in exchange.

203
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,936
That would not accomplish the goal of this mission.

204
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:06,329
Jackson knew it might come to this.
He told us to proceed no matter what.

205
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:10,439
He wouldn't want us to trade his life for
thousands, possibly millions of Caledonians.

206
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,712
Well, it's your call, colonels.
All I'm asking is that you make up your mind quickly.

207
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:17,144
Sir, we're detecting a power
buildup from within the satellite.

208
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,776
<i>Its attitude is changing.</i>

209
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:24,807
- We're being targeted.
- Sound general quarters.

210
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:28,399
Full power to forward shield generators
and maintain course and speed.

211
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:37,059
- Do it.
- Fire!

212
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:38,916
Firing missiles.

213
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:48,982
Missiles detonated prior to impact.
Target remains intact, Sir.

214
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:51,187
<i>It looks like it's being protected by a shield.</i>

215
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,822
Defensive capabilities must have been added.

216
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,637
Okay...

217
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:57,134
now what?

218
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:02,164
Shields are holding.

219
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:04,398
Recommend firing a warning shot.

220
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:07,911
We have been attacked, Commander.
We must respond in kind.

221
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,347
Target the ship.

222
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:16,690
The Earth vessel has been targeted.
Weapon's primed and ready.

223
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,489
Fire.

224
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,428
<i>Evasive maneuvers, full military thrust.</i>

225
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:29,302
<i>- Return fire with forward rail guns.
- Sub light engines aren't responding.</i>

226
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:32,934
Weapons are down! We've lost hull integrity
and life support on decks 3 through 7.

227
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:33,812
<i>Seal them off!</i>

228
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:37,922
- That blast cut through our shields at full strength.
- I know, I don't understand how.

229
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:41,484
- Sensors detect that the weapon is recharging!
- We've only got minutes.

230
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:43,490
- Hyperdrive status?
- Hyperdrive is offline.

231
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,246
Hull integrity is too unstable.

232
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:48,628
Medical teams reporting four casualties,
eight crew members still unaccounted for.

233
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:50,873
That thing can only fire at one target at a time.

234
00:15:50,913 --> 00:15:52,469
Go. Scramble Blue Squadron.

235
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:55,423
<i>We'll see if we can do some damage in close.</i>

236
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:57,119
<i>Go, go!</i>

237
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,371
Tracking multiple smaller
ships attacking the satellite.

238
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:11,128
The shield is holding.

239
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:12,963
By the grace of the gods.

240
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:15,358
Thirty seconds till weapon is primed and ready.

241
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:17,354
Target the large vessel again.

242
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:30,923
<i>It's no use, Blue Leader.
We're not getting through.</i>

243
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:32,359
Keep at it, boys.

244
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,006
Lieutenant, I need sublight engines now.

245
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:44,294
I'm trying, Sir.

246
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,489
Auxiliary systems aren't kicking in.

247
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:50,679
- They can't. The two main power
relays have been damaged.
- Can it be repaired?

248
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:53,832
We need to re-route power through the bypass conduits.

249
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:55,148
Here.

250
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,064
We should get limited sublight capability back.

251
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,499
Marks, you're with colonel Carter. Go.

252
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:07,122
We need to get up two levels.

253
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:10,554
Captain!

254
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,470
The elevator's not safe!

255
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:13,507
Right...

256
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:14,106
sorry...

257
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:15,662
I don't know what I was thinking.

258
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:18,815
Shields?

259
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:20,492
Forward shields at 40%.

260
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:22,727
Divert all shield power to forward generators.

261
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:26,240
Sir, sensors indicate that the
weapon is reaching maximum power.

262
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,474
All hands, brace for impact!

263
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:31,168
This damn thing's shield is not weakening.

264
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:49,446
I got you.

265
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:58,586
- Are you alright?
- My arm...

266
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:04,054
Bridge, this is Carter.
Can you beam us up to auxiliary control room two?

267
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:07,127
Negative, Colonel, control room
no longer has life support.

268
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:11,477
The large vessel appears to be disabled.

269
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:13,473
Shall I broadcast a call for surrender?

270
00:18:13,513 --> 00:18:16,386
The book of Origin
tells us that enemies of the Ori

271
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:20,337
show no mercy in their attempts
to draw us away from the path.

272
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:24,408
We must face this attack with
all the strength we have been given.

273
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:26,124
Finish them.

274
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:33,287
Prometheus, this is Blue Leader.
Request status report.

275
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,542
Not too good right now, Blue Leader.

276
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:36,959
<i>Can we assist?</i>

277
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,275
Negative, Blue Leader, negative.

278
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:40,620
Docking bays are too unstable for safe return.

279
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,669
<i>Stand by for orders.</i>

280
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:42,785
Roger that.

281
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:46,657
<i>Bridge, this is Carter.
We need deck 15 unsealed.</i>

282
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:48,473
Unseal it, if you can.

283
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:56,006
If the aft power control panel is still intact,
we should be able to rig the naquadah generator and

284
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:57,892
re-route power to sublight propulsion.

285
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,528
<i>You've got about two minutes, Colonel.</i>

286
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:01,564
It's not enough time, Sir.

287
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,193
- Open a channel, broadcast on all frequencies.
- Yes, Sir.

288
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:11,262
This is Colonel Lionel Pendergast of the
Earth Vessel Prometheus calling the Rand Protectorate.

289
00:19:11,302 --> 00:19:12,578
Your attack on our vessel

290
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,989
has severely damaged our engines
and rendered our weapons systems inoperable.

291
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:21,379
We are willing negotiate the terms of our surrender.

292
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:24,372
<i>Rand Protectorate, this is the Earth vessel Prometheus.</i>

293
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:29,162
<i>We wish to negotiate our surrender.
Repeat, we wish to negotiate our surrender.</i>

294
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:34,749
- Okay, fire it up.
- Don't we need to test the power flow?

295
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:35,946
- No time.
- But...

296
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:37,343
I know! Do it.

297
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,527
Alright, this is useless.

298
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:46,123
Blue Squadron, this is Blue Leader.

299
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:50,114
Break off the attack and scramble formation
between the Prometheus and the weapon.

300
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:53,607
<i>Maybe one of us will get lucky
and take a portion of the next shot.</i>

301
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:55,802
I would not consider that lucky, Colonel Mitchell.

302
00:19:55,842 --> 00:19:58,197
Well, it could be for anybody aboard Prometheus.

303
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:05,680
<i>This is President Nadal of the Rand
Protectorate addressing the Earth vessel.</i>

304
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:09,570
<i>Please explain your brazen act
of aggression against our nation.</i>

305
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:13,162
<i>Our actions have been misconstrued as hostile.</i>

306
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:14,759
<i>We are here to investigate</i>

307
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,754
<i>why an emissary we sent to your planet,</i>

308
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:19,778
<i>Dr. Daniel Jackson,
has ceased all communications with us.</i>

309
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:24,936
And yet your first act upon entering our
planet's space was to fire on our defense satellite.

310
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:27,859
But we detected that your satellite was powering up

311
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:30,823
and aiming at us, which we took
to be the first act of aggression.

312
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,818
<i>We merely responded in kind.</i>

313
00:20:33,217 --> 00:20:34,016
<i>Now...</i>

314
00:20:34,614 --> 00:20:37,208
<i>we are no longer a threat to you.</i>

315
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:42,597
<i>I have people aboard this vessel who are in need of
medical attention, and I am venting atmosphere.</i>

316
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:46,588
Please, consider our request for surrender.

317
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:52,574
Keep your fingers crossed.

318
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:59,159
<i>Your planet sent this ship to attack us.
I have no desire to take more lives.</i>

319
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,853
You tell us what we want to know,

320
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:04,247
I will accept their surrender.

321
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:06,243
<i>Who else was involved in this attack?</i>

322
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:08,439
What other actions
are the Caledonians planning?

323
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:09,595
<i>We're not spies.</i>

324
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:13,826
I came here to convince your people to dismantle this
weapon yourselves before any of this became necessary.

325
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:15,822
<i>Why would we do that?</i>

326
00:21:15,862 --> 00:21:17,618
I have tried to explain.

327
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:19,573
Who helped you gain access to the Stargate?

328
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:20,611
I acted alone.

329
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:22,806
You are lying.

330
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:28,193
You are part of a spy network helping to supply
the Caledonians with classified information.

331
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:30,349
Did you ever think that maybe
the Caledonians are being leaked information

332
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,981
<i>- because not everyone in your country
agrees with what you're doing?
- The weapon is charged.</i>

333
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:34,979
Wait! Please.

334
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:38,371
Just listen to me before you go
murdering defenseless people.

335
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:40,366
We are the ones defending ourselves.

336
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:42,961
Your ship attacked us.

337
00:21:44,078 --> 00:21:46,153
Sensors detect the weapon is fully charged.

338
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:49,944
<i>- Colonel Carter, I need good news now.
- A couple of more minutes.</i>

339
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:52,459
We don't have it, Sam. I'm sorry. It's over.

340
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,055
Give me as much power as you can.

341
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:55,253
Re-route it from the shields

342
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:58,007
and get me all functioning internal
Asgard beam sensors back online.

343
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:00,122
<i>- Sir?
- We're abandoning ship.</i>

344
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,874
Begin the evacuation orders. I want all
personnel to beam down to the planet's surface.

345
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:06,268
Find me a nice open field anywhere in Caledonia.

346
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:07,196
Yes, Sir.

347
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:09,800
And broadcast the locations
of all the active sensor sites.

348
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,594
This is the Prometheus to all F-302's.

349
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,190
We have begun our evacuation.

350
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,981
<i>I advise you to get clear of the ship and meet us
at the rendezvous coordinates on the planet.</i>

351
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:19,778
Affirmative, Prometheus.

352
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:27,361
I'll handle the final transport commands.

353
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:29,955
Everyone else is to report to the nearest beam-out site.

354
00:22:31,352 --> 00:22:32,948
Let's go, people! That's an order. Move!

355
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:35,842
- Sir, I...
- Get out of here. Get out of here!

356
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:44,123
Go.

357
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:48,114
If I don't finish tying this in, we'll run out of
power before everyone can be beamed off.

358
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:50,289
Go.

359
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:04,976
We must not fail the gods.
We must embrace our destiny.

360
00:23:05,574 --> 00:23:07,570
- Fire the weapon.
- Wait!
- No!

361
00:23:40,297 --> 00:23:41,494
Ah hell...

362
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:54,664
The Earth vessel has been destroyed.

363
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,812
The loss of your people is regrettable,

364
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:21,135
<i>but your planet and the
Caledonians must know our resolve.</i>

365
00:24:21,145 --> 00:24:24,896
<i>You know full well the Caledonians would
rather sacrifice themselves than submit.</i>

366
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,145
You'll be forced
to commit genocide and destroy them.

367
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:32,779
A year ago,
they launched a first strike against us.

368
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:35,373
They obviously
had no problem with doing the same.

369
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:37,168
When does it stop?

370
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:42,756
When do we stop killing each other over wars started
by our fathers and their fathers before them?

371
00:24:43,255 --> 00:24:45,649
This is no longer about Rand or Caledonia.

372
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,847
It is.

373
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:50,639
We need to set aside our differences
and fight the threat of the Ori together.

374
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:54,630
Goran, how long have we known each other?

375
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,825
Please...

376
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:59,818
believe what Dr. Jackson has told you about them.

377
00:25:02,611 --> 00:25:04,208
With my own eyes,

378
00:25:04,247 --> 00:25:08,797
I saw the Prior bring the satellite
to life merely by touching it with his staff.

379
00:25:08,997 --> 00:25:13,787
Neither Rand nor Caledonia have the
technology capable of resisting such power.

380
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:15,583
What choice do we have?

381
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:16,780
Look...

382
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:23,764
I can't make you any promises,
but we have already developed a machine
that neutralizes the Priors' powers.

383
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:26,956
Now, as far as we know, they've only been able
to travel within our galaxy by use of the Stargate,

384
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:30,908
and you can either bury your Gate,
or we can teach you to build an iris system like ours.

385
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,142
Nadal has lost all sense of reason.

386
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:38,930
The book of Origin is just one big lie meant
to seduce us into meaningless worship.

387
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:41,923
The Ori just want to use us,

388
00:25:41,963 --> 00:25:44,517
and killing in their name is not self-defense.

389
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:46,213
It's murder.

390
00:25:54,694 --> 00:25:57,088
We were monitoring the entire exchange.

391
00:25:57,687 --> 00:26:01,598
To our knowledge, 76 crew were
recovered in Caledonian territory.

392
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:04,672
There were over 115 people aboard that ship.

393
00:26:05,071 --> 00:26:09,062
Do you have any sort of a manifest,
a list of names we can compare to those recovered?

394
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,058
Not on me, no.

395
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:13,053
So where are our people?

396
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:15,448
The transport arrived moments ago.

397
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:17,742
Teal'c, Cameron.

398
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:18,740
Sam!

399
00:26:19,338 --> 00:26:21,733
You are a sight for sore eyes.

400
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:26,722
It is good to see you alive, Colonel Carter.

401
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:28,598
We feared the worst.

402
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:30,753
Where's Pendergast?

403
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:32,589
He wasn't with us.

404
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:38,096
<i>Our security forces did extensive sweeps
of the area where you appeared.</i>

405
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:40,172
No other survivors were found.

406
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:44,642
This is Minister Chaska,

407
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:47,236
leader of the Caledonian Federation.

408
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:50,029
I am thankful you survived
such a tragic event, Colonel.

409
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,704
I hope we can offer you and
your crew some comfort here.

410
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:55,058
She's pretty much up to
speed on what's going on.

411
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:57,892
We were, of course, praying for your success,

412
00:26:58,131 --> 00:27:01,214
but with the destruction of your
vessel, I fear that any hope

413
00:27:01,224 --> 00:27:03,978
for a peaceful solution to this crisis has been lost.

414
00:27:04,377 --> 00:27:06,253
And you will not surrender?

415
00:27:06,513 --> 00:27:09,506
Our people would rather die
than live under Rand rule.

416
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:12,828
<i>We will retaliate against any attack</i>

417
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:14,833
with the full forces at our disposal.

418
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:21,518
Any word?

419
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,237
Nothing.

420
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:25,868
The Rand government continues to deny any
knowledge of Daniel Jackson's existence.

421
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:30,339
Our contacts tell us he was seen alive
in the Rand command bunker during
the exchange with your ship.

422
00:27:30,418 --> 00:27:32,014
He has not been seen since.

423
00:27:32,813 --> 00:27:34,210
Any progress here?

424
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,002
Well, these satellite schematics are far more
detailed than the ones Kane provided.

425
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:41,793
As we saw firsthand, shields were
added late in the design process.

426
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:47,181
I'm still not sure what's powering it or how it was
able to penetrate our Asgard design shields,

427
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,037
but there is one bit of good news.

428
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:50,593
According to this,

429
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:54,704
all commands for the satellite originate
from Rand's main control facility,

430
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:59,892
and maintaining a shield around the
satellite is a huge power drain, so it's
only activated when a threat is detected.

431
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,247
Are you saying the Prometheus was destroyed

432
00:28:02,287 --> 00:28:05,001
because we hesitated to fire when
we dropped out of hyperspace?

433
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:08,034
We hesitated out of concern
for the safe return of Daniel Jackson.

434
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:10,907
We also hesitated to leave once
our weapons were ineffective.

435
00:28:10,948 --> 00:28:14,579
However, it seems that you are saying if
we were to destroy the Rand control facility,

436
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:17,293
the weapon itself would become
vulnerable to attack.

437
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,967
Then we could take a 302 back up
there and finish the job.

438
00:28:20,006 --> 00:28:23,279
No, the Rand facility is part of
an underground bunker complex

439
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:26,722
that was strong enough to
survive our last missile attack.

440
00:28:26,732 --> 00:28:29,565
Since then, Rand has developed
an early-warning radar system

441
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,521
and anti-missile defenses.

442
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:32,399
Wait up.

443
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:35,233
What about sabotage?
You said you had people on the inside.

444
00:28:35,273 --> 00:28:37,827
Our agents have already made several attempts.

445
00:28:38,147 --> 00:28:41,339
Security is too tight for them
to mount any sort of effective strike.

446
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:45,609
Actually, we don't have to hit the bunker
itself to knock out satellite control.

447
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:50,757
If we can sever the link between the facility
and the weapon, even temporarily...

448
00:28:50,838 --> 00:28:52,514
You're talking about an E.M. Pulse.

449
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:57,822
Even a small one detonated in the atmosphere
above the facility should interfere
with their ability to control the satellite.

450
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,139
E.M. Pulse?

451
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:02,092
It would disable their electronic
devices. They'd be totally blind.

452
00:29:02,132 --> 00:29:03,090
For a short time.

453
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:05,444
You possess such technology?

454
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:09,794
You wouldn't have suggested it if
you didn't have something in mind.

455
00:29:10,035 --> 00:29:12,988
Well, like most discoveries,
it was a bit of an accident.

456
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:15,302
After the battle with Anubis' fleet over Antarctica,

457
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:18,974
small random E.M. fields were detected
by Prometheus during the cleanup.

458
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,730
It took us a while to figure out.

459
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:26,537
Are you going to tell me that an F-302
gives off an E.M. Pulse when it blows up?

460
00:29:26,577 --> 00:29:29,291
It was one of the things
I was working on at area 51.

461
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:31,686
<i>We think it has something
to do with a concussive force</i>

462
00:29:31,926 --> 00:29:35,368
interfering with the artificial gravity field
generated by the inertial dampeners.

463
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:39,129
So how do we remote-fly
a 302 over there and blow it up?

464
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:40,327
We don't have to.

465
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:44,557
All we have to do is harvest the inertial dampener
and rig it to one of the Caledonian missiles.

466
00:29:44,596 --> 00:29:46,433
What about their anti-missile defenses?

467
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:49,705
We can use that same 302's radar-jamming technology

468
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:51,541
to make your missile invisible to Rand.

469
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:54,255
<i>Still, if this does not work as you are planning,</i>

470
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:57,269
it will be seen as an offensive against Rand.

471
00:29:57,368 --> 00:30:01,399
President Nadal will surely respond by
stepping up the deadline for our surrender,

472
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:04,352
and he'll use the satellite weapon against us.

473
00:30:06,428 --> 00:30:07,825
This will work.

474
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:18,281
I don't know what to say...

475
00:30:20,516 --> 00:30:21,913
how to take it all back.

476
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,667
I shouldn't have come to you.

477
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:26,952
Look, right now, I just have
to believe there are survivors.

478
00:30:26,962 --> 00:30:28,438
You think that's really possible?

479
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:30,853
The Prometheus has beaming technology.

480
00:30:30,893 --> 00:30:31,651
Had...

481
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,365
beaming technology, whatever that is.

482
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:38,157
Look, the bottom line is, we can't lose focus of
why we came back here in the first place.

483
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:40,511
There has to be a way out of this and

484
00:30:40,551 --> 00:30:42,347
I got the feeling Pernaux was listening to us.

485
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:43,025
Daniel...

486
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:46,219
I know the history between Caledonia
and Rand makes things seem impossible, but

487
00:30:46,618 --> 00:30:48,693
sometimes, an outside perspective helps.

488
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:52,045
In the past, I've found the key
to these types of disputes is to...

489
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:54,319
to get both parties on equal footing, just

490
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,635
to get the process of talking
with each other going again.

491
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:58,071
Do you ever give up?

492
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,868
Not until I'm dead.

493
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,898
And sometimes, not even then.

494
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:09,606
Intelligence is reporting visual confirmation
of a missile launch from Caledonia.

495
00:31:10,124 --> 00:31:13,557
Early-warning systems detect
no missile entering our airspace.

496
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:15,432
- One missile?
- So it seems.

497
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:17,068
<i>Possibly a test, then?</i>

498
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:19,223
They are not going to surrender.

499
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,780
They are preparing

500
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:25,011
to launch a preemptive first strike given
the Earth attack on the satellite has failed.

501
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:28,084
You don't know that.
They still have two days until the deadline.

502
00:31:28,882 --> 00:31:30,598
Get me Minister Chaska.

503
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,624
President Nadal is on line for you, Ma'am.

504
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:40,696
Doesn't look like they've employed countermeasures.

505
00:31:41,174 --> 00:31:42,571
The radar jamming is working.

506
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,327
The timing is too coincidental.

507
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,961
I suspect he has spies who witnessed the launch.

508
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,158
You need to stall,

509
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:51,311
or else they'll activate the satellite
shield out of sheer paranoia.

510
00:31:52,948 --> 00:31:54,225
Patch him through.

511
00:31:58,056 --> 00:32:00,011
President Nadal, this is Minister Chaska.

512
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:03,744
Mr. President, if you are calling about
the recent missile launch, please forgive me.

513
00:32:03,884 --> 00:32:05,640
I should have called you immediately.

514
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,754
<i>The launch was entirely accidental.</i>

515
00:32:07,895 --> 00:32:12,564
<i>It seems there was some confusion when new
launch protocol codes were distributed recently.</i>

516
00:32:12,823 --> 00:32:17,373
<i>Obviously, the payload was detonated
as soon as we realized what had happened.</i>

517
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,289
Needless to say,

518
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:22,162
everyone here is a little on edge as of late,

519
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:27,350
but, thankfully, we have ample precautions
in place to prevent such an
occurrence from being a serious threat.

520
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,428
<i>Indeed.</i>

521
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:30,743
<i>Minister Chaska,</i>

522
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:35,233
<i>while your military's incompetence does
concern me, the reason I am calling</i>

523
00:32:35,672 --> 00:32:38,546
<i>is to discuss the impending deadline.</i>

524
00:32:39,603 --> 00:32:40,481
I see.

525
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,792
Our government is still in the
process of debating its options.

526
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:49,142
<i>As promised, we will give you
an answer by the designated deadline.</i>

527
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,973
I am sorry the decision
has not been easier for you.

528
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,308
We shall talk again soon.

529
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:01,374
Air command, this is Blue Leader.
We are wheels up.

530
00:33:01,852 --> 00:33:03,170
<i>Roger that.
Package is on its way.</i>

531
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:06,483
We are 30 seconds from detonation over target.

532
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,077
Nice job.

533
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:11,871
He didn't believe a word of it.

534
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:17,378
We're getting a report from
coastal monitoring base four.

535
00:33:17,738 --> 00:33:19,972
May be visual of an incoming missile.

536
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:21,848
Why isn't it showing up on our radar?

537
00:33:21,888 --> 00:33:25,480
Sir, satellite sensors are detecting
a single small ship on approach.

538
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,274
Possibly one of the Earth fighters
that landed in Caledonia.

539
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,629
Activate the missile shields.

540
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,648
<i>What just happened?</i>

541
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:40,606
I don't know. We've lost power.

542
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:41,843
All systems are down.

543
00:33:41,883 --> 00:33:43,759
Backup power is supposed to be isolated.

544
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:45,594
The systems that activate it are down.

545
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,390
We can't control the satellite.

546
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:48,777
Get it back!

547
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:51,182
Get me a radio and a phone in here that works.

548
00:33:57,807 --> 00:33:59,164
Blue Leader, this is base.

549
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,158
The package has been delivered.
Window of opportunity is now open.

550
00:34:02,197 --> 00:34:03,035
<i>Roger that.</i>

551
00:34:03,315 --> 00:34:06,348
<i>We have cleared the atmosphere.
Two minutes from weapons range.</i>

552
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:09,381
<i>The blast did no apparent damage
beyond the power outage,</i>

553
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:13,612
<i>which seems to be limited to the area
immediately around the command facility.</i>

554
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:16,246
To our knowledge,

555
00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:20,636
the Caledonians do not possess the
level of technology required to do this.

556
00:34:20,716 --> 00:34:23,869
Such a weapon could only have
been given to them by your people.

557
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:24,906
I hope so.

558
00:34:24,946 --> 00:34:26,423
<i>How do we undo this?</i>

559
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:29,017
You tell me now, or I'll have you executed!

560
00:34:29,057 --> 00:34:32,848
Based on its speed and trajectory, the Earth ship
will reach the satellite in less than one minute.

561
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:36,321
Do you think if the Ori were true gods,
they would allow the Caledonians to do this?

562
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:41,150
Look, I understand your fear of the Prior
and why you feel you have no choice,
but there is another way out of this.

563
00:34:42,268 --> 00:34:43,544
What would you have me do?

564
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:44,621
Let me use the radio.

565
00:34:44,702 --> 00:34:48,054
I can contact the ship that's about to destroy
the satellite and get them to call it off.

566
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:49,212
Why would you do this?

567
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:52,723
Because I still believe a peaceful
compromise can be reached out of all this.

568
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:55,797
I'm listening.

569
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:58,950
<i>This is Daniel Jackson. Come in, please.</i>

570
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:02,721
<i>Whoever's flying the 302,
if you can hear me, please respond.</i>

571
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:04,836
<i>This is Daniel Jackson. Come in, please.</i>

572
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:06,233
Jackson, go ahead.

573
00:35:06,752 --> 00:35:07,710
Mitchell?

574
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,386
<i>Yeah. You okay?</i>

575
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:11,022
<i>For the moment. You?</i>

576
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:12,859
<i>Well, all things considered...</i>

577
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:17,209
Listen, me and Teal'c are getting ready
to bag ourselves an evil Ori satellite.

578
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:20,181
<i>Yeah, so glad I caught you. Listen,</i>

579
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,556
the Rand want to offer the Caledonians a deal.

580
00:35:23,195 --> 00:35:23,993
<i>Really?</i>

581
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:25,410
May I?

582
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,168
Please.

583
00:35:26,947 --> 00:35:28,383
Daniel, this is Sam.

584
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,219
Hey, Sam, good to hear your voice.

585
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:31,337
<i>Yours too.</i>

586
00:35:31,656 --> 00:35:34,609
I'm here with Minister Chaska
of the Caledonian Federation.

587
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:36,445
We'd like to know what Rand is offering.

588
00:35:36,485 --> 00:35:38,560
<i>In exchange for leaving the satellite intact,</i>

589
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:41,673
<i>Rand is offering Caledonia the Stargate.</i>

590
00:35:42,502 --> 00:35:45,894
Rand is offering the Gate
and a limited cease-fire, so all those from Caledonia

591
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:49,885
<i>who do not want to follow Origin
and wish to seek refuge on another planet may do so.</i>

592
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:51,442
They want us to leave our home...

593
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,300
our planet.

594
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,694
<i>Jackson, are you sure about this?</i>

595
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:58,047
<i>I've got a clean shot at this thing,
and I am in favor of taking it.</i>

596
00:35:58,086 --> 00:35:59,762
<i>Listen, the Rand built
that satellite in less than a year,</i>

597
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:01,918
and I can tell you their resolve is...

598
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:03,595
pretty steady.

599
00:36:03,634 --> 00:36:05,909
<i>If we blow this one up,
they're just going to build another,</i>

600
00:36:06,149 --> 00:36:08,274
<i>and as far as the Caledonians go, well...</i>

601
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:11,157
<i>Sam, you'll just have to explain to them
that the Priors may not give them much choice,</i>

602
00:36:11,197 --> 00:36:13,073
<i>regardless of what Rand decides to do.</i>

603
00:36:13,392 --> 00:36:16,545
I've seen the Priors wipe out entire
planets for refusing to follow the Ori.

604
00:36:16,585 --> 00:36:18,181
You will not fight them with us?

605
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,095
Well, we would try, but, honestly,
there's only so much we can do.

606
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:23,729
Will the Prior not follow us wherever we go?

607
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:24,886
Maybe, but for now...

608
00:36:24,926 --> 00:36:27,121
<i>Look, this offer's not going
to be on the table long, and</i>

609
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,154
I realize there's a lot to be worked
out, but at least it's a start.

610
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:35,662
At the very least, the Rand now believe
that you have the ability to disable
the satellite whenever you want.

611
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:38,495
Which they will surely counter in time.

612
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:55,777
Tell colonel Mitchell to call it off.

613
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,688
Blue Leader, this is Carter.

614
00:36:59,728 --> 00:37:02,721
Minister Chaska is requesting
that you stand down.

615
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,277
Alright, Jackson,

616
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:07,470
but you folks had better be damn sure about this.

617
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,636
Backup power is online.

618
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,270
Satellite control has been re-established.

619
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:29,101
Sensors detect the Earth ship
is veering away from the target.

620
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:32,653
Activate the shields.

621
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:34,489
The ship is no longer a threat.

622
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:36,006
Power the weapon.

623
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:36,564
What?

624
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:39,917
<i>Target the Caledonian capital building.</i>

625
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:41,952
<i>Sir, perhaps we should take a moment...</i>

626
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:43,579
You will abide by my authority.

627
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:45,465
<i>- Power the weapon now!
- Powering the weapon.</i>

628
00:37:46,622 --> 00:37:49,855
Our sensors detect the weapon's
shields have become active.

629
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:53,247
Jackson, what's going on down there?

630
00:37:53,447 --> 00:37:57,198
The satellite is powering up its
weapon and targeting the planet.

631
00:37:57,518 --> 00:37:58,555
We had a deal.

632
00:37:59,314 --> 00:38:01,548
President Nadal, explain your actions immediately.

633
00:38:02,386 --> 00:38:03,664
President Nadal!

634
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:06,537
You gave your word!

635
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:08,942
I gave my soul to the Ori

636
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:12,144
who offered us all salvation.
Anyone who rejects that is a fool!

637
00:38:12,504 --> 00:38:15,218
They are all Caledonians, for God's sake!
They all deserved to die

638
00:38:15,357 --> 00:38:17,952
long before the Prior showed us
the path to enlightenment.

639
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:18,870
Shut down the satellite.

640
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:19,907
<i>Don't listen to him.</i>

641
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:20,585
Now!

642
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:22,182
Arrest the commander.

643
00:38:22,222 --> 00:38:24,657
Stand down!
I won't let you do this, Nadal.

644
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,173
Do as I say!

645
00:38:37,188 --> 00:38:39,862
Put your weapons down!
Now!

646
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:43,693
Get a medical unit in here.
Go! Go!

647
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:52,534
Shut down the satellite.

648
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:54,609
He's dead.

649
00:38:55,128 --> 00:38:57,722
You heard him the President is dead.
Commander Pernaux is next in command.

650
00:38:57,762 --> 00:39:01,953
- He's also the one who killed the President.
- The President violated an international treaty.

651
00:39:02,352 --> 00:39:05,864
You want to be the one responsible for destroying
a city full of people when this goes to tribunal?

652
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:07,540
Shut it down now!

653
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:11,651
Hang on. Help is coming.

654
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:14,006
The deal...

655
00:39:14,045 --> 00:39:15,162
will stand.

656
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:34,120
Hey.

657
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,674
Haven't seen you since the memorial service.

658
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:37,952
Yeah.

659
00:39:39,807 --> 00:39:41,324
It was a rough day.

660
00:39:45,714 --> 00:39:47,630
So, where have you been?

661
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:49,585
I...

662
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:54,414
hand-delivered Landry's letter
to colonel Pendergast's wife and kids.

663
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:57,648
They need to know that he died saving his crew...

664
00:39:58,405 --> 00:39:59,962
that his death mattered.

665
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:06,627
Well, 76 people survived.
That's a testament to his leadership.

666
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:07,984
And yours.

667
00:40:08,862 --> 00:40:12,135
We never would've got off that planet
if you hadn't brokered the deal.

668
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,281
So, I take it, then, you haven't heard.

669
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:20,596
Heard what?

670
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:24,427
Soon after we left, the talks broke down.

671
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:29,136
And?

672
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,172
And we've been unable to make
contact with them.

673
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:34,763
General Landry had the Daedalus
re-route on its way back from Atlantis.

674
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:39,134
It seems the Caledonians weren't
content to just leave their fair planet.

675
00:40:39,453 --> 00:40:41,009
They launched an attack.

676
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,204
And Rand responded.

677
00:40:44,123 --> 00:40:46,717
The Stargate is presumed buried in the rubble.

678
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:53,741
Rough day.

679
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:57,452
Rough day.
