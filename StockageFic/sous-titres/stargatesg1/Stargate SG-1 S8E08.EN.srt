1
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:10,416
Walk out that door,
there's no turning back.

2
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:13,102
I understand. I'm not having any doubts.

3
00:00:13,188 --> 00:00:15,577
Alec, it is not just your credibility at stake.

4
00:00:15,668 --> 00:00:20,219
You're right there. It's the leaders of the
democratic free world should be worried.

5
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:24,062
Think about the people who work
for this company. The shareholders.

6
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:29,745
I am, Brian. They have a right
to know the truth. As does everybody else.

7
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:34,905
Trust me.

8
00:00:34,988 --> 00:00:37,786
We're doing the right thing.

9
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:54,262
Thank you all for coming.

10
00:00:56,548 --> 00:01:01,906
As you all know, about five months ago
our planet suffered a horrible tragedy.

11
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:06,266
Over 2,000 American
servicemen and women were killed

12
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:09,420
when a meteor shower
disrupted global communications

13
00:01:09,508 --> 00:01:15,697
and hit a United States naval carrier group
on manoeuvres in the Pacific Ocean.

14
00:01:15,788 --> 00:01:20,384
I'm here today
to challenge the facts of that incident

15
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:24,177
as they've been conveyed
to the general public.

16
00:01:26,148 --> 00:01:32,462
<i>On the day in question, none of our</i>
<i>satellites detected a meteor shower.</i>

17
00:01:32,548 --> 00:01:34,698
- Hey, what's going on?
- Shh!

18
00:01:34,788 --> 00:01:38,337
<i>I don't know how many governments</i>
<i>around the world are in on this,</i>

19
00:01:38,428 --> 00:01:44,025
<i>but I do know we are being lied to</i>
<i>and the truth is being covered up.</i>

20
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:46,261
Uh-oh.

21
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:51,342
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>there is life beyond our world.</i>

22
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:56,739
<i>There are aliens out there, and they</i>
<i>have a technology far beyond ours,</i>

23
00:01:56,828 --> 00:02:02,858
<i>and they have been intervening</i>
<i>in our existence for quite some time.</i>

24
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:05,382
<i>I have proof.</i>

25
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:10,383
<i>And I am giving the governments</i>
<i>of all the nations that are aware of this</i>

26
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:14,017
<i>24 hours to reveal the truth,</i>

27
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,704
<i>or I'm going to do it for them. Thank you.</i>

28
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:25,106
Well.

29
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:28,297
There you go.

30
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:35,018
<i>For those of you on another planet</i>
<i>for the past 20 years, Alec Colson, age 42,</i>

31
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:38,339
<i>net worth over $60 billion,</i>

32
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:41,738
<i>runs a global empire of companies,</i>
<i>including communications,</i>

33
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:47,744
<i>biotechnology, aerospace, and aviation.</i>
<i>He's number eight on the Fortune 500.</i>

34
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,547
<i>He personally holds</i>
<i>over 200 proprietary patents...</i>

35
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:52,619
Shut it off.

36
00:03:53,828 --> 00:03:56,467
We know who he is.

37
00:03:56,548 --> 00:04:00,826
- Some of us better than others.
- We worked together briefly, sir.

38
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:05,345
Colson Aviation developed multi-engine
control systems for the F-302s.

39
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:09,103
Colson didn't know what they were for,
but he is a brilliant engineer.

40
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:13,625
- He's also a little nuts, isn't he?
- You've test-flown experimental aircraft.

41
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,858
We all go through the gate.

42
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:19,258
- This isn't about us.
- In a way, it is.

43
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:25,537
The point is, sir, he's not some loony cult
leader. People are taking him seriously.

44
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:27,937
So what do we think he knows?

45
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:31,225
He owns several Earth observer
and weather satellites.

46
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:36,541
Maybe they picked something up. Anubis'
fleet in orbit or the battle over Antarctica.

47
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:39,347
I don't understand
how it could have come this far.

48
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:43,307
He's got the "national security" speech
from the Pentagon several times.

49
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:48,382
- The president has called him personally.
- Why not merely tell him the truth?

50
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:54,259
- His profile was deemed a "security risk".
- For obvious reasons.

51
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:58,227
Apparently his father was a reporter,
jailed during the McCarthy era.

52
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:02,506
He believes in the rights for people
to know what their government is doing.

53
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:07,184
Leaking classified information
could be considered treason.

54
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:11,739
All right, see if he can
be convinced not to go public.

55
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:15,818
- Without actually telling him anything?
- Right.

56
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,617
We've got all the major networks,
over a dozen live radio broadcasts

57
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,587
and reporters from newspapers
all waiting for the next shoe to drop.

58
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:32,377
- Brian, calm down.
- Our stock price is trading down 25%.

59
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:35,426
We overextended competing
for that round of contracts.

60
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:41,378
That stock price is covering our debt.
And you are alienating our biggest client.

61
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:45,780
- We'll have to start selling off assets...
- What does that matter, Brian?

62
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:48,063
Given what we know.

63
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,936
I don't know, I guess I'm just trying
to hold on to some shred of reality.

64
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:57,785
You and everyone else are gonna have
to start dealing with a whole new reality.

65
00:05:58,268 --> 00:06:00,384
What if the world can't handle it?

66
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:03,301
What if Washington's right
and we should keep it in the bag?

67
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:07,097
Trust me. The truth is always right.

68
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:12,546
We've caused mass hysteria. You have no
idea how much chaos this could cause.

69
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:14,664
Alec, they're here.

70
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:17,342
Show them in, would you?

71
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:20,777
It'll be OK.

72
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,903
- Lieutenant Colonel.
- Alec.

73
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:26,218
Radiant as ever.

74
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:28,697
- Daniel Jackson.
- Doc, I'm a big fan.

75
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,303
- Really?
- I've followed you since your early career.

76
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:35,698
Pyramids as landing pads for alien ships.
Fascinating.

77
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:37,904
That was a long time ago.

78
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:41,298
What have you been up to since?
It's like you dropped off the map.

79
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,856
I've been around.

80
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:48,224
I beg your pardon.
May I introduce Brian Vogler?

81
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,618
- Thank you for seeing us today.
- Shall we?

82
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:56,338
Why don't we start with something
I'm sure we can all agree on.

83
00:06:56,428 --> 00:07:01,866
That meteor shower was a cover story.
And a surprisingly weak one at that.

84
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:06,180
Although, under the circumstances,
I'm not sure I'd have had a better one.

85
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:08,862
What makes you say that?

86
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:29,142
I'm guessing that's one of ours?

87
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:35,064
We lost contact with 12 communications
satellites for over six hours on that day.

88
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:39,380
When we got them online, they were able
to transmit images stored in the buffers.

89
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:44,462
- Images like these can be faked.
- Or made to seem fake.

90
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:52,300
I know why you're here, Sam.
The Pentagon wants me to know

91
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,744
that people like you are gonna try
to make me look like a fraud.

92
00:07:55,828 --> 00:07:59,423
- People like me?
- Very smart people.

93
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:01,738
We have more than this.

94
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:05,662
Obviously, I don't know everything,
but I do have a right to.

95
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:08,501
As does everyone else.

96
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:13,787
- Anything we can say to stop you?
- Believe me, I've tried.

97
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:22,583
- Carter.
- Sam, it's Julia Donovan.

98
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:26,739
- How did you get this number?
- <i>I have my sources.</i>

99
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:29,902
Our camera caught you
and a nice-looking man

100
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:34,220
going into Colson Industries'
head office in Seattle. I just saw the feed.

101
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:37,539
- And?
- <i>Do you have an official comment?</i>

102
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:40,017
I think your coverage is a little one-sided.

103
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:43,180
Come on, Sam.
Colson's gonna out the whole operation.

104
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:45,862
You don't think Washington
can contain this?

105
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:50,021
We'll see. I don't have to remind you of
the nondisclosure agreement you signed?

106
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:52,576
It's a reporter
from the <i>Prometheus</i> incident.

107
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:55,940
Colson doesn't seem to be worried
about going to jail.

108
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:59,862
- He hasn't done anything illegal yet.
- <i>We had an agreement.</i>

109
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:03,145
You said if something was gonna break,
you'd call me first.

110
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:05,503
I will, OK? Bye-bye.

111
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:09,625
I got 13 messages from Emmett Bregman.

112
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:16,265
The switchboard's jammed.
Every crackpot in the world is calling.

113
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:20,546
- I've arranged security for all of you.
- Do you think we need to be worried?

114
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:25,099
- I'd be worried about what we <i>don't</i> know.
- I'm trying to tell him it's not too late.

115
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:27,179
It is too late, Brian.

116
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:31,978
Too late for the world to know there
was an alien attack against our planet.

117
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:38,337
And for the public to realise they've been
lied to about the nature of our existence.

118
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:41,625
- We're going public?
- I was hoping the feds would come clean.

119
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,462
I can't believe Washington hasn't
stopped us with a legal injunction.

120
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:48,187
That would legitimise our claims.

121
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:51,544
They'll try to play this
as if we can't be taken seriously.

122
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:55,621
- We're one of the largest corporations.
- And we're telling the truth.

123
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,018
It doesn't matter who we are.
Or how right we are.

124
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:04,740
- They can stop us if they really want to.
- Come on, what are they gonna do?

125
00:10:05,748 --> 00:10:08,342
Have me killed?

126
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:15,219
He's gotta have something
more significant than pictures.

127
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:19,506
I'm going over government contracts
assigned to Colson's companies.

128
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:25,345
There's quite a few related to R & D of
alien technologies we procured offworld.

129
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:29,940
<i>We'll now head to Colson Industries.</i>

130
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:36,063
- <i>Welcome, and thank you for coming.</i>
- 24 hours to the minute.

131
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:38,457
Yesterday, I told you of our belief

132
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:43,144
in the existence of intelligent life
beyond our planet.

133
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:47,744
I also told you that we believe
several governments, including our own,

134
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:53,266
have known about this, and have been
concealing the information for some time.

135
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:57,626
Yesterday, I challenged
those governments to come clean,

136
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,097
reveal the truth.

137
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,302
We got only silence.

138
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:10,742
Which gives me no choice
but to present to you

139
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:14,218
what evidence I have.

140
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:20,101
How do I know for sure
that alien life really does exist?

141
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:24,897
Ladies and gentlemen,

142
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:27,661
seeing is believing.

143
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:57,262
I'd call that something.

144
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:06,938
The world is in a frenzy
after yesterday's startling revelation

145
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:11,897
of what appeared to be a live alien,
by billionaire industrialist Alec Colson.

146
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:14,866
Thus far, there's been
no statement from the White House

147
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:19,305
and sources inside Colson Industries
promised there is definitely more to come.

148
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,618
OK, thank you, Sergeant.

149
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:25,261
We just got a message back from Thor.

150
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:28,545
As far as he knows,
there are no Asgard currently on Earth.

151
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:33,418
Well, Loki was here for years
without the High Council knowing about it.

152
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:36,420
OK, here's a possibility.

153
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:39,739
What if it wasn't really an Asgard?

154
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:44,183
Looked like one. Didn't say anything.

155
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:48,147
That's my point. Colson wrapped
things up quickly without any questions.

156
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:50,458
It was a perfect likeness.

157
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:53,984
Imagery of little grey aliens
has been commonplace for years.

158
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:57,458
- Colson could have a picture.
- So not a real Asgard?

159
00:12:57,948 --> 00:13:01,099
No Asgard we know
would allow himself to be used that way.

160
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:03,702
It did look a little vacant.

161
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:08,987
Still, as much as he wants the truth, I don't
think he would perpetrate a hoax to get it.

162
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:13,664
- Then what was it?
- I don't know.

163
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:15,818
The networks want interviews.

164
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:18,866
- Too bad our friend can't talk.
- We know he's capable.

165
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:23,066
MRIs show a larynx similar to ours, but
he doesn't seem to have anything to say.

166
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:28,620
They also want independent personnel
to verify that it's really what we say it is.

167
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:32,747
How do we convince the world of alien
intelligence when he doesn't have any?

168
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:37,379
We can't just trot this out on television
with wild claims we can't back up.

169
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:42,098
Granted, it's an amazing experiment,
but we don't know it is really alien.

170
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,541
What else could it be?

171
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:46,700
All we know is the DNA
came from the Department of Defense.

172
00:13:46,788 --> 00:13:49,541
We're trying to build
a circumstantial case here.

173
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,780
The more questions we raise, the more
the burden of proof shifts to Washington.

174
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:58,498
Soon, they'll have to respond to public
pressure. Meanwhile, we stay quiet.

175
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,500
The media's going nuts over this thing,

176
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:06,378
so let's just sit tight
and see what happens.

177
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:15,505
Sam was right. There's something
different about Colson's Asgard.

178
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:22,300
Seems that a Colson company was given
a copy of Asgard DNA for sequencing.

179
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:27,462
- We tried to help their cloning problem.
- Colson grew a clone?

180
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:30,620
They weren't told it was alien DNA,

181
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,940
but they obviously took their research
further than the contract specified.

182
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:38,657
Asgard DNA is programmed to grow
a clone to maturity in three months,

183
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:42,661
but they're an empty shell until
an existing consciousness is transferred.

184
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:46,138
- It was not capable of speaking.
- Exactly.

185
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:50,426
They probably spent what time
they had with it teaching it how to walk.

186
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:55,263
Well... the Pentagon has lost all patience.

187
00:14:55,348 --> 00:14:58,579
- What are they gonna do?
- They want us to put a stop to it.

188
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:00,340
How?

189
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:03,704
We're calling in a marker.

190
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:13,023
Yep.

191
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:15,702
Calling in a marker.

192
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:22,463
Greetings.

193
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:27,058
Excuse me.

194
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:29,184
- It's gone.
- What do you mean?

195
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:33,898
Just disappeared right out of the lab.
The alien, computers, everything.

196
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:37,822
- How? What about security?
- Nobody took it. It disappeared.

197
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:41,298
We were standing there.
There was a flash of light and it was gone.

198
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:45,176
Have Ron send out the decoy car. Get
the plane ready for a trip to Washington.

199
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:48,066
Have it ready
by the time I get to the hangar.

200
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:52,583
- You ready?
- Not really.

201
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:55,705
Just try not to think about the camera.
Focus on me.

202
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,700
It's not that. I respect Alec Colson.

203
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:03,100
I don't like being asked to discredit a man
who has every right to want the truth.

204
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:05,383
- But you've been ordered to do this?
- Yeah.

205
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:09,620
If you want to go against those orders,
feel free. I'll go with it.

206
00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:15,899
In five, four, three, two...

207
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:22,101
We're here with Lieutenant Colonel
Samantha Carter of the US Air Force.

208
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,860
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

209
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:29,068
Your background is astrophysics. You're
a leading military scientific researcher.

210
00:16:29,148 --> 00:16:32,220
We're all eager to hear
some reaction from Washington

211
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:34,868
regarding the revelation
made by Alec Colson.

212
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:39,419
Well, first of all, I can assure people
that if aliens really existed

213
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:43,103
and were visiting the planet,
we would know about it.

214
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:48,865
Are you saying his claims have no merit?
We all saw an alien on live television.

215
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:53,464
Yes. Hollywood's been helping us
see things on TV for a long time now.

216
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:56,381
<i>Are you saying that the alien wasn't real?</i>

217
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:59,062
<i>It depends on what you mean by "real".</i>

218
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:01,457
Notice she hasn't actually lied once.

219
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:06,576
I can show you some advanced methods
for creating realistic 3-D images.

220
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:10,138
- By all means.
- We're experimenting with technology

221
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:15,905
that makes it possible for us to create
anything you can imagine, virtually.

222
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:26,224
<i>Wow. That looks just like</i>
<i>the alien Alec Colson introduced to us.</i>

223
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:28,583
<i>Greetings, people of Earth.</i>

224
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:33,418
- That's amazing. He looks so real.
- Though I look real,

225
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:39,424
I have been created through the use
of advanced holographic technology.

226
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:43,986
That's just incredible.

227
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:51,104
It's just a projection. You'll probably see
this in theme-park rides in a few years.

228
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:54,258
She's good.

229
00:17:57,508 --> 00:18:01,103
Not the exclusive I had in mind,
but it will still do huge numbers.

230
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:05,067
You're hilarious. After everything,
you still care about ratings.

231
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:07,264
How did you do it?

232
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:11,864
I've seen visual effects before, Sam.
This was some sort of...

233
00:18:11,948 --> 00:18:15,827
This was some sort of alien technology,
wasn't it?

234
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:23,103
- What is it?
- "Ten minutes ago,

235
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:26,464
Alec Colson's plane
was forced into an emergency landing

236
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:29,187
after almost crashing
on takeoff from Sea-Tac."

237
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:32,658
"Plane suffered depressurisation
and loss of engine power,

238
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:34,978
but landed without serious incident."

239
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:39,346
We've gotta go to the air with this. I need
something on Colson's wife and daughter.

240
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:44,138
They died in a plane crash when he was
24. That's why he started Colson Aviation.

241
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:46,617
Let's go.

242
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:51,261
- Carter.
- Sam, it's Alec Colson.

243
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:57,500
- Are you OK?
- <i>News travels fast.</i>

244
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:01,345
It was close.
Brian's still as white as a sheet.

245
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:05,385
- How did you get this number?
- <i>I have my sources.</i>

246
00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:09,381
The ground crew here found evidence
the plane had been tampered with.

247
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:13,461
- Someone tried to kill you?
- Seems that way. Any ideas?

248
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:16,339
You think I know?

249
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:20,137
Why would I publicly discredit you
if I knew you would be assassinated?

250
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:23,425
To make it look like Washington
had nothing to do with it.

251
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:26,181
<i>A fine job you did too, by the way.</i>

252
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:29,021
- I'm sorry. I was following orders.
- I know.

253
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:32,987
Don't worry, Sam. I don't believe
for a second you were in on it.

254
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:36,504
If it was our government,
I'm sure you were just a pawn.

255
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:40,422
That doesn't make me feel any better.
Look, Alec, I can assure you...

256
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:45,059
It's OK. It wasn't my first rough landing.
I'm sure it won't be my last.

257
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:49,699
I won't be stopped, Sam.
I promise you, one way or another,

258
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:53,098
the world is gonna learn the truth.

259
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:03,582
How about a hyperdrive
for the <i>Prometheus?</i>

260
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:07,024
That is something I must discuss
with the High Council.

261
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:13,058
Thor, come on, you said you wanted
to get something nice for the president.

262
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:18,105
Carter?

263
00:20:18,188 --> 00:20:22,818
- Sir, anything on who tried to kill Colson?
- It wasn't us.

264
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:26,696
Colson may have fragments of
downed Goa'uld ships from the Antarctic.

265
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:29,860
A subsidiary of his was
involved in the salvage and cleanup.

266
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:33,020
Are we just gonna keep
trying to discredit the man?

267
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:38,501
Aren't we the ones delusional to think
we could cover up an attack of this scale?

268
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:42,979
- What's the alternative?
- How about tell the truth?

269
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:48,776
I mean to Colson. I know he's been
profiled and deemed a security risk.

270
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:54,022
Obviously, that's an accurate assessment,
but what have we got to lose at this point?

271
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:59,136
He's trying to go public. Let's show him
why it's so important to keep the secret.

272
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:05,224
Besides, think of the benefits of having
a man with his resources on our side.

273
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:11,143
Well, Thor and I are meeting with the
president in five minutes. I'll bring it up.

274
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,184
Five minutes?

275
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:14,621
Oh, yeah.

276
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:21,466
Right.

277
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:27,218
Two o'clock, we go live.

278
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:31,586
With the pictures, pieces of the alien ship,
everything we've got.

279
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:33,579
They tried to kill us.

280
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:36,742
You think that didn't work in our favour?

281
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,626
Dying doesn't work in our favour!

282
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,425
OK, what just happened?

283
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:56,581
In layman's terms, we beamed you up.
And then down again.

284
00:21:56,668 --> 00:22:00,707
- Where am I?
- Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colorado.

285
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:03,700
- You know Daniel, of course.
- Yeah. Hi.

286
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:07,337
- And this is Thor.
- Greetings.

287
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,545
- So this is a real one?
- Yep.

288
00:22:11,628 --> 00:22:13,380
What happened to the clone?

289
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:18,223
It will become a host to an Asgard
consciousness whose body is failing.

290
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:21,066
OK.

291
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:27,257
Now I must take my leave. General O'Neill
said he will see you all tomorrow.

292
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:33,536
What...

293
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:36,426
I want to show you something.

294
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,062
We call it a Stargate.

295
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:58,663
I'm OK, Brian. I promise you, I'm fine.
I'll be back in a couple of days.

296
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:02,377
I gotta go. All right, bye.

297
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:05,266
- Ready?
- Whoa. Look at you.

298
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,703
Yeah. Soldier Sam.

299
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,541
- I get a uniform too?
- Yep.

300
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:15,184
All right.

301
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:40,146
So where are we going?

302
00:23:40,228 --> 00:23:43,743
P4X-650. We have a base there.

303
00:23:43,828 --> 00:23:47,821
- And how far away is that?
- 640 light years.

304
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:51,666
- Really?
- Let's go.

305
00:24:05,948 --> 00:24:09,657
- Didn't feel a thing.
- You were demolecularised.

306
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:16,662
- Welcome to the Alpha site.
- Alec Colson. Captain Shefield.

307
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:21,106
Well, it's... nice.

308
00:24:21,188 --> 00:24:23,656
Our last Alpha site
was destroyed in an attack.

309
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:27,058
We decided to build this one
inside a mountain like the SGC.

310
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:30,902
Conditions are a bit Spartan,
but it's our home away from home.

311
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:34,219
I guess I was just expecting
something a little more...

312
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:37,106
I don't know, otherworldly.

313
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:49,741
Now, that... that's more like it.

314
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:54,583
It's called the F-302. Alien-human hybrid.

315
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:58,982
So this is what the MECs were for.

316
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:03,300
Yeah, thanks to you, it's capable
of leaving the atmosphere and returning.

317
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:06,221
We used a number of these
to defend Earth five months ago.

318
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:12,747
It's one of the advancements made with
technology procured through the Stargate.

319
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:15,626
You wanna take a ride?

320
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:33,264
- Brian, what are you doing?
- Alec wants all the evidence we have

321
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:37,182
about the alien cover-up
duplicated and secured off premises.

322
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:40,305
You can start on
what we have left on the clone research.

323
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:42,185
OK.

324
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:57,143
Vogler.

325
00:25:57,228 --> 00:26:00,106
I told you, I don't know where he is.

326
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:04,904
I have a meeting
with the SEC this afternoon.

327
00:26:04,988 --> 00:26:06,979
I understand.

328
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:10,302
Don't worry.

329
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:12,379
It'll work.

330
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:32,506
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

331
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:37,025
Must be hard keeping all this secret.
I don't know how you do it.

332
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:40,942
I think of all the fear it would cause.
The potential chaos.

333
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:44,145
What about the greater meaning
you could bring to people?

334
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,300
Just knowing that all this is out here.

335
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:51,142
What's out here
is an enemy so advanced, so evil,

336
00:26:51,228 --> 00:26:54,618
it's a miracle we haven't
been wiped out or enslaved yet.

337
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,858
We've been very lucky so far.

338
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,861
I think people would have a hard time
living with the threat of impending doom.

339
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:04,304
All right,
the old "if you had cancer" argument.

340
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:09,143
Would you want to know you were gonna
die, or live your final days in ignorance?

341
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:12,265
Yeah. I guess I don't really buy it either.

342
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:15,181
I'd rather know. Try to cure it.

343
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:21,787
If I couldn't do that, then I'd try to make
my final days as meaningful as possible.

344
00:27:21,868 --> 00:27:24,621
You want a turn?

345
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:27,222
I thought I was gonna have to ask.

346
00:27:27,308 --> 00:27:32,257
Switching to copilot control.
Go ahead, she's all yours.

347
00:27:39,148 --> 00:27:41,787
- So what do you think?
- Amazing.

348
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:46,623
She manoeuvres like an F/A-22
and feels like a 7 47.

349
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:51,657
- That's the inertial dampeners.
- All right, let's try this.

350
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:02,704
Alec.

351
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:05,578
Alec, pull up.

352
00:28:18,868 --> 00:28:21,826
<i>Flight, this is Alpha command.</i>
<i>Is everything OK?</i>

353
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:25,503
It is now. We're fine. Bringing her back in.

354
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:50,300
- That was reckless.
- The 302 can handle it.

355
00:28:50,388 --> 00:28:55,781
I know. I may not have known its name,
but I helped you build it, remember?

356
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:59,861
It was a joyride.
I took you up for a little fun.

357
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:04,576
This isn't a game, Sam.
What you guys are doing up here.

358
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:08,377
- This is life and death for all of us.
- We know that.

359
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:12,424
Wasn't much fun
feeling out of control like that, was it?

360
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:15,068
You don't have
to make your point with my life.

361
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:20,097
Come on, we were never going to crash.
Unlike my plane back on Earth.

362
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:23,621
I told you, we had nothing to do with it.

363
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,539
Well, someone did.

364
00:29:25,628 --> 00:29:29,701
And if you think that, or any of this,

365
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:34,179
is gonna prevent me from telling the world
what they have a right to know,

366
00:29:34,268 --> 00:29:36,657
you're dead wrong.

367
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:48,983
Alec, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

368
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:51,741
A clandestine group
of private businessmen

369
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:56,583
were informed of this programme over six
years ago by rogue elements of the NID.

370
00:29:56,668 --> 00:30:00,456
We've tried to identify them and bring
them down, but they're highly connected.

371
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,585
Former vice president Kinsey's
been linked to them.

372
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:08,264
Instead of going public like you, they've
been funding various secret endeavours

373
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,704
aimed at controlling alien technology
for their own purposes.

374
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:15,098
- Which are?
- You'd have to ask them.

375
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:20,546
Personal profit. Maybe they think they can
do better of defending the planet than us.

376
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:23,142
Why are you telling me all this?

377
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:27,187
Because I'm guessing
that's who tried to kill you.

378
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:32,262
They'll never get control of the gate
if the world finds out.

379
00:30:33,468 --> 00:30:37,347
When I was young,
all I ever dreamed about was flying.

380
00:30:37,428 --> 00:30:42,707
I had every make of aeroplane ever built
hanging from my ceiling.

381
00:30:42,788 --> 00:30:44,380
And then...

382
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,540
I take it you know
about my wife and daughter?

383
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:52,179
One of the downsides of celebrity.
We really do have no secrets.

384
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:57,501
Anyway, after the crash, I vowed to make
flying as safe as it possibly could be.

385
00:30:57,588 --> 00:31:02,901
- I thought I could do it better than anyone.
- But you have made a difference.

386
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:06,378
- But nothing's perfect, is it?
- No.

387
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:11,536
Intergalactic travel.
Advanced alien civilisations.

388
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:14,222
Humans living on other worlds.

389
00:31:15,468 --> 00:31:20,940
- I do realise there may be bad guys too.
- You have no idea how bad.

390
00:31:21,028 --> 00:31:25,704
But, in the end,
we have to believe in humanity.

391
00:31:25,788 --> 00:31:30,020
I mean, who knows? This might
bring us all together as a planet.

392
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:33,384
If we knew it would
play out that way, then...

393
00:31:34,188 --> 00:31:38,147
You're afraid that knowing about this
would fracture the world even more.

394
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:42,824
Yeah. Not just stop us fighting
the Goa'uld, but end things for good.

395
00:31:42,908 --> 00:31:45,138
We've seen it happen on other planets.

396
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:49,858
In one case, public revelation of the
Stargate caused apocalyptic world war.

397
00:31:49,948 --> 00:31:52,746
That would be the ultimate irony,
wouldn't it?

398
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:56,264
You save the world from destruction
at the hands of aliens,

399
00:31:56,348 --> 00:32:01,627
only for us to destroy ourselves
out of fear. After the fact.

400
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:04,942
Change your mind?

401
00:32:05,028 --> 00:32:07,622
Not really.

402
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,187
I don't think it would happen.

403
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:15,466
And if a truth of this magnitude,

404
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:21,623
about the very nature of human existence,
could lead us to destroy ourselves,

405
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:25,860
then I'd say we would deserve it,
wouldn't you?

406
00:32:29,668 --> 00:32:32,899
<i>Investigators now believe</i>
<i>Alec Colson created the alien hoax</i>

407
00:32:32,988 --> 00:32:36,776
<i>in order to divert attention from</i>
<i>his real corporate financial problems.</i>

408
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:40,144
<i>Colson, who has still</i>
<i>made no public statement...</i>

409
00:32:40,228 --> 00:32:44,301
Corporate financial problems?
What's she talking about?

410
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:49,619
The story broke about an hour ago. The
president's halted trading on the markets.

411
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:55,146
Your company's stock had fallen 80%,
the Dow was down over 500 points.

412
00:32:55,228 --> 00:32:59,585
- What's going on?
- The SEC is investigating you for fraud.

413
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:04,380
- That's ridiculous.
- They say there were irregularities

414
00:33:04,468 --> 00:33:07,107
in your company's
last two financial statements.

415
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:10,305
Why, it's not true.

416
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,856
Come on.

417
00:33:12,948 --> 00:33:15,542
The timing of this.

418
00:33:17,468 --> 00:33:19,504
I'm being set up.

419
00:33:34,508 --> 00:33:37,068
What's she doing here?

420
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,298
She wants to help, Brian.

421
00:33:39,388 --> 00:33:44,508
Good. Does she have a time machine
so we can go back and undo everything?

422
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:46,180
Brian...

423
00:33:46,268 --> 00:33:48,862
Brian, what's going on?

424
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:54,465
You wouldn't listen. You wouldn't stop.

425
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:57,142
So you admit you did this?

426
00:33:58,228 --> 00:34:02,460
You go off on your adventures.
You fly your planes.

427
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:06,063
You drop by every now and then
with a bright idea.

428
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:12,905
Ever since we were kids, you're always
biting off more than you can chew.

429
00:34:12,988 --> 00:34:15,741
And I'm always having to bail you out.

430
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:18,661
So you doctored the books?

431
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:23,139
I had to. I had to do something. I told you.

432
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:27,938
We were overextended. The stock price
was the only thing keeping us afloat.

433
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:30,098
You wouldn't listen.

434
00:34:30,188 --> 00:34:32,622
No. I don't believe this.

435
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:35,586
Alec, who do you think told the SEC?

436
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:40,583
Why? Why now? What difference
could it make once the truth came out?

437
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:43,819
Alec, I almost died in that plane too.

438
00:34:44,788 --> 00:34:49,100
- I still have a family. They tried to kill us.
- Who?

439
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:52,180
Did you think they would
let you tell a secret like this?

440
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:57,058
- What are you talking...
- They call themselves the Trust!

441
00:35:00,908 --> 00:35:04,503
All I know is they're very powerful.

442
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:09,786
And they think that Washington
abdicated its duty to protect the planet.

443
00:35:09,868 --> 00:35:15,864
Maybe even caused the problem. They
see it as their responsibility to step in.

444
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:20,378
We can fix this.

445
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:23,904
It's too late. It's done. It can't be undone.

446
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,786
Brian, we'll both go to jail.

447
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:30,019
Yeah, but my family will be safe.

448
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:34,704
What about the people that work for
this company? What about their families?

449
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:39,066
Why weren't you thinking
about them three days ago?

450
00:35:40,828 --> 00:35:46,425
How did the people who threatened you
know that you'd cooked the books?

451
00:35:46,508 --> 00:35:51,980
How did they know that there would
be enough to indict both you and Alec?

452
00:35:58,148 --> 00:36:00,582
They got to you six months ago.

453
00:36:02,028 --> 00:36:05,907
Alec, they knew what you had.
Don't ask me how.

454
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:12,098
They had to make sure
they could stop you.

455
00:36:13,108 --> 00:36:16,180
You were wrong, Alec.

456
00:36:17,388 --> 00:36:19,379
True or not,

457
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,982
this shouldn't come out.

458
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:30,222
The world's not ready.

459
00:36:32,748 --> 00:36:36,536
- There must be something we can do.
- You signed false statements.

460
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:40,143
I mean about the people
who tried to kill us.

461
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:44,699
All I know is they operate above the law
and they've threatened people before.

462
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,497
- Then we have to bring them down.
- We've tried, believe me.

463
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:50,738
Well, we have to try again.

464
00:36:57,268 --> 00:37:01,500
Colson's convinced Vogler to arrange a
meeting with his contact and wear a wire.

465
00:37:01,588 --> 00:37:05,547
Hopefully, we'll connect him to the rogue
NID and flip him for someone bigger.

466
00:37:05,628 --> 00:37:07,823
We're coordinating with Agent Barrett.

467
00:37:07,908 --> 00:37:10,706
At the least,
it may restore Colson's public image.

468
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:16,385
Especially if someone in competition with
Colson Industries was pulling the strings.

469
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:19,266
Unfortunately, without further evidence,

470
00:37:19,348 --> 00:37:24,183
Brian Vogler's word alone isn't gonna be
enough to undo the damage already done.

471
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:27,578
- What of Brian Vogler's safety?
- He's under surveillance.

472
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:30,785
His family's been taken
into protective custody.

473
00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:32,620
Well...

474
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,142
I guess the secret is safe. Again.

475
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:37,184
For now.

476
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:40,897
O'Neill.

477
00:37:40,988 --> 00:37:43,707
I wouldn't count Colson out just yet.

478
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:47,542
He still feels really strongly
that the world should know the truth.

479
00:37:47,628 --> 00:37:50,426
All right. Thank you.

480
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:58,537
Surveillance just found Brian Vogler
dead in his bathroom.

481
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,628
What? How?

482
00:38:02,508 --> 00:38:05,306
He hanged himself.

483
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:30,903
Alec.

484
00:38:42,828 --> 00:38:46,218
- I'm so sorry about Brian.
- I killed him.

485
00:38:47,268 --> 00:38:51,147
Might as well have put the gun against
his head and pulled the trigger myself.

486
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,300
You couldn't have known.

487
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:57,425
You saw how scared he was.

488
00:38:57,508 --> 00:39:00,466
I know what his family meant to him.

489
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:04,382
He was never gonna do anything
to put them in any danger.

490
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:05,583
Alec...

491
00:39:05,668 --> 00:39:08,740
He was my best friend.

492
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:12,297
- He betrayed you.
- No.

493
00:39:12,388 --> 00:39:14,777
I betrayed him.

494
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:19,380
Why don't you put the gun down?

495
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:26,827
My life's over, Sam.

496
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:30,901
Everything I worked for,
everything I believed in, held to be true...

497
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:36,540
Still exists. Apparently Congress
is looking into providing relief.

498
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:38,858
The companies,
the employees will survive.

499
00:39:38,948 --> 00:39:42,543
While I go to jail for something I didn't do?

500
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:46,018
Back on the Alpha site,
you said no matter what,

501
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:50,226
you would rather make
whatever time you had left meaningful.

502
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:53,744
- I'm here to give you that chance.
- How?

503
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:58,740
By making all the indictments
against me just disappear?

504
00:39:58,828 --> 00:40:02,741
I was thinking more along the lines
of making <i>you</i> disappear.

505
00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:08,027
Problem with a guy like me...
no place on earth I can hide.

506
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:10,906
Who's talking about Earth?

507
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,626
No, no. No, I couldn't let you do that.

508
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:21,463
Believe me, I wouldn't be here
without the approval of my superiors.

509
00:40:21,548 --> 00:40:27,180
The president wasn't responsible, but he's
not sorry you were publicly discredited.

510
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:35,147
Please, Alec, come with me.
You can still make a difference.

511
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:39,780
He who fights and runs away...

512
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:53,541
Lives to fight another day.

513
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:03,145
And no one will ever know.

514
00:41:04,148 --> 00:41:06,742
Welcome to my world.

515
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:24,466
