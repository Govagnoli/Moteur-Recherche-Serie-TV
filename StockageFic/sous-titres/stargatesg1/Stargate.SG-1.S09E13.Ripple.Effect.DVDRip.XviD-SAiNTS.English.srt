1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,412
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation!</i>

2
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,742
What the hell was that?

3
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,421
I don't know, Sir.

4
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,372
We're receiving SG-1's IDC.

5
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:26,260
They're back early.
Open the iris.

6
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:42,258
There was nothing on your end?

7
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:45,203
Nothing out of the ordinary
to account for what we heard?

8
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:48,548
No Sir, it was perfectly routine,
we just dialed the Gate and stepped through.

9
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:50,894
<i>Gate diagnostics showed no irregularities.</i>

10
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:53,770
Still I'd like you to
double check the data once we're done here.

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,990
Yes, Sir.

12
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:56,923
Tell me about the planet...

13
00:00:56,933 --> 00:01:01,854
Well we can confirm that the locals were
visited by a Prior two weeks ago. He performed the...

14
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:05,090
standard miracles,
healed the sick, cured the blind and...

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,951
passed out the usual literature.

16
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:11,130
The natives are easy pickings they feel as though
they were abandoned by their God Amaterasu and...

17
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,391
Ba'al.

18
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,628
- Excuse me?
- You said Amaterasu...

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,766
According to the background file,
P4R was once under Ba'al's control...

20
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,392
P4R?

21
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:23,486
Sir...

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,324
we went to PX7-455,
I believe you have the wrong report.

23
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:29,593
Anyway.

24
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:33,804
The Tok'ra have been monitoring the inroads that the
Ori have been making in the region for quite some time.

25
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:36,733
According to Selmak they are taking
advantage of the relationships between...

26
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:39,069
Did you just say Selmak?

27
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:40,911
Indeed.

28
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:43,757
Teal'c... Selmak is dead.

29
00:01:47,077 --> 00:01:48,120
Sir...

30
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:51,232
Selmak and Jacob are very much alive.

31
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:53,984
<i>Offworld activation!</i>

32
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:03,478
- Chief...
- It's SG-1's IDC, Sir.

33
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:06,262
This is when
they were originally scheduled to come back.

34
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:08,274
Defense teams stand by.

35
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,829
Open the iris.

36
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:44,022
Season 9 - Episode 13
Ripple Effect

37
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:43,605
Well, according to the tests
I've run, they're both SG-1.

38
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:46,249
- Identical in every way.
- How's that possible?

39
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:52,236
Well, we know Ba'al's able
to produce adult clones of himself. Presumably he could
do the same with our people given samples of their DNA.

40
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:55,348
That doesn't explain how they knew SG-1's IDC.

41
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:59,339
And if their Intel was good enough
to get their hands on something that sensitive,

42
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,615
- then how come they didn't know about Selmak?
- Yeah.

43
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:03,810
It's like they got
the hard stuff right and the easy stuff wrong.

44
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,446
Ba'al would have known better.

45
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:10,315
You know the first team was making
some pretty wild claims about people in past events.

46
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:15,703
And since the second team came back
from the right planet at the scheduled time,

47
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:19,893
- it's safe to assume that they're the real SG-1.
- Okay.

48
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,647
Then who's the other team
and where'd they come from?

49
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:24,123
Exactly.

50
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:31,667
We checked their story out, we went to PX7-445,
the planet they claimed to have gated in from
the locals there swore they'd never laid eyes on us.

51
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:32,824
So...

52
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:34,261
this other team...

53
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,498
is lying.

54
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:36,974
<i>Not necessarily Sir.</i>

55
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:41,604
It's possible they did gate in from PX7...
just not the PX7 that we know.

56
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:45,835
The multiverse theory of quantum physics
deposits the existence of parallel universes.

57
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:50,264
An infinite number of ever growing alternate realities
that exist concurrently with our own.

58
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:53,098
The theory holds
that anything that can happen, will happen.

59
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:55,213
<i>If not in this reality, then in another.</i>

60
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,845
So you're saying
that somewhere in an alternate universe,

61
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:01,779
I got to second base with Amy Pandenberg?

62
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:05,192
Theoretically, yes.

63
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:07,885
Boggles the mind, doesn't it?

64
00:05:08,703 --> 00:05:13,333
We're part of a metaverse in which individual
subuniverses are continually being generated.

65
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:16,405
<i>Our own experience
with the quantum mirror proved as much.</i>

66
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,957
Realities can exist where...
we never defeated the Goa'uld or,

67
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:23,530
- the Stargate program went public.
- And Selmak is still alive.

68
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,946
Exactly.

69
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:25,864
Now,

70
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:29,775
while it may feel immediate,
the journey between Gates is not instantaneous.

71
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:33,827
<i>It takes on average 0.3 seconds travel time.
However,</i>

72
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:39,294
according to Gate diagnostics, the travel time
for the other SG-1 team clocked in at 3.4 seconds,

73
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:41,330
suggesting a significantly longer trip.

74
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,637
OK, say for example we accept...
the possibility that this is an alternate SG-1 from a...

75
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:48,593
parallel universe.

76
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,868
How did they get here?

77
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:57,333
I got nothing.

78
00:05:58,212 --> 00:05:59,409
Yet.

79
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:05,755
Sumatra Mandheling.

80
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:08,309
One cream.
Two sugars.

81
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:12,300
Lucky guess.

82
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,054
Usually I have instant myself.

83
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:21,080
So, I'm guessing
this almost feels like home, doesn't it?

84
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,796
Almost like home.

85
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:24,033
But...

86
00:06:24,073 --> 00:06:25,669
if it was home,

87
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:30,379
I'd be sitting where
your sitting and you'd be sitting here, telling me:

88
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:35,328
"I'd love to help you
but I have no idea what's going on."

89
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:38,840
I'm thinking one of two possible scenarios.

90
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,075
(A) Carter's right and you're from an

91
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:45,624
alternate universe in which case
we'll do everything we can to get you back home.

92
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:49,855
Or
(B) You're not who you say you are.

93
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:54,086
In which case we need
to find out what you're really after.

94
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,757
Actually there's a third scenario.

95
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,274
(C)

96
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:02,267
You're not who you say you are,

97
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:05,899
and it's up to us to find out what you're after.

98
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:19,109
I understand your reluctance to trust us,
but rest assured we're just as eager
to get to the bottom of this as you are.

99
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:23,061
No offence but,
I'm not entirely sold on the alternate world theory.

100
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,582
There was nothing on our mission
to PX7 that would even hint at it.

101
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:30,823
No quantum mirror,
no weird alien artifacts. It was a routine op.

102
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:32,060
But...

103
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,574
you're telling me that, somehow,

104
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:38,526
the Gate sent us through to a parallel universe.
Even though we know it's not supposed to work like that.

105
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:40,361
And yet here you are.

106
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:43,194
Assuming of course this is the SGC.

107
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:44,472
<i>SG-1...</i>

108
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:45,869
six years ago.

109
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,224
Wake up in what they think is the SGC, turns out

110
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:52,633
they're not really on Earth
and it's all part of an elaborate Goa'uld plot.

111
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,308
Pegasus Galaxy,

112
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:56,704
last year.

113
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:58,779
A team from the Atlantis base...

114
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,609
gates through to what they think is the SGC,
turns out they're not really on Earth.

115
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,245
It's another planet...

116
00:08:05,804 --> 00:08:08,718
- and they're being manipulated by aliens.
- Let me put your mind at ease,

117
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:13,707
we are neither the Goa'uld
nor manipulative aliens.

118
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:16,779
You'll forgive me Sir
if I don't take your word for it.

119
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,533
We won our freedom in the battle for Dakara.

120
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:23,324
And on that day not only did we defeat
Ba'al and the replicators, you ensured

121
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:25,979
that Anubis would never again threaten this Galaxy.

122
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:28,493
<i>And then all Jaffa were united
under our new leader</i>

123
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:29,451
Bra'tac.

124
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,087
Bra'tac?

125
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,243
Really?

126
00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:35,238
That, that that hasn't happened here yet.

127
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:38,351
And with the new threat to
this galaxy I returned to SG-1.

128
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:41,544
Right, along with colonel Mitchell
myself, and eventually colonel Carter.

129
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:44,099
- Who rejoined following her...
- Following her honeymoon.

130
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:46,213
What?

131
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,205
No. I was gonna say following
her stay on the Prometheus.

132
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:51,801
Honeymoon?

133
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:53,257
Indeed.

134
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,735
We weren't able to stop the Ori from
establishing the second beachhead.

135
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:11,257
By the time we realized it was too late
they had already sent their ships through.

136
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:13,173
If it happened in our reality...

137
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:15,447
There's a good chance
it could happen in ours as well.

138
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,874
They destroyed Chulak,

139
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:21,394
Dakara, most of the Jaffa strongholds.
It's only a matter of time before they attack Earth.

140
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:23,868
- You have to find a way to get us back.
- I'm working on it.

141
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:26,024
- I've been going over the Gate diagnostics.
- And?

142
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:29,615
There was an unidentifiable energy
spike just prior to your arrival.

143
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:33,446
It's almost certainly related to the sound
they heard, but I'm still analyzing the data.

144
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:37,158
We were on PX7
for over 24 hours gathering intel.

145
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:40,551
And yet when your team went back
to the planet no one recognized you.

146
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,622
Now, that suggests that our point of
departure was definitely in our universe.

147
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:45,898
So what ever happened...

148
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:48,792
Had to have happened between the time
you stepped through the Gate on your end,

149
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:51,147
and the time you stepped
through the Gate on this end.

150
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:54,499
Except the Gate system isn't designed
to transport matter between universes.

151
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:57,892
It isn't designed to take you back
in time either but it has before.

152
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,548
Did you notice any...

153
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:03,479
No unusual weather patterns or
solar flare activity at the time.

154
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:06,851
Then is it conceivable something
else could have affected the wormhole.

155
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:11,501
What could possibly exert that kind of
influence on a subspace matter stream?

156
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,417
- A black hole!
- A black hole!

157
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:21,199
As we discussed the situation
we realized we could pinpoint the source
of the phenomenon to a precise window.

158
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:24,153
Specifically the in term journey
between the two Gates.

159
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:25,669
Did she just say we?

160
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:26,547
Pardon me?

161
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:28,104
She said we.
You said we?

162
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,299
Ah, me and

163
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:33,491
myself, I suppose.
The other Samantha Carter.

164
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:36,046
Right finally someone who can keep up with you?

165
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:37,443
Yep.

166
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:41,872
OK, this is PX7-455, their point of departure

167
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:44,447
and this, is Earth their point of arrival.

168
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:49,116
The wormhole that brought them here,
cross this section of space bisecting this singularity.

169
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:51,750
The black hole that was created
when we destroyed the Ori beachhead.

170
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,867
Exactly.

171
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:57,407
Now, I'm theorizing that when they bisected
the singularity subspace was ruptured,

172
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:01,967
creating a rift in the space-time continuum
that brought that SG-1 in to this universe.

173
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:06,237
But we've had teams gate in from locations on
the other side of that black hole in our universe.

174
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:07,594
Why weren't they affected?

175
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:10,138
One more stupid question.

176
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:13,381
Oh, sorry. Yours was fine, mine is stupid.

177
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,330
Why didn't we end up on alternate PX7 when we
gated through to check out bizarre SG-1's story?

178
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,168
I can't answer that...

179
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:23,957
As far as I know the deviation was one way
and specific to that particular wormhole.

180
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:29,904
However just to be on the safe side
I would suggest that we reroute all Gate travel
around the singularity for the time being.

181
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:32,618
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

182
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:41,079
- What do you have for me now Walter?
- Sir, It's SG-1's IDC.

183
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:42,277
Again.

184
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:44,102
Do you want me to send a confirmation?

185
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:47,105
If another team comes through they'll
just be stranded like the first one.

186
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:49,500
- Receiving radio transmission.
- Let's hear it.

187
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:53,970
<i>Stargate Command, this is Mitchell.
What's the hold up? We've got a situation here.</i>

188
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,286
Sir if we don't open the iris...

189
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:57,842
<i>Stargate Command do you read?</i>

190
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,917
Defense teams!

191
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:04,486
Open the iris.

192
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,107
What the hell's going on?

193
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,967
So much for this phenomenon
being restricted to one wormhole.

194
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:41,192
I may have underestimated its influence.

195
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:45,671
It's possible the first spatial tear may have
caused a ripple effect across several realities,

196
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:48,465
transforming an area of their
subspace into a kind of...

197
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:51,698
funnel, that's redirecting their
Gate travel to this universe.

198
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:56,089
Any wormhole passing close enough to the black
hole is being drawn into the singularity and

199
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:57,335
rerouted here.

200
00:12:57,345 --> 00:13:00,498
- So you're telling me we're the hub.
- The convergence point, yes Sir.

201
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,771
It might account for why Gate travel
in this universe wasn't affected.

202
00:13:03,811 --> 00:13:05,367
Might account. Colonel Mitchell.

203
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,135
Sir.

204
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:08,940
Inform all off world teams
to proceed to the Alpha site.

205
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,391
Until further notice Gate travel
to and from Stargate Command,

206
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:14,147
will be suspended, indefinitely.

207
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:17,819
- What if there are more teams coming in hot, Sir?
- I'm willing to make the occasional exception

208
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:22,719
but I'm not about to turn this base into
the grand central station of the Multiverse.

209
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:24,205
Dismissed.

210
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:34,502
Why is it that every team that has come through the
Gate so far, has been exclusively an alternate SG-1?

211
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:38,054
I mean, how come no alternate
SG-2s or SG-3s?

212
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:42,084
Well, SG-1 is the frontline team, the one
most likely to get into trouble offworld.

213
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,878
And as a result the team we'd
most likely have to let through.

214
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:45,517
Right.

215
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:49,428
So far we've had to turn back over
50 teams and not all of them have been SG-1.

216
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:51,782
Here's the really interesting part. Each team,

217
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:56,233
from each reality has dialed in from a
different point of origin. No repeats.

218
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:59,445
All originating from a corridor
of space starting from Earth

219
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:01,780
<i>and passing within a few degrees of the singularity.</i>

220
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,093
What about that superfluous energy signature?

221
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:08,964
- Has that happened again?
- No. Not since the first alternate team dialed in.

222
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:10,680
Any idea what it was?

223
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,116
I'm not sure.

224
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:14,911
- But it reminds me of the incident on...
- K'Tau.

225
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:20,937
In that case we introduced an unstable super
heavy element into their sun's nuclear reaction...

226
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:23,571
When the wormhole that brought
us there passed directly through it.

227
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,564
But in this case
the wormhole's passing through a black hole.

228
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:29,158
So who knows what the effect would be.

229
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:32,192
I thought we could use the help.

230
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:37,300
Yeah, I suppose two heads are better than one.

231
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,173
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

232
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,807
Let's get to work.

233
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:51,189
General.

234
00:14:52,106 --> 00:14:54,382
I was just about to come find you.

235
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:57,614
<i>I have contacted Bra'tac on Dakara.</i>

236
00:14:57,754 --> 00:15:02,104
<i>He has dispatched a mothership to the
location provided to us by the other colonel Carter.</i>

237
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:06,294
<i>If the Ori attempt to establish a second
beachhead then the Jaffa should give us a heads up.</i>

238
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:09,528
Presuming of course if events play out
the same way in both universes...

239
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,718
To this point, the particulars of the varying
universes have remained remarkably similar.

240
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:16,152
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

241
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:21,870
Another SG-1 came through twenty minutes ago.
Which puts the count at twelve teams.
Not including yourselves.

242
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,871
- Well, at least we're in good company.
- Well, this last team is a little different
in terms of personnel.

243
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,208
How so?

244
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:30,560
Well, there's someone
I thought you might like to talk to.

245
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,697
Daniel?

246
00:15:40,976 --> 00:15:43,091
Teal'c? Where's General O'Neill?

247
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:47,202
I'm sure you all have a lot to catch up on.

248
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,466
Janet...

249
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:57,699
Dr. Frasier...

250
00:15:58,537 --> 00:16:00,332
What's going on here?

251
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,443
Janet, this, this may look like
home to you, but it's not.

252
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:08,075
This is not the Stargate Command you left,
we're not the Daniel and Teal'c you know.

253
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:10,868
You and your team gated to a parallel reality,

254
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:15,299
this is an alternate SGC,
on an alternate Earth, in an alternate universe.

255
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,012
In our reality Dr. Janet Frasier died...

256
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:19,649
2 years ago.

257
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:22,802
Sixteen

258
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:24,478
different SG-1s.

259
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:28,908
Sixteen different points of origin,
but only one point of convergence, this universe.

260
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:29,626
Now...

261
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:33,937
given the fact that previous trips
through the black hole didn't produce
a rupture in the subspace structure...

262
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:37,060
They may not have of produced
the rupture but it is entirely possible,

263
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,260
that their repeated trips contributed
to the deterioration of the space time fabric that

264
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,014
weakened,
eventually seeded to the singularity.

265
00:16:44,054 --> 00:16:46,009
Creating the bridge between the various realities.

266
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:51,318
And I'm thinking that the proximity of
these realities in relation to each other,
may account for the absence of the...

267
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:53,613
entropic cascade failure. But...

268
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:57,364
it still doesn't help us with the main problem.
How do we reverse the process?

269
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:59,081
I don't have the answer to this.

270
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,036
Because if I did...

271
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:03,909
We all wouldn't be here.

272
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:05,107
- Coffee?
- No.

273
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:06,464
Thank you.

274
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:13,049
You know, I can't help but think this whole thing
would be a lot easier if Hammond hadn't ordered us
to destroy the quantum mirror.

275
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:17,319
We could just use that to send all
these teams back to their proper realities.

276
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,556
How?

277
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:22,348
I mean,
there are a near infinite number of parallel universes.

278
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:26,977
The chances of us finding the right home universe
for even one of these teams is next to impossible.

279
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:29,372
Excuse me, Colonel Carter.

280
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:32,405
My,

281
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:34,041
colonel Carter...

282
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,356
Here Sir...

283
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:40,347
I've brought another volunteer who's offered to help.

284
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,083
Martouf.

285
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,755
Hello Samantha.

286
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:03,136
I remember the mission to P3X.

287
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:06,049
I was tending to a wounded airman,
we came under fire.

288
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:08,803
You were there,
you helped me stabilize him and got us out of there.

289
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:10,559
No, I didn't.

290
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,109
You were hit by an errant staff blast and,
and killed instantly.

291
00:18:15,788 --> 00:18:18,701
You were honored with a heroes funeral.

292
00:18:18,741 --> 00:18:20,098
Lucky me.

293
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:26,124
Hopefully you will be able
to return to your world soon.

294
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:28,159
- Hopefully?
- Yeah, for the moment it looks like your...

295
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,993
- your trip here, was only one way.
- No...

296
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:34,047
no, you have to find a way
to get us back as soon as possible.

297
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:36,800
- Yes, Sam and Dr Lee are working on something.
- But you don't understand.

298
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,195
We have been targeted by the Ori.

299
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:43,984
Earth is being ravaged by a plague,
hundreds of thousands have been infected.

300
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:49,252
If we don't find a cure
the entire planet will be wiped out.

301
00:18:56,076 --> 00:18:59,069
So... how are things in your universe?

302
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,925
You mean between us?

303
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:03,459
I'm a little curious.

304
00:19:04,097 --> 00:19:05,654
Things developed,

305
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:08,727
but with you being
on the other side of the galaxy. Well,

306
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,080
long distance relationships can be difficult.

307
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:15,751
I eventually joined
the Stargate program to be closer to you.

308
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,108
We worked together.

309
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:19,582
Even lived together for quite some time,

310
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:22,456
but in the end, things didn't work out.

311
00:19:22,616 --> 00:19:24,850
You're with someone else now.

312
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,168
Who?

313
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,323
<i>I think I have something.</i>

314
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:35,985
This is the postmortem analysis
of the P3W-451 incident.

315
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:39,138
A planet whose orbit
strayed too close to a black hole.

316
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:45,803
One of our teams were attempting
to gate back at the same time and as a result
the SGC couldn't shut down the Gate from this end.

317
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,273
- I don't see what this...
- We were unable to sever
the connection because Stargate Command

318
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:55,402
was still connected to the singularity's
gravitational field through the open Stargate.

319
00:19:55,601 --> 00:20:00,590
- But we're not trying to...
- In that case we used a shape charge to deliver
an energy surge to the matter stream...

320
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,381
forcing the matter stream to jump to a different Gate,
thereby severing the connection.

321
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:06,177
That could explain the sound they heard...

322
00:20:06,217 --> 00:20:10,567
and the superfluous energy signature that accompanied
the matter stream from the first wormhole.

323
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:12,961
- It is some sort of la...
- Maybe a supernova.

324
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:18,749
or a gamma ray burst discharging at
the exact millisecond that wormhole
passed through that singularity.

325
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:21,144
It's a one in a billion fluke

326
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:26,492
that ruptured subspace and created
the point of confluence that drew
the affected realities into this one.

327
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:30,243
And then to seal the bridge between the multiverse
we have to target that point of confluence,

328
00:20:30,283 --> 00:20:33,316
basically recreate the circumstances
that caused the breach in the first place.

329
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:35,012
But how is that possible...

330
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:37,906
You... you said it yourself, it was
a one in a billion freak incident.

331
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:42,894
Well the odds would increase significantly
if we took the wormhole out of the equation.

332
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:45,689
Then what happens to us?

333
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:47,685
We'd be stranded here.

334
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:52,573
I considered not telling you about this.

335
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:54,968
I understand why you hesitated
but you made the right decision...

336
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:58,121
<i>by sealing the rupture we'll ensure
no other teams get stranded here.</i>

337
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,555
That's provided that this actually works.

338
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:02,949
<i>I mean, we still have one major obstacle to overcome.</i>

339
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:06,741
How do we deliver an explosive
device into the singularity?

340
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,692
We get help from a friend.

341
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:14,054
Thor sends his apologies for not attending personally,

342
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,818
but he and Heimdall
are in the neighboring galaxy

343
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,013
dealing with a most sensitive matter.

344
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:23,503
In his stead, I have conveyed
the time dilation device as requested.

345
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:26,097
We appreciate your quick response Vaseer.

346
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:28,222
So, what do you think will this work?

347
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:30,786
I prefer not to prognosticate.

348
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:34,378
Well, don't prognosticate just
tell us what your gut feeling is.

349
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:38,369
Speculating on the matter would
serve no practical purpose.

350
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,046
Joseph and Mary...

351
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,522
What are the odds?

352
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:42,959
Less than 12%

353
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:45,354
<i>and that is provided you are able to in act the plan</i>

354
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:48,746
before the black hole's gravity decimates your ship.

355
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:50,403
Damn that's cold.

356
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,839
<i>Colonel Mitchell. Colonel Carter.</i>

357
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:55,132
I'm giving it the green light...
shut this thing down.

358
00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:01,617
You know I read all the mission
reports on the Asgard...

359
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,712
They're not that I expected.

360
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:05,708
What were you expecting?

361
00:22:06,387 --> 00:22:07,704
Well...

362
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:10,098
pants for one.

363
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:17,881
<i>The distance between the launch
point and the target is crucial</i>

364
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,475
and you must be precise in your calculations.

365
00:22:20,514 --> 00:22:21,472
I know.

366
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:24,825
The slightest oversight in either
the timing of the explosion

367
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:27,539
or the proximity of your ship to the singularity

368
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,853
could result in a failed mission at best.

369
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:31,849
Certain death at worst.

370
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,239
I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time concentrating.

371
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:39,233
I understand, you are tired.

372
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:42,425
Allow me to complete the calibration for you.

373
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:44,620
Knock yourself out.

374
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:54,797
Time and again we've managed to save Earth
and its allies from the most dire threats...

375
00:22:57,112 --> 00:23:00,983
situations in which we faced unassailable odds...

376
00:23:01,023 --> 00:23:04,575
almost certain defeat but we always managed
to find a way to prevail in the end.

377
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:06,571
I'm sorry...

378
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,805
I wish there was a way
I could send you home or...

379
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:13,655
- at the very least delay the mission so...
- You have no choice but to do what's
best for your world.

380
00:23:13,854 --> 00:23:19,042
I assume yours is not the only SG team in your reality
that's actively searching for a cure to the plague...

381
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:20,240
No.

382
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:24,829
And I have a feeling that your Samantha Carter
is back home working on the problem.

383
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:28,221
She stopped being
my Samantha a long time ago.

384
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:30,816
I've missed you.

385
00:23:46,381 --> 00:23:49,174
I have completed the calibrations.

386
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:52,566
Thank you Vaseer.

387
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,341
General. Sorry to disturb you,
I was wondering if I could have a word.

388
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:10,627
Of course Doctor. Come in.

389
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:13,619
Thank you.

390
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:20,763
Sir, I would like to make a request on behalf
of all of the teams stranded in this reality.

391
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:24,515
Please, postpone this mission until
we can find a way to get home.

392
00:24:24,554 --> 00:24:25,792
I can't do that.

393
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:29,304
We need our teams out there
gathering intel on the Ori threat...

394
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:34,292
instead of sitting on their hands here,
waiting for normal Gate operations to resume...

395
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,847
and that won't be possible until
this problem is dealt with.

396
00:24:36,987 --> 00:24:39,262
Well, I can empathize Sir, believe me.

397
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:41,856
I think you need to take
a look at the bigger picture.

398
00:24:41,895 --> 00:24:46,844
This goes beyond this world...
beyond this galaxy, this universe.

399
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:49,968
Hundreds of billions of lives are at stake.

400
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:55,455
Their survival could hinge on not just our return
but the return of every SG-1 stranded on this base.

401
00:24:55,465 --> 00:24:59,017
Sir, back in my universe, Earth
is facing a global pandemic,

402
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:02,210
one that your planet has already faced and beaten.

403
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,280
You have the cure that could save my world,
all I have to do is get it to them.

404
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:10,591
I can also empathize but at
the risk of sounding callous...

405
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,985
my priorities are with this world.

406
00:25:13,584 --> 00:25:17,575
How can you prioritize the lives
of one group over those of another?

407
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,569
What makes my Earth
any less important than your own?

408
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:25,647
We have the top minds from 18 different
universes working on a way to get you home.

409
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,850
Now hopefully they can come up with a solution
before this mission is completed

410
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,047
but if they can't...

411
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:32,841
then I'm sorry Doctor.

412
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,609
We finished loading the warhead
and the time dilation generator.

413
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:49,404
Once the system checks
are complete, we're good to go...

414
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:53,993
Where's the crew?

415
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:55,789
You're looking at it.

416
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:59,181
Given the dangers we may face it was
decided that we proceed alone.

417
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:02,374
So if this plan goes fubar, we're the only
ones that goes down with the ship.

418
00:26:02,414 --> 00:26:04,769
Well, there's plenty more where we came from, right?

419
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:09,558
The perilous nature of this mission
should not be taken lightly,

420
00:26:09,597 --> 00:26:13,070
there is a chance the Prometheus
may not survive this voyage

421
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:19,137
<i>but courage and a steadfast resolve will prove
the most valuable assets in this undertaking.</i>

422
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:23,527
Well, good luck to you all.

423
00:26:27,318 --> 00:26:28,516
I miss Thor.

424
00:26:34,263 --> 00:26:39,012
Of course by the time he actually got around
to drinking that orange juice, it would have been
sitting in the back of the fridge for what, a month?

425
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:45,358
Yeah! Yeah yeah! Oh...yep, he was so damn thirsty
he knocked it right back, it was a second or two
before he actually breathed in, at which point...

426
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:50,626
Spit take of all spit takes! there was orange
juice on the table, the chairs...

427
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:51,304
On Aunt Emma!

428
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:52,711
Aunt Emma! Oh!

429
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:55,194
Oh! Big old fat Emma sitting across the table...

430
00:26:55,634 --> 00:26:59,666
Little bits of bacon on her face
orange juice dripping off her nose...

431
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,441
Reminiscing over old times?

432
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:04,075
Yeah... hell, I could talk to this guy all day.

433
00:27:04,215 --> 00:27:05,612
No doubt.

434
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:06,689
You finished your shift?

435
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:09,643
Yeah, I'm exhausted I'm going to bed.

436
00:27:09,682 --> 00:27:12,517
Speaking of which, I think it's past my bedtime.

437
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:14,143
And you need your beauty sleep.

438
00:27:14,153 --> 00:27:16,348
Woah... who's talking?

439
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:23,612
So how'd it go?

440
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:27,283
I found a way round all the security
protocols, everything's set.

441
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:28,719
Perfect.

442
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,673
By the time they figure out what happened...

443
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:33,150
it'll be too late.

444
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:51,627
Show time.

445
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,545
<i>We're approaching the singularity.</i>

446
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,958
Calculating minimal
prime distance to warhead launch.

447
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:33,153
Come on Carter.

448
00:28:54,605 --> 00:28:57,159
I've got it, relaying the information.

449
00:28:58,716 --> 00:29:00,032
Received.

450
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,782
Engaging sublight engines, proceeding to co-ordinates.

451
00:29:08,294 --> 00:29:10,090
We've reached the target location.

452
00:29:11,008 --> 00:29:13,003
- Yeah, I heard.
- Yeah, I think they're just...

453
00:29:13,163 --> 00:29:15,318
circling, like we are parking.

454
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,040
I should warn you...

455
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,829
I've been practicing those Sodan moves.

456
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:39,943
You were warned.

457
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:44,153
Wouldn't it have been easier just to zat him?

458
00:29:44,193 --> 00:29:45,709
Easier yes...

459
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:48,104
but far less gratifying.

460
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:52,933
Did he just insult me?

461
00:29:59,738 --> 00:30:00,775
What's going on?

462
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,024
There's been a change of flight plans.

463
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:31,426
You want to tell us what's going on?

464
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,280
We're making an unscheduled detour.

465
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,831
Yeah, just how far out of our way
is this little detour gonna take us?

466
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:39,987
About 3 weeks.

467
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:43,100
You're planning on taking this ship to Atlantis...

468
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:47,290
<i>I mean, given the parallels between our two realities,
I can't think of anywhere else we'll be going.</i>

469
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,322
As soon as we complete our mission
we'll drop you at the nearest habitable planet.

470
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:52,777
'till then

471
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:54,693
have fun.

472
00:30:58,286 --> 00:31:00,601
Three weeks, well that gives us time to

473
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,237
think of something.

474
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:04,870
Idea's anyone?

475
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:07,425
Given the unique
circumstance we find ourselves in.

476
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,498
It is possible
to anticipate their actions and reactions.

477
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:11,904
All we must do...

478
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:13,271
is think like them.

479
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:15,507
Well, shouldn't be that hard.

480
00:31:33,148 --> 00:31:36,180
The other colonel Mitchell wishes to speak with you.

481
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:42,646
You're just going to
ignore him for the next three weeks?

482
00:31:53,941 --> 00:31:57,053
You guys seem reasonable...

483
00:31:57,094 --> 00:31:58,570
and you haven't hurt us...

484
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:00,725
much.

485
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:05,494
You don't have a beard
so you're not from the evil twin universe right?

486
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:07,011
Good.

487
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,484
Right, so if I know me like I do...

488
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:13,197
I'd have a pretty damn good reason
to be doing what you guys are doing.

489
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:17,627
Bottom line is, I'd understand
better than anyone, so level with me.

490
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:19,224
What's going on?

491
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:21,279
Let me ask you something.

492
00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:26,029
How far would you go to save
the lives of every man and woman on Earth?

493
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:28,981
Don't bother. I already know the answer.

494
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:33,172
<i>- If you were in my situation
you would be doing the exact same thing.
- What? Going after the ZPM?</i>

495
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:35,886
Come on...

496
00:32:35,926 --> 00:32:40,356
- Why else would you be going to Atlantis?
- Our ZPM is depleted.

497
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:43,708
We need yours
to power the ancient weapon in Antarctica.

498
00:32:43,748 --> 00:32:47,539
- Oh right, screw our Earth to save your own.
- All that ZPM is doing right now.

499
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,202
Is allowing one way travel from
the Pegasus galaxy to Earth.

500
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:55,521
The billions of lives that we save is worth
more than the inconvenience

501
00:32:55,562 --> 00:32:59,713
- of slopping back and forth on the Daedalus.
- We need that ZPM to cloak Atlantis

502
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:05,040
If the Wraith come back and discover the City
wasn't destroyed, they'll launch another attack.

503
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,036
If Atlantis falls,

504
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:09,969
this galaxy is the next target.

505
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,808
If

506
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:12,444
the Wraith return.

507
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:13,282
If

508
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:14,519
they attack.

509
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,913
If the City is destroyed.

510
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,308
The threat we face is more immediate.

511
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:21,743
That still doesn't give you the right to do this.

512
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:25,135
Well, say it works.

513
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:26,752
Say that

514
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:33,097
you can beam the ZPM of Atlantis,
how do you plan to get it back to your own universe?

515
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:40,081
You have a way back.

516
00:33:44,351 --> 00:33:46,107
You've planned this all along.

517
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:11,421
Well, we were right,

518
00:34:11,431 --> 00:34:13,666
they're going after the ZPM.

519
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,887
You sure you can open the door?

520
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,603
Hey, I helped build this thing...

521
00:34:23,763 --> 00:34:25,678
opening the doors the easy part.

522
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,150
It's taking the ship back that'll be tricky.

523
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:38,849
The armory is this way.

524
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:42,361
No Teal'c go to the armory on the next level
it's less likely you'll be spotted.

525
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:45,234
Daniel and I will head to the engine
room and pull the control crystal,

526
00:34:45,274 --> 00:34:48,268
once they come to investigate the problem,
we'll get the drop on them there.

527
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,983
Very well.

528
00:35:16,523 --> 00:35:18,878
Hey, you had to give it a shot.

529
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:20,794
I know I would.

530
00:35:22,502 --> 00:35:27,212
So, now that we know how you get out, we'll just
have to make sure it doesn't happen again.

531
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,638
No hitting.

532
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:38,228
So, while we were up here.

533
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:41,460
We were down on the next level
breaking into the other armory.

534
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:45,810
- How did you know I wasn't your Mitchell.
- Easy.

535
00:35:45,891 --> 00:35:48,125
If we were in your position
we would have done the same thing.

536
00:35:48,165 --> 00:35:49,203
Let me get this straight.

537
00:35:49,242 --> 00:35:52,794
We figured that you guys would try
to escape and we set this trap for you,

538
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:58,383
not realizing that you'd figure out that
we'd figure you out and you'd set your own?

539
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:02,733
Indeed.

540
00:36:02,772 --> 00:36:05,566
Now, can you take us to our colonel Mitchell?

541
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:21,171
Sam disabled the power relay
running through these walls so...

542
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,007
I wouldn't bother.

543
00:36:31,907 --> 00:36:33,742
Ideas anyone?

544
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:40,048
Walter?

545
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:42,682
Sir, it's a subspace
communication from the Prometheus.

546
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:44,118
- Let's hear it.
- Yes Sir.

547
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:45,765
Sir, this is colonel Carter.

548
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:48,848
Good to hear from you Colonel,
I take it the mission was a success.

549
00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:51,891
No Sir. In fact we're scraping
the mission and heading back home.

550
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:52,939
<i>Colonel?</i>

551
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:57,888
Sir, I think I figured out a way to send
these teams back to their proper realities.

552
00:36:57,928 --> 00:36:59,154
<i>And how do we do that?</i>

553
00:36:59,164 --> 00:37:03,555
By doing exactly the same thing
the first team did in order to get here.

554
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,995
You're telling me
they planned this from the get-go?

555
00:37:08,005 --> 00:37:13,593
Yes Sir, it accounts for the boom you heard
and the extra energy signature the Gate
diagnostic picked up in the first matter stream.

556
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:18,461
They opened the wormhole through the black
hole and then blasted a bridge into this universe.

557
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:21,734
Ain't that how Carter described it,
I don't know, I just remember

558
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:24,827
Wormhole, black hole, blast.

559
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:40,192
Colonel Carter.

560
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:44,224
Sir, we've established a wormhole to PX7-455.

561
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:48,374
<i>Now, when sergeant Siler is finished, we'll fire
the directed energy weapon through the Gate.</i>

562
00:37:48,414 --> 00:37:49,292
<i>If I'm right,</i>

563
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:53,124
it should reverse the space time rupture
effectively inverting the convergence effect.

564
00:37:53,163 --> 00:37:55,678
<i>Each team gated in from a different point of origin,</i>

565
00:37:55,718 --> 00:37:57,713
<i>once the convergence effect has been reversed</i>

566
00:37:57,753 --> 00:38:00,147
we'll dial those different
points of origin and create wormholes

567
00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:02,263
that will follow the inter-universal pathways

568
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:07,451
<i>- already created by their initial trips here...
- I got it, I got it, they're going back.</i>

569
00:38:09,945 --> 00:38:11,182
Ready when you are, Sir.

570
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:13,618
Clear the Gateroom.

571
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:17,887
I will need the weapon back
once your work here is completed.

572
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:22,158
it is, after all, only on loan to you temporarily.

573
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:24,353
I know.
You'll get it back when we're done.

574
00:38:24,393 --> 00:38:26,388
Lower the blast doors.

575
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,576
Fire the weapon.

576
00:38:42,332 --> 00:38:45,446
We have a stable wormhole,
3.4 seconds, it worked.

577
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:48,219
Open the blast doors. Bring them in.

578
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:08,553
Hey Mitchell...

579
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:11,067
when the time comes,

580
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:13,383
cut the green one.

581
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:27,531
What the hell did that mean?

582
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,366
I don't know.

583
00:39:30,444 --> 00:39:33,756
But I've the feeling
that someday you're going to find out.

584
00:39:51,277 --> 00:39:52,793
Have all the other teams left, Sir?

585
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,510
You're the last ones to go.

586
00:39:54,649 --> 00:39:57,603
It was nice working with you again Sam.

587
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:01,134
Your presence has been sorely missed on our team.

588
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:04,447
Just out of curiosity, where did I go?

589
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:08,119
Maternity leave.

590
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:16,301
We have something for you.

591
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:21,090
The cure to the Prior's plague.

592
00:40:21,528 --> 00:40:23,564
Thank you General.

593
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:30,309
It's good to see you again.

594
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:31,945
You too.

595
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,920
May it not be the last time.

596
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,406
Well, we'd love to stay...

597
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:52,060
but we have a planet to save.

598
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:57,328
Bye.
