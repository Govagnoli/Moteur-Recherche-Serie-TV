1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,169
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Stargate SG-1.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,428
Whoa!

3
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:06,405
Whoa!

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,773
- What are you doing?
- I don't know, sir.

5
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,471
The Colonel must have input
new stargate locations into the computer.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,777
Jaffa number in the millions,
spread across the vastness of the galaxy.

7
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,113
What you need right now is
a strong leader.

8
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,208
You.

9
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:25,616
Guys! We've got a problem.

10
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,124
Ba'al's been busy.

11
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,455
He's been gathering up stargates

12
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,529
from all over the sector
for the last several weeks.

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,463
In Arthurian myth,
Morgan was a powerful sorceress,

14
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,802
King Arthur's half-sister
and an adversary of Merlin.

15
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,265
That would suggest
she may have had a hand

16
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,804
in the disappearance
of the weapon we seek.

17
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,034
We're looking for the names of two
planets known on Earth in ancient times

18
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:46,237
in the dialect of Old English
as Castiana and Sahal.

19
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,371
<i>Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor.</i>

20
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,676
You're not really a hologram, are you?

21
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:54,151
<i>You have your answer, Daniel Jackson.</i>
<i>I suggest you act on it.</i>

22
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,627
- What's the latest from the search parties?
- Nothing much to report, sir.

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,029
The toxic atmosphere on Castiana
is slowing us down considerably.

24
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,124
Now, we found evidence
of stone structures on Sahal,

25
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,363
but they appear to have been abandoned
over 40,000 years ago.

26
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,134
- So basically we've got nothing.
- Not yet.

27
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,275
You went all the way
to the Pegasus Galaxy,

28
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,540
had a face-to-face encounter
with a full-blown Ascended being,

29
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,878
came away with not one
but two gate addresses,

30
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,349
and they both turn out to be dead ends?

31
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,286
Well, see, that's the part
that doesn't make any sense, sir.

32
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,380
If Morgan didn't want us
to find Merlin's weapon,

33
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:34,426
then why tell us anything at all?
We must be missing something.

34
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,961
That's what Doctor Jackson
keeps telling me.

35
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,621
You heard from Daniel?

36
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,523
He checked in from Camelot this morning.

37
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,660
He's convinced that the answer is
somewhere in Merlin's library.

38
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,329
But he hasn't found anything yet.

39
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,875
<i>HARRIMAN ON RADIO: Sorry to interrupt,</i>
<i>General. You're needed in the control room.</i>

40
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,747
What is it, Chief?

41
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,111
We just received a heads-up
from NORAD, sir.

42
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,280
An Al'kesh bomber just entered Earth's
atmosphere about four minutes ago.

43
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,950
Bearing indicates Cheyenne Mountain.

44
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,853
Two F-16's out of Peterson
have been re-routed to intercept.

45
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,953
I'm patching us in.

46
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,930
<i>PILOT: Repeat, you have entered</i>
<i>a Flight Restricted Zone</i>

47
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:17,059
<i>and are requested to land immediately.</i>
<i>Please respond.</i>

48
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,637
<i>Stargate Command, this is Bearcat One.</i>

49
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,406
<i>Alien vessel is unresponsive.</i>
<i>Should we engage?</i>

50
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,414
If they were friendly,
they wouldn't be flying silent.

51
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,314
- Maybe their communications are down.
- We can't take the chance.

52
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,181
Bearcat One, this is General Landry.

53
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,515
You are clear to engage.

54
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,296
<i>PILOT: The alien vessel has been disabled.</i>
<i>They're coming down hard.</i>

55
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,334
I've got projected coordinates.
We're on it, sir.

56
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,251
CARTER:
What's the situation, Major?

57
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,418
The area has been secured.
No one on board except for the pilot.

58
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,861
- He's being treated for minor injuries.
- Let's have a look at him.

59
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:30,205
Ah, at last. The welcoming committee.

60
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,680
MITCHELL: I don't get it.

61
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,482
We know that Ba'al has come to Earth
before without being detected.

62
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,155
Presumably by cloaked cargo ship

63
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,852
or by using Asgard beaming technology
from high orbit.

64
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,930
Exactly. So why would he fly
an Al'kesh directly to Stargate Command?

65
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,760
Maybe he was planning to attack.

66
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,699
- No. Even Ba'al's not that crazy.
- I wouldn't be so sure.

67
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,497
Well, this is interesting.

68
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,268
There's a signal coming
from inside the interrogation room.

69
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,309
He must have implanted himself
with a locator beacon.

70
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,207
No doubt he's expecting his people
to beam him out at some point.

71
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,612
- Better not hold his breath.
- Why not?

72
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,047
Well, after the stargate was stolen
two years ago,

73
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,176
we installed jamming devices
to prevent anyone

74
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,720
from locking onto a signal
from within the base.

75
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,757
MITCHELL: General. Has he said anything?

76
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,827
Only that he won't talk
to anybody but SG-1.

77
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,262
Lucky us.

78
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,388
Well, frankly, I'm inclined to let him rot.

79
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,490
That's all right, sir. We'll talk to him.

80
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,034
After all, he did come all this way.

81
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,972
Colonel Mitchell.

82
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,972
Colonel Carter, Teal'c.

83
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,312
Qetesh.

84
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,410
She goes by Vala now.

85
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,283
(SIGHING)
Always did, really.

86
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,720
We've been authorized
to give you the time of day,

87
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,315
- so make it quick and make it good.
- Of course.

88
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,687
I understand your reluctance
to trust me, so I'll be succinct.

89
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,630
It's the clones. They want me dead.

90
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,064
- That would make all of us.
- Dead, huh?

91
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,563
What'd you do?

92
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,137
Short-sheet the bed? Cheat at cards?

93
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,264
You must understand
that what I did was out of necessity.

94
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,434
You were the ones
who invited the Ori into this galaxy.

95
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,636
I was merely trying to preserve
a safe haven

96
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,681
for myself and a few good friends.

97
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,750
You mean slaves.

98
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,020
So you stole a few stargates,
tried to set up your own network,

99
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,782
yada, yada, yada.
We were there, remember?

100
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,254
Luckily, I wasn't.

101
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,358
I had to hear
about your heroics third-hand.

102
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,957
I also had to hear
about how you thwarted my attempts

103
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,531
to gain control of the Jaffa High Council.

104
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,395
But none of this explains
why the clones would turn on you.

105
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:46,768
That's probably because there's a little
more to his plan than he's letting on.

106
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,841
Perceptive, as usual.

107
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,437
Didn't Daniel tell me something
about a very powerful weapon

108
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,948
in the hands of the Jaffa on Dakara?

109
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,252
It's not a weapon, technically.

110
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,681
It was a device
that was originally used by the Ancients

111
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,689
to seed all life in this galaxy.

112
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,157
But we did adapt it
to destroy the replicators.

113
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,286
Using my simultaneous dialing program,
I might add.

114
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,526
Am I correct in assuming that this device
can be adapted to kill organic life as well?

115
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,761
Yes.

116
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,529
- Now it's starting to make sense.
- It is?

117
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,608
Well, you must remember
that I have intimate knowledge

118
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,405
of just how depraved the Goa'uld can be.

119
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,379
You are suggesting that Ba'al attempted
to gain control of the High Council

120
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,416
in order to gain access
to the Ancient device.

121
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,111
With the purpose of wiping out
all life in the galaxy,

122
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,984
except his own little corner, of course.

123
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,151
That was Anubis's plan.

124
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,151
I never said it was original.

125
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:47,596
But if I'd succeeded, the Ori would have
lost interest and been on their merry way.

126
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,294
You were going to save the galaxy
by destroying pretty much everyone in it?

127
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,237
But your clones figured out you weren't
going to bring them along, didn't they?

128
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,140
They served their purpose.

129
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:03,341
But what can I say? Their egos
were beginning to be a problem.

130
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,613
Well, they are your clones.

131
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,885
What I don't understand is,
after this particular revelation,

132
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,115
you thought SG-1 would want to help you.

133
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,381
Because I can help you.

134
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:15,861
With what?

135
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,956
Your search for Merlin's weapon,
of course.

136
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:23,836
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

137
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,030
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

138
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,571
Sir? Agent Barrett's here to see you.

139
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,401
- Barrett. What can I do for you?
- I'm here for the prisoner, sir.

140
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,412
Excuse me?

141
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,680
Ba'al.

142
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,346
I have an official request
for his transfer into NID custody.

143
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,511
You gotta be kidding.

144
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,452
We caught him. We can handle it.

145
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,095
Well, with all due respect, sir,
it's my understanding

146
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,858
he basically flew himself
into your front door.

147
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,701
Look, nobody wants
a jurisdictional tug of war here.

148
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,269
We've been investigating
the Goa'uld infiltration of the Trust

149
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,240
for two years now.
I'm telling you, it's a global conspiracy.

150
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,178
Political and corporate connections
in over a dozen countries,

151
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,043
your prisoner is at the top of the pyramid.

152
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,116
We don't even know if he's the real Ba'al.

153
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,708
Even if he's a clone,
I bet you he's got enough information

154
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,117
to bring down the whole organization.

155
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,447
We could wipe them out.

156
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,548
Well, you're just gonna have
to wait your turn.

157
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,127
Right now, we've got bigger fish to fry.

158
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,498
Anubis told me of the weapon
and of its power.

159
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,794
He dedicated considerable effort
to finding it during his time

160
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,928
in our plane of existence,
but he never succeeded.

161
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,430
And you have the address?

162
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,839
Actually, you have the address.

163
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,777
It's among those Colonel O'Neill obtained
during his encounter

164
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,216
with the Ancient repository of knowledge
on the planet you call P3R-272.

165
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,487
There are thousands of addresses
on that list.

166
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,148
Exactly why you'll never find it
on your own.

167
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,824
I, however, have information
that will allow you

168
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,259
to narrow down
your choices considerably.

169
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,492
All I ask in return is
that you eliminate the clones.

170
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,502
And we do that exactly how?

171
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,832
It should be easy enough
to track them down.

172
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,702
I implanted a locator chip in each one
when I created them.

173
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:12,209
That's funny, because we detected
a locator chip in you.

174
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,277
I had to implant one in myself
in order to gain their trust.

175
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,780
You can use the tracking system
on board my Al'kesh.

176
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,409
They'll never see it coming.

177
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,887
Well, that is a truly incredible story,

178
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,955
in every sense of the word.

179
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,756
I should also mention that every one of
my clones knows about Merlin's weapon.

180
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,423
And if any of them, at any point,
were captured by the Priors,

181
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,023
and were it to somehow slip out

182
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:40,094
that the SG-C computer contains the
location of a weapon deadly to the Ori...

183
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,801
Their Priors would stop at nothing
to have it within their grasp.

184
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,635
It is, of course, your decision.

185
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,472
I leave it in your very capable hands.

186
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,657
You can't seriously think
that he's telling the truth.

187
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,822
The whole truth? Of course not.

188
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,401
But there's too much at stake here
not to investigate.

189
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,594
And in the meantime?

190
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,432
What am I supposed to tell my superiors?

191
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,598
That's your problem.

192
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:23,640
We managed to activate the
tracking system on the Al'kesh, and this

193
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,044
is what we got.

194
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,448
- Those are the Ba'als?
- More like dots, really.

195
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,457
Get it? Dots, balls.

196
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,389
(CLEARS THROAT)

197
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,397
Anyway, we worked up those files
with the current locations,

198
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,436
showing the addresses
and any available intel.

199
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,601
All right, so what kind of trap
are we looking at?

200
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,368
I don't think it would be
as simple as an ambush,

201
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,204
not while we have him in custody.

202
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,403
No Goa'uld would sacrifice himself
like that.

203
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,276
- What do you think, sir?
- I say we give it a go.

204
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,110
Remind me to give you a primer
on the meaning of the word "sir."

205
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,948
But she's right.

206
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,988
We won't know if Ba'al is serious or not

207
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,524
until we test out some of these addresses.

208
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,123
Some of this intel seems pretty sketchy.

209
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,056
I'm familiar with this planet.

210
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,532
- It used to belong to Camulus.
- Can you get us in?

211
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,294
Absolutely.

212
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,241
You sure you want to bring her along
on this one?

213
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,504
Jackson says she'll be useful.
Now's her chance to prove it.

214
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,807
But Dr. Jackson isn't here,
and it seems to me

215
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,779
he's the only one she ever listens to.

216
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,748
Yeah. Some of the time.

217
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,950
You don't think you can control her?

218
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,146
No, I know I can't control her,

219
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,519
but that's pretty much par for the course.

220
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,251
Sir, Carter and I are the same rank,

221
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,491
Teal'c's an alien, Jackson's a civilian.

222
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,464
I learned a long time ago
I don't control anything.

223
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,934
Who does?

224
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,414
- How do I look?
- Turn around.

225
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,274
Yeah, you look great.

226
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,745
A little more enthusiasm
from you next time. Thank you.

227
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,388
- What?
- Zat!

228
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,290
This is my first real mission
through the gate,

229
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,419
and I'm the only one
who knows the terrain.

230
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,464
Then try not to get us killed.

231
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,268
Here we are.

232
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,703
And what?

233
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,380
Well, it's a ring platform,
somewhat hidden,

234
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,244
but it's a backdoor, if you will.

235
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,682
Okay, but it doesn't do us much good
if we can't activate it.

236
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,912
Leave that to me.

237
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,488
Hang on.

238
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,323
Hang on!

239
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,758
Where's she going?

(GROANING)

242
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,754
- What the hell are you doing?
- I alerted a Jaffa patrol to our presence.

243
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,987
Obviously! Do you mind if I ask why?

244
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,893
So they'd sound the alarm
and send reinforcements.

245
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,295
Oh, well, that's...

246
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,366
That's brilliant!

247
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:29,960
Hey, how come I didn't think of that?

248
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,436
My dear Colonel, where do you think
the reinforcements will come from?

249
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,100
You can thank me later, by the way.

251
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,437
Jaffa!

(JAFFA GROANING)

253
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,972
Don't shoot.

254
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,205
I know why you're here,
and you're making a big mistake.

255
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,784
Oh, let us guess, you're the real Ba'al.

256
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,045
Precisely.

257
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,518
No doubt the impostor promised you
the location of Merlin's weapon

258
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,319
if you helped him get rid of the rest of us.

259
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,450
That's right.

260
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,757
You do realize he has no idea
where it is or how to find it.

261
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,831
- VALA: But you do.
- Of course.

262
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,661
I obtained the information
only after the clones were created

263
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:13,465
and needless to say,
I never shared it with them.

264
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,764
You know what?
This is giving me a headache.

265
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,771
What do you say
we finish this up at home?

266
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,808
Let's go, Spartacus.

267
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,994
Oh, yeah. Now I can see the difference.

268
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,354
I still cannot.

269
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,033
Do we really believe only one of them
knows how to find the weapon?

270
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,127
This is Ba'al we're talking about.

271
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,901
I don't think we can take anything
either of them say at face value.

272
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,068
So what now, sir?

273
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,879
We've got scientists working here,
don't we?

274
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,949
Get them on this.
See if they can sort out who's who.

275
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,622
In the meantime,
I think I'm going to have to arrange

276
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,925
for separate accommodations.

277
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,933
ANALYST: I wish I had better news.

278
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,606
So you're saying
there's no way to tell them apart?

279
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,906
We generated distinct DNA profiles
of all four samples,

280
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,604
using a number of analysis techniques.

00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,908
Sorry? Four?

282
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,573
We did the host
and the Goa'uld separately.

283
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,117
- Right.
- We ran each test five times,

284
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,778
and in each case,
the results were uncanny.

285
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:40,322
There was a perfect match
across all 13 specific DNA markers.

286
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,093
I'm sorry, Colonel.

287
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,789
Either the clones are genetically
indistinguishable from the real Ba'al...

288
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,924
Or we have two clones on our hands
and the real Ba'al is still out there.

289
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,003
- Yep.
- Thank you.

290
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,643
So much for not encountering resistance.

291
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,222
I guess some Ba'als are bigger
than others, huh?

292
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,954
If he's got a ship back there,
we're screwed.

293
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,150
We've got to find a way around.

- I'll come with you.

Don't shoot.

300
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,533
I am the real Ba'al.

301
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,345
Sam, we got Ba'al.

302
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:08,768
Copy that.

303
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,081
So do we.

304
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,660
Chief, got a full count.
Two strikes, three Ba'als.

305
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,131
That's clever, sir.

306
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,505
He was thinking that one up
the whole way home.

307
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,101
- Yeah, the whole three seconds.
- Three point two.

308
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,202
Good point.

309
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,508
Well, that ties you with SG-12,

310
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,708
because they brought in two more
about an hour ago.

311
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,784
Damn.

312
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,219
- It's not a competition.
- Says you.

313
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,396
General.

314
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,367
Barrett. I was wondering
when you'd be back.

315
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,702
I understand you got yourself
a few extra Ba'als.

316
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,302
I don't suppose you'd consider
letting me take a few off your hands?

317
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,207
You know I can't do that.

318
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,105
Not until we figure out
which one's the original,

319
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,343
and whether or not he's bluffing
about Merlin's weapon.

320
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,549
Besides, if any of them got wind
that we had another agenda,

321
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,283
that would give them leverage
in the interrogation.

322
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,851
Last thing we need is for them to think
they have a strong bargaining position.

323
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,031
I was afraid you were going to say that.

324
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,658
- I assume you spoke to your superiors.
- I did. They're not happy.

325
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:41,228
The fact is, while the NID does provide
civilian oversight of my command,

326
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,434
I don't, technically,
have to follow their orders.

327
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,136
At least not until the President tells me to.

328
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,940
They tried that.
For the moment, he is backing you.

329
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,677
But if your investigation doesn't turn up
anything useful soon,

330
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,911
it's gonna all change.

331
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,317
Obviously.

332
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,521
I'd like to stay on
and observe the interrogations, sir.

333
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,453
Any one of them could say something
that might turn out to be useful for us.

334
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,995
Of course. You're always welcome.

335
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,464
What do you got?

336
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,963
Well, sir, SG-14 just arrived
with two more Ba'al clones,

337
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,798
which brings us to the end of our list.

338
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,070
Well, you guys got your work
cut out for you, huh?

339
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,522
And just how might you be
able to help me?

340
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,796
Well, we could spare your life, for one.

341
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:43,633
You help us find Merlin's weapon,
and I promise, we won't kill you.

342
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:44,802
No.

343
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,794
Instead, you'll lock me in the basement

344
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,671
of one of your more appalling
penal facilities

345
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:54,212
for me to live out the rest of my life
in squalor and deprivation.

346
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,207
It's better than the alternative. Trust me.

347
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,949
You see, here's what I'm thinking.

348
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,986
I'm thinking that you're not the real Ba'al.

349
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,278
I mean,
you haven't even tried to cut a deal,

350
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,846
which makes me think that you have
no idea how to find the weapon,

351
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,121
therefore you're just another clone.

352
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,594
I am the real Ba'al, I assure you.

353
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,761
No, no, think about this.
How did we meet?

354
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,405
Do you think the real Ba'al
would let himself be captured like that,

355
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,635
cowering in the bushes
like a scared little bunny rabbit?

356
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,813
That's better.

357
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,073
But I'm still not buying it.

358
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,849
You're trying to goad me
into revealing information.

359
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,922
No, I'm just calling it like I see it.
And right now, you do not strike me

360
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,254
as someone who could intimidate
a 10-year-old out of his lunch money,

361
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,328
much less run an interstellar empire.

362
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,726
Why don't you have the guard
excuse himself for a moment,

363
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,391
and I'll show you
just what I am capable of?

364
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,125
See, now I know you're not the real Ba'al.

365
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,329
The real Ba'al wouldn't care
about the guard.

366
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,449
(DOOR SLIDES OPEN)

367
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,398
So,

368
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,532
having a tough day, are we?

369
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,136
What do you want, Qetesh?

370
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,207
- Is that any way to greet an old friend?
- Is that what we were?

371
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,366
I'll admit we had our differences.

372
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,306
You attacked my fleet at Selenis,
crippled my flagship,

373
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,973
and killed 10,000 of my best Jaffa.

374
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,511
So I did.

375
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,315
But it was nothing personal.

376
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,020
Anyway, that's all in the past,

377
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,189
and I'm here

378
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,057
to talk about our future.

379
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,689
"Our" future?

380
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,296
Well, you must admit there's always been
something between us.

381
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,662
Even when we wanted to kill each other,

382
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,068
there was always a certain

383
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,829
spark.

384
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,106
Perhaps.

385
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,007
But you've made your
new allegiance clear.

386
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,077
Have I?

387
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:11,215
Or have I just been waiting
for the right opportunity?

388
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,988
What sort of opportunity?

389
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,919
You know how to find the address.

390
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,453
I have the access to the database.

391
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,597
You would betray your Tau'ri friends?

392
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,623
Friends

393
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,565
come and go.

394
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,137
Besides, what use
are they going to be to me

395
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,672
on their knees
before the armies of the Ori?

396
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,467
You tell me what you know,

397
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,066
I'll find the location of Merlin's weapon,

398
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,236
we'll make our escape.

399
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:46,116
And then we'll be free to share
in the pleasure of each other's company.

400
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,716
An excellent plan.

401
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,083
But why wait?

402
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,649
Merlin's weapon isn't going anywhere.

403
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,589
We have nothing but time.

404
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:05,064
What, here
on this rather uncomfortable table?

405
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,528
Why not?

406
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,167
Well, the security camera, for starters.

407
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:13,335
There's no way they'd trust me
after seeing something like this.

408
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,976
Tell them it was part
of your interrogation technique.

409
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,449
Oh, come on, be serious.

410
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,714
I am being serious.

411
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,393
Aren't you?

412
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,899
<i>BA 'AL: Your time amongst the Tau'ri</i>
<i>is making you soft.</i>

413
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,565
<i>You used to be a much better liar.</i>

414
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,330
Don't say it.

415
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:42,463
- Your people are getting nowhere, sir.
- You think you can do better?

416
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,098
It's what we're trained for.

417
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,234
I could have half a dozen agents here
by tomorrow.

418
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:49,541
I'm talking about offering
our services on your investigation.

419
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,843
If any of the Ba'als knows
where Merlin's weapon is, we'll find out.

420
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,181
By your own admission, the NID wants
this over with as quickly as possible

421
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,415
so they can move on to something
they think is more important.

422
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,855
Under those circumstances,
I think you'll understand

423
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,427
why I'd prefer to stick
with my own people.

424
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,560
Yes, sir.

425
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,441
- Mind if I join you?
- Please.

426
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,148
So,

427
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,644
how are the interrogations coming?

428
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,550
You have to ask?

429
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,188
Look, I know you've been monitoring
the investigation.

430
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,986
I also know you think
we're wasting our time.

431
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,927
No. No, I never said that.
Not in so many words.

432
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,799
Look, you guys are fighting a war
out there, right?

433
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,458
We're fighting it down here.

434
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,201
Believe me, it's a war.

435
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,030
Do you remember two years ago,

436
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,970
when the Goa'uld almost took over
the Russian government?

437
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,838
- Do you want to see that happen again?
- Of course not.

438
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,035
Then help me.

439
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,238
Malcolm, it's not like we're gonna
keep the Ba'als here forever.

440
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,681
Just give us a couple of days,
and then you can come in and...

441
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,184
Days. No, this is way too important!

442
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,919
- Are you all right?
- This is about us, isn't it?

443
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,722
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, this is about us.

444
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,990
We obviously have unresolved issues.

445
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,734
Look, you're my friend,
and I care about you.

446
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,228
But don't push it.

447
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,441
I need to see the prisoner.

448
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,182
Now.

449
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,560
(GRUNTS)

450
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,363
- General.
- Somebody give me some good news.

451
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,476
Sorry, sir,
I still don't have anything useful.

452
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,673
I didn't even make it to first base.

453
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:01,968
Where's Colonel Carter?

454
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,604
She was finishing up last time I saw,

455
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,478
but I don't think she has anything
to report either.

456
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,552
We're running out of time.
The NID wants the prisoners,

457
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,747
and the President's not going to be able
to hold them back forever.

458
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,721
Or they're not going to wait.

459
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,684
- What are you talking about?
- Agent Barrett.

460
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,456
He's talking to one of the Ba'als.

461
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,862
I didn't give authorization for that.

462
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,835
Whoa!

463
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,631

465
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,411
This is Colonel Carter
requesting backup, Level 16, Corridor B.

466
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,240
Come with me. You, cover both.

This is General Landry.

470
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:54,899
I need a full security lockdown
of Levels 15 through 17. Now.

471
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,127
And there goes the feed. We're blind.

472
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,846
- Barrett.
- Oh, Sam.

473
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,425
He got away, he took my gun.

474
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,023
- It's okay, we'll get you out of here.
- Okay.

475
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:27,832
Come on.

476
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,334

(BARRETT GRUNTING)

479
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,506
Put them with the others.

480
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,519
We have emergency forces in position
at all access points, sir.

481
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,113
All three levels are locked down
and secure.

482
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,260
What do you got for me, Doctor?

483
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:02,432
Well, we're thinking
our best bet is symbiote poison

484
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,128
introduced in gas form
into all three levels.

485
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,394
It won't harm any of our people,

486
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,064
but it will kill any of the Goa'uld
who come in contact with it.

487
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,471
Excellent. Do it.

488
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,542
Well, it's not that simple. You see,

489
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,545
we'll have to use the ventilation system
to distribute the gas,

490
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,377
and, you know, it's not really designed
for that sort of thing.

491
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,450
What are you saying?

492
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:22,076
I can run some simulations

493
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,655
and determine the optimum
points to seal off the levels

494
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:28,351
and to insert the gas.
But even at optimum efficiency,

495
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,154
it won't be distributed evenly.

496
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:33,287
There's bound to be dead pockets
where the gas will take longer

497
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,626
- before it has any effect.
- All right, all right.

498
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:35,926
So what you're saying is,

499
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,468
depending on location, some of the Ba'als
may get advance warning, sir.

500
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,198
As soon as they realize what's happening,
they're going to kill the hostages.

501
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,001
Then we must be prepared
to provide a distraction

502
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,870
at the moment the gas is released.

503
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:45,943
Go!

504
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,229
Get up. We don't have much time.

505
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,844
Remember, we can't afford to be seen
until Dr. Lee gives us the signal.

506
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:20,911
Got it.

507
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,780
No improvising this time.
We stick to the plan.

508
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,113
Despite the fact that my improvisations
have been extremely useful in the past?

509
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,845
That's your entry point.

510
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:38,753
Bring her.

511
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,347
The access code. Please.

512
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:02,549
You're trying to download the list
of planets from the Ancient database.

513
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,032
What are you doing?

514
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,031
We need to join the others.

515
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,241
All right.

516
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:58,742
I'm coming.

517
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,554
You want Merlin's weapon for yourselves.

518
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:24,465
A weapon capable of destroying
not only the Ori, but the Ancients as well.

519
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,431
I'd say that's a pretty valuable commodity.

520
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,433
I won't do it.

521
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:38,413
This would be an inappropriate time
for heroics, Colonel.

522
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,784
Go ahead and kill me.

523
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:44,116
It's only a matter of time
before we regain control of this level.

524
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,089
Good luck trying to figure out
the code before then.

525
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,352
I would never dream of killing you.

526
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,295
But I will kill the other hostages.

527
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,062
You start with Agent Barrett.

528
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,139
Wait.

529
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,171
I'll do it.

530
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,584
I'm in position, Doc.

531

All right. That's our main access point
on the north side.

533
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:31,324
Now, the first thing you'll need to do
is seal off the vent before the junction.

534
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,428
I'm on it.

535
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,072
Why is this taking so long?

536
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,874
It's a lot of information.

537
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,714
You did something to slow
the download, didn't you?

538
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,444
I don't know what you're talking about.

539
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:51,113
Well, it doesn't matter.
You can't stop us anyway.

540
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,152
Check the perimeter.
They'll be coming soon.

545
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,804
Negative. I am similarly immobilized.

546
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,315
Doctor.

547
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,946
We're setting up
five separate access points,

548
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,485
they all have to be
ready to go simultaneously.

549
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,646
It's just going to take a minute.

550
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:12,261
- I'll take that.
- It won't do you any good.

551
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,937
They'll never let you off this base,
even if you kill us all.

552
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,939
Yes, that's what I wanted you to think,

553
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,805
otherwise you never
would have given me the code.

554
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,436
What are you talking about?

555
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,515
I knew they wouldn't negotiate.

556
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,381
Not even for you.

557
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,387
Not with something like this at stake.

558
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,651
Fortunately,

559
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,258
that's not the plan.

00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,559

- You're too late. That's symbiote poison.
- You're the one who's too late.

587
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,372
Get us out of here.

588
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,020
How the hell did he do it?

589
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,427
It looks like the locator beacons
actually served a dual purpose.

590
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,159
In close proximity, they combined
to amplify the signal enough

591
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,962
to be picked up
through our jamming screen.

592
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,401
That's why he needed us to go
and round up all the clones

593
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,871
and bring them here.
He was playing us from the start.

594
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,772
This was all so that he could get his hands
on that list of planets.

595
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,744
He must genuinely believe that
Merlin's weapon is hidden on one of them.

596
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,541
Even so, he took a great risk.

597
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,548
It was only because Agent Barrett
violated protocol

598
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,778
that he was afforded the opportunity
to escape the interrogation room.

599
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,479
And that was the reason
he was able to get all the clones

600
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,283
in one place so that he could beam out.

601
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,358
So if the whole thing
was planned in advance,

602
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,394
how did he know
what Agent Barrett was gonna do?

603
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,493
Agent Barrett, we need to talk.

604
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:41,872
Yes?

605
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,306
Did you read the report
on Ba'al's attempts

606
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,535
to gain control of the Jaffa High Council?

607
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:47,668
Yeah, sure I did.

608
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,305
The council members were influenced
by some form of mind control.

609
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,609
Yeah, I remember. So?

610
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,445
So what were you doing in Ba'al's cell?

611
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,644
I wanted to question him.

612
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:59,120
- You had no authorization for that.
- You were stonewalling me.

613
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,383
I decided to take matters
into my own hands.

614
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,756
You took your weapon
into the interrogation room.

615
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,830
Yeah. Yeah, I shouldn't have done that.
That was a mistake.

616
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,091
See, the Malcolm Barrett I know

617
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,666
would never have made
that kind of mistake.

618
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,066
Your record indicates your entire career
has been strictly by the book.

619
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,266
Now, suddenly out of the blue,
you're a cowboy?

620
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:19,635
What are you guys saying?

621
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,940
You think that I've been brainwashed?

622
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:26,443
The technology is readily available
to the Goa'uld who infiltrated the Trust,

623
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,780
and their loyalty is to Ba'al.

624
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:32,181
CARTER: Somebody must have given him
the specs to our anti-beaming technology.

625
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,347
It's the only way he could've known

626
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,584
that a combined signal would be
enough to punch through.

627
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,661
Yeah. I agree with that, but it wasn't me.

628
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,729
Ba'al's plan hinged on knowing in advance

629
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,628
he'd have the opportunity
to get out of that cell.

630
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,868
- He knew you were coming.
- And this is crazy.

631
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,961
You didn't know
you were doing anything wrong.

632
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,199
I've got to go. I'm due back in Washington.

633
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,467
You're not going anywhere.

634
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:52,542
Sergeant!

635
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,533
Hand over your weapon.

636
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,711
Sam, you know this isn't true.

637
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:14,221
Sir, I'm sorry.
I should never have given Ba'al that code.

638
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,696
You had no way of knowing.

639
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,793
Under the circumstances,
you did the right thing.

640
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:20,999
Thank you, sir.

641
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,671
So what do you think?

642
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,785
Think Ba'al really has a way
of figuring out where that weapon is?

643
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,013
Hard to say.

644
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:42,091
Anubis knew the addresses
of all those planets, and he never found it.

645
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:45,291
Mind you, there was only one of him.

646
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:47,998
Says you.
