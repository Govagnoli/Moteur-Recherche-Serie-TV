1
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:07,356
Previously on "Stargate SG-1".:

2
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:12,041
Something neither one of us can admit,
given our working relationship...

3
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:15,435
I didn't leave, because I care about her.

4
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:21,202
It's time to let go of the things that
prevent you from finding happiness.

5
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:24,436
You deserve to love someone.

6
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,722
What's his name?
Humming.

7
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:30,273
Pete. Pete Shanahan.
He's a cop.

8
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:33,485
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:38,275
Maybe I did some good, but nothing I've
done seems to have changed anything.

10
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:41,801
There is really only one thing
we can ever truly control.

11
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:44,683
Whether we are good or evil.

12
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:49,919
I know who you are, Daniel
Jackson, but you know not who I am.

13
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:54,360
Don't do this.

14
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:58,433
- Last year, you died.
- I'm dead?

15
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,961
Actually, you ascended to
a higher plane of existence.

16
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,804
He was beamed away
before our eyes.

17
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:10,798
The human-form replicator
is attempting to probe your mind.

18
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:12,682
When she is done, she will destroy you.

19
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:15,723
And when that time comes,
you will be faced with a choice.

20
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:19,480
A force of rebel Jaffa have managed
to take control of the temple at Dakara.

21
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:22,637
Have the fleet disengage
their battle with the replicators.

22
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:24,761
Take it back at all costs.

23
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:27,643
We have found
the Ancient weapon on Dakara.

24
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:40,633
- Did Daniel have something to do with it?
- I don't know.

25
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:57,321
You have failed me.

26
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:02,478
We've known for some time
that the Jaffa cannot be trusted any more.

27
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:08,197
The remaining Kull warriors stand an
excellent chance of retaking Dakara, but...

28
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:12,998
Worse than failure.

29
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:16,280
Worse than cowardice.

30
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:22,037
You have betrayed me.

31
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:26,442
Did you not think
I would know what you have done?

32
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:29,483
How can you still
underestimate my powers?

33
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:32,843
Your methods were
ultimately unnecessary.

34
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,723
There was another way
of defeating the replicators.

35
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:38,444
I will spare your life for the moment,

36
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:42,882
only so that you may witness
the fruits of your labours.

37
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:46,560
First, I will retake Dakara.

38
00:02:47,365 --> 00:02:52,962
Then, thanks to the modifications
you've made to the Stargate,

39
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:56,879
I will destroy every living thing
in this galaxy,

40
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:58,956
including you,

41
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:01,396
all at once.

42
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:07,081
I do not understand. You could have
modified the Stargate yourself.

43
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:11,317
You have no way of knowing
what is necessary and what is not

44
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:14,203
in the grand design.

45
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:18,322
Whose grand design?

46
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:22,482
Mine.

47
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,998
OK. Yeah. OK.

48
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:43,881
I'll tell everything I know.

49
00:04:56,205 --> 00:05:00,039
Sorry, sir. I just saw you were with
someone. I didn't wanna interrupt.

50
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,480
- What's up?
- Who was that?

51
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:04,556
Um, Kerry Johnson.

52
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,638
- CIA.
- I've heard the name.

53
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,035
She headed up the investigation
into Goa'ulds still at large

54
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,720
- after the incident with the Trust.
- Yeah.

55
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:18,681
- I wanted to talk to you...
- Carter.

56
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:21,837
- We haven't heard from him in a week.
- Doesn't mean anything.

57
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:26,840
Chances are he was on board
a replicator ship when it disintegrated.

58
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:30,520
All we know for sure is that he's missing.

59
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:34,962
- Sooner or later...
- Forget it! I'm not falling for it this time.

60
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:37,036
- Falling for it?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:41,880
How many times have you thought
he was gone, and then he shows up

62
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:44,525
in one form or another?

63
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:49,121
I'm sorry, but we're not having a memorial
service for someone who is not dead.

64
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:52,402
You hear that? I'm not buying it.

65
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:02,881
What? He's just waiting for us to say
a bunch of nice things about him.

66
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:08,403
Next thing you know, he'll come waltzing
through that door, like, right now.

67
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,396
Waltzing.

68
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:15,276
Now.

69
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,394
So, what can I get for you?

70
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:17,714
Brothers Bra'tac of Chulak

71
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:22,683
and Teal'c of the Tauri,

72
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:28,878
for your enduring courage and vision,

73
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:35,602
for the strength of will that has
brought us to freedom from the Goa'uld,

74
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,800
a future we have yet to even comprehend

75
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:46,278
but one that will be determined
by our own unfettered will,

76
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,721
I hereby bestow upon you
the highest honour

77
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:52,680
any Jaffa can know.

78
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:58,355
From this day forward,

79
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:02,400
you shall both be known as blood kin

80
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:05,676
to all Jaffa.

81
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:24,036
Brothers.

82
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:33,360
From this day forward,
no Jaffa shall bow before anyone,

83
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:36,721
and never again before a false god.

84
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:47,082
- Hail brother Bra'tac!
- Hail!

85
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:50,601
- Hail brother Teal'c!
- Hail!

86
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:00,756
Be proud, Teal'c.

87
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:04,633
- Today we are free.
- This day is not yet over with.

88
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:18,755
Then I shall be proud for you,

89
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,836
and of you.

90
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:46,394
- Hey.
- Hi.

91
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,476
Thank you, airman.

92
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:52,000
So, this is exciting.

93
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:54,997
- What's the surprise?
- You'll see.

94
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:58,157
Do I get to go through the Stargate?
What planet are we going to?

95
00:09:58,245 --> 00:10:02,523
- You don't get to go through the Stargate.
- OK. I'm a little disappointed.

96
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:06,644
Still, full security clearance,
an all-access pass to SGC...

97
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:09,398
- This must be big.
- Oh, it's big.

98
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:18,123
Pete Shanahan, Jacob Carter.

99
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:20,196
Dad, this is Pete.

100
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:23,519
- Dad.
- Not quite yet.

101
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:26,677
You have to marry my daughter
before you can call me that.

102
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:30,997
I was just... I meant...
Stammer, stammer.

103
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:34,202
It's an honour to meet you, sir. Really.

104
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:37,083
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want you to be nervous.

105
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:39,235
Why would I? I wouldn't. I...

106
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:44,240
- I've been dying to meet you.
- I think it was Sam that was nervous.

107
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:48,000
- How did not telling me help?
- It didn't.

108
00:10:56,045 --> 00:11:00,641
This is great. You really got
one of those things in your head?

109
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:06,120
If by "one of those things" you mean
a 2,000-year-old Tok'ra symbiote, yes.

110
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:08,161
Seriously. Come on.

111
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:10,998
That has gotta freak you
right out sometimes.

112
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:13,121
It's weird.

113
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,599
Hey. What do I have to do
to get some more coffee around here?

114
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,074
Find true enlightenment.

115
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,555
- No menus?
- We don't need them here.

116
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:36,761
Just order what you'd like.

117
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:41,123
OK, I'll have the truth
with a side order of clarity, please.

118
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:44,641
The replicator version of Sam
was in your head trying to access

119
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:47,285
the knowledge buried
in your subconscious,

120
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:50,801
but you gained control of her instead.
She killed you to stop you.

121
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:55,436
- That's where I stepped in. How's that?
- Pretty clear.

122
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:58,278
We aim to please.
Customer comes first, you know.

123
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:00,720
So I'm ascended again.

124
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:04,923
Not exactly. Sort of a stop along the way.

125
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:07,565
You have to make that choice for yourself.

126
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:10,796
- Waffles.
- Bacon on the side?

127
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:15,083
- No, I remember this place.
- You should. It came from your mind.

128
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:18,635
I was brought here after
my parents' funeral. I had waffles.

129
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:20,920
- Waffles it is.
- Wait.

130
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:27,234
How do I know this is really you this time?
How do I know this isn't some trick

131
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:32,194
replicator Sam's playing to stop me from
controlling her?

132
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,357
How deep is the river
if you cannot see the bottom?

133
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:39,677
Deeper than the coffee in my cup,
I'll tell you that.

134
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:41,403
Excuse me.

135
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:43,237
Frank, I need a Noah's boy in a blanket,

136
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:46,317
two hen fruit on a shingle
with a mystery in the alley,

137
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:51,115
a warm eve with a mouldy lid,
and two checkerboards, all right?

138
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,923
Hold the pig.

139
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:57,565
We have dreamed of this day for so long,

140
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:01,797
fought so hard for it,
and sacrificed so much.

141
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:05,594
- Now that it is here...
- It is not here, brother.

142
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:09,238
The balance of power has shifted, Teal'c.

143
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:12,556
Our victory here at Dakara
has turned the tide.

144
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,557
Jaffa everywhere
are abandoning the old ways,

145
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:18,796
coming to see the Goa'uld
for the false gods they are.

146
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:23,276
We are foolish to rejoice in conquest over
the Goa'uld when they are not all dead.

147
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:26,880
Anubis' claim to be a god is false,
but his powers certainly are not.

148
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:28,956
It is agreed.

149
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,195
He must be dealt with.

150
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:33,560
But for once,
there may be greater concerns

151
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:36,284
than the eradication of all the Goa'uld.

152
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:39,482
So consumed
were we in attaining freedom

153
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:43,683
that we did not plan
nearly enough for its aftermath.

154
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:47,553
The Jaffa have fought with each other
for so long that uniting them as one

155
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:52,765
may prove as difficult as convincing them
to free themselves from the Goa'uld.

156
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:56,394
Generations of war and mistrust
will not be healed overnight.

157
00:13:56,485 --> 00:14:01,081
Indeed. If we do not organise quickly,
freedom will become anarchy.

158
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:04,362
The high priests are proposing
a leadership be assembled.

159
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:06,436
That is wise.

160
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:11,795
They wish both of us to sit on the council.

161
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:17,355
You know that will take you
from the Tauri.

162
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:25,193
Your purpose in joining them
was to one day free the Jaffa.

163
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:30,234
That day is now. You must not abandon
your people when we need you most.

164
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:32,520
Of that I am aware.

165
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:42,116
The council will preside from our new
home world, where a city is to be erected,

166
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:45,993
a haven for all those
who have chosen freedom.

167
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:51,363
Here, on the holy ground of Dakara.

168
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,118
Hey.

169
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,161
- I know you.
- Really?

170
00:15:07,245 --> 00:15:11,124
Yeah. The guy from the paper.
Dr Daniel Jackson.

171
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:18,916
That's OK. Keep it. I'm done.

172
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,996
- Thanks.
- No problem.

173
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:40,803
- Are you gonna visit Mark and the kids?
- Tomorrow.

174
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:43,796
Is everything OK?

175
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:47,719
I'm just not very hungry.

176
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:50,194
You've been pretty quiet.

177
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:53,201
I'm fine.

178
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,841
Dad...

179
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:59,716
What?

180
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:02,797
Pete left two hours ago.
You haven't said a word.

181
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:05,524
- I did so.
- "He seems nice."

182
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:07,835
I believe that's three words.

183
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,519
- I'm gonna marry him.
- I know.

184
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:16,000
I just met him.
What do you want me to say?

185
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:19,874
I know how happy he makes you.

186
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,877
That's all that matters to me.

187
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:27,315
OK.

188
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:31,525
- Selmak really liked him.
- Selmak?

189
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:34,517
Yeah. And he's a great judge of character.

190
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:36,596
Well, OK.

191
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:43,245
Look, Sam, I'm tired.

192
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:47,557
It's been a long day.
I think I'm gonna turn in early.

193
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:51,035
- Are you sure nothing else is wrong?
- Yeah.

194
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,315
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Good night.

195
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,965
- What?
- Sorry to wake you, sir.

196
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:23,957
Teal'c's back, and it sounds
like we have a problem.

197
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:26,036
I knew it.

198
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:31,001
All right. I'll be there as soon as I can.

199
00:17:36,885 --> 00:17:38,876
Crap.

200
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:53,636
What was that?

201
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:57,240
Trouble in Jaffaland.

202
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,034
Gotta go.

203
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,116
I'm sorry.

204
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:16,594
- You know about this?
- Yes.

205
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:20,678
- You're not gonna do anything about it?
- You know I can't.

206
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:25,919
Well, I'm certainly not just gonna
sit here and let this happen.

207
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:33,799
You can't leave. You're not ascended yet.

208
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:37,673
You walk through that door,
you're choosing the alternative.

209
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:39,881
You're saying I'll be dead?

210
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:42,604
Pretty much.

211
00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:44,835
OK. Ascend me.

212
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:50,480
That doesn't mean you'll be able to
help your friends. You know the rules.

213
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:54,194
But once I'm ascended I can take
human form again, like last time.

214
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:56,640
Technically, yes.

215
00:18:56,725 --> 00:19:01,241
You can't take that paper, you won't have
any of the knowledge you've gained here,

216
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:06,115
and good luck ever ascending again.
I'm not going to help you a third time.

217
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:09,800
So I can know Anubis is plotting
to destroy all life in the galaxy,

218
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:14,800
and all I can do about it is stay here
and contemplate my own enlightenment?

219
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:16,955
You can eat your waffles.

220
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:23,156
No syrup?

221
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:36,203
Hi. How's it going?
I'm, uh, Daniel Jackson.

222
00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:45,357
Sorry to bother you. I just wanted
to know if I could borrow your syrup.

223
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:51,441
Technically, it's not gonna be borrowing,
cos I'm not gonna give back what I use.

224
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,236
Enjoy your meal.

225
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:03,120
Hi, guys. How's it going?

226
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:12,444
- They're not going to talk to you.
- Why not? Who are they?

227
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:15,479
Others. You're not one of them yet.

228
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:18,076
You mean Ancients.

229
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:21,077
- A couple of them.
- What are they doing here?

230
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:23,838
- Watching.
- Me?

231
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,881
Me too.

232
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:29,355
I told you before, they're always watching.

233
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:32,194
You wanted some motor oil?

234
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:43,963
I wish you had blown that thing up
when you had the chance.

235
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:48,038
We had to at least be sure that all
the replicators really were eliminated.

236
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:52,164
And even though we apparently
did get rid of them all in this galaxy,

237
00:20:52,245 --> 00:20:55,237
there may be more elsewhere
that could be a threat again.

238
00:20:55,325 --> 00:20:59,762
So we wanted to try to figure out how the
device worked in case we needed it again.

239
00:20:59,845 --> 00:21:02,757
Great. Well, now the Jaffa have something

240
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,554
that can blow up the entire universe
with the push of a button.

241
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:09,762
The Jaffa will defend Dakara
with their lives.

242
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:13,281
You wanna explain to me
why they don't wanna wreck it?

243
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:16,163
The ruins at Dakara
have become a symbol of freedom.

244
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:19,282
The Jaffa believe
the device's power helped free them

245
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,720
by destroying the replicators.

246
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:26,321
They believe controlling this power will
help ensure their freedom in the future.

247
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:29,363
And get them virtually anything they want.

248
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:33,074
- The Jaffa would never use it to that end.
- Jack is right.

249
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:36,999
No one should have
that kind of power at their disposal.

250
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,043
Sorry. I thought I'd turned it off.

251
00:21:49,885 --> 00:21:54,083
So, we're all in agreement?
One way or another, it's gotta go.

252
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:56,042
Correct?

253
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,083
- Indeed.
- Thank you.

254
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:04,000
If you suggest we destroy this device
against the wishes of the High Council,

255
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:07,316
I must point out that would not be
a good first step in relations

256
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:11,557
between the Tauri
and the newly-formed free Jaffa nation.

257
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:18,239
Why don't you do it?
They already hate the Tok'ra.

258
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,715
To be honest,
a plan may already be in the works,

259
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:25,593
but as you know, Selmak and I
aren't fully in the loop any longer.

260
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,004
Mm.

261
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:29,076
Ahem.

262
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:33,155
- Yes?
- Sorry to interrupt, sir.

263
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:38,035
Colonel, there's a call for you.
Apparently it's urgent.

264
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:43,396
Sorry.

265
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,036
Carter.

266
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,878
We have arranged
a meeting of the Jaffa council.

267
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:55,355
We hope to strengthen the bond
between previously warring Jaffa

268
00:22:55,445 --> 00:22:57,356
by focusing on our common enemy.

269
00:22:57,445 --> 00:22:59,720
Yeah, I know.
It's not a good time right now.

270
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:02,444
There are still many Goa'uld
who remain a threat.

271
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:05,323
I know. I'm sorry.

272
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:08,795
I don't know.
It could be an hour, it could be all day.

273
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:10,921
Yeah, I know.

274
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:13,565
OK. Yeah, me too.

275
00:23:13,645 --> 00:23:15,636
Bye.

276
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:20,361
- Sorry about that, sir.
- Emergency?

277
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:23,084
No, no. Just a... a misunderstanding.

278
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:27,681
Hey, weren't you supposed to meet
Pete at the florist this morning?

279
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,403
No, Dad.

280
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:34,359
No, I'm sure that's what you said.
For the wedding.

281
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:37,445
I know.

282
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:43,154
- Go ahead, Carter. It is your day off.
- It's OK.

283
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:47,284
Teal'c and Bra'tac are meeting with
the Jaffa. There's nothing to do here.

284
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:49,879
Go pick flowers.

285
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:57,636
What?

286
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:05,873
- More coffee?
- Sure.

287
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,243
- Can you sit a minute?
- OK.

288
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:16,164
Oh, how am I supposed to put it?

289
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:18,713
Man, are my dogs tired.

290
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,796
That's good.

291
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:25,281
- How were your waffles?
- Best I ever had.

292
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:33,436
Can you tell me why you stopped me from
killing Anubis last time I was ascended?

293
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:37,962
If I didn't stop you, the Others would have.
They wouldn't have been as nice about it.

294
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:40,798
They wouldn't have erased my memory
and left me naked?

295
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:43,194
That was your choice.

296
00:24:43,285 --> 00:24:45,674
OK, maybe not the naked part.

297
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:50,081
I didn't totally erase your memory
even though I was supposed to.

298
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:53,362
There. OK. Why is it OK
to break some rules and not others?

299
00:24:57,605 --> 00:25:00,483
You knew I had a problem
following the rules last time.

300
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,079
Why offer me ascension again?

301
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:10,641
I didn't wanna see you die without
at least giving you a second chance.

302
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:13,603
Look. I have trouble following the rules.

303
00:25:13,685 --> 00:25:16,643
I'm not really supposed
to help people ascend.

304
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:20,843
- You're supposed to do it on your own.
- But you do it.

305
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:26,921
I walk the line. Believe me, I crossed it
a few times and paid for it dearly.

306
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:35,763
My point is, you just need to be willing
to put your prior human existence

307
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:38,040
into the proper context.

308
00:25:43,285 --> 00:25:45,435
Sorry. I gotta get back to work.

309
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:51,596
Coffee, please.

310
00:25:56,325 --> 00:26:00,284
- Chocolate or vanilla?
- I'm sorry. What?

311
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:03,801
The cake. In case you can't make
the meeting with the caterer.

312
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:07,958
Oh! I'm sorry.
l-l really do wanna be a part of this.

313
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:11,515
- I hope so. It's your wedding too.
- I know.

314
00:26:13,045 --> 00:26:16,720
I realise this must be weird for you,
worrying about place settings

315
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:19,399
when we could be destroyed
by aliens any minute.

316
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:21,476
A little.

317
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:27,162
We're not about to be destroyed
by aliens, are we?

318
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:29,713
No.

319
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:32,273
Because you seem a bit distracted.

320
00:26:32,365 --> 00:26:34,401
I'm sorry.

321
00:26:34,485 --> 00:26:38,524
- So, did Dad like me?
- Of course. Why wouldn't he?

322
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:42,883
- Tough guy to read.
- You just have to get to know him.

323
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:49,164
- How about Selmak?
- Ah. He thought you were very charming.

324
00:26:49,245 --> 00:26:53,397
- For a human.
- Well, generally speaking, that's my type.

325
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:55,476
Good.

326
00:26:55,565 --> 00:26:59,843
- Did I tell you I have a surprise for you?
- No. What is it?

327
00:26:59,925 --> 00:27:01,756
Tricky.

328
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:03,836
You'll see.

329
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:08,037
The council remains unwilling
to destroy the weapon

330
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:12,801
for fear it will weaken the resolve of the
Jaffa to stand united against the Goa'uld.

331
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:16,764
You realise we have to consider
that thing a threat to our security.

332
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,403
Indeed.

333
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:22,114
The council recognises the danger
and has decided to take action

334
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:25,083
by aggressively seeking out
and killing Anubis.

335
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:28,157
Once that threat has been eliminated,

336
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:31,203
they will reassess the decision
to destroy the device.

337
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:34,357
Well, we don't even know
if Anubis can be killed yet, do we?

338
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:37,437
We must not suggest
to the Jaffa that he cannot be.

339
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:41,518
At the very least, we can eliminate
the remainder of the forces of Anubis.

340
00:27:41,605 --> 00:27:45,075
I believe this quest will unite
many of the still-fractured armies

341
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,759
by giving them focus on a common goal.

342
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:50,120
Got anything to go on?

343
00:27:50,925 --> 00:27:53,962
Many Kull were killed
in battle with the replicators.

344
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:56,923
Intelligence indicates
Anubis may be marshalling

345
00:27:57,005 --> 00:27:59,473
the remaining Kull warriors on Tartarus.

346
00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:02,955
A pre-emptive strike is being prepared.

347
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,276
It is the point.

348
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:36,159
- Hey.
- Hey.

349
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:39,043
Daniel. How's it going?

350
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:42,640
Do we know each other?
l-l feel like I know you.

351
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:46,001
Call me Jim. We ran into each other
last time you were ascended.

352
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:49,077
Ah. Nice to meet you again.

353
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:55,285
Still haven't made up your mind, huh?
Death or everlasting enlightenment.

354
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:57,595
Don't really see the choice, myself.

355
00:28:57,685 --> 00:29:02,475
Yeah, of course I don't wanna be dead.
It's just that, uh...

356
00:29:02,565 --> 00:29:07,002
Listen. The reason I came
over here was to ask you...

357
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:09,997
Why are you talking to me?

358
00:29:10,085 --> 00:29:13,839
Oh, you mean because these other snobs
won't even look at you?

359
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:17,076
I'm different. Like Oma.

360
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:20,475
Really? I got the impression
you two don't quite see eye to eye.

361
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:24,240
What, that little...? Oh, that was nothing.

362
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:32,043
We both operate somewhat outside
the normal rules and regulations.

363
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:36,562
Sometimes we disagree on how far
outside we should go, that's all.

364
00:29:36,645 --> 00:29:39,478
- Really.
- Yeah.

365
00:29:39,565 --> 00:29:44,400
As long as these other guys
don't strike me down, I figure I'm OK.

366
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:46,919
I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out.

367
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:51,795
I feel like if I agree to ascend, I'm signing
a contract and I don't know what it says.

368
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:55,798
Obviously, I had a little trouble
with the fine print the last time.

369
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:57,796
You sure did.

370
00:29:57,885 --> 00:30:00,524
You know about that?

371
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:03,324
It's all out there.

372
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:07,394
I just don't see
how I can agree to stand by

373
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:12,320
and let Anubis destroy
every living thing in an entire galaxy.

374
00:30:12,405 --> 00:30:14,202
I know.

375
00:30:14,285 --> 00:30:16,480
That's a tough one.

376
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:23,560
Speaking of which,
have you seen the latest?

377
00:30:30,885 --> 00:30:34,844
He's a crafty one.
Really knows the ins and outs of the rules.

378
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:37,758
I give him three-to-one odds to succeed.

379
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:40,234
Wanna know the irony of it all?

380
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:46,719
That device was originally used by the
Ancients to create life in the Milky Way.

381
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:51,397
Well, recreate it
after the whole plague thing.

382
00:30:51,485 --> 00:30:53,794
No kidding.

383
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,957
Now it all gets undone
with the push of one button,

384
00:30:57,045 --> 00:31:01,163
leaving Anubis to recreate things
all over to his own liking.

385
00:31:01,245 --> 00:31:05,602
There's a waste of a million-odd
years of evolution, huh?

386
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,800
I say someone should really
do something to stop him!

387
00:31:14,525 --> 00:31:16,516
No one will.

388
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:20,960
Can I get a coffee?

389
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,273
- Can I open them now?
- Almost.

390
00:31:35,085 --> 00:31:37,076
OK. Now.

391
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:41,914
- What do you think?
- Uh...

392
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:44,837
Well, uh...

393
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:46,722
- Speechless, huh?
- Yeah.

394
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:50,275
Isn't it great?
Remember our first night together?

395
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:53,994
- You described the house you wanted.
- I can't believe this.

396
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:58,920
The kitchen isn't yellow, but we can paint.
Come on. I'll show you.

397
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:02,759
And you're not gonna believe
the back yard. The dog's gonna love it.

398
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:04,836
Dog?

399
00:32:08,925 --> 00:32:11,200
This is bad.

400
00:32:11,285 --> 00:32:16,962
Yeah. But this pie is great,
and there's nothing to wash it down with.

401
00:32:18,285 --> 00:32:22,563
Can you do anything to stop Anubis?
You said someone should do something.

402
00:32:22,645 --> 00:32:24,840
I did, didn't I?

403
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:30,442
Well, as far as what can be done,
it's kinda complicated.

404
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:33,403
Yeah, so Oma tells me.

405
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,919
I don't think she's told you everything.

406
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:39,077
- What does that mean?
- I'm saying...

407
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:42,798
- I've already said too much.
- No, you haven't.

408
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:46,560
In fact, you've hardly said anything at all.

409
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:52,123
You gave up eternal enlightenment,

410
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:55,914
all the knowledge
and power of the universe.

411
00:32:56,005 --> 00:33:00,601
- Why do you think you did that?
- To fight for humanity any way I could.

412
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:02,960
Yes. Very big of you.

413
00:33:03,045 --> 00:33:06,276
You rejected everything Oma offered you,

414
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:10,677
and now she gives you another chance
based on the goodness of her heart?

415
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:14,599
Well, that is the point, isn't it?
I mean, she is ascended. She is good.

416
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:16,596
Sure. Best intentions.

417
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:19,040
Do you know what happened
between me and Oma?

418
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:22,515
Why did I choose
to take human form again?

419
00:33:23,565 --> 00:33:26,318
You should ask Oma.

420
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:01,241
Hi, sir.

421
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:02,997
Carter.

422
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:05,519
I'm sorry to bother you at home like this...

423
00:34:05,605 --> 00:34:09,120
- How did you know I was here?
- I saw the smoke.

424
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:11,799
Oh. Yeah.

425
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:15,355
Look, is-is this OK?
I mean, I could have called first, but...

426
00:34:15,445 --> 00:34:18,403
No. Yeah. I mean, it's fine.

427
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:20,956
So, um...

428
00:34:22,485 --> 00:34:27,923
What brings you to this neck of the woods
on such a fine day? My back yard.

429
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:32,157
Well, actually, I've been sitting
in your driveway for the last ten minutes

430
00:34:32,245 --> 00:34:35,840
trying to work up the nerve
to come and talk to you.

431
00:34:37,245 --> 00:34:41,682
The truth is, I've been trying to work up
the nerve for a lot longer than that.

432
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:44,358
Oh?

433
00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:50,840
- Pete put a down payment on a house.
- Well, that's great.

434
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:52,995
It's a beautiful house.

435
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:57,234
But...?

436
00:34:57,325 --> 00:35:02,638
The-the truth is I'm having
second thoughts about the wedding.

437
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,522
Why?

438
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:07,677
The thing is, the closer it gets,
the more I get the feeling

439
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:11,440
that I'm making a big, huge mistake.

440
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:20,324
Look, Carter, I don't know what...

441
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:24,080
I'm sorry to bother you with this, but, uh...

442
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,316
there's a very good reason
that I'm bothering you with this,

443
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:30,841
and if I don't tell you now, I might never...

444
00:35:30,925 --> 00:35:34,804
Jack, I looked everywhere.
I could not find...

445
00:35:36,565 --> 00:35:39,079
- Colonel Carter.
- Hi.

446
00:35:40,525 --> 00:35:44,074
- Ms Johnson.
- Yeah... l-l didn't...

447
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:48,636
We were just meeting here
in my back yard on this fine day

448
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:51,956
to discuss the state of affairs.

449
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:58,076
- Well, this is awkward.
- You think?

450
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:04,678
Jack didn't want anyone at the SGC
to know about, uh... us.

451
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:08,644
No, look, I... I'm sorry. This is my fault.

452
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:12,718
I really... I shouldn't have come by
unannounced like this.

453
00:36:12,805 --> 00:36:16,161
Well, you know,
now that the cat's out of the bag...

454
00:36:16,245 --> 00:36:18,839
You're here. Why don't you just stay?

455
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:23,919
I'm sure there's enough charred meat
on the grill for all three of us.

456
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:26,075
No, thank you. I...

457
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,116
It's the, uh, SGC.

458
00:36:34,805 --> 00:36:37,365
Colonel Carter.

459
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,355
What? When?

460
00:36:44,565 --> 00:36:46,521
OK. I'm on my way.

461
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,199
l-l gotta go. It's my dad.

462
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:10,714
Well, you can't stay here forever,
you know.

463
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:14,639
Actually, I suppose you could.
I just don't know why you'd want to.

464
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:17,193
Except for the great service.

465
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:24,757
Look. Obviously, I don't wanna just die.
I don't suppose there's any other options?

466
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:28,394
I can't get into it.
What's stopping you from ascending?

467
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:30,715
I don't know.

468
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:36,395
Must be something holding you back,
making you doubt yourself.

469
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:38,840
Maybe it's not me I'm doubting.

470
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:44,916
Look. Whether you choose to accept
living on a higher plane of existence

471
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:49,157
has nothing to do with me
or anything that I can or can't tell you.

472
00:37:49,245 --> 00:37:52,874
- It's all up to you.
- There is something you're not telling me.

473
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:55,559
Did Jim say that?
You shouldn't listen to him.

474
00:37:55,645 --> 00:37:58,239
- Why not?
- Because.

475
00:37:58,685 --> 00:38:00,676
Good answer.

476
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:03,358
Yes.

477
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,316
Dad?

478
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:09,885
I'm sorry, kiddo. We both are.

479
00:38:09,965 --> 00:38:14,436
- About what? What's going on?
- I didn't wanna ruin everything like this.

480
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,561
Dad...

481
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,954
It's Selmak. He's dying.

482
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:21,001
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

483
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:25,442
It's OK. He's OK. He led a pretty full life.

484
00:38:25,525 --> 00:38:29,040
I didn't live with Jolinar long,
but I have some idea what it's like.

485
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:32,834
Well... this is a little different, Sam.

486
00:38:32,925 --> 00:38:36,600
When a Tok'ra symbiote dies
they can prevent their host from dying,

487
00:38:36,685 --> 00:38:39,358
as Jolinar did with you.

488
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:44,155
The problem is, that last selfless act
requires a certain amount of energy

489
00:38:44,245 --> 00:38:46,634
and a conscious effort.

490
00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:49,237
What are you saying?

491
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:53,364
By all rights, Selmak should have
been dead weeks ago.

492
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:55,515
I wouldn't let him go.

493
00:38:55,605 --> 00:39:01,601
I felt we needed him, that I needed him
to help you stop the replicators.

494
00:39:01,685 --> 00:39:02,754
Dad...

495
00:39:04,645 --> 00:39:07,113
He hung on as long as he could.

496
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:12,325
Then he slipped into a coma just after
we activated the weapon on Dakara.

497
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:15,602
You've known all this time since then?

498
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:18,794
I didn't wanna spoil your wedding.

499
00:39:18,885 --> 00:39:21,877
You know, I thought we could make it.

500
00:39:25,485 --> 00:39:27,635
We?

501
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:31,159
He's barely alive.

502
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:37,564
I'm gonna die with him, Sam.

503
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:51,163
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

504
00:39:51,245 --> 00:39:53,600
Doing whatever she does
when she's not here.

505
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,641
- You ask her?
- Yep.

506
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:58,239
- Wouldn't tell you?
- Nope.

507
00:39:58,325 --> 00:40:02,716
Had to find out for yourself last time, too.
Man, were you pissed.

508
00:40:02,805 --> 00:40:04,796
About what?

509
00:40:06,245 --> 00:40:08,236
Tell me.

510
00:40:13,045 --> 00:40:15,605
What do you know about Anubis?

511
00:40:15,685 --> 00:40:18,153
I know he's half ascended,
whatever that means.

512
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:23,877
There are many planes of existence
between human existence and ascension.

513
00:40:23,965 --> 00:40:27,878
Basically, the Others
use their collective powers

514
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:32,243
to keep him from effecting anything
on a grand, cosmic level.

515
00:40:32,325 --> 00:40:34,714
But it's OK for him
to destroy an entire galaxy.

516
00:40:34,805 --> 00:40:40,675
It's OK to do anything he could have done
back when he was a regular old Goa'uld.

517
00:40:40,765 --> 00:40:42,756
I see.
What does this have to do with Oma?

518
00:40:42,845 --> 00:40:47,282
Goa'ulds are bad.
Anubis is as bad as they come.

519
00:40:48,565 --> 00:40:51,921
- And...?
- And...

520
00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:58,038
Ascension requires that somebody
be pure of spirit, good to the very core.

521
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:02,084
- How does someone like Anubis ascend?
- Now he's getting it.

522
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:04,599
Oma would never help
somebody like Anubis.

523
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:07,802
- Not on purpose.
- You're saying he tricked her somehow?

524
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:09,921
Rule number one.

525
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:14,044
No lone ascended being
shall help a Lower ascend.

526
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:16,320
Lowers are what we call
humans and such.

527
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:20,398
If you deserve to be here, you should
be able to get here on your own.

528
00:41:20,485 --> 00:41:23,363
If there's an exception,
for whatever reason,

529
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:25,913
a majority vote by the collective
can get you in.

530
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:29,793
But Oma thinks she knows better,
and she's taken her licks for it.

531
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:32,843
For the most part,
she's brought good people on board.

532
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:35,723
But as the old saying goes,
nobody's perfect,

533
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:39,718
not even us higher beings.

534
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:43,959
Oma helped Anubis ascend.

535
00:41:46,565 --> 00:41:48,203
Get out.

536
00:41:48,285 --> 00:41:50,276
Get out now.

537
00:41:53,965 --> 00:41:56,957
Well, look at the time. I've gotta go, kid.

538
00:41:57,045 --> 00:41:59,275
Business to attend to.

539
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:01,754
It was nice talking to you.

540
00:42:30,845 --> 00:42:35,475
A number of the Tok'ra have responded.
They wanna pay their respects.

541
00:42:35,565 --> 00:42:38,159
They can come.

542
00:42:38,245 --> 00:42:42,124
I can't believe there's nothing they can do.

543
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:44,355
They can remove a Goa'uld.

544
00:42:44,445 --> 00:42:49,041
In the last few years, you've almost
perfected the process of saving a host.

545
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:54,961
That process instantly kills the symbiote
before it releases toxins.

546
00:42:55,525 --> 00:42:58,323
It's too late for that, Sam.

547
00:42:58,405 --> 00:43:00,396
I'm sorry.

548
00:43:00,485 --> 00:43:02,794
I hate to do this to you,

549
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:07,764
but I should have been dead
four years ago.

550
00:43:07,845 --> 00:43:12,123
Since then,
I've been all over the galaxy.

551
00:43:13,565 --> 00:43:16,602
I've done things
most men never dream of.

552
00:43:17,405 --> 00:43:20,124
I've heard that before.

553
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:23,481
I just wanna know you're gonna be happy.

554
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:26,761
I am.

555
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:30,159
Don't let rules stand in your way.

556
00:43:31,765 --> 00:43:34,279
What are you talking about?

557
00:43:34,365 --> 00:43:38,119
You joined the air force because of me.

558
00:43:38,205 --> 00:43:40,639
I love my job.

559
00:43:45,885 --> 00:43:50,515
You can still have everything you want.

560
00:43:51,925 --> 00:43:54,234
I do, Dad.

561
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,996
Really.

562
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:16,358
How's Colonel Carter's father?

563
00:44:17,165 --> 00:44:20,555
- Doesn't look good.
- Sorry to hear that.

564
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,036
Closing the door.

565
00:44:31,165 --> 00:44:33,076
Yeah.

566
00:44:33,165 --> 00:44:35,440
Deeply symbolic.

567
00:44:35,525 --> 00:44:37,516
Really?

568
00:44:38,645 --> 00:44:40,761
I really like you.

569
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,881
We're good together.

570
00:44:44,045 --> 00:44:46,036
Yes.

571
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:49,436
We are.

572
00:44:51,845 --> 00:44:53,642
But...

573
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:55,716
You have issues.

574
00:44:55,805 --> 00:44:58,114
It's OK. We all do.

575
00:44:58,205 --> 00:45:02,801
There's just one big one in particular
that I don't think I can love with.

576
00:45:02,885 --> 00:45:04,876
Live with.

577
00:45:05,805 --> 00:45:09,639
I need to get out
before I get more involved.

578
00:45:09,725 --> 00:45:15,277
We can still work together, can't we?
I'd hate to have to ask for reassignment.

579
00:45:15,365 --> 00:45:20,280
This is really important to me.
We agreed this would never affect the job.

580
00:45:20,365 --> 00:45:22,560
- We did.
- Good.

581
00:45:26,845 --> 00:45:29,723
You know, there's just one thing
I don't understand.

582
00:45:29,805 --> 00:45:31,796
Just one?

583
00:45:32,845 --> 00:45:36,201
Is the air force the only thing
keeping you two apart?

584
00:45:36,285 --> 00:45:38,515
Rules and regulations?

585
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:42,484
Cos if it is, you're making
a very big mistake.

586
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:45,363
And you know what I should do?

587
00:45:45,445 --> 00:45:47,481
- Retire.
- Again?

588
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:51,843
You're considered invaluable
to the programme by the Pentagon.

589
00:45:51,925 --> 00:45:56,999
But the president has appointed
a civilian to run the SGC before.

590
00:45:59,765 --> 00:46:01,756
Just a thought.

591
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:28,604
The time has come for this ancient warrior
to fight one final battle.

592
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,721
I think not, old man.

593
00:46:30,805 --> 00:46:35,560
This victory will present us with new
challenges that will require your wisdom.

594
00:46:35,645 --> 00:46:39,604
What our people will require
is a youthful, vital leadership,

595
00:46:39,685 --> 00:46:42,199
and others are
better suited to provide that.

596
00:46:42,285 --> 00:46:46,597
You are only as old
as you believe yourself to be.

597
00:46:46,685 --> 00:46:49,483
Talk to me in 50 years.

598
00:46:50,965 --> 00:46:53,035
Indeed I will.

599
00:47:00,005 --> 00:47:02,200
So, it's true.

600
00:47:02,285 --> 00:47:04,879
He tricked me.

601
00:47:04,965 --> 00:47:07,160
How? You couldn't tell?

602
00:47:08,365 --> 00:47:10,515
No.

603
00:47:10,605 --> 00:47:15,281
He must have found some old
Ancient research on ascension.

604
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:18,880
When he came to Kheb,
he knew what he was doing.

605
00:47:18,965 --> 00:47:24,961
When I realised the horrible mistake that I
had made, I tried to undo it but I couldn't.

606
00:47:26,005 --> 00:47:28,314
That's when the Others stepped in.

607
00:47:28,405 --> 00:47:31,363
They only sent him halfway back.
Why not all the way?

608
00:47:31,445 --> 00:47:35,916
- It's complicated.
- Yeah. What isn't around here?

609
00:47:36,005 --> 00:47:38,565
They warned him.

610
00:47:38,645 --> 00:47:41,318
He wasn't allowed to use
any knowledge or power

611
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:45,478
unless he otherwise
would have gained it as a Goa'uld.

612
00:47:45,565 --> 00:47:49,353
I don't understand.
They let him wreak havoc.

613
00:47:50,445 --> 00:47:54,484
They don't care if he destroys
all life in the galaxy, life they created.

614
00:47:54,565 --> 00:47:58,683
They haven't stopped me
from continuing my work.

615
00:48:00,525 --> 00:48:03,961
I've tried to make up for it,
help when I can.

616
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:07,721
It's your punishment.

617
00:48:09,325 --> 00:48:12,476
You're forced to watch,
powerless to interfere.

618
00:48:12,565 --> 00:48:16,160
They let Anubis do whatever he wants
just to punish you.

619
00:48:16,245 --> 00:48:18,395
I told you. The galaxy you're from,

620
00:48:18,485 --> 00:48:22,080
the plane of existence
is so small and insignificant

621
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,281
compared to the rest of the universe.

622
00:48:24,365 --> 00:48:27,198
I don't care. It's wrong.

623
00:48:29,205 --> 00:48:31,355
That's what you said last time.

624
00:48:36,805 --> 00:48:38,796
Excuse me.

625
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:43,079
Isn't it enough already?

626
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:47,522
I mean, a whole galaxy of innocent people
enslaved and tortured for generations,

627
00:48:47,605 --> 00:48:51,598
now on the verge
of being destroyed for nothing.

628
00:48:52,885 --> 00:48:55,160
For what?

629
00:48:55,245 --> 00:48:59,318
For one mistake a good person made
trying to do a good thing.

630
00:48:59,405 --> 00:49:01,635
The least you could do is listen to me.

631
00:49:01,725 --> 00:49:06,435
That can't be against
the grand highfalutin cosmic rules!

632
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:10,043
Hey, I'm talking to you!

633
00:49:15,885 --> 00:49:19,480
OK. OK.

634
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:22,079
Well, I know you can hear me.

635
00:49:22,885 --> 00:49:26,321
Hasn't she suffered enough already?

636
00:49:27,525 --> 00:49:31,996
And certainly enough other people
have suffered to punish her.

637
00:49:33,045 --> 00:49:37,004
- Don't you think you've made your point?
- Daniel, they don't.

638
00:49:37,085 --> 00:49:40,361
I keep breaking the same rule,
helping people ascend.

639
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:43,005
That's why you're here.

640
00:49:43,085 --> 00:49:45,280
What if you stopped?

641
00:49:46,405 --> 00:49:49,044
Wouldn't undo the problem.

642
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:51,798
That's why I keep doing what I do.

643
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:56,958
Anubis can't be killed.
Not by you, not by me.

644
00:50:16,845 --> 00:50:19,917
He is not here. No one is here.

645
00:50:20,005 --> 00:50:23,475
- The defences were automated.
- We have been deceived.

646
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:27,717
Anubis fed us this intelligence
to lure us here.

647
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:31,036
Our forces defending Dakara are depleted.

648
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,923
We could not have known, brother.

649
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:41,121
You were right. The device at Dakara
should have been destroyed at all costs.

650
00:51:11,925 --> 00:51:13,916
You OK?

651
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:17,114
Actually, I'm fine.

652
00:51:17,205 --> 00:51:22,802
Good, even, strange as that sounds.
I thought I lost him four years ago.

653
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:29,159
Since then, we've been closer
than we ever were my whole life.

654
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:35,165
In a way, Selmak gave me the father
I never thought I'd know.

655
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:39,716
Come here.

656
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:47,234
Thank you, sir.

657
00:51:47,325 --> 00:51:49,361
For what?

658
00:51:49,445 --> 00:51:51,640
For being here for me.

659
00:51:54,605 --> 00:51:56,596
Always.

660
00:52:03,845 --> 00:52:05,836
I'm ready.

661
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:34,958
I love you.

662
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:12,276
- Can I get a coffee?
- Get it yourself.

663
00:53:12,965 --> 00:53:15,160
Don't mind if I do.

664
00:53:17,845 --> 00:53:20,837
Ooh. Hey, Danny boy, you see the paper?

665
00:53:20,925 --> 00:53:24,076
- No. What's it say?
- The trick worked.

666
00:53:24,165 --> 00:53:27,714
Those stupid Jaffa took half their ships
to hunt down Anubis.

667
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:31,480
Meanwhile, his army was poised
to attack Dakara.

668
00:53:31,565 --> 00:53:35,399
The remaining rebel Jaffa
guarding Dakara are being slaughtered.

669
00:53:35,485 --> 00:53:41,003
It's only a matter of time before
old Anubis gets his hands on the weapon.

670
00:53:41,085 --> 00:53:44,316
I'm sorry.
You sound almost happy about that.

671
00:53:44,405 --> 00:53:48,193
- Who, me?
- Yeah. What do you have against Oma?

672
00:53:48,285 --> 00:53:51,436
- Daniel...
- No. I wanna know.

673
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:55,757
I mean, you're not just watching.
You're coming in here to rub it in.

674
00:53:55,845 --> 00:53:58,359
Why are you taking pleasure
in her punishment?

675
00:53:58,445 --> 00:54:03,041
Me? I don't have anything against Oma.
I think she's great, don't I?

676
00:54:04,565 --> 00:54:07,955
Hell, she's the one that helped me ascend.

677
00:54:11,325 --> 00:54:13,600
You got it now.

678
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:18,835
You are Anubis.

679
00:54:22,845 --> 00:54:24,836
Cheers.

680
00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:38,038
I knew from the beginning.

681
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:42,004
I guess I just thought
when you said yes that...

682
00:54:46,765 --> 00:54:49,233
that you were worth the risk.

683
00:54:49,325 --> 00:54:51,714
Don't say I deserve better.

684
00:54:53,805 --> 00:54:58,196
- It can't get much better than you.
- That's not true.

685
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:02,437
I wish I could believe
this had to do with your father.

686
00:55:02,525 --> 00:55:05,801
You needed some time to sort things out.

687
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:13,474
I guess all I can say is
I hope you get what you want.

688
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,513
That's it?

689
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:21,996
What do you want? You want me
to get down on my knees and beg?

690
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:24,553
God, no. Of course not.

691
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,396
I just...

692
00:55:29,645 --> 00:55:33,081
I thought you would react differently.

693
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:39,556
- Bye, Sam.
- Pete...

694
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:02,998
The rebel fleet guarding Dakara
has fallen to the forces of Anubis.

695
00:56:03,085 --> 00:56:09,240
The remaining rebel ships will not arrive
in time. Anubis now controls the weapon.

696
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:13,716
We find the biggest damn nuke we can
and we shove it through the gate now.

697
00:56:13,805 --> 00:56:19,038
Anubis will have the gate shielded.
The nuke will not arrive in one piece.

698
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,958
If we dial the Alpha site
we may prevent the weapon

699
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,434
from connecting a wormhole
to either planet.

700
00:56:24,525 --> 00:56:29,315
- It may only buy us the 38 minutes that...
- Go. Go. Just go.

701
00:56:32,085 --> 00:56:34,918
Sergeant, dial the Alpha site now.

702
00:56:40,445 --> 00:56:43,915
- Wait a minute. That's not me.
- What?

703
00:56:44,005 --> 00:56:46,724
I don't know.

704
00:56:48,765 --> 00:56:51,120
Incoming wormhole.

705
00:56:52,645 --> 00:56:56,684
- That won't stop the weapon energy.
- If it is the weapon.

706
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:01,360
- No iris codes.
- We're too late.

707
00:57:02,645 --> 00:57:03,794
Self-destruct.

708
00:57:03,885 --> 00:57:08,276
That won't destroy the gate. There's only
a remote chance it would disengage a...

709
00:57:08,365 --> 00:57:10,481
Carter! Carter...

710
00:57:15,325 --> 00:57:17,919
You make a great cup of coffee.

711
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:24,480
Well, gotta go.

712
00:57:35,925 --> 00:57:40,601
There's nothing you can do.
You don't have the power.

713
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:43,074
But I do.

714
00:57:53,325 --> 00:57:55,885
- You can't kill me either.
- I can fight you.

715
00:57:55,965 --> 00:57:58,195
- Well, you can't win.
- It won't matter.

716
00:57:58,285 --> 00:58:00,799
You won't be able to do anything
but fight me back.

717
00:58:00,885 --> 00:58:05,083
- What are you gonna do?
- I should have done it a long time ago.

718
00:58:05,165 --> 00:58:06,837
Oh, no.

719
00:58:06,925 --> 00:58:08,563
No. No!

720
00:58:08,645 --> 00:58:10,317
No!

721
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:59,157
- Wormhole disengaged.
- What's going on?

722
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:02,760
I don't know.
Must be some kind of system malfunction.

723
00:59:02,845 --> 00:59:05,723
- That's impossible.
- Shut it off.

724
00:59:06,885 --> 00:59:09,877
Aborting self-destruct.

725
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:20,281
The Kull warriors became
disorganised and confused,

726
00:59:20,365 --> 00:59:22,560
as though they no longer
knew what to do.

727
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:27,400
- They no longer had a master to serve.
- After that, they were easily defeated.

728
00:59:27,485 --> 00:59:29,476
Many Jaffa lost their lives.

729
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:34,320
Those that survived are united
as never before, and we are in agreement.

730
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,794
The weapon must be destroyed.

731
00:59:36,885 --> 00:59:39,001
Well, that's good.

732
00:59:39,085 --> 00:59:41,645
A new memorial
will be erected in its place,

733
00:59:41,725 --> 00:59:45,035
so that our triumph over the Goa'uld
will never be forgotten.

734
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:47,798
I still don't quite understand
what happened.

735
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:51,241
Anubis is about to push the button
that ends life in the galaxy,

736
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:53,839
and the next minute he's just gone.

737
00:59:54,405 --> 00:59:57,203
Indeed. It is a great mystery.

738
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:01,598
One can only assume
he was vanquished by some means.

739
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:04,961
If not, why would he forfeit
the weapon and his army?

740
01:00:05,045 --> 01:00:07,798
- You think?
- I do.

741
01:00:07,885 --> 01:00:12,401
It's the only thing that would explain
the self-destruct not going off.

742
01:00:12,485 --> 01:00:16,876
- Of what do you speak?
- O'Neill believes Daniel is responsible.

743
01:00:16,965 --> 01:00:19,354
Nope. It wasn't me.

744
01:00:20,805 --> 01:00:23,365
Anybody else hear that?

745
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:26,039
I'm in here.

746
01:00:28,245 --> 01:00:30,236
That's Daniel.

747
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:35,205
- Don't! Don't come in.
- Ho!

748
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:38,315
Hey, there.

749
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:58,236
It's a long story.

750
01:01:10,685 --> 01:01:13,916
- This is great.
- I told you.

751
01:01:14,005 --> 01:01:17,042
Can't believe
we didn't do this years ago.

752
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:19,320
Yes, well,

753
01:01:19,405 --> 01:01:21,396
let's not dwell.

754
01:01:24,205 --> 01:01:28,278
- There are no fish in this pond, are there?
- Nope.

755
01:01:42,005 --> 01:01:43,996
Nice.

756
01:02:44,005 --> 01:02:47,441
