1
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:07,777
<i>Previously on "Stargate SG-1".</i>

2
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:11,178
- Who are you people?
- We are replicators.

3
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:14,101
- The others would destroy me.
- Not if you came with us.

4
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:15,541
You would do that?

5
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:17,425
<i>They won"t leave me. She promisedl</i>

6
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:20,102
No, my son. They've made a fool of you.

7
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:24,824
I have been relieved of command.

8
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:27,980
- Who's replacing you, sir?
- Her name is Dr Elizabeth Weir.

9
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:31,060
- A civilian?
- She's an expert in international politics.

10
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:33,139
<i>Terre Atlantus.</i>

11
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:36,379
Are you saying the Lost City
of the Ancients is here?

12
00:00:36,468 --> 00:00:40,302
The city we've been looking for
is under the ice of Antarctica.

13
00:00:44,468 --> 00:00:46,584
Goodbye.

14
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,938
- Dr Weir.
- Elizabeth.

15
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:12,818
I can't believe we're finally going. I know
I should've been ready a long time ago...

16
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:15,900
The talks have stalled again.

17
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:21,062
- You're kidding me.
- It's a complicated situation.

18
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:25,184
The Antarctic Treaty
was established to promote research.

19
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:29,784
With the interest of progress for
all mankind, not just the United States.

20
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:33,781
So argue the other 11 nations
all claiming shared jurisdiction.

21
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:37,827
Article One states there can be
no establishment of any military base

22
00:01:37,908 --> 00:01:40,183
and no testing of any weapons.

23
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:43,465
You saw first-hand
how powerful the Ancient outpost is.

24
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:46,016
Meanwhile, Jack stays
in a stasis pod there?

25
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:50,340
He sacrificed himself to save us.
All of us, not just this country.

26
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:56,139
I know. But the scale of Anubis' attack
makes covering it up tenuous at best.

27
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:59,823
To keep the world from finding out
all about the Stargate,

28
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:04,299
we need the full cooperation of every
government aware of what's going on.

29
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:10,463
- It's just gonna take more time.
- While we just sit here and do nothing?

30
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,504
I'm sorry, Dr Jackson.

31
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:16,025
Daniel.

32
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:18,385
Daniel.

33
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:30,067
- Why can't we use the gate?
- It's not that we can't use it.

34
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:33,299
Officially, normal gate activity
will remain suspended

35
00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:37,063
until the agreement for control
of the Antarctic site is resolved.

36
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:39,708
What does one have to do with the other?

37
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:43,224
We still have full jurisdictional control
over the Stargate.

38
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:46,584
The president feels that how
we proceed with operations at SGC

39
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:49,102
will reflect on our international goodwill.

40
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,863
In other words,
it's our political leverage in negotiations.

41
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:54,984
I would never say that.

42
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:59,265
What about Colonel O'Neill?

43
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:02,067
Look, I know what he means
to the three of you.

44
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:05,140
We all appreciate the sacrifice
Colonel O'Neill made.

45
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,378
The Asgard can help him.

46
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:11,222
Last time, they erased the knowledge
from his mind before it killed him.

47
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:13,663
We've tried contacting them.
What can we do?

48
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:18,185
You know we helped the Asgard trap the
replicators in a time-dilation field on Hala.

49
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:21,180
Something to that effect.
A couple of years ago, right?

50
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:24,658
We know that that trap
is only gonna hold them for so long.

51
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:27,626
Thor and the Asgard
must be monitoring the situation.

52
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,859
If we can get there,
we should be able to contact them.

53
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:33,906
- Isn't the planet in another galaxy?
- Othala.

54
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:38,857
O'Neill used his knowledge to modify
the Goa'uld vessel in our possession.

55
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:42,941
According to your report, that ship
is capable of flying faster and farther

56
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:47,624
- than anything the Goa'uld have.
- Yes. I think it might just get us there.

57
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,347
And back?

58
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:54,182
That may be a problem. There's a chance
the trip will burn out the engines.

59
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:58,819
That's a big problem. If you get there and
it turns out you can't contact the Asgard?

60
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:01,980
We're willing to take the risk.

61
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,582
As admirable as that is,

62
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:08,136
I can't let you do it.

63
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:10,344
For what reason?

64
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:15,104
O'Neill fended off Anubis' fleet using
the weapons from the Ancient outpost.

65
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:19,943
Hopefully, that will make the Goa'uld think
twice before attacking Earth in the future.

66
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,816
But we don't know if we're gonna be able
to ever use those weapons again.

67
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:27,696
If we can't, we're gonna need
a new tactical advantage over the Goa'uld.

68
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:32,942
That's what the Pentagon tells me. The
modified cargo ship is too valuable now.

69
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:36,100
I'm sorry. Request denied.

70
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,066
What can I do for you, Major?

71
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:04,140
I want you to reconsider my request.

72
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:08,787
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,543
That cargo ship was modified
using the knowledge of the Ancients.

74
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:18,658
There is no guarantee that anyone will
ever be able to figure out how it was done.

75
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:22,297
And as the most likely person
on the planet to figure it out,

76
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:28,065
are you saying if I don't let you attempt
to contact the Asgard, you won't even try?

77
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:30,503
I would never say that.

78
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:37,859
Right now, that is the most advanced
piece of technology we have.

79
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:40,985
If it weren't for O'Neill,
we wouldn't have that ship.

80
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:45,698
For that matter,
we wouldn't even be here discussing this.

81
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:52,617
We got the coordinates
from the <i>Prometheus.</i>

82
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,098
Based on how long it took the ship
to get from Taonas to Earth,

83
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:59,339
I'm estimating our trip to Othala
will take roughly ten days.

84
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:00,781
Hey.

85
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:04,543
So, uh, how'd you talk Weir
into letting us go?

86
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:06,744
I didn't.

87
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:10,703
I talked her into letting us go.
You're staying here.

88
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:16,856
Even with the modifications,
there's no guarantee it'll get us there.

89
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:19,382
And if it does,
it may well burn out the engines.

90
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:21,823
The ship was never meant
to fly at that speed,

91
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,264
so if we don't find the Asgard,
we'll be stranded.

92
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:27,100
I know.

93
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:29,465
We need you here.

94
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:33,461
You're our best chance at deciphering
the information in that outpost.

95
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:37,143
If we fail, you will be O'Neill's only hope.

96
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:51,219
Hey, Teal'c.

97
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:56,463
Can I get you anything? I packed turkey -
I know it's your favourite.

98
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:59,267
Thank you, but I am not currently hungry.

99
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:02,385
Have you determined
how O'Neill modified the engines?

100
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:04,982
No. I'm just taking a break.

101
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:10,301
I didn't think it would be easy, but
at least it's a good way to pass the time.

102
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:13,380
I'm sorry. Have I been ignoring you?

103
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:17,545
I am fine.

104
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:22,546
I thought working on the engines
would help take my mind off O'Neill,

105
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:27,861
which is kinda silly, considering
he's the one who modified them.

106
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:32,306
Look, I know this plan
isn't exactly foolproof.

107
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:34,982
I have never plotted
an intergalactic course.

108
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:37,901
If the coordinates are off
by one half of a per cent,

109
00:08:37,988 --> 00:08:42,823
we could wind up 10,000 light years
from our destination.

110
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:48,298
But, still, trying to stay positive.

111
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:51,906
I have the utmost confidence
in your ability.

112
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:54,183
I know.

113
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:57,817
- So, you wanna talk?
- Concerning what subject?

114
00:08:57,908 --> 00:09:00,297
I don't know. How's Rya'c?

115
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:02,185
Fine.

116
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:07,907
- You still keeping in touch with Ishta?
- Indeed.

117
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:10,900
- Bra'tac?
- Bra'tac is well.

118
00:09:10,988 --> 00:09:15,664
- Come on, Teal'c. Throw me a bone here.
- How is Pete Shanahan?

119
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:18,182
He's fine.

120
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:26,424
- Is not all well between the two of you?
- No! Everything's great.

121
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:30,979
It's just, as you know, it's not easy saying
goodbye to someone you care about

122
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:35,744
when you think there's a chance
you may never see them again.

123
00:09:35,828 --> 00:09:41,186
I know that's a risk we take every time
we step through the Stargate, but...

124
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:43,987
Still, try to stay positive.

125
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:49,217
I'll get you a sandwich.

126
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:02,303
- Daniel.
- Elizabeth.

127
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:04,822
Just wondering if you'd heard anything.

128
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:07,820
They're still bogged down.

129
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,342
- It's been over a week.
- What do you expect?

130
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:13,943
Quick round of handshakes,
champagne toast, seal the deal?

131
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:16,747
We were attacked
by an armada of alien ships.

132
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:19,900
If that doesn't get us past
our distrust, what will?

133
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:23,822
You forget those alien ships
were destroyed by a single weapon.

134
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:26,741
That kind of power
will give anyone cause for concern.

135
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:30,821
Yeah. Not that I want this to come off
as an attempt to get rid of you, but...

136
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:36,540
isn't this sort of international negotiation
exactly your area of expertise?

137
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:40,946
<i>Unauthorised offworld activation.</i>

138
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:50,499
We're receiving a signal.
It's a text message.

139
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:55,341
- It's Goa'uld.
- What does it say?

140
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:58,898
It's from one of the System Lords.
Camulus, Celtic god of war.

141
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:04,221
- I'm not familiar with him.
- We never had contact with him before.

142
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:08,499
- Wow.
- Uh, yeah, of course, "Wow".

143
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:12,263
Sorry. It says he wants to arrange
a meeting to negotiate a treaty.

144
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:14,908
A Goa'uld wants to arrange
a treaty with us?

145
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:17,456
Not just one Goa'uld - all of them.

146
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:20,062
The System Lords.

147
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:23,424
They wanna send representatives here.

148
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,456
Preparing to emerge from hyperspace.

149
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:33,823
When we drop out, I'll broadcast a signal.

150
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:37,059
If the Asgard are monitoring the region,
they should find us.

151
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,416
Should we not be able to see the planet?

152
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:52,987
Yes.

153
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:59,983
We're experiencing
an extremely powerful gravitational force.

154
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:04,459
Something's not right. Teal'c, turn us
around and get us outta here, now.

155
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:07,745
Hyperspace generator will not engage.

156
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,900
Sublight engines are at maximum,
yet we are not moving.

157
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:15,857
There's only one thing I know of that
could create this kind of gravitational pull.

158
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:25,267
You're sure this is
an accurate translation?

159
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:27,418
Pretty much.

160
00:12:27,508 --> 00:12:29,942
What do you make of it?

161
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:34,658
- To be honest, I'm not sure what to think.
- They did come here once to negotiate.

162
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:38,946
Yeah, with the Asgard. Not with us.
Earth just served as neutral territory.

163
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:42,657
For them to want to meet with us
as equals is extremely unusual.

164
00:12:42,748 --> 00:12:44,898
Maybe we gained respect in their eyes.

165
00:12:44,988 --> 00:12:47,582
They must have heard
what happened to Anubis.

166
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:51,263
They couldn't defeat him
with all their forces. We did it in a day.

167
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:53,942
Which may explain
why they wanna come here.

168
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:55,939
Yeah. To see how we did it.

169
00:12:58,348 --> 00:13:04,139
It's pretty much what we expected. We
burned out the hyperdrive getting here.

170
00:13:04,228 --> 00:13:06,458
- That is unfortunate.
- Even if it worked,

171
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:11,463
it'd be dangerous to open a window this
close to the event horizon of a black hole.

172
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:13,584
- Are we that far off course?
- No.

173
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:18,184
We came out of hyperspace where we
were supposed to. It doesn't make sense.

174
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:21,704
Hala's sun wasn't massive enough
to collapse into a black hole.

175
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:25,622
Yet that is what appears to be happening.

176
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:30,907
I'll see if I can get a little more
out of the sublight engines.

177
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:45,305
The president has authorised me
to pursue negotiations with the Goa'uld.

178
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:46,582
OK.

179
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,183
You don't think I can handle it?

180
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:54,625
I didn't say that, but if I may,
you don't sound all that confident.

181
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,223
I have brokered my share
of international negotiations.

182
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:02,267
This will just be
my first interplanetary one.

183
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:05,658
The System Lords can't be trusted,
as a group or individuals.

184
00:14:05,748 --> 00:14:10,583
They're posturing egomaniacs
driven by an insatiable lust for power.

185
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:14,138
Each one capable of unimaginable evil.

186
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:19,985
See, why should I be nervous? Sounds
like an average day at the United Nations.

187
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,697
Look, I'm not afraid
to admit that I need help.

188
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:26,256
So what can you tell me?

189
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,778
The High Council of the System Lords
is a flimsy coalition

190
00:14:32,868 --> 00:14:37,384
of the most powerful Goa'ulds in the
galaxy, who cooperate when it suits them.

191
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:40,380
Numbers vary. New ones rise up,
old ones get knocked off.

192
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:43,778
There's a dozen now. I can put together
a summary of what we know.

193
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:45,301
All right.

194
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:49,506
I assume I can't just open the Iris
and let the representatives walk through.

195
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,500
No. That would probably be a bad idea.

196
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:56,979
We should get them to meet us at a
neutral location, a planet of our choosing.

197
00:14:57,068 --> 00:15:01,664
Send a team, check them out, make sure
they're unarmed, then escort them back.

198
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:03,901
Good.

199
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:05,660
Send the message.

200
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,866
We are being pulled backwards.
We'll have to divert power from the shield.

201
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:22,667
They're the only thing
holding the ship together.

202
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:25,308
Drop them
and the field could tear us apart.

203
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:28,858
I do not believe there is any other choice.

204
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:34,265
Diverting power.

205
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:41,224
We are now moving forward.

206
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:45,381
It's not gonna be good enough.
We're losing hull integrity.

207
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:52,061
We've got a hull breach!

208
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:57,980
Greetings.

209
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:00,981
Thor.

210
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:05,141
It is good to see you again,
Major Carter, Teal'c.

211
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:08,059
Likewise.

212
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:10,423
Indeed.

213
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:12,897
Your timing is impeccable.

214
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:19,577
So, the Goa'uld have agreed
to our terms for their travel here.

215
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,465
Yeah.

216
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:26,021
I was just going over
some material on the delegates.

217
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:28,417
Camulus sent the original message.

218
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:34,219
Then there's Amaterasu, Japanese sun
goddess, and the last one is Lord Yu.

219
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,786
- Yu?
- Don't.

220
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:39,621
Every joke, every pun, done to death.
Seriously.

221
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,018
I just thought I remembered reading
he was not himself.

222
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:47,943
Of course, for a Goa'uld,
what that means exactly I'm not sure.

223
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:51,338
- Please, continue.
- He can no longer take on a new host.

224
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:56,422
The powers of the sarcophagus are losing
effectiveness. He's suffering from old age.

225
00:16:56,508 --> 00:16:59,227
He's senile.
Why choose him as a representative?

226
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:03,460
- His underlings may be covering for him.
- The other System Lords don't know.

227
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:06,585
Lord Yu was the one System Lord
who opposed Anubis' desire

228
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:10,263
to be reinstated to the Council
after his banishment. Long story.

229
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:13,738
He fell out of favour when
the other Lords accepted Anubis back

230
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:16,103
and he used his power
to become the leader.

231
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:21,023
Now that Anubis has gone, you think the
balance of power has shifted back to Yu.

232
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:24,578
On the bright side, Yu has been
the most cooperative in the past.

233
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:28,581
- I thought none could be trusted.
- They can't. Especially not a crazy one.

234
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:30,659
Huh. That's the bright side?

235
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,506
More of a slightly less dark side.

236
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:39,980
I am afraid I cannot leave this sector,
Major. Not at the moment.

237
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:43,299
Thor, you're the only one
who can save Colonel O'Neill.

238
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:46,585
As you said, he is being preserved
in stasis at the moment.

239
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:51,025
I will be glad to return with you to Earth
when my mission here is completed.

240
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:52,621
What is your mission?

241
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:56,747
I must wait here until I am certain
the replicators have been destroyed.

242
00:17:56,828 --> 00:18:00,218
You may have noticed Hala's sun
has collapsed into a black hole.

243
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:02,458
Just before our ship's back was torn off.

244
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:06,302
I'm sorry I did not reach you sooner.
I was not expecting you.

245
00:18:06,388 --> 00:18:09,425
You didn't respond
to our attempts to contact you.

246
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:13,137
I am sorry. Time-space distortions
caused by the black hole

247
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:16,777
have been interfering with my ship's
long-range communications.

248
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:20,065
- Understandable.
- Indeed, for some.

249
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:23,106
The time-dilation field
was only a temporary measure.

250
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:26,578
We knew the time it took
for the replicators to reach the machine

251
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:29,899
would translate to less than two years
outside the field.

252
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:33,344
Therefore,
a more permanent solution was devised.

253
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:35,896
So you collapsed the sun?

254
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:40,061
By artificially increasing
its gravitational field, yes.

255
00:18:40,148 --> 00:18:42,537
That's pretty cool.

256
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:48,343
As you can see,
the planet has already broken apart.

257
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,738
But a number of replicators
have managed to come together

258
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:55,457
in a coherent mass
that has yet to pass the event horizon.

259
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:59,700
Even if they withstand the force
without being torn apart, there's no way...

260
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:03,337
- Interesting.
- What is it?

261
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:07,216
The mass of replicator blocks
are moving away from the event horizon.

262
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:11,301
- How is that possible?
- They have the time-dilation device.

263
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:14,061
I do not know how,
but they seem to have used it

264
00:19:14,148 --> 00:19:18,107
to counteract the gravitational effects
that should be pulling them in.

265
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:19,780
Frightening.

266
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:23,065
Not only that they can do that,
but that you don't know how.

267
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:25,503
I agree.

268
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:29,343
They are picking up speed.

269
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:32,784
Scans indicate
the blocks have formed together.

270
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:35,336
- Into what?
- A ship.

271
00:19:35,428 --> 00:19:37,988
They are escaping.

272
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:42,141
Their course indicates
they are headed this way.

273
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:49,378
Thought you were gonna stand me up.

274
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:53,256
Yeah, sorry.
Heard anything from Teal'c and Sam?

275
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:54,747
No.

276
00:19:57,428 --> 00:20:02,582
Receiving a signal, ma'am.
SG-7 reports we have a green light.

277
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:07,417
Open the Iris.

278
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:26,536
Welcome to Earth.
Allow me to introduce...

279
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:29,381
We are not interested in your name.

280
00:20:29,468 --> 00:20:33,780
- Really. I find it generally helps so much.
- We prefer to present our offer,

281
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:38,066
so we can spend as brief a time
as possible on this planet.

282
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,583
Right this way.

283
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:01,698
- Have you seen anything like it?
- No.

284
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:05,542
And it is doubtful my ship's weapons
will be effective against it.

285
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:10,748
We should probably get outta here, then,
huh? Can you jump into hyperspace?

286
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:15,185
We must clear the gravitational
distortion field of the black hole first.

287
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:20,497
They have fired upon us.

288
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:25,582
- Can it penetrate your shields?
- It is more than likely.

289
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:29,345
Brace for impact.

290
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:38,061
- The hull has been breached.
- Where?

291
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:44,577
The damage is minimal. The projectile
was likely composed of replicators.

292
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:46,738
They are not visible to my scanners.

293
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:49,740
This is how they have boarded
Asgard ships in the past.

294
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:52,786
Can you prevent decompression
in those sections?

295
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:54,665
Yes.

296
00:22:07,548 --> 00:22:09,778
Your unexpected defeat of Anubis

297
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:13,338
has created an unstable situation
among the System Lords.

298
00:22:13,428 --> 00:22:16,067
In order to avoid open war,
we came to an agreement

299
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:19,106
to divide his territories
and his armies evenly.

300
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:21,543
How civilised of you.

301
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:25,587
Yes. Unfortunately, one among us
has broken that agreement.

302
00:22:25,668 --> 00:22:28,944
Oh, no, don't-don't tell me.
Let me guess. It's, um...

303
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:30,666
- Baal.
- Baal.

304
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:35,185
He learned the location of the planet
where Anubis created his Kull Warriors.

305
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:38,624
Baal got there first and programmed
the soldiers to serve him.

306
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:43,498
With those <i>orak</i> at his command, Baal has
tipped the balance of power in his favour.

307
00:22:43,588 --> 00:22:45,499
- <i>Orak?</i>
- Unspeakable.

308
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:49,945
In battle, the Kull
are far superior to the Jaffa.

309
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:53,816
Already, many among us
have begun to speak of capitulation,

310
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:56,945
much as they did with Anubis.

311
00:22:57,028 --> 00:23:00,862
If that happens,
Baal will indeed be unstoppable.

312
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:06,227
This is all very interesting, I'm sure,
but I fail to see what it has to do with us.

313
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:21,899
My master wishes to say it is well known
the Tauri possess a powerful weapon.

314
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:24,661
Something far beyond
their current technology.

315
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:28,138
Yes. We used it to kill Anubis
and destroy his fleet.

316
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:34,781
By means of this weapon, Baal can be
prevented from conquering the galaxy.

317
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:29,259
Major Carter!

318
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:35,701
Thor, it is Teal'c. Major Carter was
beamed away. Is she in your presence?

319
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:39,906
I did not do it.
The replicators must have her.

320
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:59,226
I have eliminated
all of the replicators I could locate.

321
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:02,266
There is no way of knowing
if there are more.

322
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:05,067
The replicator ship
has entered hyperspace.

323
00:25:05,148 --> 00:25:07,616
- Can you follow?
- Yes.

324
00:25:14,268 --> 00:25:16,498
If Baal defeats us,

325
00:25:16,588 --> 00:25:20,058
how long do you think it will be
before he turns his attention to you?

326
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:22,867
If he does,
he'll suffer the same fate as Anubis.

327
00:25:22,948 --> 00:25:24,506
Perhaps.

328
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:26,818
But there are other worlds in this galaxy

329
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:29,502
without the luxury
of such advanced defences.

330
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:32,307
What are you talking about?

331
00:25:32,388 --> 00:25:36,222
We could not help but notice
that the Asgard did not come to your aid

332
00:25:36,308 --> 00:25:39,186
when Anubis threatened your planet.

333
00:25:39,268 --> 00:25:43,102
In fact, we've heard nothing
from the Asgard for quite some time now.

334
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:46,225
Really? That's odd,
cos we talk to them all the time.

335
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:49,937
The Asgard didn't come
because they knew it wasn't necessary.

336
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:52,064
Baal believes otherwise.

337
00:25:52,148 --> 00:25:56,539
He is convinced that the Asgard can
no longer exercise power in this galaxy.

338
00:25:56,628 --> 00:26:01,622
He intends to take the planets protected
under the Goa'uld-Asgard treaty.

339
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:07,021
If you do not help us stop him,
millions of humans will die.

340
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:10,623
And millions more will be enslaved.

341
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:18,898
- Do you know its destination?
- Before you destroyed them,

342
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:22,139
the replicators managed
to access the ship's computer.

343
00:26:22,228 --> 00:26:27,746
They learned the location of Orilla, where
we are trying to rebuild our civilisation.

344
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:32,185
- I assumed it would be their first target.
- What is your reasoning?

345
00:26:32,268 --> 00:26:37,103
Orilla is rich in neutronium, which is
a key element in Asgard technology,

346
00:26:37,188 --> 00:26:42,785
and is also essential for the creation
of human-form replicators.

347
00:27:07,788 --> 00:27:11,064
- Major Carter.
- Fifth.

348
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:13,742
I imagine you never expected
to see me again.

349
00:27:13,828 --> 00:27:17,537
Look, I'm sorry we left you behind,
but we had to do it.

350
00:27:17,628 --> 00:27:22,543
We couldn't risk the others getting out.
You know what they're capable of.

351
00:27:23,148 --> 00:27:25,821
- I know you must be upset.
- Upset?

352
00:27:25,908 --> 00:27:28,342
We betrayed you. It must have hurt.

353
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:32,259
See, that's the part of you
that's most like us.

354
00:27:32,348 --> 00:27:35,021
The human part of you.

355
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:38,945
- I understand how you feel.

356
00:27:40,548 --> 00:27:42,379
You couldn't.

357
00:27:42,468 --> 00:27:45,778
But I promise, you will.

358
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,901
How many planets
are protected under this treaty?

359
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,626
Um, 26.

360
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,858
27 if you include Earth.

361
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:17,782
And what good is it if the Asgard
aren't available to protect anything?

362
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:22,100
At one time, they were. More recently,
we've traded on the threat - a big bluff.

363
00:28:22,188 --> 00:28:27,057
- Well, Baal is about to call the bluff.
- There's nothing we can do about that.

364
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:29,787
Earth is safe if the Goa'uld
think we can defend it.

365
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:34,066
- But that's a bluff too.
- Yeah. More or less.

366
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:37,106
When I was a kid,
my dad had these weekly poker games.

367
00:28:37,188 --> 00:28:41,500
All I remember is smoke making my eyes
water. I wish I'd paid more attention.

368
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:43,977
You've misrepresented the truth before.

369
00:28:44,068 --> 00:28:47,743
No. My job has usually been
to get people to recognise the truth.

370
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:51,298
If they get a hint that we can't use
the Ancient weapons for defence,

371
00:28:51,388 --> 00:28:54,186
trust me, this game is over.

372
00:28:55,748 --> 00:28:59,900
- Too dramatic?
- At this point, not for me.

373
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:11,504
- How can we stop them?
- My weapons do not work in hyperspace.

374
00:29:11,588 --> 00:29:14,739
Much like the shields.
However, in close proximity,

375
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:18,537
the self-destruct may be sufficient
to eliminate both ships.

376
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:21,096
I am sorry, but we have no choice.

377
00:29:21,188 --> 00:29:23,622
If the human-form replicators reach Orilla,

378
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:27,826
they will have the resources
to replicate many thousands of times.

379
00:29:27,908 --> 00:29:30,741
We cannot allow that to happen.

380
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:33,140
So be it.

381
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:50,144
- Why are you doing this?
- You think you deserve better?

382
00:29:50,228 --> 00:29:55,018
You can see my thoughts.
You know I didn't wanna do it.

383
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:58,145
I suppose in a way I should thank you.

384
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:03,097
It was because of what you did to me
I came to realise my full potential.

385
00:30:03,188 --> 00:30:05,656
I am more human than the others.

386
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:08,216
At first I thought it was weakness,

387
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:12,620
but now I see
it makes me capable of so much more.

388
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:14,460
Fifth, please.

389
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:20,225
My brothers and sisters will devour
entire civilisations in order to replicate,

390
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:23,266
but they will know nothing of cruelty,

391
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:25,737
or betrayal,

392
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:28,740
or revenge.

393
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,219
Not like us.

394
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:34,139
Isn't that right...

395
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:38,466
Major Carter?

396
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:40,186
No.

397
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:52,463
We appreciate this information,
but it doesn't change the fact

398
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:55,938
that we can't get involved
in any internal Goa'uld dispute.

399
00:30:56,028 --> 00:31:00,658
If Baal tries to attack any of the protected
planets, he'll suffer the consequences.

400
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:03,308
We do not share your faith in the Asgard.

401
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:05,948
We must stop Baal before it comes to that.

402
00:31:06,028 --> 00:31:09,623
You'll forgive my bluntness,
but that's not our problem.

403
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:11,903
Enough!

404
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:18,138
With each passing moment,
Anubis grows more powerful.

405
00:31:19,788 --> 00:31:22,177
You mean Baal.

406
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:26,466
My master is fatigued.
We request a short adjournment.

407
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:28,618
Silence!

408
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:32,780
I need no adjournment.

409
00:31:35,428 --> 00:31:38,784
We know you have
a formidable new defensive weapon.

410
00:31:38,868 --> 00:31:41,940
But with it, you must wait
for your enemies to come to you.

411
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:44,747
And that can be dangerous.

412
00:31:44,828 --> 00:31:49,344
What if an enemy were to devise
a means of defeating this weapon?

413
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:51,419
What exactly are you offering?

414
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:53,499
Hyperdrive engines.

415
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:57,376
We know you have battleships
not capable of interstellar travel.

416
00:31:57,468 --> 00:32:01,063
We are offering you a means
of producing a fleet of ships

417
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:04,663
as advanced as the Goa'uld
Ha'tak vessels.

418
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:11,260
You could take the fight to the enemy.

419
00:32:18,348 --> 00:32:20,737
We are almost within range.

420
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:35,298
Now.

421
00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:41,617
We are slowing down.

422
00:32:45,108 --> 00:32:48,623
Something is interfering with the controls.

423
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:53,782
The auxiliary control console
outside the engine room.

424
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:04,421
Your offer is very generous,
but I'm afraid we're gonna have to decline.

425
00:33:04,508 --> 00:33:09,628
You would be able to uphold the treaty
with or without the aid of the Asgard.

426
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:14,338
- How many hyperdrives will you give us?
- How many ships can you build?

427
00:33:14,428 --> 00:33:18,865
I think the real question is,
how many ships do you have?

428
00:33:18,948 --> 00:33:22,179
To enforce this treaty ourselves,
we need to build enough ships

429
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,623
to match any fleet that would oppose us.

430
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,744
We are not at liberty to disclose that.

431
00:33:26,828 --> 00:33:31,822
- Well, then this discussion is over.
- How can you blithely reject this offer?

432
00:33:31,908 --> 00:33:35,981
We won't fight your battles for you
in exchange for a few hyperdrive engines

433
00:33:36,068 --> 00:33:38,787
that may or may not
do us any good in the long run.

434
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:42,941
And especially since we already have
that technology at our disposal.

435
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:46,657
- You have viable hyperdrive technology?
- Yes, we do.

436
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:50,627
With the help of the Asgard, we are
in the process of implementing it now.

437
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:52,539
So thank you very much.

438
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:57,179
This Ancient weapon -
such an advanced piece of technology.

439
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,180
The power requirements
must be enormous.

440
00:34:00,268 --> 00:34:03,544
Even simple maintenance
must be extremely difficult,

441
00:34:03,628 --> 00:34:06,017
given your limited capabilities.

442
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:10,738
- We manage.
- Of course, <i>we</i> believe you.

443
00:34:10,828 --> 00:34:14,707
But I wonder what Baal would think
if he were to receive intelligence

444
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:19,066
that the weapon was...
temporarily out of commission.

445
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:22,743
Mm. He would come to this world
to claim it for himself.

446
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:27,663
- The Tauri would have to destroy him.
- And we would have to give them nothing.

447
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:31,980
Oh, come on. Baal would never fall for
that. He knows how desperate you are.

448
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:34,582
He might find this information
a bit convenient.

449
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:38,104
Perhaps, but you leave us few options.

450
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:39,746
OK.

451
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,422
We'll do it.

452
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:44,419
We will?

453
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:46,897
In exchange, we want Baal's territory.

454
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:50,776
- What do you mean?
- Well, that's the way it works, right?

455
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:55,896
When one System Lord kills another,
he takes over his armies, fleet, planets.

456
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:59,981
That's what we want.
Everything in Baal's possession.

457
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:01,945
You cannot be serious.

458
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:06,465
If we're gonna destroy Baal for you,
why should we settle for anything less?

459
00:35:06,548 --> 00:35:09,346
- Preposterous.
- We can't accept those terms.

460
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:11,498
Take it or leave it.

461
00:35:16,028 --> 00:35:19,225
We must send a message
to the other System Lords

462
00:35:19,308 --> 00:35:22,027
to advise them of the current situation.

463
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:23,905
Go ahead.

464
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:38,262
- The problem has been eliminated.
- <i>The replicators are beyond reach.</i>

465
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:43,945
We are too late to stop them from
reaching the new Asgard home world.

466
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:52,937
I guess you did learn something
from your father's poker games.

467
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,178
Always bet big when bluffing?

468
00:35:55,268 --> 00:35:57,657
I didn't know you wanted
to be a System Lord.

469
00:35:57,748 --> 00:35:59,978
I had to do something
to keep them talking.

470
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:03,185
It looked like they'd draw Baal here
no matter what we said.

471
00:36:03,268 --> 00:36:05,828
We can be sure
they won't agree to our terms.

472
00:36:05,908 --> 00:36:07,899
I know.

473
00:36:10,308 --> 00:36:13,505
We may have to revive Colonel O'Neill.

474
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,227
What?

475
00:36:18,308 --> 00:36:21,539
If they suspect we're bluffing,
they'll take the weapon.

476
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:23,778
If not, they'll trick Baal into coming.

477
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:28,180
Either way, we may actually have to use
that weapon again to defend this planet.

478
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:31,021
We don't know
if there's enough power to fire a shot.

479
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:32,302
I know.

480
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:35,505
If you try to revive Jack

481
00:36:35,588 --> 00:36:39,183
In fact, he'll probably die
before he can do anything to help us.

482
00:36:39,268 --> 00:36:40,587
Dr Weir.

483
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:46,186
Here's a copy of the message the Goa'uld
sent back to the System Lords. It's coded.

484
00:36:46,268 --> 00:36:49,465
We need to know what they're thinking.

485
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:01,862
I managed to send
advance warning to Orilla.

486
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:05,384
By providing them with
the replicator ship's course and speed,

487
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:09,381
they have a fair approximation
of where it will drop out of hyperspace.

488
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:12,858
What ships we have available
will be waiting in ambush.

489
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:16,657
The ships can destroy the replicators
before they raise their shields?

490
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:19,706
They will only be defenceless
for a few moments,

491
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:24,578
but if my calculations are accurate,
that should be sufficient.

492
00:37:29,908 --> 00:37:32,058
Stop it, please!

493
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:34,104
Why should I?

494
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:37,938
You can't change what happened.

495
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:40,383
Is this making you feel better?

496
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:44,057
I never intended to abandon you.

497
00:37:44,148 --> 00:37:45,661
But you did.

498
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:49,146
You gained my trust,
then you used me and left me behind.

499
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:52,618
- It wasn't my decision.
- You could've come back for me.

500
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,938
- There was no time!
- Time!

501
00:37:56,068 --> 00:38:00,778
Thanks to what you did, I had plenty
of time to think about what a fool I was.

502
00:38:00,868 --> 00:38:03,018
I'm sorry.

503
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:05,542
I'm sorry for what we did to you.

504
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,665
Yes.

505
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,944
You are now.

506
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:17,938
Part of being human
is having compassion.

507
00:38:18,028 --> 00:38:20,098
Learning to forgive.

508
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,066
Yes.

509
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:25,662
I'm not there yet.

510
00:38:25,748 --> 00:38:27,386
I need more time.

511
00:38:46,508 --> 00:38:48,624
- Progress?
- Yeah.

512
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:53,304
What we suspected. They think we're
bluffing, but have no way to confirm that,

513
00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:55,299
so they're not sure what to do.

514
00:38:55,388 --> 00:38:57,982
They could let Baal figure it out for them.

515
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:01,344
That's dangerous for them.
If we can't power the weapons...

516
00:39:01,428 --> 00:39:05,137
- Which we can't.
- ..Baal would get Earth and the outpost.

517
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:09,221
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

518
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:16,384
This is Weir. What's happening?

519
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:19,947
OK. We'll be right down.

520
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:22,337
Our guests just got a response.

521
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:33,223
<i>Commander Thor,</i>
<i>this is Aegir of the "Valhalla".</i>

522
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:36,857
<i>We have assumed defensive positions</i>
<i>and await the target ship.</i>

523
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:38,939
Understood.

524
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:54,462
<i>The enemy ship has been</i>
<i>destroyed.</i>

525
00:39:56,588 --> 00:39:58,783
I am sorry, Teal'c.

526
00:40:07,228 --> 00:40:11,380
I need to see the most recent
message they received.

527
00:40:18,388 --> 00:40:22,779
It's unfortunate you're being recalled.
I thought we were making good progress.

528
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:27,942
Your demands are ridiculous. We have
no choice but to terminate negotiations.

529
00:40:28,028 --> 00:40:30,496
Well, give my regards to Baal.

530
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:46,984
Shut it down.

531
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:48,865
What?

532
00:40:55,868 --> 00:40:58,382
- What is the meaning of this?
- Second message.

533
00:40:58,468 --> 00:41:01,107
The System Lords
are testing our defences.

534
00:41:01,188 --> 00:41:06,740
They're sending a ship to attack Earth.
It'll be here within the hour.

535
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:10,979
We are dignitaries.
How dare you prevent us from leaving!

536
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,866
Sending ships here to attack us
is an act of war -

537
00:41:13,948 --> 00:41:16,621
and a foolish one, given our defences.

538
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,460
My lord did not order such action.

539
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:21,460
Then undo it. Tell the System Lords
to call the ship back.

540
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:23,982
Their decision is one of desperation,

541
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:26,787
forced upon them
by your unwillingness to help.

542
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:29,666
Persuading them to change
could only be done in person.

543
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:33,502
- With a full Council vote.
- Even if I did believe you,

544
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:36,705
our good faith
is out the window at this point.

545
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:39,905
You're our prisoners. Take them away.

546
00:41:56,468 --> 00:41:59,221
- <i>Greetings, Thor.</i>
- Greetings.

547
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:04,063
Teal'c, this is Penegal
of the Asgard High Council.

548
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:09,666
<i>I regret to report that the debris from</i>
<i>the replicator ship could not be contained.</i>

549
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:15,664
<i>We were unable to prevent replicator</i>
<i>blocks from raining down on Orilla.</i>

550
00:42:15,748 --> 00:42:20,264
<i>They have already begun replicating</i>
<i>and infesting our systems.</i>

551
00:42:20,348 --> 00:42:22,543
<i>Control of the city is in jeopardy.</i>

552
00:42:22,628 --> 00:42:25,540
Should you not consider
evacuating your people?

553
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:27,664
<i>That is no longer possible.</i>

554
00:42:28,148 --> 00:42:31,618
There are too many.
We carried numerous stored minds

555
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:34,825
aboard our ships' computers
when we fled our home world.

556
00:42:34,908 --> 00:42:37,024
When Orilla was finally found,

557
00:42:37,108 --> 00:42:40,020
we were able to place those minds
into cloned bodies

558
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:42,417
so that we could build our new colony.

559
00:42:42,508 --> 00:42:47,457
<i>The replicators have already infected</i>
<i>systems needed to save those minds.</i>

560
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:51,621
<i>If we lose this battle,</i>
<i>they will perish along with their bodies,</i>

561
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:54,825
<i>taking with them</i>
<i>the hope of the Asgard race.</i>

562
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:58,867
Orilla is the last chance
of ever rebuilding our empire.

563
00:42:58,948 --> 00:43:01,701
Then we must find a way to save it.

564
00:43:13,588 --> 00:43:16,227
Sir, sensors have detected an alien vessel.

565
00:43:16,308 --> 00:43:20,347
It exited hyperspace 14,000km out,
eight degrees starboard.

566
00:43:20,428 --> 00:43:22,419
- Designation?
- None yet, sir.

567
00:43:22,508 --> 00:43:27,423
Vessel is the size of a Goa'uld mothership.
Closing fast. Visual range in six seconds.

568
00:43:27,508 --> 00:43:30,341
- Hold your position. Prepare to fire.
- Four, three...

569
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:33,101
On screen. Maximum magnification.

570
00:43:36,668 --> 00:43:42,061
Open a channel. Broadcast on all
frequencies and translate into Goa'uld.

571
00:43:45,508 --> 00:43:50,184
This is Colonel Lionel Pendergast of
the United States Air Force <i>Prometheus.</i>

572
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:54,625
Unidentified vessel, failure to reply
will constitute an act of aggression

573
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:58,621
and we will respond
with the full force of our weapons.

574
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:01,859
- <i>That will be unnecessary.</i>
- Teal'c.

575
00:44:01,948 --> 00:44:05,623
<i>I offer greetings from Thor,</i>
<i>supreme commander of the Asgard fleet.</i>

576
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:07,858
<i>We are aboard the "Daniel Jackson".</i>

577
00:44:10,228 --> 00:44:13,425
I have just received word
that the Asgard have arrived

578
00:44:13,508 --> 00:44:16,705
to witness the demonstration
of our defence technology

579
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:19,177
that you have forced us into.

580
00:44:19,828 --> 00:44:22,058
There's still time to call off the attack.

581
00:44:22,148 --> 00:44:25,458
We would also like
to witness the demonstration.

582
00:44:26,068 --> 00:44:30,425
Your ship isn't coming.
It was destroyed en route by Baal.

583
00:44:30,508 --> 00:44:35,184
The collective forces of the System Lords
are bowing, and you're losing the war.

584
00:44:35,268 --> 00:44:37,623
Then so are you.

585
00:44:49,748 --> 00:44:53,741
- Hey, guys!
- Our new colony is in grave jeopardy.

586
00:44:53,828 --> 00:44:57,138
The replicators escaped
from the time-dilation device,

587
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:59,696
and are threatening to destroy the Asgard.

588
00:44:59,788 --> 00:45:02,507
OK. So, what can we do?

589
00:45:02,588 --> 00:45:05,148
The Ancient knowledge in O'Neill's mind

590
00:45:05,228 --> 00:45:08,504
may be the key to defeating
the replicators once and for all.

591
00:45:08,588 --> 00:45:11,022
Jack's frozen down in Antarc...

592
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:15,579
..tica.

593
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:24,303
As I was saying, where's Sam?

594
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:28,506
She was captured by the replicators.
Their ship was destroyed.

595
00:46:43,908 --> 00:46:48,504
Hey, sleepyhead.
Didn't think you'd ever get up.

596
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:51,227
It was kind of a long night, huh?

597
00:46:52,028 --> 00:46:53,825
Pete.

598
00:46:56,508 --> 00:46:59,227
What's up? You OK? Is something wrong?

599
00:46:59,308 --> 00:47:01,538
Yes. Everything.

600
00:47:01,628 --> 00:47:04,017
- What do you mean?
- This.

601
00:47:04,108 --> 00:47:06,542
What are you doing here?

602
00:47:06,628 --> 00:47:10,223
What am I doing here?
Where the hell is here?

603
00:47:12,188 --> 00:47:17,023
That was good. You really had me. I've
been up since five feeding the chickens.

604
00:47:17,108 --> 00:47:19,861
No, Pete. Honestly, I don't...

605
00:47:20,308 --> 00:47:22,344
What? You don't what?

606
00:47:23,868 --> 00:47:26,302
Think this is real.

607
00:47:27,268 --> 00:47:30,738
You hungry? I'm starving.
Come on. I'll whip you up some pancakes.

608
00:47:30,828 --> 00:47:33,137
You don't understand.

609
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:37,386
This isn't happening.

610
00:47:38,268 --> 00:47:42,784
The last thing I remember,
I was on board a replicator ship.

611
00:47:42,868 --> 00:47:45,940
This is just another way
of screwing with my mind.

612
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:48,223
OK. Here's what I know.

613
00:47:48,308 --> 00:47:51,027
This is not SGC. It's Montana.

614
00:47:51,108 --> 00:47:54,703
Nothing weird happens here,
not like you're used to.

615
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,939
You left the Stargate programme
because of mental stress,

616
00:47:58,028 --> 00:48:02,021
and because you wanted to be with me
on a farm full of really stinky animals.

617
00:48:02,108 --> 00:48:06,738
Since then you've been seeing a shrink
because you can't shake the nightmares.

618
00:48:06,828 --> 00:48:09,217
You've had a bad one, OK?

619
00:48:12,548 --> 00:48:14,266
That's it.

620
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:32,144
- Did that feel real?
- Yes.

621
00:48:32,228 --> 00:48:34,617
Then snap out of it.

622
00:48:37,028 --> 00:48:40,020
OK. Pancakes,
or do I have to call the doctor?

623
00:48:42,428 --> 00:48:45,465
- I am kinda hungry.
- Good.

624
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,379
Come on.

625
00:48:57,348 --> 00:49:00,340
- What are you gonna do?
- I will merge O'Neill's mind

626
00:49:00,428 --> 00:49:03,101
with the ship's computer.

627
00:49:03,188 --> 00:49:07,898
You'll have to defrost him first, right?
He was near death when we froze him.

628
00:49:07,988 --> 00:49:11,458
Hopefully, the pod will sustain his life.

629
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:14,902
- "Hopefully"?
- What other choice do we have?

630
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:19,504
Just save him, like the last time? Wipe
the Ancient knowledge from his mind.

631
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:24,616
And lose any chance of learning
a means to defeat the replicators.

632
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:29,702
- You have no right to risk his life.
- I believe O'Neill would approve.

633
00:49:29,788 --> 00:49:34,987
We can't make that choice for him. Can't
you just extract the Ancient information?

634
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:37,423
Then we can all benefit from it.

635
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:39,942
You cannot begin
to comprehend the extent

636
00:49:40,028 --> 00:49:42,417
of what was unfolding in O'Neill's mind.

637
00:49:42,508 --> 00:49:46,820
Our scientists long ago extracted
parts of the Ancient library of knowledge

638
00:49:46,908 --> 00:49:49,138
and learned much from it.

639
00:49:49,228 --> 00:49:51,867
We have studied it
for as long as I can remember,

640
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:55,145
and we have barely scratched the surface.

641
00:49:55,228 --> 00:50:01,178
- It'd be looking for a needle in a haystack.
- A haystack of infinite size.

642
00:50:01,268 --> 00:50:03,623
That's big.

643
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:07,462
I hope O'Neill's conscious mind
provides us with a direct conduit

644
00:50:07,548 --> 00:50:10,062
to the information we need.

645
00:50:16,148 --> 00:50:20,141
- You requested to see me?
- You must let us go.

646
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:23,379
I don't have to do anything at this point.
If that's what...

647
00:50:23,468 --> 00:50:26,107
If your intent is to extract
information from us,

648
00:50:26,188 --> 00:50:29,180
you should know I will die
before I say anything.

649
00:50:29,268 --> 00:50:33,307
- Nothing my master says can be trusted.
- No one has decided what to do with you.

650
00:50:33,388 --> 00:50:36,425
Anubis was overconfident
and needed most of his armada

651
00:50:36,508 --> 00:50:38,817
to keep the System Lords at bay.

652
00:50:38,908 --> 00:50:41,980
The fleet he used
to attack Earth was small

653
00:50:42,068 --> 00:50:45,617
compared to Baal's fleet,
should he defeat the System Lords.

654
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:48,142
He will rule the galaxy.

655
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:51,618
No weapons will be
powerful enough to stop him.

656
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:55,462
- What would you have me do?
- Free us to fight.

657
00:50:56,468 --> 00:50:58,459
Or, if we must,

658
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:02,381
die with honour.

659
00:51:07,228 --> 00:51:09,822
- He is not well.
- I told you.

660
00:51:09,908 --> 00:51:13,617
The process of interfacing
his mind is complex.

661
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:15,141
<i>Hello.</i>

662
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:18,504
<i>Testing, testing. One, two.</i>
<i>One, two. One, two. Testing.</i>

663
00:51:18,588 --> 00:51:20,146
<i>Hello?</i>

664
00:51:20,228 --> 00:51:22,184
<i>Is this thing on ?</i>

665
00:51:23,028 --> 00:51:24,097
Jack?

666
00:51:24,188 --> 00:51:30,104
- O'Neill, can you hear us?
- <i>Heyl Hey, guys. What"s going on?</i>

667
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:32,941
Your mind was interfaced
with the <i>Danieil Jackson.</i>

668
00:51:33,028 --> 00:51:35,178
- <i>What?</i>
- What?

669
00:51:35,268 --> 00:51:38,817
The name of Thor's ship
is <i>Danieil Jackson.</i>

670
00:51:38,908 --> 00:51:42,139
The information in the ship's computer
is available to you.

671
00:51:42,228 --> 00:51:45,857
<i>Ah, right. Here we go. Ah, this is cool.</i>

672
00:51:45,948 --> 00:51:49,623
<i>I can pretty much</i>
<i>do anything I want, can"t I?</i>

673
00:51:53,828 --> 00:51:56,661
- O'Neill.
- <i>Huh? Oh. Sorry.</i>

674
00:51:58,108 --> 00:52:01,896
If you wish,
you may appear to us as a hologram.

675
00:52:02,908 --> 00:52:04,466
Dang!

676
00:52:06,428 --> 00:52:09,022
- You OK?
- It's a little weird.

677
00:52:09,108 --> 00:52:11,906
But... yeah. OK.

678
00:52:11,988 --> 00:52:14,456
At least you're not speaking Ancient.

679
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,620
- There's that.
- Actually, the computer is translating.

680
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:19,505
Ah.

681
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:27,017
- I've never looked better.
- There is not much time, O'Neill.

682
00:52:27,108 --> 00:52:30,418
- Thor's planet...
- I know. Ship's log.

683
00:52:30,508 --> 00:52:33,420
Can you help with the replicators?

684
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:35,385
- Already on it.
- Jack...

685
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:40,223
Daniel, the computer recorded
the whole conversation.

686
00:52:40,308 --> 00:52:42,617
Thanks for your concern.

687
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,896
Talk amongst yourselves.

688
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:06,259
I've discussed the situation with my
superiors. We've decided to let you all go.

689
00:53:07,148 --> 00:53:10,140
I must admit, that comes as a surprise.

690
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:14,619
It seems we haven't had much success
interrogating Goa'ulds in the past.

691
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:18,178
It was made apparent to me
you're more useful to us fighting Baal.

692
00:53:18,268 --> 00:53:19,701
Dr Weir.

693
00:53:20,508 --> 00:53:22,783
You know my name.

694
00:53:27,308 --> 00:53:29,663
This may come as a surprise to you.

695
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:33,138
Oh, I'm not sure anything
can surprise me at this point.

696
00:53:33,228 --> 00:53:37,346
- I wish to request asylum.
- Well, seems I was wrong again.

697
00:53:37,428 --> 00:53:40,579
My fleet was destroyed
before I came here,

698
00:53:40,668 --> 00:53:44,104
my domain one of the first to fall.

699
00:53:44,188 --> 00:53:46,577
I have nothing left with which to fight.

700
00:53:46,668 --> 00:53:49,899
The only thing waiting for me
is shame and torture.

701
00:53:49,988 --> 00:53:53,424
So it is not true that I would be
more useful to you out there.

702
00:53:53,508 --> 00:53:57,501
Perhaps I could be
of some use to you here.

703
00:54:03,988 --> 00:54:06,297
Thanks.

704
00:54:06,388 --> 00:54:08,504
That was great.

705
00:54:08,588 --> 00:54:10,544
Tasted very real.

706
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:19,585
Hey. I was thinking we could go into town
tonight, have dinner, see a movie.

707
00:54:19,668 --> 00:54:23,456
Come on. You can't really

708
00:54:25,868 --> 00:54:28,780
I gave up my job for this.
l-l gave up my life for you!

709
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:31,985
See? That is definitely not Pete.

710
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:35,026
How patient do you expect me to be?

711
00:54:37,028 --> 00:54:39,986
Nothing you say is gonna convince me.

712
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,378
I know who you are.
I just don't understand why.

713
00:54:43,468 --> 00:54:47,347
What do you want from me?
Why are you doing this?

714
00:54:53,988 --> 00:54:56,456
Because I love you.

715
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,462
- What is it?
- I am unsure.

716
00:55:07,548 --> 00:55:10,779
It seems O'Neill's mind
is building something virtually,

717
00:55:10,868 --> 00:55:14,338
in conjunction with the ship's computer.

718
00:55:15,388 --> 00:55:18,380
I do not know how much longer
his life can be sustained.

719
00:55:18,468 --> 00:55:21,619
Jack, can you hear me?

720
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:24,302
- I must revive him now.
- <i>Wait!</i>

721
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:26,185
<i>Not yet.</i>

722
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:40,385
Oy.

723
00:55:41,628 --> 00:55:44,267
What a headache.

724
00:55:45,268 --> 00:55:48,544
Take it easy. You've been through a lot.

725
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,182
- What now?
- Uh...

726
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:57,260
What's the last thing you remember?

727
00:55:59,348 --> 00:56:01,418
Getting my head sucked

728
00:56:01,508 --> 00:56:07,185
by one of those...
dang Ancient head-suckers.

729
00:56:09,388 --> 00:56:12,107
And something about twins.

730
00:56:18,468 --> 00:56:20,538
Teal'c.

731
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:23,426
- What's with the hair?
- O'Neill.

732
00:56:24,228 --> 00:56:25,627
Thor.

733
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:27,619
You got aspirin?

734
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:33,658
You should feel better momentarily,
and your memory will slowly return.

735
00:56:34,828 --> 00:56:36,386
Teal'c.

736
00:56:36,468 --> 00:56:39,187
What's with the hair?

737
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:42,817
The specifications for the device
you created are in the computer.

738
00:56:42,908 --> 00:56:45,024
I believe I can synthesise it.

739
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,183
Sweet.

740
00:56:53,268 --> 00:56:56,340
- What is it?
- We don't know, but you made it.

741
00:56:58,388 --> 00:57:00,538
- No.
- Yes.

742
00:57:02,308 --> 00:57:04,617
- No.
- Yes.

743
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:07,461
You accessed
the Ancient knowledge in your mind

744
00:57:07,548 --> 00:57:09,618
and instructed the computer to design it.

745
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:11,664
Doesn't mean I know what it is.

746
00:57:11,748 --> 00:57:15,946
It was doubtful that he would remember.
The knowledge of the Ancients is gone.

747
00:57:16,028 --> 00:57:17,381
All right.

748
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:20,426
Let me have a look.

749
00:57:20,508 --> 00:57:21,702
Yargh!

750
00:57:21,788 --> 00:57:23,779
Got legs.

751
00:57:27,628 --> 00:57:29,823
Uh, I got it. I got it.

752
00:57:41,188 --> 00:57:43,418
Yeah.

753
00:57:43,508 --> 00:57:44,941
I got nothing.

754
00:57:52,188 --> 00:57:55,624
Penegal. I am relieved
you are still able to communicate.

755
00:57:55,708 --> 00:58:00,736
<i>It may not last long. Did you procure</i>
<i>a means of fighting the replicators?</i>

756
00:58:00,828 --> 00:58:03,740
Possibly. It still requires more research.

757
00:58:03,828 --> 00:58:07,707
<i>Those infesting the colony</i>
<i>are behaving in an organised fashion,</i>

758
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:10,746
<i>unlike any replicators</i>
<i>we have encountered before.</i>

759
00:58:10,828 --> 00:58:13,900
Perhaps they are controlled
by a human-form leader,

760
00:58:13,988 --> 00:58:16,183
who has yet to reveal itself.

761
00:58:16,268 --> 00:58:20,261
If a human-form replicator survived,
it's possible Sam survived too.

762
00:58:20,348 --> 00:58:23,260
It is also possible
the old-version replicators

763
00:58:23,348 --> 00:58:25,987
created a new human form
to lead them as before.

764
00:58:26,068 --> 00:58:29,538
Yeah, but there's a chance.
Can you scan the planet for life signs?

765
00:58:29,628 --> 00:58:32,859
<i>We already have. There are none.</i>

766
00:58:39,068 --> 00:58:41,218
Penegal, can you hear me?

767
00:58:44,108 --> 00:58:46,576
We have lost contact.

768
00:58:50,268 --> 00:58:55,103
Did you think you could convince me this
illusion was my life? That I'd accept it?

769
00:58:55,188 --> 00:58:58,464
If it was something you wanted
badly enough in your mind.

770
00:58:58,548 --> 00:59:02,177
Is that why you tortured me?
So I would want this as an alternative?

771
00:59:02,268 --> 00:59:05,658
No, I tortured you because I was mad.

772
00:59:05,748 --> 00:59:10,105
Why do you think I hated you so much
for what you did to me?

773
00:59:11,108 --> 00:59:15,499
From the first moment we met,
when you let me inside your mind...

774
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:21,746
I saw you like no one else ever could.

775
00:59:22,188 --> 00:59:25,419
Human emotions
can be very overwhelming.

776
00:59:25,508 --> 00:59:28,978
The fact that you feel anything at all
is a miracle.

777
00:59:29,068 --> 00:59:32,140
It makes you very special.

778
00:59:32,228 --> 00:59:36,904
- I'm glad you see that.
- No. You don't understand.

779
00:59:36,988 --> 00:59:39,707
I could never be happy this way.

780
00:59:40,548 --> 00:59:42,857
Then you will be unhappy

781
00:59:42,948 --> 00:59:45,337
for a very long time.

782
01:00:11,668 --> 01:00:17,664
Make sure Camulus knows he will forever
be branded a traitor and a coward.

783
01:00:25,428 --> 01:00:29,421
- Most intriguing.
- Can you make it work?

784
01:00:29,508 --> 01:00:33,786
To be honest,
I am still unsure of exactly what it is.

785
01:00:36,268 --> 01:00:38,418
Don't look at me.

786
01:00:41,188 --> 01:00:44,976
<i>Thor, this is Commander Aegir</i>
<i>of the Valhalla.</i>

787
01:00:45,068 --> 01:00:47,457
<i>We have lost contact with the colony.</i>

788
01:00:47,548 --> 01:00:51,826
Aegir, communications are down.
What have you to report?

789
01:00:51,908 --> 01:00:57,540
<i>We have located the remains of</i>
<i>a human-form replicator floating in space.</i>

790
01:00:57,628 --> 01:01:00,461
<i>It obviously survived</i>
<i>the destruction of its ship.</i>

791
01:01:00,548 --> 01:01:03,824
<i>By all appearances,</i>
<i>it is currently inactive.</i>

792
01:01:03,908 --> 01:01:07,457
- Transmit coordinates.
- <i>Use caution, Thor.</i>

793
01:01:09,668 --> 01:01:12,102
- What will you do?
- Where are you going?

794
01:01:12,188 --> 01:01:14,748
I am going to transport it aboard.

795
01:01:16,108 --> 01:01:18,497
- Why?
- We must learn the location

796
01:01:18,588 --> 01:01:24,299
of the human form
controlling the replicators on the planet.

797
01:01:30,748 --> 01:01:32,943
Anybody recognise him?

798
01:01:33,028 --> 01:01:34,427
No.

799
01:01:37,628 --> 01:01:41,416
- <i>Is it dead?</i>
- Hopefully not completely.

800
01:01:41,508 --> 01:01:45,660
All replicators are linked by
a sophisticated communication system.

801
01:01:45,748 --> 01:01:48,262
If we can use this one
to tap into their network,

802
01:01:48,348 --> 01:01:51,977
we will be able to see
what any of the replicators can see.

803
01:01:52,068 --> 01:01:56,266
And if he wakes up,
is this pod gonna hold him?

804
01:01:56,348 --> 01:01:58,908
Probably not.

805
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:03,905
Then perhaps there is
no great wisdom in this.

806
01:02:03,988 --> 01:02:09,745
I will transport it back into space
if necessary, but we must take the risk.

807
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:14,905
Good.

808
01:02:28,308 --> 01:02:32,347
- What's that?
- Replicator communication data.

809
01:02:32,428 --> 01:02:37,024
I am searching for any references
to other human forms.

810
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:42,542
- You can't just keep me here forever.
- Yes, I can.

811
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:48,305
No matter what you do, I will never ever
participate in this fantasy.

812
01:02:49,788 --> 01:02:50,777
What?

813
01:02:56,268 --> 01:02:58,259
Zoom in.

814
01:03:02,348 --> 01:03:05,579
- Sam.
- Can you pinpoint her location?

815
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:10,662
She is within a replicator structure on the
planet, some distance outside the colony,

816
01:03:10,748 --> 01:03:12,943
near a rich vein of neutronium.

817
01:03:13,028 --> 01:03:16,782
- Creating more human replicators.
- I thought the ship was destroyed.

818
01:03:16,868 --> 01:03:21,100
At least one of the human replicators
must have separated from the main ship,

819
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:24,976
with Major Carter,
prior to exiting hyperspace.

820
01:03:36,828 --> 01:03:38,466
Beam it out!

821
01:03:41,588 --> 01:03:44,864
I am trying. It has made itself resistant.

822
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:52,221
It has breached the internal barrier
and interfaced with my ship's computer.

823
01:04:30,668 --> 01:04:33,262
Had to do something.

824
01:04:42,388 --> 01:04:46,984
It seems to have permanently disrupted
communication between individual cells,

825
01:04:47,068 --> 01:04:49,343
rendering each one inert.

826
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:52,340
We explored such technology
in the past with no success.

827
01:04:52,428 --> 01:04:57,297
Great. Does that mean we can use
this thing to whack the rest of those bugs?

828
01:04:57,388 --> 01:04:59,424
Even better, O'Neill.

829
01:04:59,508 --> 01:05:02,181
Now that I have seen
what the device does,

830
01:05:02,268 --> 01:05:05,180
I may be able to modify a larger version

831
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:08,499
to broadcast a disruption wave
over all of Orilla.

832
01:05:08,588 --> 01:05:10,385
Good. While you're doing that...

833
01:05:10,468 --> 01:05:14,177
I cannot transport you inside
the replicator ship on the planet.

834
01:05:14,268 --> 01:05:16,941
Their defences prevent it.
But I can get you close.

835
01:05:17,028 --> 01:05:19,098
Close is good.

836
01:05:19,188 --> 01:05:21,543
Take this, so we may communicate.

837
01:06:19,388 --> 01:06:22,107
- Who's your daddy?
- Stop!

838
01:06:24,068 --> 01:06:26,377
If you harm me
or any more of my brethren,

839
01:06:26,468 --> 01:06:30,427
I assure you
Major Carter will die instantly.

840
01:06:42,148 --> 01:06:46,699
O'Neill, I have successfully modified my
ship to emit a massive disruption wave.

841
01:06:46,788 --> 01:06:50,747
- <i>Excellent. Knew you could do it.</i>
- The weapon is 50% charged.

842
01:06:50,828 --> 01:06:55,026
If this works, you will have saved
the Asgard once again.

843
01:06:55,108 --> 01:06:57,668
I'm real happy for you.
I'm extremely proud.

844
01:06:57,748 --> 01:07:00,342
But we got a little bit
of a problem down here.

845
01:07:00,428 --> 01:07:04,216
Fifth detected our approach.
He claims he can kill Carter instantly.

846
01:07:04,308 --> 01:07:07,425
- O'Neill.
- Hey! I know what you're gonna say.

847
01:07:07,508 --> 01:07:11,296
Her life was already sacrificed.
You've got your planet to worry about.

848
01:07:11,388 --> 01:07:14,858
- Jack.
- I got problems too... Hang on a second.

849
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,223
What?

850
01:07:28,468 --> 01:07:30,663
This could be very bad.

851
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:55,302
What are they doing?

852
01:07:55,748 --> 01:08:00,026
It's like they're running away.
Thor, are you ready yet?

853
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:03,305
- <i>What is happening, O'Neill?</i>
- They're retreating.

854
01:08:03,388 --> 01:08:07,427
You must stop them, O'Neill.
The weapon is not yet ready.

855
01:08:07,508 --> 01:08:10,306
They cannot be allowed to escape.

856
01:08:13,628 --> 01:08:15,664
Come on.

857
01:08:22,508 --> 01:08:24,738
I know you can hear me!

858
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,219
What's happening?

859
01:08:31,228 --> 01:08:33,423
Fifth, where are you?

860
01:08:39,628 --> 01:08:41,664
- We must leave.
- Why?

861
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:44,057
They've found a means to fight us.

862
01:08:44,148 --> 01:08:45,979
The Asgard? How?

863
01:08:46,068 --> 01:08:49,265
- The one you call O'Neill.
- What?

864
01:08:49,348 --> 01:08:52,260
So many of us are left in the city.

865
01:08:52,348 --> 01:08:55,977
We cannot wait for them.
They will be killed.

866
01:08:56,068 --> 01:09:01,222
- Don't expect me to be sorry.
- Your friends. They are killing.

867
01:09:06,868 --> 01:09:09,223
- Trying to stop us.
- Trying to save me.

868
01:09:09,308 --> 01:09:10,900
No.

869
01:09:10,988 --> 01:09:16,381
They do not care about you. I told them
I would kill you if they did not stop.

870
01:09:41,108 --> 01:09:43,747
Then why don't you kill me?

871
01:09:44,628 --> 01:09:48,507
You know why my friends
won't stop just to save me?

872
01:09:48,588 --> 01:09:51,261
- No.
- They know, when it comes down to it,

873
01:09:51,348 --> 01:09:55,580
I would rather be dead
than be trapped like this forever.

874
01:09:55,668 --> 01:10:00,264
No matter what you feel for me,
I will never love you back.

875
01:10:01,548 --> 01:10:03,823
Kill me if you want.

876
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:07,264
But if you have even
one shred of humanity in you,

877
01:10:07,348 --> 01:10:09,816
and you really, truly love me,

878
01:10:10,948 --> 01:10:13,143
you'll let me go.

879
01:10:46,268 --> 01:10:48,623
O'Neill, the weapon worked.

880
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:53,304
Reports from the colony say all remaining
replicators have been neutralised.

881
01:10:53,388 --> 01:10:55,538
While the ship did escape,

882
01:10:55,628 --> 01:10:59,462
at least we have an effective means
of fighting them now.

883
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:02,824
Yeah, well, at least there's that.

884
01:11:03,788 --> 01:11:09,579
O'Neill, I am detecting a fourth life sign
in your immediate vicinity.

885
01:11:13,828 --> 01:11:15,625
Sam!

886
01:11:20,308 --> 01:11:21,457
Sam!

887
01:11:22,268 --> 01:11:24,384
Carter!

888
01:11:24,468 --> 01:11:26,459
<i>Over here!</i>

889
01:11:32,908 --> 01:11:34,899
You OK?

890
01:11:35,868 --> 01:11:38,826
- Glad to see you, sir.
- Likewise.

891
01:11:57,028 --> 01:12:00,623
Colonel. Come in. How are you feeling?

892
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:05,941
Not bad. Haven't had the urge
to go anywhere or build anything lately.

893
01:12:06,028 --> 01:12:08,178
You have been given a clean bill of health,

894
01:12:08,268 --> 01:12:11,499
as far as the finest doctors
on this planet are concerned.

895
01:12:11,588 --> 01:12:13,943
Well, what do they know?

896
01:12:15,228 --> 01:12:19,619
The president asked me to extend you
an invitation. Dinner at the White House.

897
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:21,778
You know what they're having?

898
01:12:22,948 --> 01:12:26,338
I don't think I've had the chance
to personally thank you yet.

899
01:12:26,428 --> 01:12:29,306
- For what?
- You risk your life over and over

900
01:12:29,388 --> 01:12:31,344
and ask for nothing in return.

901
01:12:31,428 --> 01:12:34,500
Well, don't be fooled. I'm making a list.

902
01:12:34,588 --> 01:12:40,584
Well, I doubt very much that there's
anything that could properly repay you.

903
01:12:41,508 --> 01:12:43,578
Are you going somewhere?

904
01:12:43,668 --> 01:12:48,617
The president has asked me to supervise
the research at the Ancient outpost.

905
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:54,385
It'll be a delicate situation, given all the
international claims already being made.

906
01:12:54,468 --> 01:12:56,823
Sounds right up your alley.

907
01:12:56,908 --> 01:12:59,945
Yeah, well, much more so than this job.

908
01:13:00,028 --> 01:13:03,100
Does that mean Hammond
will be coming back?

909
01:13:03,188 --> 01:13:06,703
No. General Hammond is being promoted.

910
01:13:06,788 --> 01:13:11,578
He'll be overseeing all things relating to
Earth's defence on behalf of the Pentagon.

911
01:13:11,668 --> 01:13:14,865
The SGC, the 303 programme,
the Antarctic site.

912
01:13:14,948 --> 01:13:18,782
Unofficially, it's being called
"Home World Security".

913
01:13:20,508 --> 01:13:24,262
Any idea who we're gonna be stuck with?

914
01:13:24,348 --> 01:13:27,420
The Pentagon has convinced
the president there is one man

915
01:13:27,508 --> 01:13:32,024
who could run the SGC and make it
politically viable internationally,

916
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:36,226
despite the fact that he is part of
the American military establishment.

917
01:13:36,308 --> 01:13:38,663
Do we know this shrub?

918
01:13:39,388 --> 01:13:41,948
Well, you know him rather well.

919
01:13:42,748 --> 01:13:46,024
Brigadier General Jack O'Neill.

920
01:13:46,108 --> 01:13:48,576
- Me?
- Yeah. You.

921
01:13:49,628 --> 01:13:51,619
Brigadier.

922
01:13:53,788 --> 01:13:57,019
- It's on my list.
- Congratulations.

923
01:13:57,468 --> 01:13:59,663
I should be clear.

924
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:05,938
I'd like the promotion,
the paycheck, and the parking spot,

925
01:14:06,028 --> 01:14:09,179
but I don't really wanna be
in charge of anything. No.

926
01:14:09,268 --> 01:14:12,340
Well, sadly, all those things
kind of go together.

927
01:14:12,428 --> 01:14:14,783
So I guess you have some thinking to do.

928
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:17,428
I hate that.

929
01:14:19,268 --> 01:14:22,226
Maybe you should break it down
into pros and cons.

930
01:14:22,308 --> 01:14:25,744
I've spent my whole life
sticking it to the man.

931
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:28,388
If I do this, I'll <i>be</i> the man.

932
01:14:28,948 --> 01:14:32,020
I don't think I can be the man.

933
01:14:33,348 --> 01:14:37,466
You'll be inheriting a big can of worms
with the state of affairs out there.

934
01:14:37,548 --> 01:14:42,497
If Baal is about to dominate the System
Lords, we face a formidable challenge.

935
01:14:42,588 --> 01:14:45,898
Plus, who knows where and when
the replicators will turn up?

936
01:14:45,988 --> 01:14:51,301
There'll be more scrutiny now so many
governments know about the Stargate.

937
01:14:51,388 --> 01:14:53,777
I've never had a desk.

938
01:14:54,988 --> 01:14:56,307
That's a...?

939
01:14:56,388 --> 01:14:57,901
- Con.
- Con.

940
01:14:57,988 --> 01:15:01,219
For the record, sir, you do have a desk.

941
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:03,783
I do?

942
01:15:03,868 --> 01:15:08,658
On the flip side, nobody knows how
this place should be run better than you.

943
01:15:08,748 --> 01:15:10,500
Why, thank you, Daniel.

944
01:15:10,588 --> 01:15:14,103
With a little guidance
from your good friends and advisors.

945
01:15:14,188 --> 01:15:19,137
If you don't take the job, we could
end up with someone much worse.

946
01:15:19,868 --> 01:15:23,304
OK. That didn't come out right.

947
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:26,425
I, for one, will miss you
accompanying us on our missions.

948
01:15:26,508 --> 01:15:30,342
Yeah. Now, see, I'm not sure
I'm ready to give that up, either.

949
01:15:30,428 --> 01:15:33,386
Sitting back, watching you
go off and have all the fun.

950
01:15:33,468 --> 01:15:36,983
Risking our lives
in the face of grave danger.

951
01:15:37,068 --> 01:15:40,060
There'll be situations
where you can accompany us.

952
01:15:40,148 --> 01:15:43,185
You'll be in charge.
You can do whatever you want.

953
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:46,142
I'll be able to do whatever I want.

954
01:15:49,348 --> 01:15:52,021
Within reason, sir.

955
01:16:02,268 --> 01:16:06,420
Although my time here has been brief,
it has been, without a doubt, indelible.

956
01:16:06,508 --> 01:16:10,660
I will remember every one of you,
and I thank you all for your hard work.

957
01:16:10,748 --> 01:16:13,820
I'm not one for long goodbyes,
so, without further ado,

958
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:18,299
it is with great pleasure I introduce you
to your new commanding officer,

959
01:16:18,388 --> 01:16:21,186
Brigadier General Jack O'Neill.

960
01:16:39,748 --> 01:16:42,387
At ease.

961
01:16:44,828 --> 01:16:48,218
You all know how much I love speeches,

962
01:16:48,308 --> 01:16:50,378
so...

963
01:16:50,468 --> 01:16:52,777
I'll make this short.

964
01:16:54,268 --> 01:16:58,341
I wish I could say
I didn't owe anything to anyone.

965
01:17:01,668 --> 01:17:06,378
But the truth is,
I wouldn't be standing here

966
01:17:07,348 --> 01:17:12,945
if it wasn't for the courage and support
of each and every one of you.

967
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:17,419
I hope I can be as good a leader
as we've had in the past,

968
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:19,738
and as good as you deserve.

969
01:17:19,828 --> 01:17:21,819
Hear, hear!

970
01:17:28,868 --> 01:17:31,462
The other reason I took this job

971
01:17:32,428 --> 01:17:36,103
was so I could do really cool stuff like this.

972
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:44,625
It is with great pride that my first order
of business as commander of this base

973
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:47,541
is the announcement of the promotion

974
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:51,701
of Major Samantha Carter
to Lieutenant Colonel.

975
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:09,462
The president of the United States
has placed special trust and confidence

976
01:18:09,548 --> 01:18:15,498
in the patriotism, integrity,
and abilities of Major Samantha Carter.

977
01:18:15,588 --> 01:18:18,660
Major Samantha Carter
is promoted to the grade

978
01:18:18,748 --> 01:18:22,457
of Lieutenant Colonel,
United States Air Force.

979
01:18:22,548 --> 01:18:25,824
Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter.

980
01:18:33,588 --> 01:18:38,264
Now. Raise your right hand,
and repeat after me.

981
01:18:38,788 --> 01:18:40,779
I, insert name...

982
01:18:41,908 --> 01:18:44,058
I, Samantha Carter...

983
01:18:55,908 --> 01:18:58,547
Don't be afraid.

984
01:18:58,628 --> 01:19:02,382
I know the first moment
of consciousness can be frightening.

985
01:19:02,468 --> 01:19:05,062
I will show you everything,

986
01:19:05,148 --> 01:19:08,140
share with you all I know.

987
01:19:11,588 --> 01:19:17,584
You have no idea how happy I am we
were able to collect enough neutronium.

988
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,417
We have much time to share.

989
01:19:31,028 --> 01:19:36,182
We must search for a new home
for our brethren to propagate.

990
01:19:36,268 --> 01:19:39,658
It will pass quickly for us, though.

991
01:19:39,748 --> 01:19:43,343
Soon enough, everyone will know.
