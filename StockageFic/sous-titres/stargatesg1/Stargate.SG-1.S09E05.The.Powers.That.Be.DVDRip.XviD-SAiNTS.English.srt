1
00:00:03,644 --> 00:00:05,145
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

2
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:07,006
Having lunch.

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:12,311
Don't you care that there could be Priors out there
taking advantage of poor innocent people?

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,724
Luring them into an oppressive religion,
or worse, killing them for rejecting it?

5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,476
Are you bored of bothering Jackson?

6
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,295
You're supposed to be going out
on missions through the Stargate.

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:24,124
So let's go. Let's rid the galaxy of evil doers.

8
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:28,159
Look, despite what
Daniel might think, I really can help.

9
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:31,473
I know how things work out there.
I'm physically capable. I'm good with weapons.

10
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,725
Not to mention seductively attractive!

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,639
I'll make a fine asset to any SG team.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,932
You left out selfish and untrustworthy.

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,845
How about independant and resourceful?

14
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:46,188
That is a classified file.

15
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:52,053
Priors have been reported on
43 different planets already.

16
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,371
Yeah, that's what the file says.

17
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,148
It just so happens, that I have
a very good relationship with

18
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:58,276
the people on the one you've designated P8X-412.

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,178
Define...

20
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:02,664
- Relationship.
- They trust me.

21
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:05,216
What?

22
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:07,035
- Where are you going?
- Go talk to Landry.

23
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:08,078
Why?

24
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:10,438
Because, anyone who trusts you

25
00:01:10,873 --> 00:01:13,292
is obviously in a great deal of danger.

26
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:35,798
Oh God, no-one's here.

27
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:40,186
I thought these people trusted you.
Why are we sneaking around avoiding everybody?

28
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:42,363
I already told you.
They won't recognise me dressed like this.

29
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:44,516
Fortunately I left a couple of spare outfits.

30
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,267
What is it with her and her wardrobe?

31
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:47,904
Yeah, I think we could probably
explain to them why exactly...

32
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:49,004
It'll only take a second.

33
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:51,589
- Can a girl have a little privacy?
- No.

34
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:53,717
Besides, I think I've seen just
about everything there is to see.

35
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:55,602
Right.

36
00:01:55,836 --> 00:01:59,965
Look, there's no other way out of this room.
I'm just going to change.

37
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,016
I'll be right back.

38
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,447
Hey!

39
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:20,595
These are the weapons of our God, Quetesh!

40
00:02:20,678 --> 00:02:22,430
- Who are you?
- Just take it easy.

41
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:23,440
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:24,733
We mean no harm.

43
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:34,926
Please, forgive us.

44
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,688
It's been so long, we began
to fear you would not return.

45
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:40,424
Then you were foolish.

46
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:42,618
I would not abandon you.

47
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:45,204
I am your God.

48
00:02:56,847 --> 00:02:59,225
Season 9 - Episode 5
The Powers That Be

49
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:58,289
I have pillaged the galaxy many times over

50
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:01,042
and made slaves of all the mortals I have encountered.

51
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,382
This world pleases me and I shall take it as my own.

52
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:07,272
Benevolent God Quetesh
will never allow such treachery!

53
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:09,078
Not exactly Shakespeare.

54
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:12,932
How is it these people don't know
the Goa'uld have fallen?

55
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:15,321
Most of this world is pretty isolated
and I would be very surprised

56
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,547
if anyone here actually knew how to operate the gate.

57
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:20,839
- These humans must be told the truth.
- I know.

58
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,536
<i>Oh merciful, beautiful Quetesh. Have mercy on him.</i>

59
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,261
<i>He knows not your power.</i>

60
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:28,506
What are you doing?

61
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:29,670
It's a play.

62
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,320
Don't worry, I think it will be
over soon, then we'll eat.

63
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,086
That's not what I'm talking about.

64
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:38,080
You want to stop these people from falling
victim to the Priors? That's what I'm going to do.

65
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,685
This is not what I had in mind.

66
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,142
What your mind may or may not be able
to imagine, is really none of my concern. Now,

67
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:44,904
kindly get out of your God's face.

68
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:50,965
<i>No man shall lay claim to my world.</i>

69
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:56,243
And no man shall bring harm to my children.

70
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:03,850
<i>Thanks be to you, Quetesh.</i>

71
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:06,901
All hail and glory be to you.

72
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:22,315
We had little rehearsal my Lord,
but I trust it pleases you?

73
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:23,599
Yes.

74
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:27,092
As always Azdak, you please your God greatly.

75
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:28,657
Thank you, my Lord.

76
00:05:28,898 --> 00:05:30,423
You have been greatly missed.

77
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:33,032
Now!

78
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:37,448
I would like to hear about the visitor
who arrived through the Chaapa'ai.

79
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:44,172
It is pointless lying to your God, Azdak,
I am all knowing as well as all beautiful.

80
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:47,583
<i>He said that he was here to save us.</i>

81
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:51,035
That our true Gods await our devotion.

82
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:52,240
Lies!

83
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:54,367
Meant to deceive you.

84
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:57,659
I did not believe a word he said,
my Lord, I swear it.

85
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,064
Some of you did.

86
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:02,438
You have been absent for so many seasons.

87
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,587
Some thought, maybe you had abandoned us.

88
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:10,023
They were weak my Lord. Please, forgive them.

89
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:13,675
Have I not always been merciful to
those who deserve forgiveness?

90
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,225
Now go!

91
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:18,873
While I consider you punishment.

92
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:21,142
Yes, of course.

93
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:32,903
Well,

94
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:35,151
that was easy.

95
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,439
Shut that thing off!

96
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:41,574
Why must you continue to deceive these people?

97
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:45,106
This was one of the many planets that
Quetesh ruled over when I was her host.

98
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:47,615
As you know, the Tok'Ra eventually
removed the symbiote, but not

99
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:50,987
before her people rebelled and tortured me,
thinking we were one and the same.

100
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:54,179
And they couldn't tell the difference.

101
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:57,069
Why am I not surprised?

102
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,875
I had nothing.

103
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,123
I was desolate.

104
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:06,622
Fortunately, I discovered that news of Quetesh's
demise had not reached this little mining outpost.

105
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:08,790
So you kept them mining naquadah for you?

106
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:10,275
Just a tiny bit.

107
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,607
The mine was practically
barren by the time I got here,

108
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:17,339
but this planet acted as a safe haven
for me until I got back on my feet.

109
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:20,791
Look, I never killed anyone.

110
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:23,602
I never tortured them. I was a wonderful God.

111
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:24,766
Just ask them.

112
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:26,010
I think we will.

113
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:26,873
Why?

114
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:27,817
You don't believe me?

115
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,205
That and I'm not totally convinced they're
ultimately going to follow your command.

116
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:32,413
Nor should that be the only reason
they don't follow the Priors.

117
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:33,938
I am still supposed to be their God.

118
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,210
I can't exactly go out there and ask them
if they're going to listen to me.

119
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:37,270
I wasn't expecting you will to.

120
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,842
What makes you think they're going to tell you the
truth? You are supposed to be my faithful servants.

121
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:43,553
Then I'll also explain that we're not as faithful
as you might like to believe and if necessary,

122
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:45,479
I'll also tell them we're plotting to kill you!

123
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,232
I have heard better plans!

124
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:52,081
- I kind of like it.
- Shut up!

125
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:59,026
How are the staff evaluations coming?

126
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:02,318
They're done, they'll be on your desk by
tomorrow morning. That's when they're due, right?

127
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:04,165
Yes.

128
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:09,905
Yeah, I have lunch with the heads of my
departments once a month, just to stay in touch,

129
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:13,377
get any housekeeping done.
Helps me get to know them a lot better.

130
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:15,163
- I know in our case...
- What?

131
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,023
In our case, what?

132
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:20,723
Well, it's just that we know each other
a little better than say, I do,

133
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:23,553
Colonel Garrett, the munitions supply officer.

134
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,319
Really? I actually doubt that.

135
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,165
Colonel Garrett's been here longer than I have.

136
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:30,577
Do we have to do this here?

137
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,324
You wanna have lunch, fine.

138
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:34,210
Tomorrow noon, I will be there as ordered.

139
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:35,695
It's not an order.

140
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,221
OK.

141
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:47,537
I have been sick for some time now.

142
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,551
The past few harvests, I've been more
of a burden than a help to my family.

143
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:54,602
I've even lost the ability to stand.

144
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:56,328
You're standing now.

145
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,773
The Prior,

146
00:08:58,215 --> 00:08:59,258
he cured me.

147
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,185
Said that it was the will of the Ori.

148
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:03,032
Blasphemer!

149
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:06,223
Just, take it easy.

150
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,474
I'm sorry, but I will not have him speak
against Quetesh like that in my presence.

151
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:12,645
Look, we're not out to get anybody here.
We just wanna hear what he has to say.

152
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:15,977
Go ahead.

153
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:19,590
The jewel in his staff glowed.

154
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:23,444
He waved it over me and
I felt better than I ever have.

155
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:27,096
All he asked in return, was that I tell others.

156
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,866
That I spread the word of the Ori.

157
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,552
Then upon his return...

158
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,799
When is this Prior to return?

159
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:36,409
Tomorrow.

160
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:40,721
The Prior said that Quetesh is a false God!

161
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:44,333
That if she ever returned,
he would expose her weakness!

162
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:48,427
Your are a fool! Speak no more or
I shall strike you down in the name of our true God!

163
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,197
I said, take it easy.

164
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,765
You should be thankful that Quetesh is so forgiving.

165
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:58,101
And pray, when she slays the Prior for his wicked lies,
she won't do the same to you.

166
00:09:58,262 --> 00:09:59,225
Oh, boy.

167
00:09:59,586 --> 00:10:01,191
Glory be to Quetesh!

168
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:03,368
Glory to the one true God!

169
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,668
OK! You have made your point!

170
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:08,798
Know when to stop.

171
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,448
I think I need to talk to our one true God.

172
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,141
This is why you wanted to come back to this planet?

173
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:17,348
All of this is mine.

174
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:19,083
I earnt it.

175
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:21,083
These people have just been keeping it safe for me,

176
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:24,474
and as you say, we can't be a hundred percent
certain that they're going to obey me.

177
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:26,762
So if this planet does fall to Priors...

178
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:29,893
Hello! You stealing
this planet's most valued treasure

179
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:32,342
is the least of our concerns right now.

180
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:34,398
I like your attitude.

181
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:38,102
I was thinking of cutting you boys in at
ten percent and now I'm thinking twenty.

182
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:43,480
Despite your return, many of the villagers believe
the Ori to be true Gods and worthy of their loyalty.

183
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,230
All the more reason why we should
pack all of this up right now

184
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,357
and get out of here. Are you gonna pitch in or what?

185
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:52,773
Others believe you will slay the Prior
in a show of power, upon his return tomorrow.

186
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:53,777
Tomorrow?

187
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,663
Tomorrow's no good for me.

188
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,390
You need to tell these people the truth!

189
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,561
I have a lot of needs Daniel, but
I assure you, that is not one of them.

190
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:02,808
If you do not tell them the truth, we will.

191
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:06,562
Yes, and who do you think
they're actually going to believe?

192
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:08,248
Look, commanding these people
to obey you and not the Ori,

193
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:10,657
is not gonna work.
Especially once that Prior comes back.

194
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,627
And we do not want to get into a God-off.

195
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:17,240
Especially since we know you're not even close.

196
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,106
Forget what I said about the twenty percent!

197
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:21,174
Yes, he's right!
We can't trade one lie for another lie!

198
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:23,502
Alright. What can we fight with then?

199
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:26,210
How can we stop this Prior
from corrupting these people?

200
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,137
OK, we have a very limited window of opportunity here.

201
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:29,884
If you expose yourself as a false God,

202
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:31,810
If you tell these people how you fooled them and why,

203
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:33,817
we might be able to make them
sceptical about the Prior.

204
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:37,130
Or, it could push them towards believing
in the Ori as true Gods even more!

205
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,482
No, the only chance these people have,
the only chance any of us have against the Priors,

206
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:41,625
is to show them we will not accept the Ori as Gods!

207
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:43,191
No matter what happens, we must reject them!

208
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:47,124
- True enlightenment must begin with the truth!
- Oh please! The truth is so overrated.

209
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:50,015
Look, for once, just do the right thing here, OK?

210
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:52,624
You're gonna feel so good about it afterwards.

211
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,153
Trust me.

212
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,970
Really, this is unnecessary.

213
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,298
You will be executed at first light tomorrow.

214
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:03,903
Imposter.

215
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:12,574
So, Daniel.

216
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:17,069
When does that warm and glowy feeling
from doing the right thing kick in? Cos,

217
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:18,916
not there yet.

218
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,408
I can't believe you all just
stood there and let them imprison me.

219
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,615
- What were we supposed to do?
- You have guns don't you?

220
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:33,345
- There's like over a hundred people there!
- And?

221
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:37,559
- Just relax. We're gonna get you out of this.
- Oh you are?

222
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:42,858
I feel a little better.
I'm sorry, I got a little nervous what with
the whole execution looming and all!

223
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:46,952
Just believe me, it is not going to come to that.
Mitchell and Teal'c are talking to them, right now.

224
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:49,842
Have you forgotten that if I die,

225
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:51,368
you die?

226
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,559
Believe me, it is not going to come to that.

227
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:56,165
Trust me.

228
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:00,380
This time.

229
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:05,236
Fine. She made a mistake.
It was a big mistake! It was a whopper!

230
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:08,609
- But you can't just kill her!
- Why not?

231
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:11,800
A little help?

232
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:14,530
Does she not deserve a trial,

233
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:16,817
to explain the things that she has done?

234
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:20,350
I think we all have a pretty
good idea of what she did and why.

235
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:21,514
Your people

236
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:25,086
are looking for leadership. They're looking to you.

237
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,137
So you've got to decide

238
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,727
what kind of society you wanna have.

239
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:34,941
One where people get executed
without a chance to explain their actions?

240
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:38,033
You wanna hold a "maldoran"?

241
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,561
Ain't that her name?

242
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:48,188
Quetesh established the process several years ago.
A way to settle disputes between two parties.

243
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,600
Fine! That sounds... fitting.

244
00:13:52,162 --> 00:13:54,009
We're gonna hold a "maldoran"!

245
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:04,485
Hey! How'd it go?

246
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:06,853
Well? You know...

247
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:09,181
What's the plan?

248
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:11,148
You gonna blow up this door?

249
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:13,356
Lay down supression fire so that we could

250
00:14:13,397 --> 00:14:15,804
rush out through the hidden escape passage?

251
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:18,695
It's in the room I told you had no other exit.

252
00:14:18,896 --> 00:14:21,545
They're gonna put you on trial tomorrow.

253
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,639
- I like my plan better.
- Kinda is your plan.

254
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,750
- It's named after you.
- Really? A "maldoran".

255
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:30,879
They going to let me be the judge?

256
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,203
Don't think so.

257
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:34,973
- Then it's not a real "maldoran", is it?
- Actually, this couldn't have worked out better.

258
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:37,501
- Actually, I think it could have.
- No, a trial is public.

259
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:41,476
We can use the forum to expose what it is to be
a false God and warn the community about the Priors.

260
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,180
<i>You're right actually.</i>

261
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,754
We could get them all worked up about false Gods and
then they can kill me as an example to the others!

262
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:49,644
Look, I persuaded them to
let you stay here for the night.

263
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:50,929
Right, thanks.

264
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,394
Yeah.

265
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:54,602
Well, I'll see you guys in the morning.

266
00:14:54,642 --> 00:14:58,937
Thank you. I apologize for ever doubting
your masterful skills at negotiation!

267
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:02,068
- He's doing the best he can.
- That's what terrifies me!

268
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,531
Welcome

269
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:12,585
and thank you all for coming.

270
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:16,519
Unlike in the past, the

271
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,007
final decision of this "maldoran",

272
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,215
will be yours, my friends.

273
00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:23,342
A general vote.

274
00:15:23,704 --> 00:15:28,560
After both presentations have been made,
we shall all decide what is to be done

275
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:31,010
to the false God Quetesh.

276
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:36,348
We're pleading innocent, right?

277
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:39,318
- You already confessed.
- A girl can change her mind, can't she?

278
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:43,413
We shall begin, as always,
with the reading of the claims.

279
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:46,182
The first claim of seven -

280
00:15:46,564 --> 00:15:48,130
mass murder.

281
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:52,265
- Wait a second.
- The second claim of seven - mass torture!

282
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:54,994
I never killed, I never tortured. That is Quetesh.

283
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:59,691
- The third claim of seven...
- Uh, excuse me, hi, sorry to interrupt.

284
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:03,263
The person seated before you, didn't do those things.

285
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:06,065
You will have your chance to make your presentation.

286
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:09,665
Yes, I'm sure we will.
I just wanted to make something very clear.

287
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:12,194
As we discussed, when she confessed,

288
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:18,658
Vala was a host to a Goa'uld.
Parasite, that controlled her actions for many years.

289
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:23,354
It was that Goa'uld symbiote named Quetesh,
that committed the atrocities you're talking about.

290
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:24,518
Vala herself,

291
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:27,529
can only be held responsible for the actions she did

292
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,897
after that Goa'uld was removed.

293
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:32,266
When exactly was that?

294
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:37,443
Four years, four years?

295
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:49,405
Very well.

296
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:52,938
Assuming your assertion to be true.

297
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,426
We shall begin again!

298
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:00,364
The first claim of four.

299
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,137
Planetary wide forced labour!

300
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:09,235
This is gonna be a long day.

301
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:11,322
Indeed.

302
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:14,614
I,

303
00:17:15,256 --> 00:17:17,263
perhaps more than any of you,

304
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:19,952
feel great sorrow

305
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:23,787
at the fact that I devoted my love and faith

306
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:26,917
so freely, to an imposter

307
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,573
who cared only for the naquadah in our mines.

308
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:34,022
With every breath,

309
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:35,266
she lied.

310
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,201
With every effort, she stole.

311
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:43,134
At every chance, she betrayed us.

312
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:46,747
The conditions of poverty that we now suffer,

313
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:49,998
are her fault and her fault alone!

314
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:53,008
That is what you must consider!

315
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,303
He's good.

316
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,709
I'm dead.

317
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,703
Yes,

318
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:10,470
she stole.

319
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:13,481
She betrayed you.

320
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:17,214
She used you as slave labour.

321
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:19,843
All this is true.

322
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,835
Not the opening statement I would have gone for.

323
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:28,013
But, the only reason you know about this,
is because she told you.

324
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:32,810
She came forward knowing full well how you would feel

325
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:35,821
and what the consequences would be.
Ask yourselves...

326
00:18:36,642 --> 00:18:38,328
Why did she do this?

327
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:44,068
She did it because there's a greater threat in
this galaxy, she thought you deserved to know about.

328
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:47,761
She told the truth in order to open your eyes.

329
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:53,663
To show you the dangers of giving away your freedom.
Your free will.

330
00:18:53,743 --> 00:18:56,191
In the hopes that given another chance,

331
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,563
you wouldn't make that same mistake twice.

332
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:03,698
We know a Prior of the Ori has come here.

333
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:08,755
He's been sent to this village to convince you
to worship beings more powerful than all of us.

334
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:10,402
But you must know,

335
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,048
that like Vala,

336
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:14,837
they're not Gods.

337
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:19,533
<i>You speak well, Daniel Jackson of the planet Earth.</i>

338
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,063
What is a God?

339
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:29,348
What power is great enough to
make you bow down in humble reverence?

340
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:33,122
That's the one that tried to burn us to death.

341
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:34,165
Twice.

342
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:35,992
There's only one measure.

343
00:19:36,112 --> 00:19:40,929
The only question you may ask yourself,
is why must I believe?

344
00:19:41,872 --> 00:19:46,689
What is there for any and all to
gain by choosing the path of Origin?

345
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:52,590
Those seeking eternal salvation
can follow the word of the Ori.

346
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:58,471
Those that do not shall die as mortals.
It is as simple as that.

347
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:01,019
The day of reckoning approaches.

348
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:04,732
Your destiny awaits.

349
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:09,148
He's pretty good, too.

350
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,156
We are so

351
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:12,600
dead.

352
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,007
I have told them of the Ori, Prior.

353
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:16,974
Many of us believe.

354
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:19,624
But not all of us.

355
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:23,255
- You doubt the power of the Ori?
- No.

356
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:25,624
<i>But I understand how they got it</i>

357
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:29,678
and because I do, I'm not willing to abandon
my own free will and worship them for it.

358
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:34,455
The Ori healed this man. This man that was sick,
this man who could barely walk.

359
00:20:34,495 --> 00:20:36,863
This man was healed through knowledge!

360
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:41,801
We have medicine.
We have tools that can do much the same thing.

361
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,848
This device

362
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:46,898
has the power to heal.

363
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:52,037
If you know how to use it. But not by magical power.

364
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:53,562
It's called technology.

365
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:56,813
- Technology.
- Yes. Knowledge. Understanding.

366
00:20:56,874 --> 00:21:00,005
Of the way things work and
the science of the universe.

367
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,450
Maybe so,

368
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,878
but consider this.

369
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,364
There are two men.

370
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:09,298
One is starving and the other has a plentiful crop.

371
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:14,115
Is it not wrong for
the fortunate man to hoard his harvest?

372
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:17,526
Should he not share with his hungry brother?

373
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,745
<i>It is the same with knowledge and understanding.</i>

374
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:24,131
<i>As you have said.</i>

375
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:30,512
The Ori have a greater understanding
of the universe, but most importantly,
they are willing to share it with us.

376
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:34,366
Out of their love for us, their creation.

377
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:37,457
Only a fool would turn away.

378
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:44,602
Just because the Ori know more
than we do, doesn't make them Gods.

379
00:21:45,886 --> 00:21:48,295
They are beings who were once like you and me,

380
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:50,323
but they evolved.

381
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:53,373
They learned of humanity's potential.

382
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:57,527
Eventually over time they used
that knowledge to shed their physical bodies

383
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:59,776
and live as energy on another,

384
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:02,024
higher, plane of existence.

385
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:03,790
Which side is he on?

386
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,821
You are all children of the Ori.

387
00:22:06,981 --> 00:22:09,030
But you have been raised by evil!

388
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:16,295
The true nature of the universe
has been kept from you by powers that
would have you stray from the path of Origin.

389
00:22:16,976 --> 00:22:19,384
It is time to open your eyes!

390
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:22,595
Let Origin show you the way.

391
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:24,222
<i>No, you're right.</i>

392
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:27,473
Maybe

393
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:29,962
hoarding knowledge is wrong.

394
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:33,373
Maybe it's not.

395
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:35,726
Maybe

396
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:39,636
learning something for yourself
is part of the journey to enlightenment.

397
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:42,887
But,

398
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,721
killing someone for not worshipping you,

399
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:48,427
regardless of your power, is wrong.

400
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,875
Very wrong.

401
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:53,684
Knowledge is power,

402
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:58,261
but how you use that power
defines whether you are good

403
00:22:58,662 --> 00:22:59,947
or evil.

404
00:23:00,468 --> 00:23:02,957
The choice is yours.

405
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:08,015
Give us another chance, I beg you. Please spare us all.

406
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,291
Believe in the power of the Ori.

407
00:23:15,622 --> 00:23:18,231
Or be laid down in the dust.

408
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:35,974
Escort the prisoner back to the cell.

409
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,823
- Wait!
- We're done with the "maldoran".

410
00:23:39,024 --> 00:23:43,199
We must vote now on her punishment
and discuss other issues we now face.

411
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:47,453
Azdak, I know what the Ori seem to be
offering you may sound very tempting...

412
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:49,180
We are povery stricken.

413
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:54,960
As a society, we may not be able
to survive much longer.
We thought our God would provide for us.

414
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:58,814
Why should we reject the knowledge
and education to better ourselves?

415
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:01,061
But you can have all that
without giving up your freedom!

416
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:05,397
Don't you see how wrong it is to enforce a belief
by threatening your people with their very lives?

417
00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:06,922
As the Ori said,

418
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:10,977
would we not be ignorant and deserving of punishment,

419
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:14,389
for failing to see the plain truth before us?

420
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:20,209
Leave us!

421
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,935
We shall deliberate.

422
00:24:40,034 --> 00:24:41,640
Comfortable where you're living?

423
00:24:42,343 --> 00:24:44,751
I kind of like the place
I'm renting in Summerin Hills.

424
00:24:45,313 --> 00:24:46,477
If it's nice,

425
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,722
you ought to buy it.

426
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:51,575
Well, just wait and see.
I don't know how long I'm going to be here, so...

427
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:55,991
How's your mother?

428
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,527
Why don't you call her and find out for yourself?

429
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:03,698
Why does everything have to be so hostile?

430
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:05,142
I'm trying!

431
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:08,575
To tell you the truth,
I don't really know where to start.

432
00:25:09,698 --> 00:25:10,783
Start what?

433
00:25:10,863 --> 00:25:13,071
The long way back to happily ever after?

434
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,322
- I had a job to do.
- As I do.

435
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,446
Now,

436
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:22,102
I thought this was supposed to be
a professional meeting about my staff.
That's why I'm here.

437
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,157
Excuse me.

438
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:43,618
You need to work on your anti Ori speech.

439
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:46,388
That Prior almost had me believing.
Well...

440
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:50,763
- not so much believing as willing to say I believe.
- I know.

441
00:25:53,372 --> 00:25:56,985
You are asking people to stand up
and put their lives on the line.

442
00:25:57,065 --> 00:26:00,457
I really believe it's the only way we're
gonna have to defend ourselves against them.

443
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:02,103
You could try shooting them.

444
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:04,692
You said the Priors are human, right?

445
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:06,579
A few well aimed shots might

446
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,225
at least get their attention.

447
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:10,191
The interesting thing about religion is, you find that

448
00:26:10,232 --> 00:26:13,282
killing the missionary
doesn't combat the overall philosophy.

449
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:16,655
The problem is, what the Priors
are offering, sounds quite good.

450
00:26:16,935 --> 00:26:20,829
Until you get to the whole prostrating
and burning people alive bits.

451
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:22,755
There's that and

452
00:26:22,796 --> 00:26:26,690
- I don't think any of us
have read the real fine print yet.
- Meaning?

453
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:30,222
Well,
I personally know without a doubt, the Priors are bad.

454
00:26:30,262 --> 00:26:32,309
- So creepy.
- And...

455
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:34,838
believe or die is an archaic moral standing.

456
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:39,896
No, the Ori are wrong for doing what
they're doing, but the part I haven't
figured out yet, the part that's really bothering me,

457
00:26:39,935 --> 00:26:41,622
is why they're doing it.

458
00:26:41,903 --> 00:26:44,913
I mean, why do they care if people worship them or not?

459
00:26:59,063 --> 00:27:01,592
We have decided to spare your life.

460
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:03,358
Really?

461
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,004
Thank you.

462
00:27:05,044 --> 00:27:06,409
Your punishment

463
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,299
will be imprisonment for the rest of your life.

464
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:11,146
What?

465
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:13,955
Azdak, after everything we've been through.

466
00:27:13,995 --> 00:27:15,199
Together!

467
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:19,415
You made me rub your feet.

468
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:22,710
Weren't you justly rewarded?

469
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:27,062
Anyway, the odd massage here and
there hardly worth life imprisonment.

470
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:30,233
You lied and abused the people of this planet.

471
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,517
What about the Prior?

472
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:33,203
Wait a minute. We're not done here with me yet.

473
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:35,050
Yes, we are.

474
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,857
As for the Prior,

475
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:38,663
the settlement is divided.

476
00:27:38,743 --> 00:27:41,513
Many believe the Ori are worthy of our devotion.

477
00:27:41,714 --> 00:27:42,918
And you?

478
00:27:44,323 --> 00:27:45,808
Vachna has fallen ill.

479
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:47,413
That's the man the Prior healed.

480
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:49,260
<i>- Yes.
- Please hurry.</i>

481
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:51,508
We fear he might be close to death.

482
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:53,234
Wait, Azdak!

483
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:57,850
Maybe we can help.

484
00:27:59,697 --> 00:28:01,664
I do not want you near me!

485
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:02,611
Take it easy!

486
00:28:02,707 --> 00:28:05,397
It's OK. She's not going to hurt.

487
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,634
There. How do you feel now?

488
00:28:21,674 --> 00:28:23,641
What have you done to me?

489
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:27,895
Making people feel good is a natural talent of mine.

490
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,381
Can you sit up?

491
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:34,399
I do not understand.

492
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:36,085
How did you do it?

493
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:39,095
How? This is a tool.

494
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:42,828
Like a hammer, a shovel, just a lot more complicated.

495
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:49,050
Just because you don't understand something at first,
doesn't mean it's the magic of the Gods.

496
00:28:52,301 --> 00:28:55,151
You think that if we are united and

497
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:59,467
tell this Prior we will not heed his word,
he will merely go away and leave us alone?

498
00:28:59,507 --> 00:29:03,481
Well, I wish I could say for sure what will happen.
All I know is, you have to make a stand.

499
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:05,556
Whatever happens, we'll be here to back you up.

500
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:09,020
But ultimately it's gonna be up to you and your people.

501
00:29:10,505 --> 00:29:16,455
In exchange for saving Vachna's life I've decided
to reopen the issue of your life imprisonment.

502
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:17,855
Thank you.

503
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,799
I have to admit, it did make me feel rather good.

504
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,744
I'm sure you thought there might be a reward.

505
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:23,014
That's not why I did it.

506
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,927
Speaking of rewards. The entirety of your property will
be kept here as payment for your crimes.

507
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,492
Now hang on a minute.

508
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,566
You alright?

509
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:36,266
Yes, it's just been a very long day.

510
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:38,609
Azdak! You must come quickly.

511
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:43,642
- What is it?
-  Many have fallen ill.

512
00:30:04,231 --> 00:30:06,118
Thank you.

513
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:09,474
You are truly blessed.

514
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,139
Oh, I don't know about that.

515
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,949
Just doing the best that I can.

516
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,839
How many have fallen ill?

517
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:21,010
I've lost count, but it's a lot.

518
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:27,039
Whatever this thing is, it's spreading like wildfire.
Come on, we need you over here.

519
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,339
We'll talk about my treasure later.

520
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:36,319
We're doing our best to quarantine the sick.
Vala's using the healing device to cure them as
they come in,

521
00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:38,125
but they're piling up pretty quick.

522
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:39,273
Symptoms?

523
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:43,544
Weakness, high fever, chest and stomach pains.

524
00:30:43,784 --> 00:30:48,501
They have trouble breathing. Some of the extreme cases
have gone into shock before Vala could even get to them.

525
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:52,636
It doesn't sound like we're dealing with something
transmitted from person to person. Not that fast.

526
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:56,369
We could be looking at a common source.
Possibly water or food.

527
00:30:56,409 --> 00:30:58,761
Oh I'd say we know the source.

528
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:02,130
Looks like these Priors wanna show us
they're gonna play hard ball.

529
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:04,543
Well they're definitely trying
to establish some crediblity, Sir.

530
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:06,886
How are you and your team, Colonel?

531
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,574
Yeah, we're fine.

532
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:11,704
But I reckon we could use some back-up.

533
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:13,672
On the way Colonel.

534
00:31:13,911 --> 00:31:15,758
Thank you Sir.

535
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:22,220
You alright?

536
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:27,278
No.

537
00:31:31,814 --> 00:31:32,738
You can do this.

538
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:34,704
I'm not so sure.

539
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:40,687
Look, I know using that hand device,
must be taking a lot out of you,
but we really, really need your help right now.

540
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:47,529
Each one, it's getting harder each time.
It takes longer and they keep coming.
I don't think I can save this whole village, Daniel.

541
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,516
You have to keep trying.

542
00:31:49,556 --> 00:31:52,085
Jackson, we've got a problem here.

543
00:31:53,008 --> 00:31:54,237
Give me a minute.

544
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,621
Now please!

545
00:32:05,928 --> 00:32:07,176
He was just fine.

546
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:09,705
Well, he's not fine now.

547
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,049
I healed him.

548
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,798
If they can get reinfected, this will never end.

549
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,873
We must give in. They are too powerful.

550
00:32:18,913 --> 00:32:20,318
No.

551
00:32:21,582 --> 00:32:23,067
It's OK.

552
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,456
I'm here.

553
00:32:33,163 --> 00:32:33,649
Caroline!

554
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:39,485
I'm Chief Medical Officer on this base. It's my call
who goes on this mission. Given my work with the CDC,
infectious disease is my specialty.

555
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:41,898
I am easily the most qualified for this.

556
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:45,286
I know. I'm your Dad.

557
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:49,582
I just came by to wish you luck. And be careful.

558
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:54,638
Thank you. I will.

559
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,830
Hang in there. Don't give up yet.

560
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:17,218
Hey! Thanks for coming.

561
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:18,543
This is worse than I thought.

562
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:20,269
Yeah, they're falling pretty fast.

563
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:23,079
We're gonna need a place to work.

564
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:24,644
This way.

565
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:39,536
What?

566
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:42,667
This is not working anymore.

567
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:44,674
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:44,714 --> 00:33:46,801
You have to keep trying.

569
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:49,451
At least put on a show, keep their hopes up.
I mean, we know you can do that.

570
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:53,846
See, this is exactly why I never even think about
trying to help people. I'm terrible at it.

571
00:33:53,887 --> 00:33:58,644
Because of me, these poor souls are either going
to die horribly, or they're going to give in to the
Prior in the hopes that he'll heal them.

572
00:33:58,683 --> 00:33:59,768
It's not because of you!

573
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:01,719
I cannot make them better!

574
00:34:01,815 --> 00:34:06,592
And, if I hadn't of been so worried about my precious
treasure, I would never have opened my big fat mouth
and we never would have come here.

575
00:34:06,632 --> 00:34:10,485
Then these people would still have to hide or
convert to Origin and face the consequences.

576
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:14,138
That's a dilemma the rest of our galaxy is also
going to have to worry about.

577
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:16,627
May I speak with you?

578
00:34:24,414 --> 00:34:29,150
I've pretty much ruled out bacterial infection.
At this point I'm treating with an anti-viral cocktail.

579
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:30,877
We're just gonna have to wait and see.

580
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:33,967
Any idea why the hand device seems
to have lost it's effectiveness?

581
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:37,540
First I'd have to understand,
even remotely, how that thing works.

582
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,397
I do know it's not unheard-of for virus' to mutate and
become immune to whatever's trying to attack it.

583
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:46,411
Obviously in this case we're dealing with something
more than just a garden variety superbug.

584
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:50,666
Alright, I don't know if this helps or not, but we know
the Ancients were almost wiped out by a similar plague.

585
00:34:50,707 --> 00:34:53,396
I'm just bringing it up in case there's something
in the research that's already been done.

586
00:34:53,436 --> 00:34:54,664
You think the Ori gave it to them?

587
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,144
I am aware that SG-1 was infected with a virus and then
cured by an Ancient found frozen, down in Antarctica.

588
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,090
The symptoms and rate of
progression here are remarkably similar.

589
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,703
Do you have any hypothesis as to
why we have not been infected?

590
00:35:06,742 --> 00:35:08,549
No, we're still looking at your bloodwork.

591
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:10,074
Excuse me.

592
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,379
Feel my forehead, am I hot?

593
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,879
Hotter than usual?

594
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:19,127
You know what I mean.

595
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,932
I'm sorry.

596
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:24,505
I'm sure you know how much I wanted
to walk in here and solve this.

597
00:35:24,545 --> 00:35:27,235
Hey, you wanted to be a Doctor.

598
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:30,608
I've seen some bad situations before,
but nothing like this.

599
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:33,518
And based on that comparison, what's your prognosis?

600
00:35:33,558 --> 00:35:38,576
If we don't make a big breakthrough really soon,
these people are gonna need a miracle.

601
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:41,827
<i>Dr Lam? You're needed immediately.</i>

602
00:35:42,028 --> 00:35:45,199
I have to go. Lam out.

603
00:35:47,627 --> 00:35:49,594
This is bad, right?

604
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:52,725
The virus is shutting down his internal organs.

605
00:35:52,765 --> 00:35:57,020
He can't process toxins within his own system.
He's essentially being poisoned to death.

606
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,545
You can't give him more medicine?

607
00:35:58,987 --> 00:36:02,479
As it is, this may be the virus bouncing
back against treatment.

608
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:04,406
I hate having to say this,

609
00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:07,296
but there's nothing I can do.

610
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:28,355
Time of death. 14 hours, 18 minutes
after preliminary symptoms were first noted.

611
00:36:32,529 --> 00:36:35,821
Remove the body and prep for autopsy.

612
00:36:36,183 --> 00:36:38,671
Could I have a minute with him first?

613
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:54,487
This is the first, not the last.

614
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:57,438
I've gotta get back to Colonel Mitchell.

615
00:37:08,636 --> 00:37:10,829
You did everything you could.

616
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:12,931
<i>He has returned!</i>

617
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:16,343
The Prior of the Ori has returned!

618
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:20,559
You go ahead Daniel.

619
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:31,557
Please, you must save us.

620
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:34,246
Forgive those blinded by ignorance.

621
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:35,771
People are dying.

622
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:37,779
Our children are dying.

623
00:37:37,818 --> 00:37:39,947
They will believe. They do believe.

624
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:43,323
Still, not all of you.

625
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:47,714
They are not of us! They do not speak for us!

626
00:37:47,754 --> 00:37:49,240
Why are you doing this?

627
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:55,020
From the smallest seed of doubt springs
forth a mighty poisonous tree of evil.

628
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:57,187
Yeah alright. Cut the crap!

629
00:37:57,228 --> 00:37:59,314
This is my fault, alright?

630
00:37:59,354 --> 00:38:06,083
I'm the one who told these people,
if they didn't bow down to you, bow down to the Ori,
you might just give up and go away. Well I was wrong.

631
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:08,386
I understand now.

632
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:11,397
You don't have to kill them to prove a point to me!

633
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:14,086
Do you truly understand?

634
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:16,615
I understand this isn't about you and me.

635
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:19,144
It's about all the children of the Ori.

636
00:38:19,184 --> 00:38:20,630
Enough!

637
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,490
<i>- Heal these people now!
- Vala?</i>

638
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:30,745
No Daniel, I've had it with the Ori.
I think it's time we sent them a message.

639
00:38:30,785 --> 00:38:32,150
Or will you heal them?

640
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,558
Only their faith can heal them now.

641
00:38:34,598 --> 00:38:37,087
Then you're useless to us.

642
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:49,130
Stop at once!

643
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:54,388
Please do not let their evil deeds doom us.

644
00:38:54,429 --> 00:39:00,248
We all bow to the power of the Ori.

645
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:10,024
Hallowed are the Ori.

646
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:13,636
Hallowed are the Ori.

647
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:38,363
Colonel!

648
00:39:42,698 --> 00:39:45,227
Have you got a couple of aspirin?

649
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,595
Dr Lam.

650
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:49,803
How are you feeling?

651
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:52,612
Tingly.

652
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:55,315
How about we pretend I didn't say that?

653
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:59,821
OK. You hang on and I'll be right back.

654
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:05,378
Hey, what did I miss?

655
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:13,965
<i>Oh my God!</i>

656
00:40:14,004 --> 00:40:17,979
That's not all. Look.

657
00:40:43,347 --> 00:40:47,642
Tell others what you have seen today.
