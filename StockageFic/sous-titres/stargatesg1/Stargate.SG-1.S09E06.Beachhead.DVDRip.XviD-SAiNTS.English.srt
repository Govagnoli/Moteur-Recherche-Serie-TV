1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,685
<i>Previously on Stargate SG-1...</i>

2
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:05,253
Come back and rejoin SG-1.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,088
I have my reasons for wanting this job.

4
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:08,223
What if the world needs saving?

5
00:00:08,307 --> 00:00:10,851
If the world needs saving,
I will be there to do what I can.

6
00:00:10,876 --> 00:00:14,880
The bracelets create a physiological bond
between the wearers.

7
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:16,673
- They were used by the Goa'uld.
- Jackson.

8
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:18,083
Jackson?

9
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:20,502
You were completely unresponsive
when we brought you in,

10
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:23,614
but your condition suddenly improved
when she came back.

11
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:24,640
Miss me?

12
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:25,583
Who's that?

13
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:29,529
<i>A gentleman who claims that he represents
some Gods called the Ori.</i>

14
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,640
<i>There are as many humans
out there as there are Jaffa.</i>

15
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:34,208
<i>If we don't continue to work together,</i>

16
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:39,689
<i>the victory we worked so long and hard for,
could result in chaos.</i>

17
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:47,095
- You show no fear Latal.
- He is one man. What is there to fear?

18
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:50,692
He promised retribution if we did not
bow to their Gods upon his return.

19
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:54,696
The Jaffa have shed too much blood
to replace one false God with another.

20
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,099
We have made our decision and we will tell him.

21
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,525
Have you come alone?

22
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:08,911
The Ori are with me always.

23
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:12,482
You have read from the book of Origin.

24
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:13,508
We have.

25
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,744
What say you to the promise of the Ori?

26
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:21,524
We will hear no more of false Gods.

27
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:25,645
Go now and we will spare your life.

28
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:27,447
You speak for all?

29
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:29,366
We do.

30
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:32,911
One way or another,

31
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:36,415
this world will serve their purpose!

32
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:42,088
Jaffa!

33
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:11,610
Thank blessing the glory of the Ori...
Thank to the Ori...

34
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:24,054
Season 9 - Episode 6
Beachhead

35
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,639
Unscheduled offworld activation!

36
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:30,065
What have we got, Chief?

37
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:32,020
Receiving a message Sir. It's text only.

38
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:41,906
It's in Goa'uld.

39
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:44,637
None of you folks read Goa'uld, do you?

40
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:58,582
You boys aren't going to let people from two different
planets beat you at your own silly game are you?

41
00:03:58,642 --> 00:03:59,928
This silly game isn't over yet.

42
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:01,214
That's my wingman.

43
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,339
You need a new wingman.

44
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:03,665
I'm gonna kick your ass!

45
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:04,830
Promises, promises.

46
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:12,143
As you were, Colonel.

47
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:13,912
Actually, I was looking for Teal'c.

48
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:17,849
We received a communiqué from a Goa'uld named Nerus.

49
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:18,934
Ring any bells?

50
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:20,983
I am aware of his identity.

51
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,564
He was a minor Goa'uld
who served Baal for many centuries.

52
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:26,769
What can you tell me about him?

53
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:28,618
Honestly, you don't want to know.

54
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,944
Honestly, I do.

55
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:31,230
Why?

56
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,288
What do you say we go with the idea that
I'm in charge and I've asked a simple question?

57
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,572
Nerus defines avarice and gluttony. Simple answer?

58
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,310
He is a Goa'uld known for his many...

59
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:45,837
appetites.

60
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,212
He's also known as an inventor responsible
for a host of Goa'uld technologies.

61
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,055
Really?

62
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:52,106
That's when I started paying attention to him, too.

63
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:54,114
Weird as it sounds,

64
00:04:54,436 --> 00:04:56,485
he's offering to work for us.

65
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:01,829
Nerus is not to be trusted.

66
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:03,276
Funny.

67
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,767
He had nice things to say about you.

68
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,648
No, he really did. He said some very nice things.

69
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:18,948
<i>"I would consider it a great honour to meet the heroes
of the Tau'ri, who brought the Goa'uld to their knees."</i>

70
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,761
- Yeah, it is nice.
- No, he's disgusting.

71
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:26,884
You can't honestly open the doors to a pathetic,
minor Goa'uld, posing as one of the big boys.

72
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:30,139
Well at least promise me
you're intending on torturing him.

73
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,149
We're setting him up in the VIP suite.

74
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,013
- No?
- Yes.

75
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,103
- Sir, if you don't mind my asking...
- Why?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:39,804
Well, according to his communiqué, he's in possession
of military intelligence of the utmost urgency.

77
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,531
Sounded like it was worth a listen.

78
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,138
Still, why throw in with us?

79
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:45,309
Why not stay with Baal or work for some other Goa'uld?

80
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,246
Well, look at it in terms of optics.
We must look like major players now.

81
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:50,694
By defeating Anubis.

82
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:54,109
Most of the System Lords were killed by
the Replicators, then we defeated the Replicators.

83
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:55,936
Wow, we look cool.

84
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:57,343
Don't let it go to your head.

85
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:00,477
Have you seen this list of dietary requirements?

86
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:02,124
Already taken care of.

87
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,575
Ripened Traquil eggs?

88
00:06:04,856 --> 00:06:07,429
We got eggs. I don't know if they're ripe or not.

89
00:06:07,771 --> 00:06:11,949
SG-3 is with him on a neutral planet,
doing a security check as we speak.

90
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,823
As soon as they give the green light, I want you to...

91
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:16,632
<i>Offworld activation!</i>

92
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:19,042
Speak of the devil.

93
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:37,004
- He's clean Sir.
- Thank you Sergeant, we'll take it from here.

94
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:39,174
Hello, I am Nerus.

95
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:41,926
Major General Hank Landry.
I'm in command of Stargate...

96
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,399
Yes, I'm sure you're a very
important person and you had

97
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:47,412
very important reasons for subjecting me
to your security precautions.

98
00:06:47,694 --> 00:06:48,979
But to meet you.

99
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:52,395
To look upon the face of the one.

100
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,297
- The one what?
- The one who inspired a great uprising of course.

101
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,003
Now the time of false Gods is at an end and
no small part because of this man!

102
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:06,861
Doctor Daniel Jackson!

103
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:09,834
It is rumoured among the Goa'uld,

104
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:12,968
that you alone defeated Anubis. Is that true?

105
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:16,906
- Where'd you hear that?
- Oh, I hear everything.

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,974
Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell. Leader of SG-1.

107
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:24,642
But you, you're not...

108
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:25,606
No.

109
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,298
- Will he be here?
- Nope!

110
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:35,732
And you're not even Colonel Carter, are you?

111
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:40,152
This isn't at all the way I imagined that will be.

112
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:42,764
Nerus, if you'd follow me to our Briefing Room.

113
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:44,170
We have much to discuss.

114
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:46,160
Yes, yes. But first I must have sustenance.

115
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,797
- Have you met all my dietary requirements?
- As much as humanly possible.

116
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:52,730
Good, good, because I'm positively famished.

117
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:21,200
No seeds!

118
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:23,289
How is that possible?

119
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:26,021
It's a state secret, but we're willing to negotiate.

120
00:08:26,102 --> 00:08:29,999
That's impossible, but delicious.

121
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,223
Still...

122
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,201
Still we have important matters to discuss, don't we?

123
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:41,894
Your voice... just changed.

124
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:44,224
Oh, we don't have to talk that way.

125
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:51,055
This is a device that I invented.

126
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:54,109
What you're about to see, occurred

127
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:56,681
nearly two days ago.

128
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:01,824
Now the free Jaffa who
claim this planet called Kallana...

129
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:03,030
What was that?

130
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:07,852
The formation of an extremely large forcefield
around the planet's Stargate.

131
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:09,057
Brilliant.

132
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:12,955
And you're sharing this information with us, because?

133
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:16,852
Why are you so surprised?
We joined forces to destroy the Replicators.

134
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,384
I have no recollection of your participation.

135
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:20,147
<i>Teal'c.</i>

136
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,116
You wound me.

137
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:27,260
I was the one who figured out how to activate
all the Stargates in the galaxy at once!

138
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:32,001
Didn't Ba'al mention that to you?

139
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:34,292
That is so like him.

140
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:37,728
Isn't it though? That's alright.

141
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:43,012
Your adversaries call themselves the Ori.

142
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:44,941
We know all about the Ori.

143
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:48,798
Yes, well thus far I detect only a single individual,

144
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:52,495
no doubt a Prior, inside the forcefield, but...

145
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:56,152
It is expanding.

146
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:59,105
Then it will soon be able to accomodate entire armies.

147
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:02,963
Yes, and further more, the Stargate itself
has not shut down since it opened.

148
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:04,450
Wait a minute.
You say this happened two days ago?

149
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,285
Yes.

150
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:09,795
38 minutes is the maximum time a Stargate
can stay open. That's a law of wormhole physics.

151
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:11,483
Not according to the Ori.

152
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:13,894
Which means they have a power source
which can indefinitely maintain a wormhole

153
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:16,204
from another galaxy, plus this forcefield.

154
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,650
A ZPM can't even do that.

155
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,624
How to do battle with an enemy so powerful?

156
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:24,762
With my help?

157
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:31,473
Every forcefield has a weakness and
I'm confident that I shall find it.

158
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,787
Sir, if this intel is correct, it represents a
complete change of tactics. We'll have to respond.

159
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,012
I agree, Colonel.

160
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:42,946
But if this Kallana is a Jaffa world,

161
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,317
I'm not sure how this is our fight.

162
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:47,366
Not your fight?

163
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:52,831
You engineered the downfall of the Goa'uld.

164
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:57,854
This is very much a galaxy of
your own making... General.

165
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:00,666
And you must take responsibility.

166
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:02,274
What would you have us do?

167
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:06,974
Attack them as quickly as possible with
as much force as you can bring to bear.

168
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:14,169
<i>This is nothing short of an invasion, General.</i>

169
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,901
Like it or not, you're in a state of war.

170
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:24,952
<i>Jack, Jack.</i>

171
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:29,553
Jack, she practically invented the Mark 9 and
you're the one who thinks we should use the damn thing.

172
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,807
Why are you wasting valuable time saying no?

173
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:37,951
I've read enough of your SG-1
mission reports to know that

174
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:42,410
there were times when no-one else but Samantha Carter
could have pulled your ass out of the fire.

175
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:44,821
Well this is one of those ti...

176
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:46,951
Reporting as ordered, Sir.

177
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:49,281
Yeah.

178
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:51,171
She's standing right here.

179
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:53,863
You're a funny man, Jack.

180
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:55,491
Very funny.

181
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,175
Chevron 4 encoded.

182
00:12:05,537 --> 00:12:06,782
I promise you he's lying.

183
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:08,630
- Oh, which part?
- All of it.

184
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,876
Chevron 5 encoded.

185
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:13,733
Yet we have been unable to dial the coordinates
to Kallana despite several attempts.

186
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,627
Goa'uld don't do anything for anyone,
other than themselves.

187
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:18,074
Chevron 6 encoded.

188
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:20,364
Maybe it's in his own interests to stop the Ori.

189
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:24,382
Chevron 7 still will not lock.

190
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:27,477
Alright, we've tried that long enough. Colonel Carter?

191
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:30,511
We've revised the original
plans slightly, to expedite matters.

192
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:34,770
The Prometheus is en route and will
rendez-vous with us at P4C-452.

193
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:36,658
We'll proceed to Kallana from there.

194
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,380
Now considering their unique ability
to maintain an active Stargate indefinitely

195
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,766
and their forcefield capabilities,

196
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:46,383
the President has authorised any
and all means, to complete the mission.

197
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,320
Oh boy. And here I was trying
to have a nuke free career.

198
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,310
<i>We've been developing something at Area 51,</i>

199
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:56,088
that General O'Neill believes will be our best
chance to stop them, right here, right now.

200
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,493
But you don't agree.

201
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:00,105
I agree we have to try.

202
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:01,913
I just don't think it'll be enough.

203
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:03,159
It's what we've got.

204
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:04,525
Questions?

205
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:06,977
No Sir.

206
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:09,267
Still no response from the Jaffa council?

207
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:10,432
None as of yet.

208
00:13:10,553 --> 00:13:14,089
Well, we can't wait for Gerak. We proceed as planned.
Chief, dial the Gate!

209
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:15,455
- Yes Sir.
- Move out!

210
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:34,100
Well, temporary or not, it's good to have you back.

211
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,741
How good is this? We've got the band back together.

212
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,554
You sure with the extra backup singer?

213
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:42,719
Ah, she's good fun.

214
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,568
Plus, we figured if Jackson were to...

215
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,537
- Die.
- Yeah, that's the word.

216
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:48,284
It would jeopardise the mission.

217
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:53,067
Well when we spoke a couple of weeks ago, you said you
thought the effects of the bracelets was wearing off.

218
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:56,322
I was. I just didn't want to put it to a test
from the other side of the galaxy, so...

219
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:59,537
Wow! Just dying to get rid of me now, aren't you?

220
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:01,064
No! I'm not dying...

221
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:02,550
Oh no, I know I'm not welcome here.

222
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,764
Despite all my efforts to try fit
into your good stargating club,

223
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:11,390
you can all rest assured, that as soon as
I can safely part Daniel's company
without killing the both of us,

224
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,233
I will.

225
00:14:15,408 --> 00:14:18,021
Oh, and you!

226
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,641
You will wish you'd listened to me when I said,
letting the Goa'uld come here was a mistake!

227
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,092
<i>Get to it and good luck!</i>

228
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:37,005
Alright, let's do this.

229
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,371
Request permission to come aboard!

230
00:14:51,713 --> 00:14:53,763
Shaft! Welcome back to the Prometheus.

231
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:54,808
Thank you Colonel.

232
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,093
Shaft?

233
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,308
My call sign. Cam... Shaft.

234
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:01,961
Yeah. Disappointing, isn't it?

235
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,733
Flight Deck, this is Pendergast. SG-1 is aboard.

236
00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:07,286
Engage hyperdrive and proceed
to Kallana at best possible speed.

237
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:08,652
Is the Mark 9 ready to go?

238
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:11,264
Standing by for your systems check,
I hear you're in a hurry.

239
00:15:11,304 --> 00:15:12,469
You heard correctly.

240
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,689
What is a Mark 9, exactly?

241
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,818
It's also known as a Gate buster.

242
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,485
Sounds big.

243
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:22,092
Some might say, too big.

244
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:24,283
Really? I've always thought there's no such thing.

245
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,649
Vala this is a military vessel?

246
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,256
I know darling, I've stolen it before.

247
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:28,281
Just try to be...

248
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:29,205
My charming self?

249
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:32,019
Let's see, a little less talk
a little more, shut the hell up.

250
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:02,597
General! Join me for a glass of wine!

251
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:04,607
It's from a place called France.

252
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:05,652
I'm on duty.

253
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:08,424
What is this?

254
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:11,840
This is exquisite. What is it?

255
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,483
Chicken!

256
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:14,010
Chicken?

257
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:16,522
It's a rare delicacy among our people.

258
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:20,541
It's exquisite.
I want more chicken! More chicken!

259
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,987
I'll try to pull some strings.

260
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:27,612
Nerus, this arrangement is only going to work
if you actually do something to help with this problem.

261
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:31,188
I was working.
I was deep in thought when you walked in.

262
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:32,795
Yeah, I could see that.

263
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:34,362
You don't trust me!

264
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:35,889
Course I don't trust you.

265
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:39,625
Now. Here's the latest transmission from my satellite.

266
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:45,894
As you can see, the forcefield
continues to expand in phases

267
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:49,230
and as it does so, it weakens considerably.

268
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:51,279
Enough to penetrate with our beaming technology?

269
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,699
Yes, with those nuclear devices
that you were talking about.

270
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,361
Or SG-1. They could talk to this Prior, face to face.

271
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:02,330
Why would they do that?

272
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,781
We resort to force, only when necessary.

273
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:07,594
Oh, I assure you, it will be. It will be, General.

274
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:11,209
And, and, and with the most
powerful weapons in your arsenal.

275
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,490
I'll forward this new information,
directly to Prometheus,

276
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:18,946
and, I'll see if I can arrange some more chicken.

277
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:21,156
Do!

278
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:36,023
Sir, we received an encrypted databurst from Stargate
Command the moment we came out of hyperspace.

279
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:38,957
Decode it immediately. Are we picking up
any other vessels in the system?

280
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:39,740
Negative Sir.

281
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:41,388
Can we get a closer look at the surface?

282
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:44,201
You can already see the extent
of the incursion with the naked eye.

283
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:51,093
My God, it's enormous!

284
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,408
Not everything I see is in the window.

285
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,177
We can all see, thank you.

286
00:17:56,516 --> 00:18:00,074
It's increased by almost 900% since our original intel.

287
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:01,641
What of the Jaffa, Colonel Carter?

288
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:06,061
I'm sorry Teal'c.

289
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:08,874
I'm not detecting any lifesigns
outside of the forcefield.

290
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,088
- Inside?
- Just one.

291
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:13,897
Prior.

292
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:15,504
I don't know how he's managing it.

293
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:19,120
According to these readings,
the atmosphere inside the field has become toxic.

294
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:22,134
Probably as a result of the Jaffa
weapon's fire on the forcefield.

295
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:25,068
Send a subspace message to Stargate Command.

296
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:28,283
We are over the enemy beachhead.

297
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:50,821
You do realise that no matter how nicely we ask them,
they're not all that likely to stop.

298
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:52,428
Then why are we going down there?

299
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:54,236
Well you're going cos' I'm going.

300
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:56,446
And we're going because we have orders.

301
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:59,119
Thanks to Nerus. Doesn't that alarm anyone?

302
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,611
Well, our government believes we need
to send the Ori a message.

303
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:05,107
Indeed. The Ori need to be made
aware of they are not welcome.

304
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:07,558
Well some of you are certainly expert
in getting that message across.

305
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:10,451
<i>SG-1 this is the Flight Deck.</i>

306
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:14,027
My people are projecting an expansion phase
to occur anytime in the next few minutes.

307
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:15,132
<i>Understood.</i>

308
00:19:17,363 --> 00:19:20,497
If Nerus is correct, we should be able
to punch through with a transport beam.

309
00:19:20,537 --> 00:19:21,485
And if not?

310
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:23,832
Then we're all dressed up with nowhere to go.

311
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:27,649
Your return window will be roughly
16 seconds, once on the surface.

312
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,828
After which time, you'll be committed
until the next expansion phase in about half an hour.

313
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:33,596
I'll be monitoring from the bridge.

314
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:36,208
Thanks. Let's do this.

315
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:44,606
Stand by mode in 3, 2, 1, mark. Good luck.

316
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,562
Set. The weapon is now in mode 2.

317
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:10,063
We are good till the next window.

318
00:20:14,804 --> 00:20:16,492
How can he breathe?

319
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:19,546
Perhaps he has a personal shield of some kind.

320
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:30,515
Yo!

321
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,218
- My name is Lt Col Cameron Mit...
- I know who you are.

322
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:37,267
Yeah, he just told you his name.

323
00:20:37,307 --> 00:20:41,165
I also know you will do
everything in your power to stop us.

324
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:42,411
Obvious.

325
00:20:42,812 --> 00:20:44,339
You will fail.

326
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:46,348
The Ori are more powerful than you.

327
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:52,014
Here's the thing. We're not here to talk to you.
We want to talk to the guys you take orders from.

328
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:54,389
The Ori are all seeing.

329
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:56,615
Great! In that case,

330
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:00,673
we have in our possession, a Mark 9,
Naquadriah enhanced nuclear warhead,

331
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:06,324
which was designed solely for the purpose of vapourising
Stargates and anything else in a 100 mile radius.

332
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:13,532
If you attempt to disable this warhead,
physically, electronically or otherwise,
it will result in an immediate detonation.

333
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:19,961
Now we have a number of these
god-awful things at our disposal and we will
not hesitate to use them if necessary.

334
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:23,739
If you do not disengage
the Stargate within 30 of our

335
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:25,266
Earth minutes,

336
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,761
we will shut down the Gate for you.

337
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:31,654
Go ahead.

338
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:39,069
We know who and what you are and
want no part of what you have to offer.

339
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:45,377
If you attempt this on any other planet in this
galaxy, we will find you and we will fight you.

340
00:21:46,462 --> 00:21:48,070
That's it?

341
00:21:50,158 --> 00:21:53,212
I just gave him 30 minutes.

342
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:09,790
29 minutes.

343
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,235
- Earth minutes?
- Yeah, I've always wanted to say that.

344
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:17,324
Well, now you have.

345
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:24,818
Sure hope they shut down that Gate before
we have to set this thing off.

346
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:27,631
That would appear to be
highly unlikely, Colonel Mitchell.

347
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:30,348
I know! It's naive, even for you.

348
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:35,647
Detonating the largest warhead ever built by man is
not exactly the historical footbump that I had in mind.

349
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:40,489
Not to mention the guilt you're gonna feel for
vapourising a perfectly good Gtargate.

350
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:41,614
And that guy.

351
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:44,306
Ah, he's probably looking forward to it.

352
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,556
Hey Prior!

353
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:52,728
You understand that you're within a 100 mile
radius and that personal shield ain't gonna help you.

354
00:22:52,824 --> 00:22:55,303
Death is only the beginning of the real journey.

355
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:56,603
Sounds familiar.

356
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:59,576
It should sound familiar, Doctor Jackson.

357
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:02,429
When I die, I will ascend.

358
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,639
It is the promise of the Ori.

359
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,291
Even if you fail your task?

360
00:23:09,783 --> 00:23:11,510
What the hell is that?

361
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:18,261
<i>Lieutenant?</i>

362
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:21,274
<i>There was no warning sir. They started firing,
the second they came out of hyperspace.</i>

363
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:24,089
<i>It's damn fortunate they're not firing at us.
Open communications.</i>

364
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:26,942
To Jaffa vessels, this is the Earth ship Prometheus.

365
00:23:26,982 --> 00:23:31,160
We request that you hold
your fire we have people down there!

366
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:35,284
<i>I repeat!</i>

367
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:41,126
SG-1 is on the planet attempting
to negotiate an Ori withdrawal. Cease fire now!

368
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,561
The forcefield is being fired upon by Hatak vessels.

369
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,087
Why are they doing that?

370
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,735
Can we get them to stop doing that?

371
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:53,704
<i>Oh, this could be bad.</i>

372
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:57,200
The Mark 9's fuse in mode 2 is a wee bit twitchy.

373
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,088
You mean, it could go off?

374
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:00,093
Yeah.

375
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:05,954
They stopped firing.

376
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:12,927
Sir? The forcefield is entering
an expansion phase ahead of predicted time.

377
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:17,507
This is Pendergast. I want SG-1 brought back onboard
as soon as we can beam them through the forcefield.

378
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:21,123
<i>SG-1. Prepare for immediate extraction.</i>

379
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:28,738
The weapon is now in mode 1.

380
00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:32,837
Prometheus, we are ready to beam up.

381
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:37,016
Prior! Last chance!

382
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:58,161
I am Gerak, of the free Jaffa.

383
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:00,251
Why have you come here?

384
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,399
It's an honour to speak with you Sir.
My name is Lt. Col. Samantha Carter.

385
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:13,793
By insisting that we cease fire on the enemy stronghold
and you've allowed it to expand even further
and we've lost the element of surprise.

386
00:25:14,677 --> 00:25:17,289
And quite possibly saved the lives of SG-1.

387
00:25:17,328 --> 00:25:19,940
<i>I ask you again. Why have you come to this world?</i>

388
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:25,606
We have reason to believe that the Ori are attempting
to use this planet to stage a full scale invasion.

389
00:25:25,647 --> 00:25:28,459
<i>And you hope to repel this invasion with words?</i>

390
00:25:29,264 --> 00:25:30,750
<i>There is more to this.</i>

391
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:33,643
Words are often the most powerful weapon of all Gerak.

392
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:37,380
The old ways will not stop
an adversary as powerful as the Ori.

393
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:40,877
So you said in your message to the High Council, Teal'c.

394
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:43,167
To which we received no response.

395
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:46,060
We had no choice but to act on the information we had.

396
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,244
And how is it that the Tau'ri received
this information even before the Council?

397
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,494
How we got this information is not important.

398
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:57,593
What is important is that we stand together
as allies, in the face of our common enemy.

399
00:26:16,318 --> 00:26:18,126
You said you've come to fight.

400
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:19,211
We have!

401
00:26:19,252 --> 00:26:25,199
I dispatched a scout in a cloaked cargo ship.

402
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:28,333
He tells me you have done nothing!

403
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:34,602
We're sending the Ori a message which they
should receive in about ten seconds.

404
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:36,289
Shields to maximum!

405
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:40,990
Gerak, I suggest you give the same order
aboard your ships. There will be a blast wave.

406
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:42,196
Jaffa!

407
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:44,807
Five seconds.

408
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:13,297
Sir, the forcefield went into another expansion
phase just as the bomb detonated.

409
00:27:13,538 --> 00:27:14,945
And it's a big one.

410
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:22,460
What is happening?

411
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:29,050
The forcefield continues to expand.

412
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,082
<i>- It isn't supposed to be doing that?
- No.</i>

413
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:32,405
- Why is it doing that?
-  I don't know.

414
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:33,852
- What are you gonna do about it?
-  Will you shut up?

415
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:36,946
That was a multi gigatonne detonation.
There's just no way.

416
00:27:36,986 --> 00:27:38,111
Maybe the Gate was destroyed.

417
00:27:38,151 --> 00:27:41,929
No. If the field is still expanding,
the Gate still has to be active.

418
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:48,880
The environment inside the field has been turned
into super heated plasma. Makes it impossible to
get a reliable reading.

419
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:52,456
And this is your message to the Ori?

420
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:54,184
Pithy, wasn't it?

421
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:57,078
We struck the enemy with our most powerful weapon.

422
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:58,805
And yet their forcefield grows.

423
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,372
That was not our intention.

424
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:04,913
Their beachhead must be destroyed. If you are truly
our ally, you will join us in this attack.

425
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:10,418
If you do not, your ship will become our next target.

426
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:22,394
The detonation did weaken the forcefield

427
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:24,667
Our combined weapons fire might just finish the job.

428
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:28,822
If it is not, we will soon be
engaged in battle with Gerak's forces.

429
00:28:28,863 --> 00:28:30,590
We just don't have enough information.

430
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:35,855
Until I can explain how they're keeping
the Gate open or powering a forcefield this large.

431
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:36,619
It's your call.

432
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:39,954
I say we run away and rethink the whole thing.

433
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:47,508
Open up with everything we've got.

434
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:53,757
Bring the main rail gun online.
Commence firing. Launch missiles.

435
00:29:03,094 --> 00:29:04,721
Is the fire having any effect?

436
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:06,474
Forcefield is definitely losing strength.

437
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,061
But it's still expanding
at a faster rate than it's weakening.

438
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:11,861
It's almost enveloped the entire planet.
What happens then?

439
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:14,325
Dammit!

440
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,691
- What?
- What?

441
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:18,569
Colonel, we need to cease fire now!

442
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:19,308
Now!

443
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:20,433
Do it!

444
00:29:20,755 --> 00:29:26,982
The greater the intensity of our weapons fire,
the greater and more frequent their expansion phase is.
There is a direct correlation.

445
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:30,157
They're using the energy of
our own weapons to build their beachhead.

446
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:31,644
You mean they planned this?

447
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:35,783
There's no way to project the necessary power
through a Stargate, across galaxies.

448
00:29:35,822 --> 00:29:38,595
So they designed a forcefield that
could be powered by our own weapons.

449
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:42,373
The Ori knew the Jaffa on Kallana
would defend their homeworld and others would follow.

450
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:43,980
And Nerus made certain we'd join in.

451
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,230
Which means he's working for the Ori.

452
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,810
The Mark 9 gave them almost 70 %
of the power they needed to envelop the entire planet.

453
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:52,201
Oh yeah, we've been set up.

454
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:54,588
What a complete shock!

455
00:29:56,115 --> 00:29:57,340
I won't say another word.

456
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:59,149
Gerak's forces must also cease fire.

457
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:00,435
Open communications.

458
00:30:00,475 --> 00:30:01,881
Too late.

459
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,806
I'm reading activity on the surface.

460
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,361
We've got incoming. Three objects and counting.

461
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:23,741
Bearing 180. Rising from the planet's surface
from the coordinates of the Stargate and accelerating.

462
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:25,590
Shields to maximum

463
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,829
Why have you ceased fire?

464
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:32,421
We have reason to believe
our weapons may power the enemy forcefield.

465
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:33,346
Impossible!

466
00:30:33,385 --> 00:30:35,595
Well that's what I thought,
but it's the only explanation.

467
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:38,368
Gerak, they used both of us!

468
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:44,435
Multiple contacts on multiple bearings, Sir.

469
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:45,561
What the hell are they?

470
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:49,940
They're about ten metres long.
But censors read no internal space, no lifesigns aboard.

471
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:53,798
Rear guns to defensive fire mode!
Stand by to launch fighters.

472
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:58,299
One of them is on a collision course.

473
00:30:58,338 --> 00:31:01,578
I can confirm that. 1000 metres.

474
00:31:01,674 --> 00:31:02,421
500.

475
00:31:02,518 --> 00:31:06,335
Sublight engines to emergency thrust.
Brace for impact!

476
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:22,846
Damage report!

477
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:26,221
There's a hull breach on the hangar deck.
Shields are down to 20%.

478
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,753
Return fire. All positions.

479
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:31,283
Sensors are down.

480
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:35,222
Take us out of orbit. We can't stay here.

481
00:31:44,423 --> 00:31:48,020
I wanna know what you sent my people into.

482
00:31:48,061 --> 00:31:52,038
General, I've been expecting you.
You know these eggs, they're not properly ripe.

483
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:55,776
I asked you a question! Sergeant!

484
00:31:56,716 --> 00:32:00,975
They say all good meals come to an end.

485
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:06,384
I assume General, that by now,
SG-1 has reported that the Ori,

486
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:12,934
the closest thing to true Gods in the entire universe,
have successfully established a permanent foothold.

487
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:14,221
What did you do?

488
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:17,917
Oh, it's not what I did, General.

489
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:22,643
What I have done pales
in comparison to your contribution.

490
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:28,148
And by now, the forcefield
has almost entirely enveloped the planet.

491
00:32:28,244 --> 00:32:31,981
Which makes them unstoppable.

492
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:38,450
And we couldn't have done it without you.

493
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:51,405
<i>Two of my ships have been destroyed
and my own flagship has been damaged.</i>

494
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:52,652
We must withdraw.

495
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:55,906
<i>We too have suffered damage,
Gerak, but the battle is not yet over.</i>

496
00:32:56,147 --> 00:32:59,101
Our sensors tell us that
the planet has begun to collapse.

497
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,873
I cannot tell you to what extent.

498
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:07,257
If you choose to remain to find out,
know that your actions will be watched.

499
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:10,713
Hey! We're on the same side here!

500
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:13,485
We shall see.

501
00:33:19,253 --> 00:33:21,537
What is he talking about?

502
00:33:21,924 --> 00:33:23,090
He's leaving.

503
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:27,107
We've got the sensors back up, but we're gonna
have to get closer to the planet to find out.

504
00:33:27,148 --> 00:33:29,559
Right, bring us about.
Take us back into the system.

505
00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:33,617
OK, I've got a fix on the planet.
Looks like Gerak was right.

506
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:37,957
According to the sensors,
its diameter has decreased by 16%.

507
00:33:38,298 --> 00:33:41,352
Planet's don't shrink, in my experience.

508
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,501
Uh, there's something else.

509
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:51,559
What is that?

510
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:53,328
A ship?

511
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:54,835
It's hard to say.

512
00:33:54,874 --> 00:33:59,375
Whatever it is, I think it's composed of the
objects that came through the Stargate.

513
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:10,304
- Doesn't that look an awful lot like a...
- Yeah, it does.

514
00:34:10,345 --> 00:34:12,057
In fact, I think that's just what it is.

515
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:14,765
No, it can't be, cos I was gonna say, Stargate.

516
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:18,044
Try supergate. I estimate it's 3 to 400 metres across.

517
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:21,797
Large enough for passage of an entire Armada.

518
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:24,730
It's incomplete. There's still time.

519
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,748
Time? Time to do what?
What everything we've done has just made things worse.

520
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:31,742
The planet's diameter has now decreased by
up to 50% and it's accelerating rapidly.

521
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:32,788
I think I know why.

522
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:39,015
Only one thing in the universe could power a Gate
that size. It's also the only thing that would allow
them to keep the Gate open this long.

523
00:34:39,056 --> 00:34:40,623
And there's one on the other end.

524
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,506
A black hole.

525
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,098
That's what the forcefield was for.

526
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:47,694
It wasn't mean't to keep us out, it was designed
to collapse the planet into one micro singularity.

527
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:48,559
Why?

528
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,679
Well, this is how they can create a wormhole
that can span such a vast distance.

529
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:55,853
With a black hole at either end they can
maintain an open wormhole indefinitely.

530
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,460
Fine, fine. How do we stop it?

531
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,869
I have an idea. If we could...

532
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:01,884
The next idea that anybody comes up with,
has to be outside the box!

533
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,114
OK, the Gate is composed of individual blocks.

534
00:35:05,155 --> 00:35:08,711
There must be some sort of energy link
between them. Like... like a chain.

535
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:09,394
Exactly! So we...

536
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:11,644
So we need a big ole set of bolt cutters.

537
00:35:11,725 --> 00:35:15,221
<i>Too far outside the box. Get closer to the box!</i>

538
00:35:20,324 --> 00:35:22,936
Planetary collapse is speeding up exponentially.

539
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:27,074
I estimate singularity formation is minutes away
and there will be a significant shockwave.

540
00:35:27,115 --> 00:35:29,405
Whatever we're gonna do, we have to do it now.

541
00:35:29,445 --> 00:35:32,057
Sir? Somebody just activated the ring transporter.

542
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:33,142
What?

543
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:35,794
Oh no.

544
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:04,068
Don't leave without me.

545
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:05,368
Vala! Where the hell are you?

546
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:06,695
You care now!

547
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:07,478
<i>Vala!</i>

548
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,056
I'm aboard the cloaked cargo ship
that Gerak left behind to watch us.

549
00:36:11,095 --> 00:36:12,020
How did you find it?

550
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,627
Good guess?

551
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:20,579
Look, the tones are set a certain way. Rings seek
out the nearest set, which happen to be aboard
this cargo ship, cloaked or not.

552
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:21,664
What are you doing?

553
00:36:21,704 --> 00:36:25,762
<i>Trying to help, Daniel.
Someone had to do something and you wouldn't listen.</i>

554
00:36:25,803 --> 00:36:30,142
<i>Actually, I got the idea from Colonel Carter.
The objects are being held in some sort of energy field</i>

555
00:36:30,183 --> 00:36:33,839
like links in a chain and I intend
to take the place of the last link.

556
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:38,982
Vala, when that singularity forms, there will be a
powerful shockwave. The cargo ship won't survive.

557
00:36:39,023 --> 00:36:44,689
I'm counting on it. I'll ring back before it hits.
Then you can all thank me immensely.

558
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,528
Shields to maximum.

559
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,019
She's running out of time.

560
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,054
Alright.

561
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,856
It's working.

562
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:30,713
She disrupted the energy field
holding the objects in place.

563
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:37,303
The singularity is forming.

564
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:09,209
She did it. The Gate's been destroyed.

565
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:11,298
Did Vala make it back onboard?

566
00:38:11,661 --> 00:38:13,348
Negative Sir.

567
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:21,627
Jackson! Infirmary

568
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:26,006
Get a message to Stargate Command.
The Ori beachhead has been destroyed.

569
00:38:40,472 --> 00:38:44,772
There's still time to repent, General.
The Ori are forgiving.

570
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:49,594
That won't be necessary.
SG-1 has destroyed the Ori beachhead.

571
00:38:52,648 --> 00:38:53,893
You're lying.

572
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:54,817
I'm not.

573
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:58,096
I witnessed their power, General.

574
00:38:58,192 --> 00:39:00,965
Power that will one day be mine.

575
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:05,385
And if what you say is true,
you have merely forestalled the inevitable.

576
00:39:05,868 --> 00:39:07,515
And

577
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:15,350
when you put me to death for what I have done,

578
00:39:15,391 --> 00:39:16,718
I shall ascend.

579
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:26,306
No, you will descend to a small dark room
in the basement of Area 51 and you'll stay there
till you come up with a defence against the Ori.

580
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,294
That was our deal.

581
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:36,769
What would possibly compel me to do that?

582
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:39,059
Hunger.

583
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:01,341
You know, these Ori are just going to try it again.

584
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:03,149
Probably.

585
00:40:03,832 --> 00:40:07,327
Sam, I could sure use
someone like you on the front line.

586
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:10,281
Just think about it.

587
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:16,992
Hey, Jackson!

588
00:40:17,474 --> 00:40:19,886
Sorry, I keep falling asleep.

589
00:40:19,925 --> 00:40:21,794
Well, it's better than the alternative.

590
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:23,884
You're lucky the bracelet's affect was wearing off.

591
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:25,796
Yeah, lucky me.

592
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:28,906
Vala Mal Doran will be mourned.

593
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:35,035
I've been going over the telemetry from the last
few seconds before the formation of the singularity.

594
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:39,094
A matter stream left
the cargo ship just before it exploded.

595
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,835
There's at least a slight chance
that it was pulled into the singularity.

596
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:50,022
So you're saying she could be alive,
somewhere in the Ori home galaxy.

597
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:53,917
It's possible.

598
00:40:54,061 --> 00:40:59,525
Well! We wanted to send them a message.
