No!

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,021
Yes!

8
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,286
You mean this sign?

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,095
- That was supposed to be on the...
- Yeah. I got that.

10
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,694
Is there any particular reason
why you turned this place into Fort Knox?

11
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,497
I'm attempting to rewrite
the safety protocols on Merlin's device

12
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,004
so we can take even larger areas
out of phase.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,368
I set up a two-way force shield
to restrict the range of the device

14
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,502
and to ensure that nobody
entered the field accidentally.

15
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,376
Yeah. Very effective.

Any news on Daniel?

17
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,385
No. The latest sighting by the Jaffa
turned out to be a false alarm,

18
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,581
but Teal'c just got back,
so we're going to grab some lunch

Okay, just let me run one more test.

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,142
- General, we have a problem.
- What is it, Major?

00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,213
I'm not exactly sure how to explain it, sir,
but there's been an accident.

It's Sam.

44

She claims she's not
the Major Carter we know.

00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,931
- What's that supposed to mean?
- She says she's from a parallel universe.

46
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,468
- And given the nature of the experiment...
- Let's not jump to conclusions just yet.

47
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,037
You said there was an explosion.
Was she injured?

48
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,333
Not a scratch, sir,
but she does seem different.

49
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,772
- Different how?
- Well, for one thing,

50
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,400
she claims she's a lieutenant colonel,

51
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,741
and she does have this device with her
I've never seen before.

52
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,474
We have no idea where that came from.

53
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,982

she's telling the truth,

I didn't do it on purpose, believe me.

60
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,134
What about that machine
you brought with you?

61
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,198
It demolecularizes matter
and transports it to another dimension.

62
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,210
- Well, there you go.
- No, no, this is different.

63
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,573
Look, according to M-theory,

64
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,113
there are a fixed number
of alternate dimensions

65
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,580

with our known universe.

The multiverse theory, on the other hand,

67
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,383
posits the existence of an infinite number
of alternate universes,

00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,184
each evolving concurrently with our own.

why I was brought here, of all places.

what was happening in that lab.

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,229
I'm not authorized
to give you that information.

74
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,101
Okay, maybe I could talk to Daniel.
Is he here?

75
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:48,046
Dr. Jackson was captured by
the forces of the Ori several weeks ago.

76
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,447
Okay. What about Colonel Mitchell?

00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,879
What, the 302 pilot
that went down over Antarctica?

79
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,684
That's right. Is he here?

80
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,281
I have no idea where he is.

81
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,055

83
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,862
Teal'c went back to the Jaffa
several years ago,

84
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,128
and if you're talking about Vala Mal Doran,

85
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,533
I hate to break it to you,

86
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,367
but she is currently
occupying a cell at Area 51.

the surveillance footage from the lab.

00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,243
There may be a clue.

90
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,719
Look, I know you want your Carter back
as much as I want to go home,

<i>of figuring this out if we work together.</i>

<i>- Override's not responding!</i>
<i>- Bennet, get out of here!</i>

96
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,313
That's all we got.

97
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,186
Sensors indicate there was
a massive explosion in the room,

98
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,554
but when we opened the door,
instead of finding charred remains,

99
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,092
we found you.

100
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,455
What were the capacitors for?

101
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,297
Major Carter was developing a process

102
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,099
by which we could extract energy
from parallel universes.

103
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,375
And you knew about this?

104
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:27,574
Knowing and understanding are
two totally different things.

105
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:31,149
Ordinarily, this type of energy retrieval
is extremely dangerous,

106
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,811
leading to the creation of exotic particles
in one or both universes.

107
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,412
- I know. We've tried it.
- Oh.

108
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:41,450
Well, our Major Carter
found a way around that.

109
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,960
She designed the machine so the bridge
would only open for a microsecond.

110
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,157
The idea was to steal
small amounts of energy

111
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,927
from thousands of different universes,

112
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,163
thereby minimizing the fallout
in any single one.

113
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,298
Anyway, it doesn't entirely explain
how you got here.

114
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,833
That's true.

115
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,607
The device was never designed to bring
ordinary matter through the bridge.

116
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,046
Well, I was conducting
an experiment of my own.

117
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,948
At the precise moment that your Carter
tapped into my reality,

118
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,578
the entire contents of my lab
were out of phase,

119
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,749
and they were being protected
by a force shield.

120
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,423
Oh, my God.

121
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,189
What... I mean, there's no telling
what effect that would have

122
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,661
on the inter-universal bridge.

123
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,823
Well, presumably, it pulled me through

124
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,401
and caused the capacitors on this side
to overload.

125
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,935
If it brought you here,

126
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,802
is it possible that it sent
our Carter to your universe?

127
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,569
I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.

128
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,489
- General.
- I need to see the President.

129
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,952
- He's on a call. Can it wait?
- No.

130
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,529
- General Hammond.
- Colonel.

131
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,763
- You're in command here?
- That's right.

132
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,363
I'm sorry, sir, it's just a little strange.

133
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,875
The General Hammond I know
is retired from active service.

134
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,871
Well, then, he's a lucky man. Please.

135
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,681
I know this must be difficult for you,
Colonel.

136
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,986
It's difficult for us as well.

137
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,088
In fact, the timing couldn't be worse.

138
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,498
- What do you mean?
- Three weeks ago,

139
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,227
the Ori attempted an attack on Earth.

140
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,594
You survived an Ori attack?

141
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,795
One ship.

142
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,203
We fought them off
with the Ancient Chair.

143
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,243
The ZPM was nearly depleted
in the process.

144
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,835
That's why our Major Carter
was running that experiment.

145
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,780
She was trying to bolster
our power reserves

146
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,215
with captured energy
from other universes.

147
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,048
And, of course,
you only have the one ZPM,

148
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,123
because you've never received
new ones from Atlantis.

149
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,487
Atlantis. You mentioned that before.
What is that?

150
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,585
It's the city of the Ancients,
in the Pegasus Galaxy.

151
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,893
In my reality,
we have an international contingent there.

152
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,729
I don't know about your reality, Colonel,
but in this world,

153
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,861
there isn't much
in the way of international cooperation.

154
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:13,003
Three years ago, the Goa'uld System Lord
Anubis launched an attack on Earth.

155
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,444
We had no choice
but to reveal the existence

156
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,109
of the Stargate program to the world.

157
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,945
LORNE: People panicked.

158
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,645
There was rioting in the streets.

159
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,519
The President had to declare martial law.

160
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,360
The diplomatic fallout was even worse.

161
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,396
You can imagine
how the world's governments reacted

162
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,398
when they realized
the kind of technology being employed

163
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,934
by the United States military.

164
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,800
We barely got the Chair out of Antarctica
before the Russians moved in.

165
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:44,001
Now it's at Area 51,
but it isn't going to do us much good

166
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,274
unless we can find a way to power it.
And that's where you come in.

167
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,016
You want me to complete
your Carter's research?

168
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:55,019
Major Lorne tells me
you've been conducting similar research

169
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,383
in your own universe.

170
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,754
Well, yes, sir, but with all due respect,

171
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,260
we're facing a very real threat
in my universe.

172
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,887
I need to start thinking
about how to get back there.

173
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,556
Let's say we agree to help you get back

174
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,330
and gave you full access
to the resources of this base.

175
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,997
How long would it take?

176
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:15,933
I don't know.

177
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,374
I don't even have a working theory yet.

178
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,605
Well, are we talking weeks
or maybe even months?

179
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,340
Yeah, it's possible.

180
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,576
That's why I need
to get started right away.

181
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:30,715
I'm sorry, Colonel, but the fact is
we don't have that kind of time.

182
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,348
Our intelligence indicates that,
having consolidated their position

183
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,920
in this part of the galaxy,
the Ori are assembling a fleet

184
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,000
for a full-scale attack on Earth.

185
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,466
We expect them within five days.

186
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,578
- What's this about, Doctor?
- I'm not entirely sure.

187
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,344
She says she wants
to show us something.

188
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,888
I thought you agreed to help us, Colonel.

189
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,822
Yes, sir, but after talking to Dr. Lee,
I realized it was a mistake for me

190
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,190
to pursue your Carter's research.

191
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,230
May I ask why?

192
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,323
Well, it would take too long
to get me up to speed,

193
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,527
and to be perfectly honest, sir,
I'm not totally convinced

194
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,933
that I could make it work.

195
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:24,475
- Do you have another suggestion?
- Yes, I do. This.

196
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,576
What the hell?

197
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,980
Doctor?

198
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,121
Colonel, what just happened?

199
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,056
I was taken out of phase, sir.

200
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,388
Invisible and untouchable,

201
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,690
and based on experiments
in my own reality,

202
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,924
100 percent Ori-proof.

203
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:51,162
No offense, Sam, but how does
hiding one lab full of equipment help us?

204
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,135
Well, the field size can be manipulated.

205
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,867
That's what I was working on
when I was brought here.

206
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,967
Our plan was to hide the entire planet.

207
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,795
Hey. How's it coming?

208
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,494
Oh, okay, I guess.
I was just about to run my first simulation.

209
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,404
You know, it's kind of weird,
seeing you in here.

210
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,943
- It's a little weird being in here.
- Yeah.

211
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,946
It's the same, but it's different, you know?

212
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,918
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

213
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,824
I found these pictures, and in them,

214
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,255
she's wearing a wedding ring.

215
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,066
Yeah, that must have been
before the divorce.

216
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,061
So...

217
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,132
Oh, no, no, no. God, no.

218
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,574
No, it was this dot-com millionaire
smart-ass named McKay.

219
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,948
- Not Rodney McKay?
- Yeah.

220
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,382
You have one, too, huh?
Is he a jerk in your universe?

221
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,578
Some people think so.

222
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,488
Sam always said there was a side to him
that no one else saw.

223
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,761
- General.
- Colonel.

224
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,560
I was just coming to see you.

225
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,998
I know.
I already spoke to Dr. Lee this morning.

226
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,299
Then you know our power calculations
are coming up short.

227
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,897
The battle with the Ori ship
simply taxed the ZPM too much.

228
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,476
I'm sorry, sir. I think I may have traded

229
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,307
one power requirement problem
for another.

230
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,040
Not necessarily.

231
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,587
Sir, who are these people?

232
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,214
Secret Service.

233
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,960
Since when have you had
Secret Service outside your office?

234
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,825
It hasn't been my office for three years.

235
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,100
Colonel, nice to finally get to meet you.

236
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,864
Colonel Carter, President Landry.

237
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:13,206
- President? Of the United States?
- That's right. Is there a problem?

238
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,545
No, sir, it's just... Never mind.

239
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,844
I understand you're dealing with
a little power shortage.

240
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,079
How much do you need?

241
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,382
Well, about 700 gigawatts.

242
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,548
That's roughly 80 percent
of the power generating capacity

243
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,388
of the continental United States.

244
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,086
So it's doable, then.

245
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,554
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

246
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,896
We've known about the condition of ZPM
for some time, Colonel.

247
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,697
In addition to our Major Carter's research,

248
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:42,365
as a backup, we've been building
an infrastructure to channel energy

249
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,637
to the Ancient Chair
directly from the U.S. Power grid.

250
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,436
Not enough to give us the upper hand

251
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,380
in a shooting battle
against the whole fleet,

252
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,144
but if your plan works,
there won't be any battles at all.

253
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,447
Charlie, I need a speech,
explaining to the American people

254
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,322
why it's a good thing
they'll be without power

255
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,896
for an undisclosed period of time.

256
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,191
Yes, sir.

257
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,431
Pack your things. You're going to Area 51.

258
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:26,444
- We're ready, sir.
- All right. Let's do it.

259
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,548
My fellow Americans
and citizens of all nations,

260
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,185
tonight our world faces a grave threat.

261
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,594
The same hostile forces
that recently attacked us

262
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,893
without warning or provocation

263
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,697
are again massing for another assault.

264
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,738
Let me assure you that we intend
to meet this aggression

265
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,331
as we did previously
with unwavering resolve

266
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:55,311
and fully confident that we will
once again emerge victorious.

267
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,507
<i>In order to achieve this victory,</i>

268
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:02,178
<i>we will need to divert a significant portion</i>
<i>of our electrical generating capacity...</i>

269
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,481

On behalf of the people
of the great state of Idaho, thank you.

341
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,779
Well, you're very kind, sir.

342
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:32,015
- Keep up the good work, dear.
- Thank you.

343
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,255
Enjoying the party?

344
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,161
Oh, I'm not sure
that's exactly the right word, sir.

345
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,791
Have some champagne. Relax.

346
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,295
I guess I'm just not used to
all the attention.

347
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,896
They do things differently
where you come from?

348
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,941
Well, no, it's not just that.

349
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,840
I feel like an impostor, sir.

350
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,412
I mean, these people think
that I'm Major Samantha Carter.

351
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,847
That won't be a problem anymore.
We're promoting you.

352
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,385
That's not the point, sir.

353
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,044
People here have been through a lot lately.

354
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,555
They need something to believe in.

355
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,691
Your timing is impeccable.

356
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,320
No security without freedom!
No security without freedom!

357
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,419
Sir, let's get you out of here.

358
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,192
MAN: The people will not be silenced
by acts of tyranny!

359
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,700
Our voices will be heard!
No security without freedom!

360
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,395
No security...

361
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,471
(SCREAMS)

362
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,197
MAN: Let's get him out of here.

363
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,717
Prometheus.

364
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,584
<i>MAN ON PA: Welcome to Air Force One,</i>
<i>Mr. President. Is there anything you need?</i>

365
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,317
No, not for the moment, Colonel.
Thank you.

366
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,017
Sorry about that.

367
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,158
- You want a drink?
- No, thank you.

368
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,321
Sir, what the hell just happened?

369
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,492
My security detail
can get a little over-protective.

370
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,730
We probably just could've
gone out the back way.

371
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,636
I meant the protestor, sir.

372
00:22:55,741 --> 00:23:00,269
Well, not everyone is happy about some
of the compromises we've had to make.

373
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,937
Compromises like martial law?

374
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,515
Believe me, Colonel,
I have no desire to go down in history

375
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:08,575
as the man who destroyed
civil liberties in America,

376
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,848
but I think you'll agree
that compared to other presidents,

377
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:14,255
I have faced
some pretty unique challenges.

378
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,563
The President's people are looking for you.

379
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,073
I was just on my way out.

380
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,837
They've been getting
a lot of requests from the media

381
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,640
for you to do some sit-down interviews.

382
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,042
Apparently, you've become
quite the celebrity.

383
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,845
Have you seen this?

384
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,453
It was an Irish village.
It was just bombed by American F-302s.

385
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,691
At the request of the Irish Prime Minister.

386
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,226
That village, as you call it,
was in fact a training camp

387
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:52,922
for terrorists bent on overthrowing
several European governments.

388
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,795
You know, I've also been going over
several mission reports.

389
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,266
You abandoned the alpha site.

390
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,529
You cut ties with the Jaffa.

391
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,696
You pulled back on almost everything.

392
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:01,830
We didn't have a lot of choice.

393
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,807
We devoted our full resources
to planetary defense.

394
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,572
Well, that's understandable,
but now that the Ori attack has failed,

395
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,044
does that mean
you'll be getting back out there?

396
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,275
- That decision hasn't been made yet.
- Of course not.

397
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,875
I mean, why be hasty?
Especially when those 302s are so handy

398
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,181
for putting down your political enemies.

399
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:20,550
Now, I understand you're coming
to see certain things about this world

400
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,717
that you don't like.

401
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,489
To tell the truth,
we don't much like it either,

402
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,291
but you weren't here for the riots.

403
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,299
You didn't see American citizens
shooting each other

404
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,562
over food, water and gasoline.

405
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,935
Hank Landry brought us back
from the brink of chaos.

406
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,631
That was three years ago.

407
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,765
The threat is still out there.

408
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,334
That's the problem. It always will be.

409
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:04,024
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the toast of Washington.

410
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,828
Hi, Rodney. Thank you for seeing me.

411
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:06,904
Well, why wouldn't I?

412
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,906
I mean, we're still friends, aren't we?

413
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,169
I saw you on TV.
Well, recorded you, actually.

414
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,504
Not that I watched it more than once.

415
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,979
I mean, I recorded it
in order to watch you once.

416
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,777
How can I help you?

417
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,320
Well, this is going to come
as a bit of a shock, but...

418
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,853
I'm not who you think I am.

419
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,717
Oh, my God, you're a lesbian.

420
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,223
- Is that what you're trying to tell me?
- What?

421
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,314
No. McKay!

422
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,792
(STAMMERING)
Well, no. I just... I think... I thought...

423
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:31,885
Oh!

424
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,125
What I'm trying to tell you is that

425
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,869
I am from an alternate universe.

426
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,471
(EX CLAIMS)

427
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,232
Your Samantha Carter was working
on an experiment

428
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,501
when she inadvertently pulled me in.

429
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:48,010
Is this some kind of a joke? It's very funny.
Who put you up to this?

430
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,274
This is not a joke, McKay.

431
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,617
In my reality, you're a key member
of a team of international scientists

432
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,347
and explorers based
in the Pegasus Galaxy.

433
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:01,414
You go on dangerous adventures,
you deal with high-level alien technology.

434
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,523
Sounds like I'm a chump.

435
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,722
Nice try, Sam, but even if travel
between universes was possible,

436
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,389
the likelihood of you surviving is...

437
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,663
I was in a force shield
when I was pulled through.

438
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:17,339
Your Samantha Carter was killed in
the same accident that brought me here.

439
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,639
I'm sorry to be so blunt about it,
but I don't have a lot of time,

440
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,679
and I need your help.

441
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,652
- This one's ours?
- Yes, sir. This one is ours.

442
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,416
It was among the artifacts
we found in the cave at Glastonbury

443
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:36,153
just like she said it was, and, remarkably,
it has been in storage ever since

444
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,786
because we did not know what it was.

445
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,455
But now that you do know,
you can make it work, right?

446
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,261
Well, we have to understand,

447
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:46,030
this is an incredibly complicated
piece of machinery.

448
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,435
Our preliminary investigations
have revealed

449
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,943
that it is powered by a crystal
which sits at the back, here.

450
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:56,536
The keys are labeled in Ancient,
which we're in the process of translating.

451
00:26:56,648 --> 00:27:01,051
Now, these keys, they appear to operate
in the normal way that keys do,

452
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,683
- up and down...
- Doctor!

453
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,787
Have you learned anything substantial
about the operation of this machine?

454
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,454
The operation? Not really. No, sir.

455
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,055
In fact, the only person who truly
understands this technology

456
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,963
is Colonel Carter.

457
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,795
All right. Thank you.

458
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,666
No. Thank you, sir.

459
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,244
What are we going to do?

460
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,182
We're not going to do anything.

461
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,649
Mr. President, we told her if she helped us,
we'd let her go.

462
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,517
I'm sorry, George, but for the moment,
we can't afford to lose her.

463
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,590
She's not going anywhere.

464
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,853
Okay, you need to slow down.

465
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,394
You're telling me my ex-wife is dead,

466
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,157
even though you look exactly like her,

467
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,095
except for the hair,
which is nice, by the way.

468
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,598
On top of that,
you're from another universe,

469
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,828
and you need me to help you get back?

470
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,200
In my reality,
you successfully designed and built

471
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:58,264
a bridge between parallel universes
with a little help from your sister.

472
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,709
Really? What, so she and I get along
in your universe?

473
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,311
Not exactly.

474
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,410
Anyway, I've been trying my best
to recreate your calculations,

475
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,850
but I keep coming up short.
That's why I'm here.

476
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,854
I have not done
a lot of theoretical physics lately, okay?

477
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,617
I mean, these days I tend to do

478
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,556
a little more of
the buying and selling of companies.

479
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,221
The Rodney McKay I know
wouldn't back down from a challenge.

480
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:24,563
He is one of the most forthright,
courageous and selfless men

481
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,227
I have ever met.

482
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,401
- Oh, you're making that up, aren't you?
- Most of it, yeah.

483
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,238
Okay, I'll help you.

484
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:36,781
Good news, Bill.

485
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:41,318
We've got somebody to help
with the calculations.

486
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,788
Where's my equipment?

487
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,289
Still at Area 51.

488
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,485
It was supposed to be returned
once the Ori fleet was gone.

489
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,789
I need it for the defense of my own world.

490
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,354
I'm sorry, the timing's not good for you
to go back just yet.

491
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,630
We'll revisit your situation
after the plebiscite.

492
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,128
What plebiscite?

493
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,264
Last year, Congress was forced
to cancel the mid-term elections

494
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,535
because of widespread unrest.

495
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,845
It was supposed to be temporary,
but when things didn't improve,

496
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,438
we voted to suspend elections indefinitely.

497
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,414
Now it comes down to
a simple yes-or-no vote

498
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:14,849
to put the President in office.

499
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,252
You're a member of my team,
the woman who saved the world.

500
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:23,183
Do you have any idea
what kind of political capital that's worth?

501
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,359
I won't help you subvert democracy.

502
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:28,455
LANDRY: This world is dangling
by a thread, Colonel, and, unlike you,

503
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:32,400
the rest of us will never have the luxury
of leaving for someplace better

504
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,199
when things get tough.

505
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,535
This is our home,

506
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,072
and we'll make the best of it.

507
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,955
I don't want to hear it, George.

508
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,389
You could cut her a little slack, sir.

509
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,328
She's completely out of her element.

510
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:05,801
Trapped here, away from everyone
and everything she knows or cares about.

511
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,271
She also happens to be a symbol of hope
to the entire planet.

512
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,535
Because we made her into one.

513
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,938
Because that's what we needed.

514
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,145
See, I know what you're thinking.

515
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,815
"Damn politicians."

516
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,909
I still can't stand them,
and I'm one of them.

517
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,476
The main one.

518
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,751
You were the right man for the job.
You still are.

519
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,722
I know it wasn't easy for you
taking us down this road.

520
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,426
What's going to be even harder is
getting us back.

521
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,039
Going somewhere?

522
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,815
Maybe to see your friend, Dr. McKay?

523
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,518
You had me followed.

524
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,283
He is a wealthy high-tech industrialist,

525
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,721
and I'm sure if anyone outside of this base

526
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,055
had the resources to help you get back
to your own universe,

527
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,719
he'd be the one.

528
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:09,694
But he also derives a significant portion
of his income from defense contracts

529
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:13,931
and some would argue he's a likely target
for an anti-trust investigation.

530
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,739
You'd blackmail him
to keep him from helping me?

531
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:21,005
Just play your part
and everything will be fine.

532
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,339
MITCHELL: How do you take it?

533
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,276
Just black.

534
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,284
Thank you.

535
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,718
Yeah, I like a little sweetener in mine.

536
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,223
I was an F-302 pilot.

537
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,856
Got shot down over Antarctica.

538
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,590
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

539
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,493
Well, a little late in the day for that,
isn't it?

540
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,367
I mean, I already gave my legs
for the freedoms we now enjoy.

541
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,770
It's a hell of a deal, isn't it?

542
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,537
Of course, I recognize you.

543
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,574
Your picture's been
in the papers a lot lately.

544
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,178
Hey.

545
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,920
You want to see something funny?

546
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:45,459
That's me. That's me when I was you.

547
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,594
Hero of the moment,
poster child for the administration.

548
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,828
- You were walking.
- Yeah, well...

549
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,497
I had a little setback in my therapy.

550
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:00,508
After Antarctica,
they flew me to Washington,

551
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,738
pinned a medal on my chest.

552
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,141
Next thing I knew,
I was being trotted out to state dinners,

553
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,445
political rallies. I think...

554
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,784
Yeah, I think I even opened a few malls.

555
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,922
Mr. President said,
"It would be good for morale, son.

556
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:20,827
"Help soften the blow for keeping
the Stargate secret for so long."

557
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,832
What a load of B.S.

558
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,795
So, what happened?

559
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,005
I called him on it,

560
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,098
and they dropped me

561
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,741
like a rock.

562
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:38,339
No more fancy dinners,
no more expensive doctors.

563
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,883
Anyway, walking is overrated.
I've got everything I need right here.

564
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,690
And I do not have to deal with the curfews

565
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,922
or military checkpoints or being detained

566
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,464
without charge.

567
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,993
Life is sweet.

568
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,672
Look, I'm sorry.
I probably shouldn't have come.

569
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:09,572
Oh, no. No, no, no.
You wanted to see for yourself, right?

570
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,478
The price for sticking up
for your principles.

571
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,679
Take a good look.

572
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,169
- Yeah.
<i>- CARTER: It's me.</i>

573
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,708
Colonel, where are you?

574
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,077
Please, you know exactly where I am.

575
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,808
Look, I'll do it.

576
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,249
<i>The interviews,</i>
<i>the TVappearances, I'll play ball.</i>

577
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,754
Wise decision.

578
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:03,928
My guest tonight, Major Samantha Carter,
a 10-year veteran of the Stargate program,

579
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:07,027
and the woman who almost
single-handedly saved the world

580
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,139
from the recent alien attack.

581
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,071
From the recent alien attack.

582
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,141
- Major, welcome.
- Thank you.

583
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,370
Of course, I will be taking calls
later in the segment, but first,

584
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,447
why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself?

585
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:20,677
Well, as you said, I've been with
the Stargate program for the last 10 years.

586
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,084
Most recently, I was appointed
as a special advisor to the President.

587
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,418
Great. In what capacity?

588
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,549
My primary role is to consult
with the President

589
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,627
on matters of planetary defense.

590
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,730
<i>But I also intend to push</i>
<i>for improved foreign relations</i>

591
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:37,892
<i>and the restoration of civil liberties that</i>
<i>were lost since the President took office.</i>

592
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,435
<i>- Really?</i>
- What the hell is she doing?

593
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,973
<i>JULIA: Does the president welcome this</i>
<i>kind of input from his military advisors?</i>

594
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,907
<i>Well, he wouldn't be much of a president</i>
<i>if he wasn't at least</i>

595
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,104
willing to listen to other opinions.

596
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,248
I mean, while I understand
how we got to where we are today...

597
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,317
Shut it down.

598
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,282
<i>... I think it's time</i>
<i>to reassess the situation.</i>

599
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,650
I don't care if you're live.
Shut it down, now.

600
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,882
The people of this country
need to understand

601
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,982
that they are in control
of their government,

602
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,061
not the other way around.

603
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,959
It's your responsibility as citizens
of this country to demand the freedoms

604
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,897
that have been taken away from you.

605
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,994
Demand accountability for why
they were withheld in the first...

606
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:18,474
Major, as much I admire
what you're trying to do, they cut us off.

607
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:23,773
Thanks.

608
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,814
What were you thinking?
You can't say things like that.

609
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,978
Well, somebody's got to say something,
and I'm in a rare position

610
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,315
to make people listen.

611
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,287
They're not going to let you do that,
all right?

612
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,256
I know these people.
They do not mess around.

613
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,621
What are you looking for, anyway?

614
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,922
I want to see how my little tirade's
playing out in the press.

615
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,054
It won't.

616
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,654
What are you talking about?
The show was live.

617
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,757
Millions of people were watching.

618
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,495
It doesn't matter.

619
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,237
I don't understand this.
There's nothing here.

620
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,403
Wait a second.

621
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,240
"Major Samantha Carter had to cut short
an appearance on <i>Inside Access</i>

622
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,838
"with Julia Donovan yesterday
when she suddenly took ill.

623
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:04,643
"A spokesman said she was suffering
from exhaustion due to her busy schedule,

624
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,246
"and would be canceling
her upcoming appearances."

625
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,451
That's what I'm telling you, Sam.

626
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,188
Look, there is no story. It never happened.

627
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,491
You're wrong. People heard me.

628
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,532
Which people?

629
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,704
Major Carter, you need to come with us.

630
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:25,767
(GRUNTS)

631
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,936
(GROANS)

632
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,014
(BEEPING)

633
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,743
Get her in the car!

634
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,530
A gag? Charlie, was that really necessary?

635
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,391
It seemed appropriate, sir.

636
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,869
Get it off! And give us the room.

637
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,378
What am I going to do with you, Colonel?

638
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,042
You could let me go.

639
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,745
I still need you.

640
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,918
For what?
My knowledge of phase technology,

641
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,016
or as a prop for public relations?

642
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,958
What if I said both?

643
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,424
I won't keep my mouth shut.

644
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,625
But that's exactly what you do
in your own world.

645
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,725
Stargate's still a secret, right?

646
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,464
You talk about freedom and democracy,

647
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:31,063
but you're hiding the greatest secret
mankind has ever known

648
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,506
from your own people.

649
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,669
Well, at least on my world,
we don't intend to abandon

650
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,576
the rest of the galaxy to the Ori.

651
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:40,082
Well, maybe not now,
but what do you think will happen

652
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:44,486
if you give them a foolproof way to hide,
like you've given us?

653
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:48,255
And don't be surprised
if the rest of the galaxy

654
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,554
suddenly doesn't seem
that important anymore.

655
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:55,220
No, see, I know at least one man
who won't feel that way.

656
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,326
He's the leader of Stargate Command.
His name is General Hank Landry.

657
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:13,210
Ah, Colonel, how nice to see you again.

658
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,183
Yes, well, thank you.

659
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,717
McKay, what are you doing here?

660
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:25,990
Well, it's the first day on the new job.
Your old job, actually.

661
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,894
Special Advisor to the President.

662
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:31,661
Bit of a pay cut but, well,
let's just say they were persuasive.

663
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,794
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, me, too.

664
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:38,673
Well, the first order of business
is to create an inter-universal bridge,

665
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:42,109
something that I've done
in another reality, apparently.

666
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,646
Are you serious?

667
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,342
Yeah, I'm not sure what you said,
but they're letting you go.

668
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,511
Wow. I guess they must have realized
I'm more trouble than I'm worth.

669
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:54,113
I remember I said the same thing
the day we got divorced.

670
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:59,390
The second order of business is
to make this thing work like yours.

671
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,690
Well, I'll leave you my notes.
That should help.

672
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,467
But let's say that you succeed. Then what?

673
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,968
Then we're safe.

674
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,365
You do know that there is
a whole galaxy out there

675
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:10,963
that's under attack, right?

676
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,900
Millions of people are dying,

677
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,945
millions more being subjugated
to a false religion.

678
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,105
You just never quit, do you?

679
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,843
Deep down, I know that
your president's a good man.

680
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,010
He wants to do the right thing.

681
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:28,183
Maybe he just needs a persistent voice in
his ear nudging him in the right direction.

682
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,728
And you think
I would be good at that, do you?

683
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:36,899
The Rodney I know is a master
of subtle persuasion.

684
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:41,004
Oh, you're lying again, aren't you?

685
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,801
Just think about it.

686
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,815
Dr. Lee?

687
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,157
(EX CLAIMS)

688
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:01,849
(SCREAMING)

689
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,521
Oh...

690
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,361
- You're back!
- Hi.

691
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,937
So, you didn't get any news on Daniel
while I was gone?

692
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,302
Nothing.

693
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,206
Well, at least we got you back.

694
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,808
I am very glad to be back.
The whole thing was kind of creepy.

695
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,749
- Hey, what was I like in that reality?
- You were in jail.

696
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,219
Not again.

697
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,322
What about the rest of us?

698
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,417
You know, to be honest,
I'd really rather not talk about it.

699
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,152
What about you guys?

700
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,960
What have you been doing
this whole time?

701
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,703
When you did not return for several hours,

702
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,865
we began to suspect
that something might have gone wrong.

703
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,409
Well, we just assumed
that the machine had malfunctioned,

704
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,411
and you were stuck out of phase.

705
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,778
We attempted to communicate with you
using the Sodan cloaking device,

706
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,748
and when that failed...

707
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,611
What?

708
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:07,119
We took shifts,
trying to keep you company.

709
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,726
- You mean...
- Yeah, we talked to an empty room.

710
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,262
- For two weeks?
- It did stop eventually,

711
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,824
but it did go on for quite some time.

712
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,095
Indeed.

713
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,171
Well, that must have been
some conversation.

714
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,933
What did you say?

715
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,304
You know, I've got a file to read.

716
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:30,247
I have a sparring session
with Sergeant Siler.

717
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,884
I'm bidding for a time-share on eBay.

718
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,860
- Oh!
- Welcome back, Samantha.

719
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,555
- We really did miss you.
- Thank you.

720
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,263
It's good to be home.
