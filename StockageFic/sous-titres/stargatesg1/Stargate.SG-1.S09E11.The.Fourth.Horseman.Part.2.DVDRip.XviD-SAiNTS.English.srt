1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:06,330
<i>Like you...
my judgment was clouded by suspicion and distrust.</i>

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,526
But the Ori,
sensed my misgivings, forgave me my weaknesses

3
00:00:10,576 --> 00:00:13,012
and showed me their power.

4
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:15,981
I stand before you today as proof

5
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:17,525
of their divine might.

6
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:20,161
They have poisoned your mind.

7
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,231
The Ori's promises are hollow.

8
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:27,919
We have learned from the Ancients
that they are not ascending their followers.

9
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:29,946
Do you expect us to take your word for this?

10
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,624
One of the Ancients returned
to human form to warn us...

11
00:00:32,674 --> 00:00:36,803
that the Ori gain strength
by sapping the power from their followers.

12
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:39,898
That is why they seek out support.

13
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:42,133
The Ori are not some...

14
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:44,260
benevolent gods...

15
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:46,788
offering the path of enlightenment.

16
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,192
They are but manipulative beings
who will use you...

17
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:51,135
<i>and discard you...</i>

18
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,703
<i>- once you have served their purpose.
- Enough.</i>

19
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,756
They are no better than the Goa'uld!

20
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:57,216
Enough!

21
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,301
<i>The Goa'uld are imposters,</i>

22
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,619
but...

23
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,004
the Ori...

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,448
The Ori...

25
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:07,869
are the real Gods.

26
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:10,171
Behold the gift...

27
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:13,658
the Ori have bestowed upon me.

28
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,736
<i>We've had three fatalities this morning...</i>

29
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:38,626
We have another 12 base personnel
who are in critical condition and probably
won't make it past the next 24hrs.

30
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:40,219
That's it?

31
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:43,322
They've been given sedatives
and are resting comfortably.

32
00:01:43,522 --> 00:01:46,334
There's nothing you
or anyone can do for them right now.

33
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:49,303
- I can go see them.
- No you can't!

34
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:52,499
You're exhausted,
and you've already got a lot on your plate.

35
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,552
Those people are serving under my command.

36
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:56,636
Sir.

37
00:01:56,686 --> 00:01:58,163
What is it Walter?

38
00:01:58,213 --> 00:01:59,631
As of 08:00 this morning,

39
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:03,360
the CDC reports confirmed cases
of the virus in both Mexico

40
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,911
and Canada.

41
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:09,149
We could be looking at a global pandemic.

42
00:02:13,106 --> 00:02:17,610
Season 9 - Episode 11
The Fourth Horseman (Part 2)

43
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:20,726
Jolan! Hey! It's good to see a familiar face.

44
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:23,242
Lord Haikon wishes to see you.

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,358
Lets rock and roll.

46
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,221
It was foolish of you to come...

47
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,098
The others are distrustful of you.

48
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,335
Yeah... I kind of got that...

49
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:45,011
Is there anything else I need to know?

50
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:47,088
Haikon will have your answers.

51
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:57,153
Welcome Mitchell.

52
00:03:57,473 --> 00:03:58,752
Thank you Haikon.

53
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,028
Please... sit.

54
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,736
I apologize for making you wait...

55
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,693
but we just came back from a mission of

56
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,730
great importance.

57
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,484
We were informed of a world of non-believers,
who were conspiring against the Ori.

58
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:20,320
The Prior dispatched us to...

59
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,919
deal with them.

60
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:24,315
You mean kill them.

61
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:28,230
Well we were told they posed a considerable threat.

62
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:33,482
Leave not the smallest pebble to allow
any hindrance that will slow your people's progress...

63
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:37,137
- So said the Prior.
- Yeah the Priors say a lot of things.

64
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:38,455
Look...

65
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:42,848
I'm the last person to criticize someone
for what they believe but...

66
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:47,213
If your intention is to convince me
to withdraw support from the Ori

67
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:49,349
- you need not bother.
- You're making a big mist...

68
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:52,954
- I have already decided as much.
- What?

69
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,350
We went to the planet as the Prior instructed.

70
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,496
200 strong to eliminate any threat.

71
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:01,222
<i>We were expecting an army...</i>

72
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,777
What we found were simple farmers

73
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:09,350
too naïve to understand the consequences
they faced for daring to defy the Ori.

74
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:12,026
The Sodan are proud warriors...

75
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:15,302
- We do not kill innocent people.
- So you didn't follow through.

76
00:05:15,342 --> 00:05:17,019
We left them unharmed.

77
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,573
But before returning here we had to put all doubts
to rest, so we traveled to another world...

78
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,648
one rumored to have refused the Ori.

79
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,363
The entire civilization was decimated...

80
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,278
by a mysterious plague.

81
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:35,592
There was no one left.

82
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,228
Yeah... That's what they do...

83
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:43,361
In fact, they're doing it on Earth,
right now, as we speak.

84
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:48,075
And it will probably happen here when the Prior
gets back and finds out you didn't obey his orders.

85
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,073
How can we resist...

86
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:52,768
so powerful enemy.

87
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:54,885
Well, I can tell you...

88
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:57,921
but you're probably not gonna like it.

89
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,458
Orlin?

90
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,897
Sam.

91
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:18,691
Are you alright?

92
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:20,249
I'm fine.

93
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,726
It's you I'm worried about...

94
00:06:23,245 --> 00:06:25,482
We just got your test results back...

95
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:29,635
They show significant and progressive
changes in different areas of your brain.

96
00:06:29,676 --> 00:06:30,993
What kind of changes?

97
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:37,504
A degenerative process that has already
started to impair your cognitive functions.

98
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,732
I knew that when I took on human form...

99
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,134
the memories I brought
with me would eventually fade...

100
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:46,611
That's only part of it...

101
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:50,198
I mean...
it's not so much a result of you losing the memories.

102
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:53,641
But more a consequence of you
trying to hold on to them.

103
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:57,156
Orlin by not letting go of the Ancient knowledge...

104
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:58,834
You're damaging your brain.

105
00:06:58,874 --> 00:06:59,873
Yes.

106
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:02,429
My human mind is failing under the...

107
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,705
weight of so much information

108
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:07,141
You knew this would happen, didn't you?

109
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,996
As an Ancient how could you not have known?

110
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:13,114
Of course I knew Sam.

111
00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:14,951
But I had no choice.

112
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:17,307
But you have a choice now.

113
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:24,498
Your brain is fighting a losing battle.
Stripping away whatever it can in an attempt
to salvage the memories related to the cure.

114
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:27,972
Give them up and you could stop
this from progressing any further.

115
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:31,247
I can't do that there's too much at stake.

116
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:33,484
You have the memories.

117
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:34,922
Write them down.

118
00:07:35,002 --> 00:07:38,517
Give me the instructions.
I'll complete the vaccine.

119
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:41,753
It's too complex...
you won't fully understand the process...

120
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:42,791
Try me.

121
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:45,387
<i>Orlin you don't have to sacrifice yourself.</i>

122
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:47,824
Let go before it's too late.

123
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:51,698
I can't risk entrusting this job to anyone but myself.

124
00:07:52,377 --> 00:07:55,053
I have to see this through, Sam.

125
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:56,771
I'm sorry...

126
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:16,942
<i>- We're good.
- Okay.</i>

127
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:21,975
This device will emit a high ultra sonic frequency
targeting a specific portion of the Priors' brain
temporarily blocking his ability

128
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:23,722
to use his powers. Now,

129
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:25,889
the good news is it won't have any effect on us.

130
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:28,925
The bad news is
it may not have any effect on the Prior either.

131
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:31,162
In order for this thing to work the way we want it to,

132
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:35,915
it has to be broadcasting on the correct frequency
unfortunately we don't know

133
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:39,689
what that frequency is,
so we'll use a trial and error approach.

134
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,205
This remote allows us to adjust the signal.

135
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:45,371
And sooner or later we'll get the right one.

136
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:48,178
- Any questions thus far?
- How will we know it is working?

137
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:50,813
Oh we'll know
when the Prior's no longer able to use his powers.

138
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:54,009
And how will we know
he'll no longer be able to use his powers?

139
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:54,960
Well...

140
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:57,164
someone, is just gonna have to...

141
00:08:57,364 --> 00:08:58,682
test it and find out.

142
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,151
Don't worry fellows that someone is me.

143
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:06,911
<i>So...</i>

144
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:12,302
it's simple we disable the Prior, we take
a sample of his blood, we send it
back to the SGC, they finish the cure...

145
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:14,939
we turn the Prior against the Ori and...

146
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,457
call it a day.

147
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:18,514
- Jackson you're driving.
- Oh... Yeah.

148
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:21,670
SG-22, I want you in defensive positions
around the perimeter, there,

149
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:22,349
there,

150
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:22,987
there,

151
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,306
and there.

152
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:26,063
There's...

153
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:28,141
one other small problem.

154
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,054
We're not exactly sure what the range
of that device is, so Haikon...

155
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,721
I need you to get the Prior as close as possible.

156
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:37,277
Is that a problem?

157
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:38,406
No.

158
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:40,522
No it is not.

159
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,596
You are confident that this will work?

160
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:50,309
Well if it doesn't work.

161
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:52,026
We're out of options.

162
00:09:57,378 --> 00:09:59,176
I fear we have lost them.

163
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:01,172
This battle is far from over.

164
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:03,209
But clearly, the Council were swayed.

165
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,365
The task before us is daunting but not impossible.

166
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,001
The Jaffa nation has no appetite for war...

167
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:12,836
- particularly one that threatens to divide us.
- Indeed that much is certain.

168
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:15,472
The Ori on the other hand will not abide opposition,

169
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:18,437
they have already ordered Gerak
to quell the dissention within our ranks.

170
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:22,083
Then we must retreat into the shadows
and evade their attempts to find us.

171
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:23,340
No.

172
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,218
We must make a stand.

173
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:26,976
On Chulak.

174
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:32,967
Faced with the prospect of
in sighting a civil war that would kill millions
the Council will be left with an impossible choice,

175
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:37,091
but ultimately
they must decide between the Ori and their fellow Jaffa.

176
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:40,177
It is only by forcing their hand
that they will see reason...

177
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:41,495
So I believe.

178
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,850
An enterprise this bold
will require much support.

179
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:48,085
Then let us gather a fleet to defend Chulak.

180
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:06,459
<i>It's like catching a glimpse of someone
from the corner of your eye...</i>

181
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,374
then turning around, and they're gone.

182
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:15,686
You begin to doubt
whether you really saw them in the first place.

183
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:20,000
Tell me Sam.

184
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,074
How can you regret
losing a memory you can't even remember?

185
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:30,545
What are you working on?

186
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:33,300
The instruction for assembling the cure.

187
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:37,335
In the event that
I am too incapacitated to complete it myself.

188
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:39,452
It's a...

189
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:42,487
precaution we have to take.

190
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:48,759
The most frustrating part in all this is,
that I am unable to control what I can hold on to.

191
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:50,636
Even for a little while.

192
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:55,070
Crucial information, I need to finish the cure,
is slipping through my fingers...

193
00:11:55,109 --> 00:12:00,662
while insignificant minutia of my experiences
as an Ancient are still fresh and clear in my mind.

194
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,299
<i>In time I'll lose it all...</i>

195
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:03,737
<i>But for now,</i>

196
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:06,254
it just doesn't seem fair.

197
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,687
Is there anything I can do to help?

198
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:11,805
No.

199
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:14,362
At this point.

200
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,197
It's best if I work alone.

201
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:37,329
<i>Despite the best efforts of all those involved
the virus continues to spread at an alarming rate.</i>

202
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:42,514
<i>The CDC advises anyone who suspects they may have the
virus or may have come in contact with someone who did...</i>

203
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,525
Sir, just received word that China,
Great Britain and Russia have

204
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:49,821
grounded all air travel and
have closed off their ports to foreign ships.

205
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:52,667
This is out of control and
it's only gonna get worse.

206
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:57,540
And according to General Hammond's office
our allies have expressed concern about the cover story...

207
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,295
specifically how long we can continue to maintain it.

208
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,150
They've requested a meeting with you.

209
00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:09,902
So, it is your estimation that General,

210
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:14,056
that the decision to send SG-6 to that
particular planet was the right one.

211
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:18,470
As evidenced by this plague we have
no viable defense against the Ori.

212
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:21,106
The purpose of the mission to 6.5.6

213
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:24,142
was to gather intelligence that
might help us in that respect.

214
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:27,577
But admittedly the mission was
a failure in the worst possible way.

215
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:29,295
And as a result...

216
00:13:29,614 --> 00:13:32,090
millions,
perhaps billions will lose their lives.

217
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,724
The newly appointed liaison between
Stargate Command and the International Committee

218
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:39,320
was informed of and signed off on the mission.

219
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,697
Your representative agreed it was the right call.

220
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:43,154
There is some concern

221
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:47,389
that Mr. Woolsey may not have been fully
apprised of all the possible ramifications.

222
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:51,723
- Now, to his credit he still supports your decision.
- The Ori were going to strike at us sooner or later,

223
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:53,720
and rather than sit back and wait for it,

224
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:56,696
we were out there looking for a way
to stop them, to stop this from happening.

225
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,652
- And to start pointing fingers...
- General!
- at such a crucial...

226
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:00,231
General Landry!

227
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:04,025
The purpose of this meeting is not to assign blame,

228
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:08,379
but to arrive at a better understanding of
how this happened and conversely

229
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:10,735
to avoid something like this ever happening again.

230
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:13,052
That's provided we get a second chance!

231
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:17,166
Presently we have no way of stopping this virus.

232
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:18,723
<i>People are dying.</i>

233
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:22,558
And there's not a damn thing we can do about it.

234
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,788
What you propose is madness.

235
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:31,345
So it may seem.

236
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:36,418
But if the Council believes that we are mad and
cannot be dissuaded from sacrificing our lives,

237
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,656
then all the better.

238
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:40,333
We must stake everything
on the belief that in the end,

239
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:45,046
the Council will value the lives of their brothers
over the empty promises of the Ori.

240
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,717
Time is short brother.

241
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:53,874
We must gather our forces,

242
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,788
for the bigger our army the more lives
Gerak must choose to take.

243
00:14:57,988 --> 00:15:00,623
We must make this decision
as difficult as we can for him.

244
00:15:00,704 --> 00:15:03,340
Gerak is no longer one of us.
He is a Prior now.

245
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,057
Gerak may be a Prior,

246
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,014
but I have no doubt that part of him remains Jaffa.

247
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:11,089
And that is the part we must seek out.

248
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,845
I still believe this plan to be madness...

249
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:16,042
But then,

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,995
I once considered the very notion
of defeating the Goa'uld a mere fantasy.

251
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:24,550
Prove me wrong yet again Teal'c.

252
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:26,786
You have my support.

253
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:30,022
Thank you, Brother.

254
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:43,522
He's on his way.

255
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,361
<i>Jackson?</i>

256
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,158
Ready.

257
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,227
Alright, everybody sit tight...

258
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:57,303
Wait for my signal,
remember we need this guy alive.

259
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:13,000
You went to the planet as I asked to?

260
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,558
We did.

261
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:17,434
And yet the nonbelievers still live.

262
00:16:18,132 --> 00:16:19,371
They do.

263
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,607
Why have you disobeyed the will of the Ori?

264
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,642
Because...

265
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:28,139
We take orders from no-one.

266
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:29,636
The Ori offer you enlightenment...

267
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:31,055
immortality.

268
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,011
Even if that were true,

269
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:35,368
their price is too high.

270
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,604
What they ask of us goes against
the very spirit of the Sodan.

271
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:41,040
You doubt the power of the Ori?

272
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,556
It is not their power that we doubt.

273
00:16:43,677 --> 00:16:45,514
It is their worthiness as Gods.

274
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:53,543
That's not it.

275
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,191
That's not it either...

276
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:13,414
Andreas chose to hunt the
lion and was eaten by his prey.

277
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:14,772
Come on...

278
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,766
It was unwise of you to challenge me.

279
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:20,643
Yeah well, I wouldn't mind another crack at it.

280
00:17:24,397 --> 00:17:26,754
What did you hope to achieve by attacking me?

281
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:29,670
Did you honestly believe it was possible to capture me?

282
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:31,906
Well, that was the plan.

283
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:34,502
<i>And what purpose would that have served?</i>

284
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,774
<i>- George.
- Hank, how was the grilling?</i>

285
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:09,292
Medium rare.

286
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:12,089
I just got off the phone with the CDC.

287
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:16,482
A flight left Salt Lake City, three days
after the contagion was identified.

288
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:21,635
Made a stop over at O'Hara before continuing
on to its final destination, Charles de Gaulle airport.

289
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,691
You're telling me the virus
has already reached Paris?

290
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,784
Three of the people on that flight
have tested positive for the virus.

291
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:30,672
French authorities are doing all that they can

292
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:32,719
to track down the passengers, flight crew,

293
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,274
any ground crew or airport personnel that
may have come into contact with them.

294
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:40,228
And anyone who came into contact with them,
and anyone who came into contact with those people.

295
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:42,944
You know at the rate this thing is traveling,

296
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:45,900
in three days it will hit the Middle-East.
Six days it will be in China.

297
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,255
Stock market has already taken
a dive and people are panicking...

298
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,373
If this thing spreads far enough

299
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:55,007
and does enough damage, it could
start destabilizing governments.

300
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:59,401
We're going to have to be prepared
for any and all possibilities.

301
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:23,885
Yeah, we took the liberty of
borrowing a sample of your blood.

302
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:26,882
Hope you don't mind.

303
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:30,437
You looking for this?

304
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:34,671
No...

305
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,428
it's not gonna work.

306
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:40,382
That warm, fuzzy feeling you're experiencing
may be the effects of a device that's

307
00:19:40,622 --> 00:19:43,388
inhibiting your ability to concentrate
and focus your powers.

308
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:46,154
Symptoms may include dizziness, irritability...

309
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:46,953
Nausea...

310
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:50,687
mild nausea,
and a condition known as "hotdog fingers".

311
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:53,284
It makes no difference what you do to me,

312
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:55,121
but know this.

313
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:57,517
The Ori are all seeing,

314
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:00,114
<i>they are already aware of this,</i>

315
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:02,311
<i>a front to their eminence</i>

316
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:05,906
and shall strike down those
who dare to defy them.

317
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:07,703
Nothing yet, and you?

318
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:09,301
Drawing a blank...

319
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:11,098
little thirsty.

320
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:12,427
- That doesn't count.
- No it doesn't.

321
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:14,993
Their movements are not so easily defined,

322
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:17,789
their ways unseen and veiled in mystery.

323
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:18,268
Right...

324
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:20,665
right, they have a plan.

325
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:23,081
I don't suppose
you want to tell us what that is.

326
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,838
Why'd they send you
to this galaxy in the first place?

327
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:28,234
We are beacons on the road to enlightenment.

328
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:34,265
No you're dark side
intergalactic encyclopedia salesmen, unfortunately
the home office hasn't quite been up front with you.

329
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:36,363
- Nice work on the metaphor.
- Thank you.

330
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,877
For starters, did you know that the Ori

331
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:43,313
need people to worship them
because that's how they gain their power?

332
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:45,949
- He didn't know.
- No he didn't know that.

333
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:46,877
No it's true.

334
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:49,923
<i>We're not exactly sure how it works
but from what I've heard,</i>

335
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:53,568
they actually drain power from their followers.

336
00:20:53,578 --> 00:20:54,965
<i>That's why they need worshippers.</i>

337
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,493
You should talk to them about it, next time your home.

338
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,019
Might do a better job
of explaining the process to you.

339
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:02,984
Ours is not to question but to rejoice
in their service for they are perfection.

340
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:10,143
No... not really. Because a perfect being wouldn't
need to lie to ensure the loyalty of their followers.

341
00:21:10,153 --> 00:21:14,107
They wouldn't need to promise you ascension
if they had no intention of delivering it.

342
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:19,501
Those who follow the path of
righteousness shall be raised up high...

343
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,339
<i>No...</i>

344
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:21,897
they won't.

345
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:25,492
Because the Ori do not share power.

346
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:29,286
They're using you.

347
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:32,282
Pity not the blind man...

348
00:21:32,781 --> 00:21:36,975
<i>for he is hindered not by the visions
of this world but rather pity yourselves...</i>

349
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:41,768
for he shall see the light before you.

350
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,406
I'm gonna get something to eat.

351
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:01,940
Orlin!

352
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:04,736
Damn it!

353
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,033
Are you okay?

354
00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:09,629
- I'm fine...
- No no... he is not fine.
- Colonel.

355
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:14,422
He has not been fine in two days!
He has demonstrated lapses in judgment
that have put everyone in this room at risk.

356
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,620
Colonel, that is enough.

357
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:19,015
No...

358
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:20,613
he's right Sam...

359
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:22,011
I can't help you anymore...

360
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,208
I'm just in the way here.

361
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:46,975
Reflecting on your ill spent youth old man?

362
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:51,568
In truth I was thinking of you.

363
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:58,159
If this gamble succeeds, you will have
once again proven yourself a great leader.

364
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:03,351
Perhaps the only one capable of
uniting this fractured Jaffa nation.

365
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,546
My heart is indeed with our people...

366
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:11,540
but as long as the Ori threaten
this galaxy my place is with SG-1.

367
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,737
I understand.

368
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:18,930
Even so there is no doubt
we are the poorer for it.

369
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,127
I disagree...

370
00:23:21,726 --> 00:23:26,719
after our great victory this day,
Gerak's influence over our people shall wane,

371
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:30,513
<i>then our nation will rally
under the command of a great leader</i>

372
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:34,707
that is if he has
the courage to accept the challenge.

373
00:23:36,705 --> 00:23:38,502
- Me?
- Who better?

374
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:40,399
Tell me.

375
00:23:41,198 --> 00:23:43,485
No. There are many others.

376
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:45,491
There are many others who cover the position

377
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:49,685
but none who possess the strength
and wisdom only you can offer.

378
00:23:50,485 --> 00:23:54,878
It was not too long ago
we faced a similarly impossible task...

379
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:59,272
and yet, on that day, despite the odds

380
00:23:59,311 --> 00:24:02,667
we finally ended generations
of oppression and struggle

381
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:05,862
by securing victory over Ba'als fleet.

382
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:07,659
I remember

383
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,855
standing
on the peltak of that mother ship...

384
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:13,251
just as I am doing now

385
00:24:13,531 --> 00:24:16,048
waiting for the battle to begin...

386
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:18,044
yet knowing

387
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,841
no matter what the outcome...

388
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,434
it would be the last time I would have
to take the life of a fellow Jaffa.

389
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:32,424
No Jaffa blood will be spilled on this day...

390
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:36,219
on that you have my word.

391
00:24:48,002 --> 00:24:53,514
Sir. We have confirmed cases in Bonn,
Amsterdam, Rome and Madrid. We have
suspected cases in London and Athens.

392
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:55,152
The WHO has teams on route,

393
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,527
meanwhile there are suspected cases
on the African continent

394
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:01,683
some of the military leaders in the region
have already declared martial law.

395
00:25:01,722 --> 00:25:03,479
Thank you Chief.

396
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,876
- Colonel, how are things progressing?
- They're not Sir...

397
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:12,068
as you know the contagions rapidly
mutating nature necessitated our requiring
a specimen of DNA from the original virus.

398
00:25:12,107 --> 00:25:15,063
We finally managed to get a blood sample
from the Prior who started the plague

399
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:17,749
but so far it hasn't helped.
It looks like we've hit a dead end.

400
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,356
Well let's hope "looks like" is
the operative sentence here.

401
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:21,354
Yes Sir.

402
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,039
Orlin.

403
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:33,836
Sorry to disturb you.

404
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:35,833
Not at all General.

405
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,031
Please.

406
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:39,828
I'd like to thank you for everything you've done.

407
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:41,106
I wish it could have been...

408
00:25:41,585 --> 00:25:42,264
more.

409
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:44,062
Hey, you got as along as far as you could,

410
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:46,218
the rest is gonna have to be up to us.

411
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:47,896
Orlin...

412
00:25:48,216 --> 00:25:51,931
I realize, I have no right to ask this of you,

413
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,525
but there is something else
you might be able to do for us.

414
00:26:03,714 --> 00:26:06,510
Numerous vessels dropping out of hyperspace.

415
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,001
You're out numbered,

416
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:28,818
retreat is no longer an option.

417
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:31,254
<i>I do not want to slaughter you,</i>

418
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:34,130
but I will if you give me no choice...

419
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,087
so what say you Teal'c?

420
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:50,605
I still have hope this situation
can be peacefully resolved Gerak.

421
00:26:50,646 --> 00:26:53,921
Let us meet on the planet surface and discuss.

422
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:55,398
Very well.

423
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:05,505
It's a Norwegian cheese I think...

424
00:27:05,544 --> 00:27:07,581
spelt with a G or a J...

425
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:08,699
maybe both...

426
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,496
Jiggha... Gojuha... something like that...

427
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:13,293
so what you do is you...

428
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:16,368
dice up the
cheese you toss it in with the egg whites...

429
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:20,523
and you chop up some avocado...
throw it all together whoa daddy,

430
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:23,159
you got yourself a wicked omelet.

431
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:25,077
General...

432
00:27:26,074 --> 00:27:27,752
we were just exchanging recipes.

433
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,390
I heard.

434
00:27:31,347 --> 00:27:32,905
Has he offered up anything?

435
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:35,381
No Sir... the man doesn't
even have a decent pie crust.

436
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:39,136
The Ori are not going to ascend you.
They lie to you...

437
00:27:39,176 --> 00:27:41,333
<i>and anyone else they could take advantage of.</i>

438
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:44,808
Let not the words of deceivers lead you to doubt.

439
00:27:44,848 --> 00:27:47,285
Nor the enticements they offer cause you to stray.

440
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:48,782
Exactly.

441
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:51,619
And the sad fact is you gave it all up for nothing.

442
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:54,534
The life you had is gone.
The Ori took it away from you...

443
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:56,412
Blessed are the true believers,

444
00:27:56,451 --> 00:27:58,808
<i>for only they shall walk the path</i>

445
00:27:59,047 --> 00:28:02,403
and they shall be welcomed onto the
realm of Ori and made as one with them.

446
00:28:02,443 --> 00:28:04,320
What did you leave behind...

447
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,599
a wife?

448
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:07,835
<i>Children?</i>

449
00:28:10,512 --> 00:28:12,109
I have a grown daughter,

450
00:28:13,706 --> 00:28:18,021
I wasn't around much when she was growing up
and it's something I'll always regret.

451
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,657
You ever think about your kids?

452
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:24,012
<i>The time you spent with them...</i>

453
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:25,889
<i>the things you used to do together</i>

454
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:27,686
before you threw it all away?

455
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:34,676
But how...how would I know whether
the Ori are... ascending people or not...

456
00:28:34,717 --> 00:28:37,752
Truth is I don't know for sure...

457
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:40,708
but he does.

458
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,824
Hello Demeras.

459
00:28:44,862 --> 00:28:46,220
Who are you?

460
00:28:47,618 --> 00:28:49,096
- How did you...
- Know?

461
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:54,288
You're entire life was an open book to me
the moment you set foot in this galaxy.

462
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:57,484
<i>I was once ascended...</i>

463
00:28:57,523 --> 00:29:02,717
<i>but I took this form because it was the only
way to warn the humans about the Ori.</i>

464
00:29:03,196 --> 00:29:09,746
Since I made that decision I've paid a heavy price
in terms of the effects it's had on my mind.

465
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:11,624
The memories I've... lost.

466
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:12,742
Life and death.

467
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:14,100
Light and darkness.

468
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,459
Hope and despair.

469
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:17,255
The rift was created...

470
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:19,373
and on that day the Ori were born.

471
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:22,488
But every so often...
something will stir in me...

472
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:26,922
and if I push myself hard enough
I'll remember one more time...

473
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:29,119
before it leaves me forever,

474
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,396
your name Demeras,

475
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:33,991
<i>your wife Adina, your sons... Jaden and Alon...</i>

476
00:29:34,032 --> 00:29:36,828
but the hatred of those
who stray from the true path

477
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:40,262
festered and bloomed in the dark corners
of the avarices to which they were cast...

478
00:29:40,402 --> 00:29:45,086
and the fact that the Ori
have never ascended any of their...followers,

479
00:29:45,096 --> 00:29:48,531
and consumed by this hatred
they poisoned all they touched,

480
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,888
bringing death, darkness and despair...

481
00:29:51,128 --> 00:29:53,414
You know that as an Ancient
I wouldn't lie to you.

482
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,661
and the souls of their victims knew no peace

483
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,177
until the Ori came and whispered to them

484
00:29:58,217 --> 00:30:01,932
"Sleep for the end draws near"

485
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,488
<i>He's overcome the device.</i>

486
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:06,206
And on that day

487
00:30:06,565 --> 00:30:09,561
all will rejoice
when the Ori come and lay them lo...

488
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:11,917
General.

489
00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:17,230
I'm fine...
What was he saying?

490
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:21,623
He just told you
why the Ori are on their way to this Galaxy.

491
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:26,256
They're coming to destroy the Ancients.

492
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,957
You have made the right choice.

493
00:30:39,997 --> 00:30:43,872
There is no honor in fighting an unwinable battle.

494
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:47,627
More peace at the hands of a tyrant.

495
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:49,264
I assure you...

496
00:30:49,864 --> 00:30:53,459
the Ori are not the Goa'uld.

497
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:57,522
Have we truly lived as slaves
for so long that we must fear being free.

498
00:30:57,532 --> 00:30:59,210
It has nothing to do with freedom.

499
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:02,485
Enlightenment is just within our reach.

500
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:04,842
Or so the Ori would have us believe.

501
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:29,226
Why have you led me here?

502
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:31,104
I thought it fitting

503
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:35,219
that on this day when we must
sacrifice our short lived freedom

504
00:31:35,258 --> 00:31:37,096
that we do so here...

505
00:31:37,136 --> 00:31:39,532
<i>at the site of the Battle of Salsacksor...</i>

506
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:42,728
where you're father gave
his life for this very cause.

507
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:49,718
He began to doubt the Goa'uld long before
this rebellion took shape Gerak.

508
00:31:49,797 --> 00:31:54,710
It was your father's death at their hands
that led you to question what god...

509
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,667
<i>is so deserving of my worship.</i>

510
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,144
You were not one who was chosen.

511
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:02,818
You did not witness the wonders I beheld.

512
00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:06,454
Did that erase the dead...

513
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:08,530
heal the sick and wounded,

514
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,764
destroy their enemy
with but a wave of their hand?

515
00:32:13,603 --> 00:32:15,880
The Goa'uld deceived us...

516
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,636
the Ori's powers are pure.

517
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:23,789
Then what is the measure of a god Gerak...

518
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:27,903
is it the scope of their power or
how they choose to wield that power?

519
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:31,777
Would a god who is prepared to
lead us on the path of enlightenment

520
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:37,289
so contradict this divine benevolence by
destroying all those who refuse to believe in him?

521
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:40,444
Those who refuse to believe...

522
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:42,362
must die.

523
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:50,989
I understand...
how difficult this must be for you Gerak

524
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:52,867
nearing your final years...

525
00:32:52,906 --> 00:32:56,862
you so desperately long for
the enlightenment that we all seek.

526
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:59,777
This is not the way to save yourself.

527
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:02,892
I only wanted to avoid

528
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:04,550
bloodshed.

529
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,028
Stay this course

530
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:10,142
and you will have not choice but
to spill the blood of your brothers...

531
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,975
and you may start with me,

532
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:20,488
for if I have a choice between resistance
and return to the life of slavery,

533
00:33:20,527 --> 00:33:23,723
then I choose to die free.

534
00:33:34,587 --> 00:33:37,423
I'm telling you... I'm fine.

535
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,100
Carolyn can you tell these people I'm fine.

536
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:41,936
You're not fine.

537
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:44,253
Your blood work came back positive.

538
00:33:44,393 --> 00:33:46,990
You have the virus.

539
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:56,252
It's always darkest before the dawn.

540
00:33:56,292 --> 00:33:59,128
My uncle used to say that all the time,
he was a wedding planner.

541
00:33:59,268 --> 00:34:00,507
General Hammond.

542
00:34:00,586 --> 00:34:01,625
At ease.

543
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:03,273
Sir when did you arrive?

544
00:34:03,283 --> 00:34:04,840
Oh I've been here a while Colonel.

545
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:08,476
But you were busy and I thought
it was best not to disturb you.

546
00:34:09,095 --> 00:34:12,339
Colonel Mitchell. Congratulations
on getting the band back together.

547
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:14,187
Thank you Sir. It wasn't easy.

548
00:34:14,906 --> 00:34:16,145
Ah, but worth it.

549
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,300
You couldn't ask for
three better people watching your back.

550
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:22,855
I'm sorry I won't get a chance
to see Teal'c before I go.

551
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,893
You're leaving Sir?

552
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:26,489
Oh, I'm off to Peterson.
I've been called back to Washington.

553
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,246
Well, it's good to see you again Sir.

554
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:32,441
It's good to see you too. All of you.

555
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,676
Give my best to Teal'c.

556
00:34:36,235 --> 00:34:37,953
Take care of each other.

557
00:34:38,173 --> 00:34:39,811
Take care of General Landry too.

558
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:52,393
<i>You're awake.</i>

559
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,269
How are you feeling?

560
00:34:57,665 --> 00:35:00,621
After that little nap,
better than I've felt all day.

561
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:02,737
How's that for irony?

562
00:35:03,576 --> 00:35:05,973
<i>How are Mitchell and Dr Jackson?</i>

563
00:35:06,632 --> 00:35:07,390
They're clean.

564
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,829
And Orlin?

565
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:12,264
I just run a battery of tests on him...

566
00:35:12,704 --> 00:35:16,218
I'm afraid the effort of drawing out
all those memories has taken a toll,

567
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:19,753
accelerated the degenerative process.
So he's in his quarters resting.

568
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:22,869
You look tired Carolyn.
You should get some sleep.

569
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:24,626
I can't. Not yet.

570
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,344
I can make that an order.

571
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:29,439
The last time you ordered me to bed,
I think I was six.

572
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,716
You were just as stubborn back then.

573
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:32,954
I spoke to mum recently.

574
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:36,029
How is she?

575
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,829
<i>Worried.</i>

576
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,783
All those years I was growing up
I resented the fact that you never told us

577
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:42,860
anything, about your work,

578
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,174
<i>about why you had to leave us for
days, sometimes weeks at a time.</i>

579
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:49,450
<i>But</i>

580
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,250
<i>now...</i>

581
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:57,199
I'm beginning to understand how
hard it must have been for you.

582
00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:04,909
<i>Talking to mum the other
day I wanted to reassure her.</i>

583
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,545
<i>To tell her everything. But I couldn't.</i>

584
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:09,542
It was hard.

585
00:36:12,418 --> 00:36:14,974
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

586
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:25,399
It's Teal'c.

587
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:34,547
Lower your weapons.

588
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:44,172
This is colonel Carter. Stand down.

589
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,140
What's going on?

590
00:37:07,419 --> 00:37:09,376
Gerak has arrived to assist us.

591
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:18,843
Why do you hesitate Gerak?

592
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,639
If I help you...

593
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:23,076
I will die.

594
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:26,991
But I will die free!

595
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:41,130
Gerak!

596
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:52,475
What the hell just happened?

597
00:37:52,794 --> 00:37:56,628
I thought the Ori weren't allowed to take action
in this galaxy without in sighting the Ancients.

598
00:37:56,668 --> 00:37:57,507
They can't.

599
00:37:58,107 --> 00:38:01,541
It must have been some sort physiological failsafe
they put in place when they made him a Prior,

600
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:03,459
in the event he ever turned.

601
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:06,135
They're normalizing, it worked.

602
00:38:17,858 --> 00:38:23,010
<i>The final death toll of the pandemic has
been estimated at a little over 3000 world wide,</i>

603
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:26,825
<i>but health officials are quick to point
out that it could have been much worse.</i>

604
00:38:26,865 --> 00:38:29,622
<i>As distribution of the vaccine continues</i>

605
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:33,026
<i>many have begun to ask how this
could have happened in the first place,</i>

606
00:38:33,036 --> 00:38:36,311
and more to the point
where did this virus originate.

607
00:38:36,591 --> 00:38:37,390
We were lucky.

608
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:41,345
There might not be someone like
Gerak to help us next time.

609
00:38:41,984 --> 00:38:42,862
It wasn't just Gerak...

610
00:38:42,902 --> 00:38:44,300
He cured the people in the Base.

611
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:48,834
From then we were able to isolate
an antibody and manufacture a vaccine

612
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:51,550
using Orlin's formula.
Thanks to Orlin's work,

613
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,626
we should be able to prevent the Priors
from attacking us in this way again.

614
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,993
Oh, I reckon they've got a pretty wide repertoire.

615
00:38:57,003 --> 00:39:00,558
The Ori will undoubtedly view this defeat
as nothing more than a minor set back.

616
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:04,472
It will not be enough to dissuade them from
continuing their incursion into this galaxy.

617
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:06,749
Certainly not if their end game
is to destroy the Ancients.

618
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:11,701
Given the fact that they are personally
threatened do you think the Ancients
will take measure to defends themselves?

619
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:16,214
If it comes to that it's possible but
I think we're a long way from the Ori
posing the Ancients a serious threat.

620
00:39:16,255 --> 00:39:18,891
No they're just a threat
to everyone else in the galaxy.

621
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:21,687
So how's Orlin?

622
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:27,039
His condition has stabilized
but I'm afraid the damage has already been done.

623
00:39:43,856 --> 00:39:44,814
Hello.

624
00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:45,652
Hi.

625
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:47,450
Who are you?

626
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,926
My name is Samantha.

627
00:39:52,443 --> 00:39:53,641
Do you need help with this?

628
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:55,639
Sure.

629
00:39:59,153 --> 00:40:02,740
I finished the outside so you
can help me with the inside.

630
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,769
Okay.
