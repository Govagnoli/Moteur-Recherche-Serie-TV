"The Sangraal shall instead belong to he
who speaks the Guardian's name."

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:12,704
They say that the Sangraal is protected
by the most powerful of magical beasts.

4
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,178
Amongst the information I obtained
regarding the Sangraal

5
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:16,475
is the name of the protector.

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,050
- Protector?
- The dragon.

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,279
OSRIC: The Sangraal is hidden in a cave
beneath a lone mountain.

8
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,481
It's too bad you won't be coming with us.

9
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,686
There it is. We've found it.

10
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,858
Well, I guess I'm not as true of spirit
as you thought I was.

11
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,595
Hey!

12
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,830
We agreed there's no such thing
as a dragon, right?

13
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:39,996
Yeah.

14
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,102
VALA: Because that looks
pretty real to me.

15
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:56,713
What just happened?

16
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,053
I extended my protective shield.

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,093
You're lucky I still need you.

18
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,987
Whoa, heads up!

19
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,835
Move out!

00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,117
Well, he's too big to fit
through the opening,

23
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,054
so I think we're safe.

00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,845
There appears to be an exit this way.

28
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,855
Okay, what the hell
just happened back there?

29
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,691
It was a hologram.
The Sangraal wasn't real.

30
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,731
What are you saying?
We came all this way for nothing?

31
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,062
- We have to go back inside.
- BA'AL: You must be joking.

32
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,658
The dragon is the final test.

33
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,636
It would be madness
to challenge that thing.

34
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,451
I don't think we're going to have a choice.

Tree line!

37
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,079
So now what?

38
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,842
It can't see us
as long as we stay in the trees.

39
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,715
We should be able
to make it back to the village.

40
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,550
We're not going anywhere.

41
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:20,490
Adria's right. The dragon's the final test,
and we've come too far to give up now.

42
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:24,324
It's just that kind of noble sentiment
that's going to get us all killed.

43
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,423
Aren't you the one that claimed
to know the dragon's secret name?

44
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,058
Time to earn your keep.

45
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,696
Yes, I may have exaggerated
about that slightly.

46
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,899
Anyway, you didn't think
that just by calling out its name

47
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,909
you'd suddenly be able to control it?

48
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,309
I don't know. Name magic is common
in most mythologies.

49
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,246
To know something's secret name
is to steal its power.

50
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,510
So, what are we supposed to do?
Just start guessing?

51
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,609
Darrell, the dragon.

52
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,812
MITCHELL: How about Smokey?

53
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,047
Perhaps Puff.

54
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,748

While we're waiting, options?

57
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,893
Well, we know the P90 fire
just bounced off its armor.

58
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,628
Which means it's not a hologram.

59
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,761
If it was a hologram, the bullets
would've gone straight through.

60
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,567
So it's not that your weapons
aren't ineffective,

61
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,301
it's that they're ineffective
in a different way.

62
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,344
What I am saying is that if bullets bounce,

63
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,913
maybe we should try something
that packs a little more punch.

64
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,318
All right, here is what we're going to do.

65
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:29,354
We're going to lure Darrell
down to the ground.

66
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,830
I'm going to take this thing,

67
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:37,528
and we're going to toss it underneath and
detonate it near the exposed underbelly.

68
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,197
That's where dragons are most vulnerable.

69
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,101
Carter, you detonate from the tree line,

70
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,578
and I will do the running.

71
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,285
That's all right, Teal'c. I got this one.

72
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,689
All right.

73
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,191

Hey, Daniel,
now would be a really good time.

78
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,076
Okay, the <i>Parchment of Virtues</i> said

79
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,120
the Sangraal would belong
to he who speaks the guardian's name.

80
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,280
- The guardian's name...
- The guardian is a dragon.

81
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,357
No, the guardian's not the dragon.

82
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,891
The guardian is the person
who set this whole thing up.

83
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,359
- The guardian is Morgan Le Fay.
- Right!

84
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,927

00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,050
Wow.

92
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,387
It's Morgan's name in Ancient.

93
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,296
Yeah, I know.

94
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,936
Thanks for the assist.

95
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,840
Well, to be honest,
I wouldn't have been of much use to you.

96
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,808
My strengths
lie in strategy and command,

97
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,937
whereas yours lie
in armed combat and dealing with...

98
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,310
Dragons?

99
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,377
Clearly.

100
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,390
It's real this time, right?

101
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,291

Okay, what just happened?

104

into another chamber.

105
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,040
Where's Adria?

106
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,478
I guess she didn't make it.

107
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,023
It must be some sort of security measure.

108
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,684
I don't know.

109
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,918
It let him in.

110
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,364
Well, I don't think Morgan
was too concerned about the Goa'uld.

111
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,061
It was the Ori she was worried about.

112
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,429
MITCHELL: You know,
I'm not seeing anything

113
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,304
around here that looks like a Sangraal,

114
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,377
which begets the question,
what was she protecting?

115
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,004
I think I know.

116
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,497
"Here lies Myrrdin,
Archmage of the Round."

117
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,137
All right, that's not a hologram.

118
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,072
- He's the real McCoy, right?
- I think so.

119

120
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,678
Well over a thousand years.

TEAL'C: We have encountered Ancient
stasis technology such as this before.

122
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,149
General O'Neill was kept in a similar pod
in Antarctica.

123
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:57,086
So, how do we get him out?

124
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,366
I have no idea.

133
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,690

(GROANING)

135
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,974
No, he did not just...

136
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,650
No, he's still alive.

137
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,186
It may take him a while
to revive completely.

138
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:59,155
All right. In the meantime,
we should see if there's a way out of here.

139
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,784
Let us know what you find.

140
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,095
Or I could come, too.

141
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,043
Hey, daylight over here.

142
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:34,459
You know, I can't quite put my finger on it,
but something is different.

143
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,255
We weren't just transported
to another chamber.

144
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,922
We were transported to another planet.

145
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,094
The gate must have been
activated remotely,

146
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,601
then the obelisk beamed us
through the wormhole.

147
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,231
Well, as far as I'm concerned, the more
distance between us and Adria, the better.

148
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,433
Except that she has the knowledge
of the Ori.

149
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,876
She knows as much about the gates and
the DHDs as the people who built them.

150
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,107
- Lf anyone can track us, it's her.
- Yeah, except that.

151
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,590
It's amazing how similar this is
to the myth.

152
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,759
Supposedly, Morgan trapped Merlin
in a cave

153
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,762
and left him frozen there for all eternity.

154
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,856
Only in reality,
I think she was trying to protect him.

155
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,491
How do you mean?

156
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:24,806
Well, I'm starting to think that maybe
Morgan did destroy the Sangraal after all.

157
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,275
I mean, she probably figured
she had no choice.

158
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:30,439
That if she didn't do it, the other Ancients
would have just sent someone else.

159
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,881
So instead, she did the next best thing.

160
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,648
MITCHELL: She preserved the one man
capable of building it again.

161
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,984
Well, it's official.

162
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,082
We are stuck here, wherever "here" is.

163
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,991
The good news is we found a gate.
Teal'c's watching it.

164
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,825
- The bad news is...
- We can't dial out.

165
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,694
Somebody tampered with the DHD.

166
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,199
BA'AL: I can fix it.

167
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,769
Reprogramming dialing devices
is my specialty.

168
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,473
Whoops. Guess who's coming around.

169
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,570
Where am I?

170
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,171
Good question.

173
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,089
Oh, my dear, it's been too long.

174
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,288
It's good to see you, too.

00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:22,265
Percivale and Galahad.

176
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:27,499
Oh, brave knights, fortune indeed does
smile upon me to see your faces again.

177
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,541
It looks like Merlin's drawbridge no longer
goes all the way across the moat,

178
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,042
if you catch my meaning.

179
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:37,047
What's that? Mordred.
I might have known it.

180
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,118
BA'AL: We're wasting our time
with this old fool.

181
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,153
We need to get back to the gate,
so I can start reprogramming...

182
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,687
Be silent.

183
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,155
Well, how do you like that?

184
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,628
The old boy still has some tricks
up his sleeve.

185
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,325
Merlin. Myrrdin!

186
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:00,228
We need you to remember
about the Sangraal,

187
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,240
about Morgan,
and about how you got here.

188
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,868
- Morgan...
- You also knew her as Ganos Lal.

189
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,741
I haven't heard that name spoken
in a very long time.

190
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,818
We're not Knights of the Round Table.

191
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,113
MITCHELL: Though we are flattered
by the comparison.

192
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,781
A thousand years have passed.
We know who you really are.

193
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,291
We know about Atlantis
and we've encountered the Ori.

194
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,883
Tell me more.

195
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,923
I don't know where to begin.

196
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,262
This is going to take a while.

197
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,735
All right, we'll get started
checking out the cave.

198
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,703
Unless you have any objections.

199
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,609
No? Great. Move out.

200
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,444
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

201
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,619
Make way for the Orici!

202
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,184
What happened?

203
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:01,767
The gate activated on its own
and only seconds later, it closed again.

204
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:01,994
The gate activated on its own
and only seconds later, it closed again.

205
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,092
I don't suppose anyone saw the address.

206
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,501
No, Orici.

207
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,199
I'll need to examine the dialing device.

208
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,798
Ready your men.

209
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,741
As soon as I determine where they went,
we're leaving.

210
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,278
Yes, Orici.

211
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,746
And what of the village?

212
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,477
Have they agreed to accept
the teachings of Origin?

213
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,574
No.

214
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:21,914
Then burn it.

215
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:30,184
And it was Morgan
who finally led us to you.

216
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,764
Of course, she couldn't come right out
and tell us.

217
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:36,164
She had to be annoyingly cryptic
about the whole thing.

218
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:40,102
You have an unusual understanding
of the way of Ascended beings.

219
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,469
Yes, that's partly
because I used to be one myself.

220
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,644
The human race could not have progressed
that far in only a thousand years.

221
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:51,682
No, I had a little help.
Her name was Oma Desala.

222
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,274
Oh, of course.

223
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,347
And what happened?

224
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,221
Well, I guess I didn't exactly
see eye to eye with the others.

225
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:04,194
Oh, yes.
I found myself in a similar position.

226
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,754
Yeah, I wasn't too good
at the whole non-interference thing.

227
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:11,131
I guess there were a few arguments.
At least, that's the impression I got.

228
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,601
- You don't remember?
- No.

229
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:17,540
In order to protect me, Oma erased it
all from my mind and sent me back.

230
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,476
Oh, I'm surprised
she still hasn't learned her lesson.

231
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,878
She's not the only one
who broke some of the rules.

232
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,477
The Ori gain their power
from the lower planes,

233
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,114
so much so that one day they shall be
strong enough to wipe the others out.

234
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,590
In the face of such a threat, a strict policy
of non-interference is absurd.

235
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,460
I'm sure Oma would agree with you.

236
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:44,093
Oma concerns herself with the individual.

237
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:48,469
She may have the best intentions, but
then, so did the Ori when they first began.

238
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,171
Still,

239
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:58,578
she must have seen something in you
to believe you to be worthy.

240
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:10,186
This cave is a bust.
There's nothing else here.

241
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,729
- How's it going?
- I'm not exactly sure.

242
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,975
Before I agree to join with you,

243
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:29,412
I need to know that you are willing to do
whatever must be done to see it through.

244
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:34,077
Surely, you have some idea of
what we've been through to get here.

245
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:39,385
What you experienced so far is
as nothing compared to what is to come.

246
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,264
Don't worry about us. We're on board.

247
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,198
In that case,
there is much work to be done.

248
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,620
(SIGHING)

249
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:24,462
He's been at it for hours, Daniel.
Want to take a guess at what he's doing?

250
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,131
Well, from the looks of it, I'd say
he's virtually piecing something together

251
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,003
from base molecules.

252
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,369
Another Sangraal?

253
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,908
(EX CLAIMING)

254
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,085
Thank you. I'm fine. Just need a little rest.

255
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,355
What was that?

256
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,930
<i>TEAL 'C ON RADIO:</i>
<i>Colonels Mitchell and Carter.</i>

257
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,226
<i>Come quickly. You will want to see this.</i>

258
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,404
Let's go.

259
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,171
The gate activated on its own.

260
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:13,581
The crystal in the obelisk began to glow,
and then everything changed.

261
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,947
I'll say.

262
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,719
MITCHELL: We've been
transported to another planet.

263
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,190
Well, if Daniel's right,
and Morgan wanted to keep Merlin hidden,

264
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,523
this would be a great way to do it.

265
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,097
My guess is we're traveling through
a circuit of planets

266
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,460
cut off from the rest of the gate system

267
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,830
by a deliberate alteration
of the DHD program.

268
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:33,098
Then you believe we'll be unable
to dial out from this gate as well.

269
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,732
Well, we can give it a shot,
but, yeah, I doubt it'll work

270
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,470
until we find the automatic dialing
program in the DHD processor

271
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,567
and shut it down.

272
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,476
You can do that, right?

273
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,383
I hope so.

274
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,860
I have lived many lifetimes.

275
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,256
First in Atlantis.

276
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:09,865
Then on Earth before the dawn
of your civilization.

277
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:14,637
Then I joined the ranks of the Ascended,

278
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:22,685
and finally, I returned to mortal form
to live out my remaining days

279
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,547
among the noblemen of Arthur's court,

280
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,120
or so I thought.

281
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,824
And through all these eons,

282
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:37,698
only one thing stayed the same.

283
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,364
There is never enough time.

284
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,408
Well, we're safe for the moment.

285
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:49,969
You can take all the time you need.

286
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,777
I slept too long.

287
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,911
My body betrays me.

288
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,014
We're not about to let you give up now.

289
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,116
You realize what's at stake.

290
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,162
If you don't help us,
the Ori will take this galaxy.

291
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,726
(SIGHING)

292
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:14,237
One last task, then, before I rest.

293
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,663
Good luck, Dr. Jackson.

294
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,929
(ENERGY SURGING)

295
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,974
(EX CLAIMING)

296
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,023
What just happened?

297
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,464
He's dead.

298
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,774
He said, "Good luck"?

299
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,538
It's very strange.

300
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:32,139
It's almost as if he knew
it was going to happen.

301
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:37,413
Which leaves us with no Sangraal, and
for the moment, no way off this planet.

302
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,286
I told you I can fix the dialing device.

303
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:46,222
Merlin's little trick with my vocal chords
expired at the same moment he did.

304
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,629
Yet another reason to mourn his passing.

305
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:53,228
Joke all you want, Teal'c, but I am
the only one who can get us out of here.

306
00:22:55,874 --> 00:23:01,210
He is good with dialing programs.
Maybe if we work together.

307
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,448
I'm having trouble finding
the relocation program.

308
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,019
It must be buried in one of
the correlative subroutines.

309
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,589
We'll never find it
using those search protocols.

310
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,181
I'm going to have to
make some adjustments to your program.

311
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,260
How much longer is this going to take?

312
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,953
It's impossible to say.

313
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,690
All I know for sure is
it would have been a lot easier

314
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,198
on that nice, warm desert planet.

315
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,574
He said he had one more thing to do
before he could rest.

316
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,206
I thought he meant
build us another weapon.

317
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:40,114
No, you were right before.
He knew he didn't have enough time.

318
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:45,254
Now, this is obviously
some sort of virtual interface,

319
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,986
like a computer-assisted design program,
only in the past,

320
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,086
we've seen it used to download
information into someone's mind.

321
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,892
What sort of information?

322
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,591
All the knowledge of the Ancients.

323
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,667
That's a lot.

324
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,499
Yes, as a matter of fact, it's too much
for a human brain to handle. It's fatal.

325
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,971
But what if you could control it?

326
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,876
Use it to store and load
something more specific?

327
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,070
Like?

328
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,370
I'm not sure.

329
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:14,485

to finish on his own, Sam.

Jackson!

336
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,678
What did he do?

337
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,090
The planet is lifeless.

338
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,619
There is no one here.

339
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,995
They were here. I'm certain of it.

340
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,292
What would you have us do?

341
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,800
Lead the men in Prostration. I will inform
you when I have the next address.

342
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,841
Yes, Orici.

343
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,125
Try it now.

344
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,063
I'm still not reading any anomalies.

345
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,829
This is ridiculous.
I can't be expected to work like this.

346
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:42,373
I can barely see, my fingers are numb.

347
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:47,411
I say we go back inside, we warm up,
we take our chances on the next planet.

348
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:48,809
How do you know it will not be worse?

349
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,052
We're about to find out.

350
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,293
(EX CLAIMING) Merlin's gone.

351
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,033
Well, that's just weird.

352
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,230
Sam, what just happened?

353
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,372
The obelisk transported us
to another planet.

354
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,273
I think it's scheduled to go off
every couple of hours.

355
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,811
<i>How are things out there?</i>

356
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:26,179
Well, it's a little spooky,
but at least it's warm. How's Daniel?

357
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:33,518
He's sitting up.
I'll get back to you on the rest.

358
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,524
Hey.

359
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,759
How you doing, sunshine?

360
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,974
He was right.

361
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,307
You do look like Percivale.

362
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:58,783
Excuse me?

363
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,650
We spent a lot of time in this room.

364
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,249
Who did?

365
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,555
We did.

366
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,687
He did. Merlin.

367
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,291
Sorry, it's a little confusing having
two sets of memories in your head.

368
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,937
And he wasn't kidding
about living many lifetimes.

369
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,410
- You have Merlin's memories?
- Some of them.

370
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:40,480
Earth, Atlantis, and the different medieval
societies he set up throughout the galaxy.

371
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,591
And the work he did in this lab.

372
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,688
Hey, whoa, hey, hang on a second.

373
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,868
Are you telling me
you can build the Sangraal?

374
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,962
He knew he didn't have the strength
to finish it.

375
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:59,032
His body had deteriorated too much
during the stasis.

376
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,140
So he gave me the knowledge.

377
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:08,844
Wait!

378
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,486
I can see it now.

379
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,023
I can do this.

380
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:28,098
Twice, a device like that
almost killed General O'Neill.

381
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:32,575
Both times,
it took the Asgard to save him.

382
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,578
Daniel thought that
this device might be different,

383
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,205
that somehow
the information could be limited.

384
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,379
I hope he's right.

385
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:59,297
We found the body of an old man, dead.
Apart from that, there's nothing here.

386
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,296
(SIGHING)

387
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,399
This is beginning to try my patience.

388
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,105
Is there no other way we can track them?

389
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,681
No.

390
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:15,515
But each time I'm able to determine their
destination more quickly than the last.

391
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,589
Sooner or later, we will catch up to them.

392
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,171
Maybe we're barking up
the wrong tree here.

393
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,973
Maybe the relocation program
isn't in the DHD processor at all.

394
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,441
What, the obelisk?

395
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,675
(CHUCKLING)

396
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,185
You obviously have no idea
what you are talking about.

397
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,352
Says the brainiac who spent three days
trapped in that force field.

398
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,325
That technology is strictly used
for localized transport.

399
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,394
Yeah, I know.

400
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,122
I mean, it's obviously
what's beaming us through the gate

401
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,993
every time there's an open wormhole,

402
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,329
but what if it also contains
a remote dialer?

403
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,994
It's one thing to send someone here
and there on the surface of the planet.

404
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,595
It's quite another to send them
halfway across the galaxy.

405
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:12,665
It's like comparing a laptop
to a supercomputer.

406
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:17,214
Well, it wouldn't have to contain the
entire navigational system, now, would it?

407
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,850
Just a command code sufficient
to override normal dialing protocols.

408
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,444
Just a command code sufficient
to override normal dialing protocols.

409
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,679
Yes.

410
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,755
But to borrow a rather
quaint human phrase,

411
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:29,987
why hide a needle in a small haystack
when you can use an enormous one?

412
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,322
It wouldn't be much of a security measure

413
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:35,923
if it could be discovered by the first Tau'ri
female who comes along, would it, now?

414
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,763
I'm sorry.

415
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:41,828
Are you dismissing my idea out of hand
because I'm human

416
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,032
or because I'm a woman?

417
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,435
A little of both, I suppose.

418
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:50,407
You know what? I'll check it myself.

419
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,190
What is that?

420
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:11,598
Stage one. The first step towards
creating Merlin's weapon.

421
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,267
- It's real?
- Yeah.

422
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,209
That's exactly what this device does.

423
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,211
It allows you to design and configure
something virtually,

424
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,803
and then it materializes it.

425
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,476
Just like O'Neill did when he created
the anti-Replicator weapon.

426
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,644
I thought the Sangraal
was a tiny red jewel.

427
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:32,814
No, that's the final stage,
the key to making the whole thing work.

428
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,950
So how long before you can put
the whole thing together?

429
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,357
Daniel?

430
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,690
(GROANING)

431
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,097
I'm all right. I'm all right.

432
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,464
This machine takes a lot out of you.

433
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,595
The level of concentration required
is pretty intense.

434
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,730
Can I get you anything?

435
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,536
- Water.
- Sure.

436
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,751
Okay, that happened.

437
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,749
It's interesting.

438
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,525
Jack got healing powers.
I guess I got telekinesis.

439
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,960
Jack also almost died.

440
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,626
Now, you said that
this device might be different.

441
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,599
- I'll be fine.
- That's crap.

442
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,534
She's right.
You don't get fancy mind powers

443
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,266
unless there's been major redecorating
going on inside your skull.

444
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,434
Look, obviously, creating the weapon
requires a higher level of brain function.

445
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,409
Now, Merlin would've foreseen that.

446
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,642
Trust me, I can handle this.

447
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,816
Damn it.

448
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,362
(CLEARING THROAT)

449
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,096
What do you want?

450
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,065
I need your help.

451
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,140
Look, I still think
I'm right about the obelisk,

452
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:03,236
but I can't make heads or tails
of its programming.

453
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,647
Well, that's hardly surprising.

454
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:12,080
I mean, I know where you come from
you're considered relatively intelligent,

455
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,990
but by galactic standards,
that's not really saying much.

456
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,584
Wouldn't you agree?

457
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,427
You know, if you're not going to help
then you're really not much use to us,

458
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,401
and if you're not much use to us,
then there's really no point

459
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,530
in keeping you alive any longer.

460
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,868
Wouldn't you agree?

461
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,337
(SCOFFING)

462
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,610
I'd be delighted to help.

463
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,348
Great to hear it.

464
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,070
- Stage two?
- Indeed.

465
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,012
I must rest.

466
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,484
I'm not as young as I used to be.

467
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,713
Daniel? Are you all right?

468
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,721
- I know you.
- Well, of course you do, silly.

469
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,093
It's me. Vala.

470
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,000

What's going on?

475
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:58,356
We're losing you, that's what's going on.

476
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,296
Every time you come back from
that machine, it gets a little worse,

477
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,161
and don't tell me you're fine.

478
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,092
No.

479
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,802
No, I just have...
I have too many thoughts in my head.

480
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,806
- I can't concentrate. I get confused.
- You have to fight it.

481
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:14,105
No, no, that's the thing.
I have to let it happen.

482
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,906
That's the only way
I can build Merlin's weapon.

(PANTING)

484
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,895
You have to tell him that he doesn't have
to do this. He'll listen to you.

485
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,695
Oh? What team have you been on?
Besides, we need this one.

486
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,770
What makes you think
we'll even be allowed to use it?

487
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,566
The Ancients didn't let Merlin get away
with it last time...

488
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:44,971
Vala! Vala, shut up for once.

489
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,869
We have to take the risk.

490
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,174
What?

491
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,976
This is all about noble sacrifice
for you, isn't it?

492
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,453
- Oh, dear, I'm sorry, what about you?
- What?

493
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,990
When you flew that cargo ship
into the gap of the supergate,

494
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:04,584
you knew damn well that you might not
come out the other side alive.

495
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,296
No, that was different.

496
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:10,629
Yeah, different because
you were the one taking the risk.

497
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,870
Well, now you know.

498
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:20,239
The hard part about being part of
this team is not risking your own life.

take chances with theirs.

Now you really are one of us.

502
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,332
It's a command override.
I can't believe we actually found it.

00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,935
Clearly, you work well together.

504
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,769
Well, now that
we've identified the program,

505
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,816
it should be a simple matter
to shut it down.

00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,784
Hold them here! I'll get help!

516
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,268
(GROANING)

517
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,653
Dr. Jackson.

518
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,421
(SIGHING)

519
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,158
You're too late.

520
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,733
You haven't completed the weapon.
I'd say I'm just in time.

521
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,134
And I'd say things are different now.

522
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,952
Draining, isn't it?

523
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:25,485
Instead of helping your friends, you should
have saved your energy to deal with me.

524
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,628
Would it have made a difference?

525
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,736
Probably not.

526
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,568
What was that?

527
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,473
I don't know, but I say
we don't stick around to find out.

528
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:43,012
Dial out of here
before anyone else can dial in.

529
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,342
I'm going to go check on Daniel.

530
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,285
Daniel?

531
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,227
Why do I bother?

532
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,793
Adria, I want you to stop this right now.

533
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,840
I'm sorry it has to be this way, Mother.

534
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,410
- Get to the gate now.
- I'm not leaving you here.

535
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,115
I'll be right behind you.

536
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,381
No.

537
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,651
There has to be a way
we can get back to that planet.

538
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,855
A DHD buffer typically holds
the last 50 addresses that were dialed,

539
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,091
and we went through three gates
before getting there.

540
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,895
We've got a lot of planets to check.

541
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,367
Adria found a way around the problem.

542
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:18,204
Even if we could return to the planet, at
this point I fear it would do us little good.

543
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,399
(HITTING KEYBOARD)

544
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,568
(GRUNTING)

545
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,051
At least we'd be doing something.

546
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:35,856
Merlin gave Daniel
some pretty valuable intel.

547
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,621
Adria knows that.

548
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:39,859
Hey.

549
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,864
She'll keep him alive.

550
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,853
How are you feeling?

551
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,691
I don't suppose you know
what a hangover is.

552
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,627
(SIGHING)

553
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,363
Never mind.

554
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,701
I know the burden must be awful.

555
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:26,003
Your brain simply wasn't built
to handle that much information.

556
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,270
(GROANING)

557
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,472
Well, whatever I had, it's gone,

558
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,175
along with what feels like
half my brain cells.

559
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,952
You'll forgive me
if I don't take your word for it.

560
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:43,716
Now, rest. We have a lot of work to do.
