1
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:35,251
This is my school.

2
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:40,606
If you go here, your parents are either millionaires or your parents work for millionaires.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,718
Neptune, California. A town without a middle class.

4
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:49,505
If you're in the second group, you get a job: fast food, movie theaters, mini-marts.

5
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:50,898
Or you could be me.

6
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:56,120
My after-school job means tailing philandering spouses or investigating false injury claims.

7
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:57,676
Who'd that guy rat out?

8
00:00:57,897 --> 00:00:58,675
The bikers.

9
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:00,212
Why doesn't somebody cut him down?

10
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:02,944
Yeah, I'll do it.  I wanna be the guy up there tomorrow.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,080
Say cheese. Smile.

12
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,110
Move.

13
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,080
Who died and made you the queen--

14
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:19,007
You are a freak.

15
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:20,686
You're new here, huh?

16
00:01:21,454 --> 00:01:23,117
Welcome to Neptune High.

17
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:26,062
Go Pirates!

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,618
This is advanced placement. We expect more.

19
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:36,926
It's called "An Essay on Man", but what Pope's really talking about is faith, right?

20
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:38,729
Anybody?

21
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,097
Did anybody complete the reading?

22
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:44,544
Veronica?

23
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:46,516
Veronica Mars!

24
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:50,709
Congratulations. You're my volunteer.

25
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:54,059
Pope. "An Essay on Man." Epistle one.

26
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:58,602
"Hope springs eternal in the human breast.

27
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,616
Man never is, but always to be blessed.

28
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:08,856
The soul, uneasy and confined from home rests and expatiates in a life to come."

29
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:13,024
And what do you suppose Pope meant by that?

30
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:16,331
Life's a bitch until you die.

31
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:21,998
Thank you, Ms. Mars, for that succint and somewhat inappropriate response.

32
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:27,815
I think what Pope's saying is the thing that keeps us powering through life's defeats

33
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:31,482
is our faith in a better life yet to come.

34
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:34,040
Random locker searches.

35
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:38,475
It's the latest tactic the administration has adopted in their losing war on drugs.

36
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:40,544
Except the searches aren't really random.

37
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:43,718
I know when they're going to happen before Vice Principal Clemmons does.

38
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,462
Veronica Mars. This should be good.

39
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,649
Veronica, will you please open your locker?

40
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:52,360
Buster.

41
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:02,810
Wow.

42
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:05,934
This is a little embarrassing.

43
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,626
I used to sit there, at that table.

44
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:25,671
It's not like my family met the minimum net worth requirement.

45
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:32,026
My dad didn't own his own airline like John Enbaum's or serve as ambassador to Belgium like Shelly Pomroy's.

46
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:35,701
But my Dad used to be the sheriff and that had a certain cache.

47
00:03:36,254 --> 00:03:37,724
Let's be honest, though.

48
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:41,655
The only reason I was allowed past the velvet ropes was Duncan Kane,

49
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:44,272
son of software billionaire Jake Kane.

50
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,509
He used to be my boyfriend.

51
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:55,542
Then one day, with no warning,

52
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:57,360
he ended things.

53
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,796
And let's not forget Logan Echolls.

54
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:15,366
His dad makes twenty million a picture.

55
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:17,358
You probably own his action figure.

56
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:21,126
Every school has an obligatory psychotic jackass.

57
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,565
He's ours.

58
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:25,497
You okay?

59
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,723
What?

60
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:30,379
You look, I don't know, hypnotized.

61
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,828
Did I say you could sit here?

62
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:35,206
Wait a minute.

63
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:38,130
Of course you can sit here. Sit wherever you want.

64
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:43,946
That was cool. What you did, cutting me off of that pole.

65
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:44,663
Well--

66
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:45,707
My bitch!

67
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:48,277
Weren't you supposed to wait for me at the flagpole?

68
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,074
Not sure I could've made that any clearer.

69
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:55,492
Okay. I get it.

70
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,577
Very funny. I guess, we're even now.

71
00:04:59,696 --> 00:05:03,044
You get what, boy? You get that you're a dead man walking, is that what you get?

72
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:04,145
Leave him alone.

73
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:11,743
Sista! The only time I care what a woman has to say is when she's riding my big ole hog,

74
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:14,816
and even then it's not so much words, it's just ooh's and aah's, you know?

75
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,664
- So it's big, huh?
- Legendary.

76
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:20,847
Well, let's see it. I mean, if it's as big as you say, I'll be your girlfriend...

77
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:23,842
We could go to prom together! What?

78
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,453
What seems to be the problem? I'm on a schedule, here, Vato.

79
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:28,594
Dude, Weevil!  Don't let Blondie talk to you like that!

80
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:30,775
Sounds like your buddy here wants to see it, too.

81
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,115
Oh, hell, I'll show you mine!

82
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,551
Felix Coumbs! What on God's green Earth is going on here?

83
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:37,215
Alright, gentlemen, move along.

84
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:40,097
Veronica, why does trouble follow you around?

85
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:46,661
So, what'd you do?

86
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:47,905
What?

87
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:50,221
Why are you a dead man walking?

88
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:51,854
Oh, yeah.

89
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:53,574
I work at the Sac and Pac.

90
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,506
Last night I was working by myself and a couple of those guys came in.

91
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:05,156
They just walked right to the back of the store and start stuffing all these forties into their pockets.

92
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:06,584
So I hit the silent alarm.

93
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:14,678
Wallace.

94
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:20,726
I guess the dude thought a one dollar bill would cover it.

95
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:21,812
Keep the change.

96
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:30,250
That's when the police came.

97
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:32,937
We don't have police here, we have a sheriff's department.

98
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:35,989
You. Come on.

99
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:42,465
What's up, snitch?

100
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:44,206
Come  here!

101
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,433
They say they paid.

102
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,251
- Well, did they?
- Yeah.

103
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:52,521
Like I said.

104
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:54,661
Shut up.

105
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:58,465
But you pressed the alarm anyway?

106
00:06:58,522 --> 00:06:59,330
It was an accident.

107
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:10,906
Jacks, get 'em out of here.  Get 'em out of here, we've got enough.

108
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:17,507
You need to go see the Wizard.

109
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,266
Ask him for some guts.

110
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,343
-  Go see the Wizard?  He said that?
- Yeah.

111
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,862
Congratulations, sport.  In your short time here

112
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:29,473
you've already managed to piss off a motorcycle gang and the local sheriff.

113
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,566
Hey, baby.

114
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:47,874
That's our song.

115
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:54,147
Happy birthday, Veronica! Are you surprised?  Veronica?

116
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:55,128
Mom?

117
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:59,317
Veronica, it's me.  Honey, can you give me a hand.

118
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:08,991
Hey... who's a big boy?

119
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:20,208
Good boy!

120
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:54,056
I was shocked to discover Celeste Kane's car outside Dad's office.  Duncan's mom.

121
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:57,399
She hates me almost as much as she adores her son.

122
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,557
Veronica Mars.

123
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:13,026
My dad's with a client.

124
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:16,124
Apparently. That's okay, I'm happy out here chatting with you.

125
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:17,926
Like I said, my Dad's with a client.

126
00:09:17,997 --> 00:09:21,567
I heard you. But your dad's out tracking bail jumpers half the time and yet,

127
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,678
somehow, all the cases that come in here still get handled. How is that?

128
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:28,401
- We're efficient.
- Very efficient.

129
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:31,760
Hmm, look, I'm just going to leave this file here, open, on your desk

130
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:34,090
and if you decide to take a look at it, cool.

131
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:37,904
One of my clients, Loretta Cancun, dances at The Seventh Veil.

132
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:39,911
- Classy.
- These are my people, V.

133
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,431
She was busted for vandalism, taking a baseball bat

134
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:45,067
to the washing machine that stole her quarters at Suds and Duds.

135
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:48,222
- And Johnny Cochran was booked?
- I make no apologies.

136
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:52,051
I like this case. It's... tawdry. Ms. Cancun says The Seventh Veil

137
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:57,412
has an interesting way of keeping their liquor license despite their rather lax I.D. policy.

138
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:58,665
She wants to make a deal.

139
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,835
If your dad has time, he should look into it.

140
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:10,894
Don't get the wrong idea, Mr. Mars. I don't like you.

141
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:17,806
I hate the fact that I'm here but I do know if anyone will be dogged

142
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:20,831
and resourceful in this matter, it'll be you.

143
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:23,437
Don't call me at home. I'll call you.

144
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,400
And I'll need it right away.

145
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,690
Hi.

146
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,120
Sure, she's a bitch, but can you blame her?

147
00:10:49,237 --> 00:10:52,508
After all, Dad did try to send her husband to jail for life.

148
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,230
How was school?

149
00:10:57,394 --> 00:10:59,980
If you think we're going to talk about my school day and not the fact that

150
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:02,994
Celeste Kane was in your office ten minutes ago, you're deluded.

151
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:04,495
You're making good grades?

152
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,988
Kane's got something on the side, doesn't he?

153
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:09,605
You know, say what you want about real cheese.

154
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:12,652
I am a fan of the orange powdered packet stuff.

155
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:16,497
My grades are fine and I like the orange powder, too. Now can we please talk about Mrs. Kane?

156
00:11:16,553 --> 00:11:21,236
Yes, she thinks he's seeing someone. Late nights, motel matches, the usual.

157
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,507
Sexual appetite?

158
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:27,857
- It's gone.
- Did you take the case?

159
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:31,227
- Well, we need the money, Veronica.
- Good. I would've been pissed if you hadn't.

160
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,942
Well, I wouldn't have cared if you were.

161
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,344
Gimme some of that apple.

162
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,901
- Ah, don't--
- Mars Investigations?  Mmm hmm, just a sec.

163
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:42,917
Keith Mars.

164
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,696
How long ago?

165
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,564
What's he driving?

166
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,567
I got the 7:30 out of San Diego and I'll meet you by the thing by the fountain.

167
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,796
Good work, thanks.

168
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:57,170
That guy's on the move. Andy picked him up in El Paso.

169
00:11:57,257 --> 00:12:00,984
Another day, he'll probably drive across the border so I gotta head out.

170
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:03,837
You go. I'll have a flight booked by the time you get to the airport.

171
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:06,166
Do you want a rental car in Texas?

172
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:08,281
Yeah, nothing fancy this time, Veronica.  Seriously.

173
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,722
A Blazer is not fancy and we can bill it anyway.

174
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,481
Fine, I'll get you a Crown Vic. Once a cop...

175
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:17,040
Don't do anything on the Kane case. I'll handle it.

176
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:17,834
Okay.

177
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:21,110
- Given our relationship with that family--
- Fine, I said okay!

178
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:23,655
Okay. If all goes well, I'll be back tomorrow night.

179
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:26,350
If not, the night after.

180
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:29,236
I'll call and I'll check in.

181
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:30,271
You always do.

182
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:31,387
And Veronica?

183
00:12:32,227 --> 00:12:32,861
Yes?

184
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:36,753
When you go after Jake Kane, you take backup.

185
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:38,114
I always do.

186
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:45,344
By the time Dad's plane landed in El Paso I'd already picked up Jake Kane

187
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:47,521
at his house and followed him to his office.

188
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:52,420
Streaming video was invented and perfected here at Kane software.

189
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:56,685
The day the company went public, Jake Kane made a billion dollars.

190
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,122
Everyone who worked for him in fact, right down the secretarial pool became millionaires.

191
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:03,617
He's beloved here.

192
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:07,068
Half the people in this town owe their fortunes to him.

193
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,261
And I knew the family well.

194
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,885
Jake's son, Duncan, was my first and only love.

195
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:15,256
His daughter Lilly was my best friend.

196
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:19,116
God, Lilly, I see the Prozac's working.

197
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:20,938
High on life, Veronica Mars.

198
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:22,730
I've got a secret.

199
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:23,878
A good one.

200
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:26,524
Girls!   Less talk, more scrub.

201
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,462
Later...

202
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,162
Those were the last words Lilly and I ever shared.

203
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,423
Later that night as I was driving home from picking up dinner with Dad

204
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:37,385
a call came in over the radio.

205
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:41,604
All the dispatcher said was that there was a disturbance at the Kane estate.

206
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:48,224
Dad gave me specific instructions to stay in the car,

207
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:52,054
but the moment that I saw Duncan, I knew that this was more than a disturbance.

208
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,567
What happened?

209
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:04,326
Duncan, what happened?

210
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:07,721
Where's Lilly?

211
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:15,330
But everyone knows this story. The murder of Lilly Kane.

212
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:19,462
It was on the cover of People Magazine. It made Entertainment Tonight.

213
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,687
The town flooded with journalists.

214
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,246
Duncan, talk to me, please.

215
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:38,308
And of course, everyone remembers reading about the bungling local sheriff,

216
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:40,269
the one who went after the wrong man.

217
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,767
That bungling sheriff was my Dad.

218
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:04,436
But if my Dad wasn't right about Jake Kane, then, it looks like Mrs. Kane is right about him now.

219
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:09,644
Not a lot of high-powered business meetings taking place at the Camelot at one in the morning.

220
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:15,045
They say the divorce rate is twice as high for parents who lose a child.

221
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,210
Lose a child.

222
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:19,796
Now there's a euphemism for you.

223
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,341
That hardly takes into account the way she was found.

224
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,903
What? You guys find a way to unlock the porn?

225
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:30,127
It's the Lilly Kane video. How do you think that family feels?

226
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:37,341
Six weeks after Lilly Kane's death, someone from the Sheriff's Department leaked the crime scene video.

227
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,988
Within twenty-four hours, it was all over the net.

228
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:42,099
Streaming video made it possible.

229
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:45,098
Someone made a fortune while Dad took the blame.

230
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,820
So, does your uh, does your dad still think that Lilly's father did this?

231
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:52,928
That's my girlfriend.

232
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:56,025
Your friend.

233
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:00,260
Duncan's sister.

234
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:03,325
Your dad is destroying the Kane family.

235
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:06,373
What's the matter with you people, huh?

236
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:09,445
What's the matter with you?

237
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:11,662
He did it, Lianne. The man is a liar...

238
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:15,783
My Dad's belief that Jake Kane was the murderer became a moot point.

239
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,040
An emergency recall election removed him from office.

240
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:20,843
Mom wanted to move out of Neptune.

241
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,268
The loss of status, the loss of income was too much for her.

242
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:27,263
We were going to move, alright, we couldn't afford our house.

243
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:29,587
But Dad wasn't going to be run out of town.

244
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:30,888
And neither was I.

245
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,843
Dad, come here!

246
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,965
Hey, I'm sorry, honey.

247
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,272
- Me and your mom, we're going to work this out.
- Look.

248
00:16:40,496 --> 00:16:43,555
...Abel Koontz, a disgruntled former Kane software employee.

249
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:47,194
Koontz, a software designer, was fired during the development stage

250
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:49,893
of Kane Software's streaming video project.

251
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:52,331
Shoes and a backpack belonging to the deceased

252
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:56,156
were discovered on Koontz's houseboat by Sheriff Don Lamb--

253
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:24,161
Well. This can't be good.

254
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:35,416
Car trouble, miss?

255
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:39,476
Yeah, as a matter of fact. I think it might be a loose belt,

256
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,354
but if you wouldn't mind checking under the hood.

257
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,712
Hey Weevil, who gets the first--

258
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:46,772
Get him off me! Get him off me!

259
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,457
Call of your dog!

260
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,129
Backup, chill.

261
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:58,521
I'll tell you what. We'll call it a draw.

262
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:00,202
Lady, come on. It's too late for that.

263
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:03,391
Here's the deal. Leave that kid at school alone for a week

264
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:05,020
and I'll make sure your boys walk.

265
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,575
Why you care so much for that skinny negro, anyway?

266
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,699
Things I heard about you, you must really lay the pipe right, huh?

267
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:11,768
Yeah, that's it.

268
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:17,544
Alright, alright, alright, Felix. We get it, you're a badass, okay?

269
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:20,533
- But for once, don't be stupid!
- Not bad advice.

270
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:22,617
Alright. One week.

271
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:28,024
After that, we come for you, your boy, and your little dog, too.

272
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:29,479
Backup, be cool.

273
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:31,015
You get lonely out here, remember,

274
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,559
Weevil love you long time.

275
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,633
Quite a reputation I've got, huh?

276
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,563
You wanna know how I lost my virginity?

277
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,216
So do I.

278
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:55,418
I went to a party at Shelly Palmroy's just to show everyone their whispers and backstabbing didn't affect me.

279
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:57,685
It was a mistake.

280
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:16,936
I don't know who handed me the drink. I wish I did.

281
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:20,669
It turns out it was your basic rum, coke, and roofie.

282
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:37,116
I never told my dad.

283
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:40,224
I'm not sure what he would have done with that information,

284
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,339
but no good would have come of it.

285
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:44,186
And what does it matter?

286
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:46,179
I'm no longer that girl.

287
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:51,733
Alright, Lady, let's see ya'.

288
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:08,348
Hey, Ronnie.

289
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:13,167
We've decided that we'd rather surf than study today. You wanna come with?

290
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,861
Duncan will promise to take his shirt off, does that sweeten the pot?

291
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:20,145
Does it make you horny?

292
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,509
- Hey, DK, flex for your ex.
- Shut up, Logan!

293
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,280
Alright, alright.

294
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:28,020
Hey, hey, hey.

295
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,590
What do say to a little hooch, huh?

296
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:33,201
What's the matter, aren't you your mother's daughter?

297
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:36,555
Now there was a woman who could drink.

298
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:39,018
Hey, what's she up to nowadays, maybe she'll join us.

299
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:41,270
You know where she is? Any clue?

300
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:44,357
-  Leave her alone, man.
- Ooh, chill pill, man.

301
00:21:46,908 --> 00:21:49,150
Aw, she used to be fun, man.

302
00:21:51,374 --> 00:21:54,138
It's been eight months since I've seen my mother.

303
00:21:57,004 --> 00:22:00,777
A month after Dad lost his job, Mom split for good.

304
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,788
All she left me was a unicorn music box

305
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:06,562
and a note saying she would be back for me someday.

306
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:24,801
Girl.

307
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:27,392
You should hear what people say about you.

308
00:22:28,344 --> 00:22:30,008
So then what are you doing sitting here?

309
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,140
You sat next to me!

310
00:22:31,242 --> 00:22:33,961
- This is my table.
- And what a fine table it is.

311
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:37,360
What do you suppose this is made of? Oak?

312
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:39,456
Look, if people are saying such awful things--

313
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:43,234
Well, I figure I gotta choice. I can either go hang out with the punks who laughed at me,

314
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:46,270
took pictures of me while I was taped to that flagpole.

315
00:22:46,628 --> 00:22:48,784
Or I can hang out with the chick who cut me down.

316
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:56,336
So, you wanna get the PCH Bike Club off your ass?

317
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,435
This is SO twisted. I love it.

318
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,090
Well can you do it, 'cause we need it fast.

319
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:07,416
Oh, hell yeah! For you, anything. I'll even throw in the glazing gratis.

320
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:09,602
Go to town. Thanks, Corny.

321
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:13,959
Oh, my god.

322
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:17,983
While Corny did his thing, I downloaded the pictures from the Camelot.

323
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:21,916
Every girl's gotta have a hobby. Photography's mine.

324
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:08,969
And?

325
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:10,818
Who's your daddy?

326
00:24:10,956 --> 00:24:12,554
Ugh. I hate it when you say that.

327
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:17,258
You know what, this is important. You remember this: I used to be cool!

328
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:18,953
- When?
- '77.

329
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:22,106
Trans-Am. Blue Oyster Cult on the eight-track.

330
00:24:22,183 --> 00:24:25,932
A foxy stacked blonde riding shotgun. Racing for pink slips.

331
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:31,784
Oh, wait a minute. I'm thinking of a Springsteen song. Scratch everything. I was never cool.

332
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:35,019
I don't know which bothers me more: foxy or stacked.

333
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:39,581
I nailed our bail jumper one hundred yards from Mexico.

334
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:43,078
2,500 bucks. No sack dinners tonight.

335
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:48,680
Tonight, we eat like the lower middle class to which we aspire. Fire up the bati.

336
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:52,913
For real, steaks?

337
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:05,617
So Jake Kane went to the Camelot last night and hooked up with some hussy.

338
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:09,646
Didn't I say something about you not getting involved in that?

339
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:13,717
I remember you saying something about taking Backup.

340
00:25:14,894 --> 00:25:15,873
You get pictures?

341
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,902
No money shot. The woman in question never stepped foot outside,

342
00:25:19,974 --> 00:25:23,275
but I did get pictures of license plates. I figured you could run them.

343
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:27,029
Let me see 'em.

344
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:36,931
You stay away from Jake Kane.

345
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:39,707
I don't want you doing anything else on this case.

346
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:42,440
We're gonna drop it anyway. I'm gonna let his wife know.

347
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:45,037
What? We're dropping the case? Why? What's wrong?

348
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:46,599
Who is it?

349
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,589
Why don't you just tell me?

350
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:53,950
Veronica, no! It's done. It's over with. You just stay away from him.

351
00:26:05,987 --> 00:26:08,311
I had another case to occupy my brain:

352
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:13,136
Loretta Cancun says the Seventh Veil has an interesting way of keeping their liquor license.

353
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:21,649
This was phase one of my plan to save Wallace.

354
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:23,928
Phase two would begin the next day.

355
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:26,145
Let's go!

356
00:26:26,248 --> 00:26:28,681
Hey, Flo-Jo, slow your ass down.

357
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:35,519
There you go.

358
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:41,802
Well, what's this, Logan? This would appear to be a device they use to smoke marijuana.

359
00:26:42,136 --> 00:26:43,789
That's exactly what it looks like.

360
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,407
Let's go to the office.

361
00:26:48,756 --> 00:26:49,932
This was you?

362
00:26:50,973 --> 00:26:53,742
Listen, I know it was you! This isn't over, okay.

363
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,659
Hey.

364
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:58,027
You're so cute.  Listen, I'll get you for this.  I will!

365
00:26:58,939 --> 00:27:00,142
Solid!

366
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:02,503
You're right. That was funny.

367
00:27:02,574 --> 00:27:05,493
Meet me at my car after school. Let's see if you've done your part.

368
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:10,664
After school, I drove Wallace to the Sherrif's Department. This was phase three.

369
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:12,573
You know, we could get in a lot of trouble for this.

370
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:13,941
- Give it here.
- Wait.

371
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,940
I'm gonna do it. Just thought one of us should state the obvious.

372
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:31,262
I wonder if it worked.

373
00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:36,602
A fire!

374
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,935
It worked.

375
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:56,135
Hey Adam. Hey Eddie, is the Chief around?

376
00:27:56,294 --> 00:27:58,946
Well, if it isn't Smoky the Barely Legal.

377
00:27:59,126 --> 00:28:03,401
I saw you in action today, Phil, you were very brave.  Did you make the switch?

378
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:04,926
Fait accompli.

379
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:06,805
Thank you.

380
00:28:06,932 --> 00:28:11,048
Plenty of people in this town still love Dad. That comes in handy sometimes.

381
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:13,671
Other times, you rely on your own devices.

382
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:26,758
San Juan Capistrano P.D.

383
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:31,181
Tony, it's Inga. Ah, guess what, our computers is down again.

384
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,960
Inga. Upgrade already, this must be the tenth time.

385
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:38,687
You preach to the choir, Tony. Listen, we had a hit and run last night.

386
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,222
Victim got the plates, but we need someone to run them.

387
00:28:41,315 --> 00:28:42,339
No problem. Hit me.

388
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:49,076
Ah, Arizona. Four - Victor - Golf - Zero - Zero - Zero

389
00:28:50,347 --> 00:28:52,082
Well, I'll be damned. Some families.

390
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:53,097
What is it?

391
00:28:53,347 --> 00:28:56,766
That car is registered to one Lianne Mars.

392
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,587
Bored.

393
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:09,776
Wanna call it a day, maybe catch a movie or something?

394
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:14,006
Explain to me again why we're dropping the Kane case.

395
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,279
Look.

396
00:29:18,747 --> 00:29:25,439
I... I did run those plates and... it's what I thought.

397
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,492
Corporate espionage stuff.

398
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:30,702
And it's dangerous, you know.

399
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,705
We don't get paid enough, so...

400
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:39,196
Let's just drop it, okay?

401
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,018
Okay.

402
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:46,068
- Movie?
- Can't.

403
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:49,452
Well maybe we can rent something. What are you in the mood--

404
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:57,676
Veronica! Ah, little Veronica, how are you? How's your father?

405
00:29:57,752 --> 00:30:00,947
- Fine, Inga, we're both fine.
- I haven't seen you since...

406
00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:03,200
- Since...
- Been a while.

407
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:05,405
Can you tell me where the Cortez/Winn prelim is?

408
00:30:05,462 --> 00:30:07,306
- Courtroom three.
- Thanks.

409
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:08,955
The last time I was here?

410
00:30:09,578 --> 00:30:10,926
Come on, Inga.

411
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:12,580
That's easy.

412
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:20,602
Veronica! What happened to you?

413
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,575
I need to report a crime.

414
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,379
Is there anyone in particular you'd like me to arrest?

415
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:33,019
Or should I just round up the sons of the most important families in town?

416
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:39,469
I've got not a shred of evidence to work with here, but that doesn't really matter to your family, does it?

417
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,916
Oh, look at this.

418
00:30:44,078 --> 00:30:45,470
She cries.

419
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:51,543
I'll tell you what, Veronica Mars. Why don't you go see the Wizard?

420
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,673
Ask him for a little backbone.

421
00:30:54,078 --> 00:30:57,605
When we find them, they've still got twenty bottles stuffed in their pockets.

422
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:05,880
They say they bought the beers, but we've got it all on tape, so...

423
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:08,066
- Your honor, can we show the tape?
- Let's see it.

424
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:13,232
Alright, what you're gonna see here are the two defendants over there. They enter and--

425
00:31:16,237 --> 00:31:18,772
What are we seeing here, Sheriff?

426
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,184
Uh, Your Honor, I've--

427
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,105
Sheriff Lamb, is this one of your officers?

428
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:26,948
Is this how you run your department?

429
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:35,346
Ah, Your Honor, is this an appropriate time to ask for a dismissal in People vs. Loretta Cancun?

430
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,223
Got a present for you.

431
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:23,012
I owe you, big time.

432
00:32:23,104 --> 00:32:25,065
I had my own reasons for doing it, trust me.

433
00:32:25,147 --> 00:32:26,473
 Oh, no, you don't.

434
00:32:26,926 --> 00:32:28,706
You really think I'm gonna let you get away with that?

435
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,405
That might play with the masses.

436
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:35,848
But underneath that angry young woman shell, there's a slightly less angry young woman

437
00:32:35,915 --> 00:32:38,526
who's just dying to bake me something.

438
00:32:39,484 --> 00:32:41,445
You're a marshmallow, Veronica Mars.

439
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,597
A twinkie.

440
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:47,286
Okay, how do I make it loop de loop?

441
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:50,964
Uh, Veronica.

442
00:32:51,516 --> 00:32:52,419
Yeah?

443
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:53,803
Your car.

444
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:08,320
Hey. Veronica Mars.

445
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:14,397
Do you know what your little joke cost me?

446
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:16,743
Well, I'm pretty sure you won't be getting your bong back.

447
00:33:20,174 --> 00:33:21,612
Wrong answer.

448
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,623
Would you care to guess again?

449
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,111
Clearly, your sense of humor.

450
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:31,371
Nope. You're usually so good at pop quizzes.

451
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,290
No, the correct answer is, my car.

452
00:33:34,698 --> 00:33:37,157
That's right, my Daddy took my T-Bird away.

453
00:33:37,443 --> 00:33:39,293
And you know what I won't be having?

454
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:44,530
Fun, fun, fun.

455
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:46,696
Uh, Logan?

456
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:00,939
What do we have here?

457
00:34:02,818 --> 00:34:04,923
Vandalism? No, no, no.

458
00:34:05,158 --> 00:34:08,236
The only vandalism that happens in this town goes through me.

459
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,188
Listen, man, I don't have a problem with you.

460
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,401
That's where you're wrong.

461
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,598
Hey, yo! Is this O-Town any good?

462
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:22,987
I mean, my little sister likes 'em, but she likes ponies and juice boxes, too.

463
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:27,294
I suddenly feel like I'm in a scene from The Outsiders.

464
00:34:27,851 --> 00:34:29,511
Be cool, Sodapop.

465
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:31,600
Hey, that's not his car, that's my mom's car.

466
00:34:31,757 --> 00:34:32,986
She can bill me.

467
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:48,223
That's it. Head for the hills.

468
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,246
I'm not gonna say it twice.

469
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:52,063
Except for you.

470
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:53,983
You, say you're sorry.

471
00:34:55,628 --> 00:34:56,825
Rub a lamp.

472
00:35:00,462 --> 00:35:02,227
I said, say you're sorry.

473
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,023
Kiss my ass.

474
00:35:14,874 --> 00:35:16,973
- Now.
- Let him go.

475
00:35:17,055 --> 00:35:19,117
Are you sure?  I could do this for a while.

476
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:20,858
I don't want his apology.

477
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:35,015
So that surveillance tape just, poof?

478
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,160
That's fortunate.

479
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:46,035
My uncle has a body shop on the highway.

480
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:50,115
If you come in, you know, I could make sure your body gets the full service treatment.

481
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:51,538
Okay, now you apologize.

482
00:35:51,718 --> 00:35:55,178
- I'm sorry, was that too dirty?  'Cause--
- Not to me, dork. To him.

483
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:58,516
- Right. No.
- Fine.

484
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,477
He has the only copy of the Sac and Pac video.

485
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:03,432
Wallace, let's go decide what to do with it.

486
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:08,578
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait. Look. I'm sorry, man, for taping you to the flagpole.

487
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:09,844
Alright.

488
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:11,343
Can I have the tape back now?

489
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:13,908
Nope.

490
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,384
This morning when I woke up, I had one person in the world that I could count on.

491
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:33,293
But if there's something I've learned in this business,

492
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:35,593
the people you love let you down.

493
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,608
Dad doesn't think I know where he keeps the combination to the safe.

494
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:07,735
He's wrong.

495
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:10,940
Of course, I've never needed to use it.

496
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:24,994
Oh, my God. The Lilly Kane murder file.

497
00:37:25,568 --> 00:37:26,853
What's Dad been up to?

498
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:30,417
Some of these notes are less than a month old.

499
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:35,957
The confessed killer is already on death row, but Dad still hasn't given up on the case.

500
00:37:36,905 --> 00:37:40,857
My surveillance photo from the Camelot? Why is it in the Lilly Kane file?

501
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:44,999
What was Mom doing there, and what business did she have with Jake Kane?

502
00:37:45,141 --> 00:37:46,884
And the million dollar question:

503
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:49,966
Why did Dad lie to me?

504
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:55,557
What are you doing back here? I saw the light.

505
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,722
I forgot a few of my books.

506
00:37:57,795 --> 00:37:59,934
So up and at 'em, Adam Ant. Come on, it's Family Fun Night.

507
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:03,130
I called out to Mama Leone's. I rented the South Park movie.

508
00:38:03,206 --> 00:38:04,296
My favorite.

509
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:06,820
Hey... Who's your daddy?

510
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:09,452
You are.

511
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:15,714
I have to make a stop, so I'll meet you at home?

512
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,940
Okay. Hurry up.

513
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:20,000
I worry about you.

514
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,989
Yeah, you do.

515
00:38:40,556 --> 00:38:44,450
Okay, he lied to me, but I've gotta believe he has his reasons.

516
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:46,854
He's probably trying to protect me.

517
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,046
That's what dads do.

518
00:38:49,497 --> 00:38:54,837
Still, I've got too many questions swirling around in my head to wait until he's willing to share.

519
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:56,648
These questions need answers.

520
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,211
That's what I do.

521
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,758
Okay, it's a long shot, but I can't help myself.

522
00:39:04,965 --> 00:39:09,516
I used to think I knew what tore our family apart. Now I'm sure I don't.

523
00:39:09,686 --> 00:39:16,004
But I promise this: I will find out what really happened, and I will bring this family back together again.

524
00:39:17,144 --> 00:39:18,982
I'm sorry, is that mushy?

525
00:39:19,217 --> 00:39:20,836
Well, you know what they say.

526
00:39:21,102 --> 00:39:24,651
Veronica Mars, she's a marshmallow.
