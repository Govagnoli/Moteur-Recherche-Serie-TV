1
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:47,378
I look back over the past week and wonder if things could've turned out differently.

2
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:52,606
If I hadn't met the girl, if I hadn't initiated the case, if I hadn't interfered,

3
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:57,055
would tonight be just another dull, quiet night in our apartment complex?

4
00:00:57,905 --> 00:00:59,099
Miss, get out of the way.

5
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:12,432
Is it my fault a horrible crime played out its final chapter here?

6
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:14,548
Or was what happened inevitable?

7
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:07,930
- Hey Rocky. 
- Hey Veronica.

8
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:13,450
Hi, Neighbor.

9
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,125
Oh, hey Veronica.

10
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:16,927
Are you okay?

11
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,330
Yeah. Fine.

12
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,470
Oh, your Snow Patrol CD! I'll get it back to you, I swear, I've just been so into it.

13
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,120
I know. I can hear through the ceiling.

14
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:29,088
Oh, god, you can hear us fighting, can't you? I'm sorry.

15
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:31,361
What was the fight about?

16
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:33,195
It was nothing.

17
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:36,077
You're right, it's not my business.

18
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:39,687
No! It's just stupid, I...

19
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:42,903
My journal's missing. I think he took it.

20
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:44,688
- Really? 
- Yeah.

21
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,545
He somehow got it into his head that I have a thing for my boss.

22
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,825
Suddenly, the journal disappears.

23
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:55,003
Sort of my diary-slash-sketchbook.

24
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:57,690
But it's got some way personal stuff in there.

25
00:02:58,232 --> 00:02:59,266
I hope it turns up.

26
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:01,714
Hey, Killer!

27
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:04,074
- Do you mind if I? 
- No, go ahead.

28
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,308
He lives for the attention.

29
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:11,561
You are so lucky he's your dog. I would immediately put him in a little sailor's outfit.

30
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:15,633
Veronica, can I ask you a favor?

31
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:20,645
I have a doctor's appointment Tuesday morning. I'm getting some test results.

32
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:21,675
Do you need a lift?

33
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:23,595
Maybe some hand-holding.

34
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,627
Of course.

35
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:29,954
Mr. Echolls. I was wondering if I could have a word.

36
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:32,160
Anthropomorphic.

37
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,927
All yours, big guy.

38
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:39,446
Your father has generously offered to donate a pair of boots for a school fundraising auction.

39
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,361
Not the ones made for walking.

40
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:43,206
God, I love those boots...

41
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:47,476
Ah, the pair he wore in "Hair Trigger". They're a big ticket item.

42
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:50,553
We're hoping we'll be able to pay for our new scoreboard with what we make off of them.

43
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:54,669
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to reach your father. I was hoping you could remind him.

44
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,351
I'll have my assistant call his assistant.

45
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:09,052
...Carrie Ann Wesley went on to be Miss California, of course, then she went on to gain forty pounds.

46
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:13,784
Oh, and Jake Kane! Big computer mogul and I sat next to him in typing.

47
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:17,011
Surprisingly slow, typing-wise. He's a brilliant man.

48
00:04:17,102 --> 00:04:21,803
Ronald Tuler, of Tuler Motors -- are you married? -- because I hear he's seperated now...

49
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:27,276
Veronica! Just the girl I was looking for! I'd like you to meet Evelyn Bugby.

50
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,922
Oh, aren't you cute?

51
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,006
Evelyn is from the Alumni Association and she's looking for some help

52
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:36,354
putting together a photo display for a class reunion.

53
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:39,463
Oh. If only I had the spare time.

54
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:44,275
Oh, Pat, is that you?

55
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:46,253
Class of '79.

56
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:52,012
Think of all the bad clothes you can mock. Velour shirts. Platform shoes.

57
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:56,549
Um, okay. I'll do it.

58
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:57,711
Great!

59
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:02,755
Your first assignment is to scan and print all the photos Mrs. Bugby tagged.

60
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:08,506
And please. Keep her away from me.

61
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:25,100
Somewhere amidst the "most likely to succeed" and "class sweetheart",

62
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,589
my mom, Lianne Reynolds.

63
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:30,568
Most likely to disappear off the face of the earth.

64
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:53,655
They teach you manners in ESL?

65
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:56,241
If I was gonna cheat, don't you think I'd pick somebody smart?

66
00:05:57,451 --> 00:05:58,413
If you was gonna.

67
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:03,292
Ah, alas.

68
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:06,514
You both get zeros.

69
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,077
No talking during tests.

70
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:16,058
I guess Mrs. Daniels ain't giving it up at home, huh?

71
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:23,119
You know, the glow of your father's welcome celebrity may be enough to sustain you

72
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,666
through high school, Mr. Echolls, but do you know what it will get you in the real world?

73
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:32,043
Please say "high school English teacher". Please, say "high school English teacher".

74
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:34,700
Mr. Navarro.

75
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:39,027
I wonder if you'll find Mr. Echolls so amusing ten years from now.

76
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,439
When you're pumping his gas.

77
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:45,684
See me after class, both of you.

78
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:47,701
I'll tell you where to report for detention.

79
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:52,702
You know what I love?

80
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:58,392
I love that I get a zero for talking when you were the one who was talking to me.

81
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:03,263
You get detention for dissing the teacher in front of everybody.

82
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:06,109
And I get detention for laughing.

83
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:08,833
Let me ask you something, man.

84
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,167
Is this detention or hell?

85
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,660
How do you people not make yourselves sick?

86
00:07:14,747 --> 00:07:18,341
I mean, it's like you walk on water in this school. For what?

87
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:20,005
It's nothing that you do.

88
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:26,160
I mean, all that matters is who your parents are, and the zip code your mom shot you out in.

89
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,686
If I donate to the United Latino Pain-in-the-Ass fund, will you shut the hell up?

90
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:32,407
You like playin' wit' yourself?

91
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:33,426
Huh?

92
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,976
Or you wanna make things interesting?

93
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:37,804
What did you have in mind?

94
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:43,958
You're almost as bad a actor as your father.

95
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:47,052
You know that you don't need a diploma to steal hubcaps, right?

96
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:50,307
I mean, why do you even show up here?

97
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,964
I promised my grandmother.

98
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,537
I don't break my promises.

99
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,799
And I mean this: Aww.

100
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:03,969
Is  this Reno or detention?

101
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,186
Would you believe the best of both?

102
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:10,631
- Aw, come on, man! 
- What the hell?

103
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:12,863
We were playing a game, here.

104
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:15,777
This is punishment, gentlemen, not party time.

105
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:18,193
Well, that would explain the absence of balloon animals.

106
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:22,612
You know, the two of you may not have learned respect in the home,

107
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:24,786
but you are going to learn it here.

108
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:28,362
And you now have a full week of detention for me to teach you

109
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:31,085
without luxury time for playing cards.

110
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:48,009
-  Why'd you tell her? 
- I assumed she already knew. God, she's your mother.

111
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,869
She is the last person I want to know about the baby! I can't believe you told her where I was!

112
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,635
You're just being hormonal.

113
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:55,386
Shut up! Why don't you go spend the night with Joanna?

114
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,787
Maybe then she'll stop calling here all the time!

115
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,410
Get over it, Sarah! Grow up!

116
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:30,215
You hear something last night?

117
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:31,511
What kind of something?

118
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:34,894
Like a loud thump from upstairs.

119
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:38,930
Well, no, but you know me. I could sleep through an earthquake. Why?

120
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:43,524
I don't know. It sounded like a falling body. It really freaked me out.

121
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:46,432
- Falling body? 
- Yes. A falling body.

122
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:49,365
Would you describe the sound as "Hitchcock-ian"?

123
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,697
I'm glad you're able to entertain yourself.

124
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:57,307
Oh, sweetie, don't sell yourself short. I find you completely entertaining.

125
00:09:57,952 --> 00:09:59,426
You're dressed awfully early.

126
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,941
I'm taking Sarah to a doctor's appointment before school.

127
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:03,645
Oh, well that's mighty neighborly of you.

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,349
Well, I'll see you back at the ranch, partner.

129
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:30,066
Sarah?

130
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:54,188
Sarah, it's Veronica again. Please give me a call when you get this, I'm just getting a little worried.

131
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,159
The people that say high school years are the best years of your life are usually on the yearbook staff.

132
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:11,458
I just pray that bake sales and pep rallies aren't as good as it gets.

133
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:17,336
And that the prom isn't the most magical night of my life like it was for this golden...

134
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:19,733
Oh, my god.

135
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:23,974
So, how's life with the movie star's kid?

136
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,338
Ugh, he makes Juvie Hall seem like vacation.

137
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:27,173
Yeah?

138
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:31,388
You should tell him you spent some quiet time with Lilly Kane, his precious girlfriend.

139
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:35,617
I'd love to see the look on his face when he finds out you tapped that fine, white ass.

140
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,458
Hey! You shut your mouth with that, man!

141
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,176
You don't know what you're talking about and it wasn't like that, alright?

142
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:48,991
What? What'd I say?

143
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:52,457
Hey.

144
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,530
Hey, what's up?

145
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,530
I've got a little Neptune High trivia for you.

146
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,340
Yeah?

147
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:02,750
Did you know that your Dad and my Mom were King and Queen of the prom?

148
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:08,414
Which, I guess, means they were like a couple or something.

149
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,692
Did you know about that?

150
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:11,986
Uh, no.

151
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,528
That's weird, huh?

152
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:17,650
The boy does have a gift for evasiveness.

153
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:21,270
Last year, he broke up with me without so much as an "it's over".

154
00:12:21,353 --> 00:12:22,090
What's going on?

155
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:28,668
What's going on is I had lip gloss on my teeth for, like, all of first period.

156
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:31,709
Why is Duncan pretending I no longer exist?

157
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:34,997
Hmm... because he's a freak.

158
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:37,957
I don't know. I'm his sister, not his shrink.

159
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:43,358
It's like he's broken up with me, but hasn't gotten around to telling me yet.

160
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,871
He has been weird the past few days.

161
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,767
Maybe his right hand finally said no.

162
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,302
Can you not see I'm really upset about this?

163
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,266
God, Veronica, please. Will you stop, okay?

164
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,002
He's going through like a phase or something.

165
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:02,084
You two are meant for each other. He's not that stupid.

166
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:08,300
Fine. I'll talk to him.

167
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:09,349
Thank you.

168
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:12,135
You know, I don't know what you people would do without me.

169
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,455
Is this a joke?

170
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:20,430
No, Mr. Echolls, this is detention.

171
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:22,151
I meant the car.

172
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:26,877
Oh, my God!

173
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,208
It's not yours, is it?

174
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:34,803
Seriously, I don't think it's school policy to have students do chores.

175
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:39,278
Seriously, would you like to hear the school's policy on gambling, Mr. Echolls?

176
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:41,828
It's considerably detailed.

177
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:55,540
- Hi, I'm looking for Sarah. 
- Me too.

178
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,526
She didn't show up today.

179
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,215
I'm her neighbor and she's been missing since this morning. I'm getting really worried.

180
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:05,254
Might wanna check with her boyfriend, Andre.

181
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:06,175
Do you know him?

182
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:09,483
I feel like I do. She talks about him ad-nauseum.

183
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:13,789
"He's such a great artist. He's so down to earth. He has magic hands."

184
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,501
I'm sensing you don't like him very much.

185
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:21,182
They fight all the time. And I know for a fact the guy's got a temper.

186
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,424
A couple weeks ago she spent the night at my place.

187
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:28,269
It was storming out, she didn't wanna drive. Andre absolutely flipped out.

188
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:30,041
They fought on the phone like Sid and Nancy.

189
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:32,638
Thanks for the info.

190
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,208
This isn't like her, you know.

191
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:36,856
She hasn't missed a day of work since she started here.

192
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,648
Do you know where I can find Andre?

193
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:40,850
Hello?

194
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:01,781
- What are you doing here? 
- Have you seen Sarah?

195
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,408
Not since this morning. Why?

196
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:07,967
Well, I was supposed to take her to the doctor this morning, but she wasn't around.

197
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,087
She didn't show up for work, either.

198
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:11,107
She'll turn up.

199
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:13,123
You're not concerned?

200
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:18,418
This  is what she does. Things get a little rough, she runs.

201
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:21,643
What was the fight about?

202
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,421
I told her I found her friends annoying.

203
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:29,938
Something about you telling Sarah's mom she was pregnant?

204
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:32,886
Well, if you know the answer, why ask the question?

205
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,192
Sarah's mom didn't know she was pregnant?

206
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:37,634
They hadn't spoken since Sarah left Ohio.

207
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:42,093
I told her that Sarah was pregnant, she said she wanted to come be with her. Sarah freaked.

208
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:44,541
- Freaked and ran off? 
- Yeah.

209
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:49,426
So get these dark fantasies out of your head.

210
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:54,511
She'll come back as soon as she's processed it all. It's her way.

211
00:15:55,985 --> 00:16:00,091
I heard a noise come from your apartment last night. A loud thump.

212
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,623
Thump. Hmm.

213
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:05,098
Well, that must have been when I cracked her head open with a candlestick

214
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:08,091
and she crumpled to the ground. No, wait.

215
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:10,745
That was Professor Plum in the study.

216
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:12,458
I am seriously worried.

217
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,479
You are seriously paranoid is what you are.

218
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,629
I didn't hear a thump.

219
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,928
Maybe I slept through it.

220
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,687
Look, why don't you go back to playing field hockey or whatever it is you usually do after school.

221
00:16:26,872 --> 00:16:28,193
I can handle this.

222
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:32,417
Actually, what I usually do after school is work at my dad's detective agency.

223
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:34,403
You remember, he used to be Sheriff?

224
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:37,399
He still has a ton of contacts in law enforcement.

225
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,559
Well, la-di-da.

226
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:42,464
Who's the girl?

227
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:46,344
She's the head of our neighborhood watch program.

228
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:02,519
I wasn't aware this was clothing-optional!

229
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:06,375
Let me know when you're ready for me, Picasso.

230
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:10,334
See ya', Neighbor. Thanks for dropping by.

231
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:25,530
Dogs. Nature's psychic detectives.

232
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,182
They know it in their bones when something is wrong.

233
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,835
Now I've got the corroboration I need.

234
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:08,146
Hey, Killer.

235
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,578
Killer?

236
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:48,324
Killer, where are you, bud?

237
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,116
Oh, hi.

238
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,061
What the hell are you doing in my apartment?

239
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:56,154
I couldn't study. The little guy was barking his head off,

240
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,632
and I tried the door, it was unlocked so I figured I'd come in and check on him.

241
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:01,551
I never leave my door unlocked.

242
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:03,793
Oh, well then Sarah must have done it.

243
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:05,586
That's possible, right?

244
00:20:06,078 --> 00:20:08,791
Possible. Yeah, that's possible.

245
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:14,101
I don't know who you think you are, but you need to stay out of my business.

246
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:16,544
Am I being clear?

247
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:17,853
Crystal.

248
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:20,845
Nice chatting with you.

249
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:43,517
Well, we definitely don't need this one. I have no idea who this is, so what does that say?

250
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:47,532
Oh! Perfect, we have to have Doris Landers, she was Class Sweetheart.

251
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:49,467
In more ways than one. But a very nice girl.

252
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:53,082
What about Lianne Reynolds?

253
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,515
She's my mom...

254
00:20:56,414 --> 00:21:00,117
Oh my god! Of course! Look at you.

255
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:04,173
I thought you looked familiar. You look just like her. How is she?

256
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,901
I love this picture of her.

257
00:21:08,611 --> 00:21:14,484
Oh. She was just gorgeous. And Jake. They were a beautiful couple.

258
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,108
So they were a couple?

259
00:21:16,332 --> 00:21:19,742
No, they were the couple. Very lovey-dovey.

260
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:23,210
Practically connected at the mouth in the hallway. I'd always thought they'd get married,

261
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:26,442
I mean, everybody thought they would but obviously everything worked out for the best.

262
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:28,412
Otherwise you wouldn't be here, right?

263
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,020
Right.

264
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:36,328
They were something, though. Like a couple in a movie.

265
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:40,439
Oh, Aaron Stallon. I think he went to jail.

266
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,180
It's just high school. What happens here doesn't mean anything.

267
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:49,810
I was part of a perfect couple. It was part of my perfect life.

268
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:52,933
It's amazing how fleeting perfection can be.

269
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,565
Yesterday you said we were made for each other.

270
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:58,575
I don't-- I don't really want to be in the middle of this.

271
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,092
What is this?

272
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:02,738
I just think that maybe you should just move on.

273
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:03,717
What?!

274
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:08,791
I can think of a half dozen guys off the top of my head that would be a better match for you than Duncan.

275
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:10,736
What did he say to you? Did I do something?

276
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:14,254
No, it's not you! It's just... he needs some time alone for a while.

277
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:15,462
Would you stop walking?

278
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,775
What is so horrible that you can't tell me?

279
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:20,359
Can you trust me?

280
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:25,883
It's for the best, Veronica. I know that it doesn't seem like it right now, but it is!

281
00:22:25,974 --> 00:22:27,440
You deserve better.

282
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,589
Alphabetize by author and then by title.

283
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,859
For example, Shakespeare would come after Poe and before Wordsworth.

284
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:02,242
And within Shakespeare, MacBeth after Hamlet.

285
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:05,981
- Should I draw a diagram? 
- Please. That would be helpful.

286
00:23:06,097 --> 00:23:08,930
If you get this wrong, I'll simply have you do it again.

287
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:15,457
Well, amigo, let's get to it, huh?

288
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:22,426
Oops! Heads up! My bad!

289
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:25,136
You obviously have no appreciation of literature.

290
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:32,683
Would that it were Mr. Daniels' head!

291
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:35,201
I was thinking more like that scene in Casino.

292
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,556
- With the vice grip. 
- Ah, see I'm more of a purist.

293
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:41,079
You know, less blood, more emotional distress.

294
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:45,457
I'd rather see him locked in a room, padded, cramping himself in the corner.

295
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,538
You know. He's an English teacher; he'd appreciate the poetic justice.

296
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:52,646
I think I've got your poetic justice.

297
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:53,593
Meaning?

298
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:55,969
Meaning I've got a plan.

299
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:58,918
Tick tick. Losing interest...

300
00:23:59,035 --> 00:24:02,181
If  I thought you had the cojones to pull it off, I'd tell you, but...

301
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:06,533
Never underestimate the size of my cojones.

302
00:24:11,854 --> 00:24:12,520
Whoa.

303
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:25,141
Where the--

304
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,658
Do you know how to get back to your hotel?

305
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:30,086
- Yeah, I just-- 
- We're fine.

306
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:33,599
I have one more thing. Where do you think she is?

307
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:39,564
No idea. Look, I have your number at the hotel, so if I hear anything,

308
00:24:40,486 --> 00:24:41,545
I'll give you a call.

309
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:43,117
Thank you.

310
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:44,372
Sure.

311
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,805
Excuse me, are you Sarah's mother?

312
00:24:55,902 --> 00:24:59,559
Yes. I'm Emily, and this is her stepfather, Randall.

313
00:24:59,713 --> 00:25:02,386
Um, my father's a private detective.

314
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:04,960
And he's really good at finding missing people.

315
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:08,412
I can give you his card.

316
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:16,001
- Come on, man, check it out! 
- Thanks again for the ride, Lisa.

317
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,135
Let me know if you need me to take you home.

318
00:25:18,236 --> 00:25:18,776
Okay.

319
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:22,918
Ah, geez. What's the problem now?

320
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:33,609
Alright, people break it up! Break it up! What's the big attraction?

321
00:25:50,754 --> 00:25:52,267
Son of a--

322
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:01,387
Get back to class.

323
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,325
Go on! Move it! Go to class!

324
00:26:06,585 --> 00:26:08,346
Go to class, people!

325
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:18,116
Mr. Navarro! Interesting artwork you left at the flagpole this morning.

326
00:26:18,218 --> 00:26:19,026
Artwork?

327
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,082
It looks to me like Mr. Daniels has a little drinking and driving problem.

328
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:26,559
Spare me your indignation, Mr. Navarro, we have a witness.

329
00:26:27,526 --> 00:26:28,760
Yeah, sure you do.

330
00:26:37,736 --> 00:26:41,393
The only thing that's going to make this easy on you is if you tell us who helped you.

331
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:44,265
Alright.

332
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:46,907
You guys wanna know who helped me?

333
00:26:47,746 --> 00:26:48,771
Ask your witness.

334
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:52,258
You believe this?

335
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,653
Tell us who helped you!

336
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:57,910
Tom! Easy.

337
00:26:59,144 --> 00:27:03,947
I called your grandmother. She's been informed that as of today,

338
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,401
you are expelled from Neptune High School.

339
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,604
You are no longer a student here.

340
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:13,768
And you had so much potential.

341
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:18,607
Okay, then. A security guard will escort you to clean out your locker.

342
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,306
Wait. Does this mean I can't try out for the soccer team?

343
00:27:27,465 --> 00:27:29,672
I didn't even know they expelled people at our school.

344
00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:31,417
Well, not our people.

345
00:27:32,677 --> 00:27:33,615
They expelled him?

346
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:38,561
They had security escort him off the grounds. I was in the office getting my schedule changed

347
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:40,710
and you could hear Daniels just blowing a fuse.

348
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:44,193
Tell us who helped you! Tell us who helped you!

349
00:27:45,385 --> 00:27:48,678
If he starts selling orange juice in front of my house, I'm gonna be pissed.

350
00:27:56,379 --> 00:28:01,495
She was a very sweet girl. Light-hearted. An angel.

351
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:05,739
And then around her senior year, I saw a change.

352
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:11,110
She was secretive, always picking fights with me.

353
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:13,425
Thank you.

354
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,379
I think she was angry because I remarried after her father died.

355
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:25,196
I don't know. She had a knack for attracting troubled young men.

356
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:26,138
Come on, Emily.

357
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:28,603
You make her sound worse than she was.

358
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,089
She was a teenager, they have moods.

359
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:33,020
We shouldn't kid ourselves, Randall.

360
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:37,322
Then one day, last year, she took off.

361
00:28:37,577 --> 00:28:40,285
Didn't finish high school, never even said goodbye.

362
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,749
Emily, she's only been gone a couple of days.

363
00:28:43,153 --> 00:28:44,044
We'll find her.

364
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,102
That's why we're here.

365
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:49,708
I'll do my best.

366
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:54,868
So, here's what I'm thinking.

367
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:57,147
The boyfriend, Andre,

368
00:28:57,961 --> 00:29:01,550
he knows something and if we lean on him a little bit, put the fear of god in him--

369
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:04,208
Veronica, I'm handling this case from here on out.

370
00:29:05,774 --> 00:29:08,053
I know. That's why I brought them here. So you could be involved.

371
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:10,107
I'm handling this case without you.

372
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:12,139
No, Dad. She's my friend.

373
00:29:12,226 --> 00:29:14,956
No, she's a girl you talked to in the laundry room from time to time.

374
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:19,954
Look, sweetie, young, attractive girls who take up with troubled men?

375
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:21,663
Disappear without warning?

376
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:27,204
I've handled a hundred of these cases in my life and they often end badly.

377
00:29:28,668 --> 00:29:29,836
Prepare yourself.

378
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:47,787
I convinced Dad to let me keep working on the case if I stayed away from Andre.

379
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:52,749
Hi, this is Sarah Williams. I'm just wondering if I can get my test results over the phone.

380
00:29:53,235 --> 00:29:54,973
Right, the DNA test.

381
00:29:55,237 --> 00:29:57,111
Could you explain to me what that means?

382
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,260
Sarah's baby, it wasn't Andre's.

383
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:05,253
You got a sec?

384
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,934
Mr. Echolls. What can I do for you?

385
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:13,808
Man, I tell you Mr. Clemmons, I am pissed off!

386
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,609
I need for you to use appropriate language in here, Mr. Echolls.

387
00:30:20,143 --> 00:30:21,668
Now, what's got under your skin?

388
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:25,154
It's, uh, it's that Weevil kid.

389
00:30:25,313 --> 00:30:26,850
He is no longer a student here.

390
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:28,047
Yeah, I know.

391
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:33,731
But the problem is, he's getting all the credit for sticking Mr. Daniels car on the flagpole.

392
00:30:34,273 --> 00:30:37,005
All of the sudden, he's like the biggest badass...

393
00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:40,880
rad dude here at Neptune.

394
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,515
People are gonna be talking about that punking for years.

395
00:30:44,857 --> 00:30:46,220
I don't think I understand.

396
00:30:46,656 --> 00:30:48,581
I mean, I want my share of the credit.

397
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:50,714
You're confessing to helping Eli Navarro?

398
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:53,879
You can't just get away with this, young man.

399
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,561
Yeah, I didn't think I could.

400
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:05,175
So, what kind of punishment are we talking about?

401
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,322
I'm not really understanding your question.

402
00:31:13,812 --> 00:31:17,506
Well, if Andre's not the baby's father, do you know who is?

403
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:20,060
It's not mine, if that's what you're suggesting.

404
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:23,829
No, I'm not. But you work with her every day.

405
00:31:23,912 --> 00:31:25,477
I thought you might have picked up something.

406
00:31:25,627 --> 00:31:29,926
I hate to even think this, but maybe the guy that raped her is the baby's father.

407
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,835
- She was raped? 
- Yeah.

408
00:31:32,994 --> 00:31:35,764
It's one of the reasons she left her hometown, followed Andre here.

409
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:39,691
- She told you that? 
- Yeah.

410
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,406
Like you said, we spend a lot of time together.

411
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,064
- Did she say who it was? 
- Never.

412
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:50,659
I should get back to work. But if I think of anything else, I'll be sure to give you a call.

413
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:06,347
You stole the diary!

414
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:08,329
What?

415
00:32:08,745 --> 00:32:12,190
How did that work? She was sleeping at your house that stormy night

416
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:15,667
and there it was, just poking out of her bag. You couldn't resist.

417
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,120
You had to find out if she had a thing for you, too.

418
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:21,687
You realize you're paranoid.

419
00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:24,623
I do. Everyone reminds me.

420
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,727
But it doesn't mean I'm not right.

421
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,185
I want the journal. It's gonna help me find her.

422
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:31,331
I told you. I don't have it.

423
00:32:32,426 --> 00:32:36,092
Hmm. Looks like we're in a bit of a standstill.

424
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:37,459
Looks that way.

425
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,491
Excuse me?

426
00:32:47,054 --> 00:32:48,954
Hey, it's Veronica.

427
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:52,594
Hear you have some free time on your hands, you wanna do me a little favor?

428
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,439
- We heard there was sale! 
- Yeah!

429
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:30,899
Everything's on clearance!

430
00:33:32,037 --> 00:33:33,250
What, what do you guys want?

431
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,931
I don't know. Sometimes the girls get put off by this whole motorcycle jacket thing.

432
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,443
Do you think something in suede might make me seem more accessible?

433
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,256
Could you, could you please not do that?

434
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,454
Looks like the new Prada line came in.

435
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:58,225
Guys! Remember: No white after Labor Day!

436
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:04,443
Nathan. Did you happen to find that journal?

437
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,502
What the hell?

438
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,091
You going somewhere?

439
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,394
What's it to you?

440
00:34:55,728 --> 00:34:58,779
Seems like a strange time to be taking a trip with your girlfriend missing.

441
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:00,621
And how is this your business?

442
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:02,854
I was hired by her parents to find her.

443
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,187
Something tells me they wouldn't be too keen on the idea of you skipping town right now.

444
00:35:07,423 --> 00:35:11,738
Well, that's just it, pal. I'm not 'skipping town'. I'm just dropping off a friend.

445
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:17,474
Can I go? They're boarding now.

446
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:20,939
I appreciate you humoring me. Go board your train.

447
00:35:23,695 --> 00:35:25,420
I'll be right here waiting for you.

448
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:26,921
Well, I'll be right back.

449
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:32,891
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you both that you're getting off easy.

450
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:35,548
This will go on your permanent record.

451
00:35:35,654 --> 00:35:39,015
And you're supremely fortunate that you're not being suspended or expelled.

452
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,551
Um, does it go on my permanent record that I was un-expelled?

453
00:35:44,482 --> 00:35:46,316
Don't push your luck, Eli.

454
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,937
I'll take this one.

455
00:36:05,845 --> 00:36:08,486
- Hey, man, what are you doing? 
- What the hell is that?

456
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:12,430
- It's my arm, dawg. 
- What-- why do you have Lilly's name on your arm?

457
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:13,904
- You really wanna know? 
- Yeah!

458
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:15,946
- You really wanna know? 
- Yeah, I really wanna know!

459
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:20,908
Lilly's my little sister's name, man.

460
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:23,940
That okay with you?

461
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:32,129
Put your hands on me like that again, you'll lose on of 'em.

462
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,037
Yeah, I think I just peed myself.

463
00:36:43,608 --> 00:36:47,803
I guess if you keep a diary, you have to consider the possibility that someone could find it

464
00:36:47,888 --> 00:36:50,371
and be privy to your every intimate secret.

465
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:54,324
At least, that's what I told myself as I pored through Sarah's private thoughts.

466
00:36:54,948 --> 00:36:58,697
There were no details of a sexual assault, only its aftermath.

467
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:12,548
Sarah didn't handle it well. She felt she couldn't talk to her mother.

468
00:37:12,634 --> 00:37:14,294
She couldn't relate to her friends.

469
00:37:14,426 --> 00:37:17,626
She ran away from home and started sleeping in her car.

470
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:27,119
Bingo.

471
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:34,144
The one bright spot was Andre.

472
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:37,043
She met him in an art class and followed him to Neptune.

473
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:41,502
Sarah?

474
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:47,201
You found me.

475
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:49,306
Everyone's worried about you.

476
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:51,769
Are my parents here?

477
00:37:51,874 --> 00:37:53,761
Yeah. They're back at the apartment.

478
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:57,248
I'm gonna miss all this.

479
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,038
I found her.

480
00:38:10,976 --> 00:38:11,718
I know.

481
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:16,014
Word's out in the complex. They're very impressed.

482
00:38:16,142 --> 00:38:17,678
Think I've got a future in the biz?

483
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:20,965
I think you've got a future as a highly-paid, Ivy-League educated,

484
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:26,250
executive of some sort who never thinks about private investigation again in her perfect life.

485
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:31,364
Now, let's do something normal fathers and daughters do.

486
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:33,264
Buy me a pony?

487
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:36,592
I was thinking I'd watch TV and you'd rub my feet.

488
00:38:36,904 --> 00:38:38,640
Hmm. Yeah, that's normal.

489
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:45,094
Have you seen my keys?

490
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,685
You're not leaving, are you?

491
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:49,854
No, Sarah. I'm not the one who's always running.

492
00:38:50,218 --> 00:38:53,985
Look, I spent the last two hours making small talk with your parents.

493
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:56,773
They didn't come two-thousand miles to see me.

494
00:38:56,895 --> 00:38:58,661
I told you, I don't wanna deal with them.

495
00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:01,036
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to deal with them sometime.

496
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,366
You're right.

497
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:07,252
I'll take Killer for a walk. Be right back.

498
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:09,623
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

499
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,542
I have to say, I still really don't trust Andre.

500
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,302
I don't know.

501
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:32,992
He knows about the DNA test, the baby's not his.

502
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,516
He said it didn't matter.

503
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,925
Which in itself is all sorts of freakish.

504
00:39:41,994 --> 00:39:44,314
Well, it's a testament to how much he loves her.

505
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:49,813
A man's gotta be pretty committed to a woman to agree to raise another man's child.

506
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:53,847
You know who the real father is?

507
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:59,203
Hello? Earth to Mars!

508
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:00,632
What?

509
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,140
Where did you go just now?

510
00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:06,126
Nowhere. What'd you just ask me?

511
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:08,317
Who the father is.

512
00:40:10,038 --> 00:40:13,275
Sarah! What's wrong?

513
00:40:13,975 --> 00:40:15,951
Mom, there's something you should know.

514
00:40:16,202 --> 00:40:18,933
- Why didn't you tell me she was raped? 
- I just found out.

515
00:40:19,024 --> 00:40:20,953
He raped me! He raped me!

516
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:25,026
You are a liar! You want to hurt me!

517
00:40:25,111 --> 00:40:29,264
Shut up and listen to me for once! Your husband raped me!

518
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,349
You stay here.

519
00:40:36,587 --> 00:40:38,389
No, I'm done keeping quiet.

520
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:39,377
That's enough.

521
00:40:39,818 --> 00:40:42,153
- Sarah! 
- You're not gonna hurt me again.

522
00:40:43,116 --> 00:40:44,109
Open up!

523
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:51,041
Randall! No!

524
00:40:59,677 --> 00:41:00,975
I'm sorry.

525
00:41:27,462 --> 00:41:28,460
How is she?

526
00:41:28,646 --> 00:41:30,770
She's resting. She's gonna be okay.

527
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,837
So, I guess I'm grounded.

528
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,053
I'm gonna let you slide on this one.

529
00:41:43,036 --> 00:41:49,346
But can I let myself slide? Sure, the real tragedy happened long before I came along.

530
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:51,261
I just brought it to the surface.

531
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:53,991
But are some things better left buried?

532
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,062
