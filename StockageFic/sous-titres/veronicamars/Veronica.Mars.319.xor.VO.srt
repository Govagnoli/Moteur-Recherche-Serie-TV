1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,440
Previously on Veronica Mars.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,279
- Where did you hide the cashbox?
- The two places you looked for it.

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,228
I had to go back later and
add the incriminating $50 bill.

4
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:12,132
Do you think you can
ever really leave gang life behind?

5
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:14,632
Yeah, I miss it.
I miss having cash in my pocket.

6
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,026
The world doesn't stop
because you decided to show up.

7
00:00:17,122 --> 00:00:18,812
I can barely live with myself sometimes,

8
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,968
and it's so much easier
when you're not around!

9
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,405
Take a look around. It's dead week.

10
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,482
Everyone's walking around half-Crazy.

11
00:00:34,578 --> 00:00:37,649
Yeah, I just hope Piz isn't planning
on moping his way through

12
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:39,698
the remainder of freshman year.

13
00:00:39,794 --> 00:00:43,775
It's not like I'm taking an internship
at a mister softee in wachuta.

14
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:45,063
It's the FBI.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,352
The FBI.

16
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:50,256
At the very least,
Piz should think it's hot.

17
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,480
Actually, he does think it's pretty hot.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,729
He'd just think it was hotter
if I were doing it in Neptune.

19
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:00,268
He wants to date you and be near you?

20
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:02,152
Greedy little bugger.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,094
And if he didn't care,
I'd probably be complaining about that..

22
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:11,951
to my girlfriend...
while waiting to pay for frozen yogurt.

23
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:14,239
I'm a girl.

24
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:19,351
Have we moved in the last five minutes?

25
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:20,928
Backwards, I think.

26
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:26,466
Have you considered
letting Piz know you're...

27
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:30,455
bummed about the prospect
of being apart from him this summer?

28
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,274
Simple, direct, honest?

29
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,832
That's almost crazy enough to work!

30
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:38,966
Just sharing my vast
relationship wisdom.

31
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,581
- Just give me back my damn card!
- No.

32
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,177
She's right here...
The one with her mouth open.

33
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,153
What's with the food police?

34
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:52,827
She has the right to remain famished.

35
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:05,199
Stowe.

36
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:06,987
What?

37
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,064
It's Harriet Beecher Stowe.

38
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,712
Excuse me, can I sit down?
My knee's killing me, man.

39
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:13,385
Oh, right. Your knee.

40
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:16,135
When did you say
you injured it, mr. Navarro?

41
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:18,808
- Last wednesday.
- And you did this on the job?

42
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:21,020
I only ask because a lot of you

43
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:23,571
maintenance fellows like
to play basketball over lunch break.

44
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:26,242
That's why I didn't file for
sportsman's comp, see,

45
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:29,865
'cause I hurt my knee moving a busted
washing machine across the campus.

46
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,153
Says here you spent
a little time in prison last year.

47
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:33,597
So did Martha Stewart.

48
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:35,905
Now, does that mean
I don't get my benefits?

49
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,539
No, it just means...

50
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:40,866
How shall I put this?

51
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:43,343
A lot of people look
at a thriving private institution

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,901
like Hearst and they see...

53
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:47,476
- They see deep pockets.
- I'm not trying to con you, man.

54
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:50,645
But you can appreciate why we have
to be so thorough in these matters.

55
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:52,755
I will pass your claim
along to the review board,

56
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:55,447
and you can expect a decision
in the next month or so.

57
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:56,851
A month?

58
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:00,139
What am I supposed to do until then...
Hop around on one leg?

59
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:01,274
Just...

60
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,271
do your best.

61
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:28,425
Answer it.

62
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,060
- Hello?
- Hey.

63
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:37,071
What are you doing?

64
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:38,244
I'm calling you

65
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,648
from FBI headquarters in Virginia
because I miss you.

66
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,112
And I'm very sweet.

67
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,592
- You miss me, huh?
- I do.

68
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:49,496
- Who's that?
- What?

69
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,438
Do you have a girl in your room?

70
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:02,068
This long-Distance thing is hard.

71
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:05,222
I mean, this internship is
the opportunity of a lifetime,

72
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:07,684
and I couldn't be
enjoying it more, but...

73
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,372
I so wish I could be with you right now.

74
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,366
Well, how about that?

75
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,463
It's like I never left.

76
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:29,414
- Yeah, those 12 weeks just flew by.
- No

77
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:33,011
they didn't. They took forever.

78
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:38,480
All those weeks of thinking
about you, and...

79
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,903
and missing you...

80
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:43,172
and all those

81
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:45,326
pent-up feelings.

82
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,191
What am I ever gonna do
with all of them?

83
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:50,114
I have a couple...

84
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:52,078
million suggestions.

85
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:01,002
So,

86
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:03,175
what are these suggestions?

87
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:05,672
Oh, you know, you don't need them.

88
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,557
Does it involve me...

89
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:12,537
Doing a sort of
dance-squad-like routine?

90
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:14,807
Perhaps a cheer?

91
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:21,999
- Actually, it does.
- I was kidding.

92
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:23,134
Then no.

93
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:28,372
Did it involve me being naked?

94
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:30,526
It did.

95
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,051
If I'm understanding you correctly,

96
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:41,859
a student I.D. card
is basically like money.

97
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:44,590
Exactly. Kids can
buy stuff anywhere on campus...

98
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:46,949
The cateria, the bookstore, you name it.

99
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:49,370
So if they're using fake student I.D.s,

100
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,869
they're using fake money,
which makes this fraud.

101
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:52,734
Right.

102
00:05:52,814 --> 00:05:56,177
And if these students you've apprehended
made the fake I.D.s themselves,

103
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:59,361
conspiracy to commit.
So, you want me to bring them in?

104
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:02,496
The studts've already been dealt with.
They've been placed on probation,

105
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:04,802
and the families have agreed
to repay the stolen funds.

106
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,457
That sounds...

107
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:09,800
- lenient.
- There's no dungeon in the ivory tower.

108
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:13,454
Both kids claim they bought
the I.D.s from this man.

109
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:14,896
He's not a Hearst student,

110
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:17,832
and the Hearst police ain't
in the business of prosecuting felons.

111
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:19,236
I'll take care of it.

112
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:20,659
Number four.

113
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,159
You sure?

114
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,755
I'm sure.

115
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:28,268
Hey, come on.

116
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,479
Step right in here, son. Take your time.

117
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:37,742
Number four.

118
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:43,447
- You'll testify to that fact?
- Yeah. That's definitely him.

119

~ seriessub ~

124
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:33,003
I wish you weren't sitting
across from me right now, Eli.

125
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,369
I shouldn't be, sheriff.

126
00:07:34,462 --> 00:07:37,520
Two dean's-list college students
picked you out of a lineup.

127
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:40,116
Your being an ex-con
isn't gonna help things.

128
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:41,828
Do I get a phone call?

129
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,956
What's Veronica's number?

130
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,689
Veronica,

131
00:07:58,035 --> 00:07:59,554
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

132
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:00,881
Where you at?

133
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:03,847
I tried you on your cell, but maybe
you got it turned off or something.

134
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,597
Hey, lucky for me,
your dad's a cool guy,

135
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,862
'cause he gave me another
chance at this. Anyway...

136
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:09,700
reason I'm calling is...

137
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:13,322
I need a bail bondsman
and a private investigator,

138
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:16,284
and you need a 21st-century
answering machine!

139
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:20,272
Hey!

140
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:27,175
- Weevil, you're wobbling.
- Yeah, and I'm gonna take the fall...

141
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:30,307
Unless you can help me.
I've already lost my job 'cause of this.

142
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:32,211
Dad says it's a fraud case?

143
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,493
Exactly, and you know how
I feel about white-collar crime.

144
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,531
They're saying I busted
into the bursar's office

145
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:40,358
and made a couple fake ID. cards
and stuck a bunch of cash on them.

146
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,397
- And you're saying?
- I don't even know what a bursar is.

147
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:45,467
That office where
you pick up your paycheck?

148
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:47,140
It says "bursar" on it?

149
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:49,544
- That's the bursar.
- Who says it was you?

150
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,679
A couple college kids
pulled me out of a lineup.

151
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:54,717
- Why do you think they fingered you?
- 'Cause I'm easy...

152
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:56,537
easy like sunday morning...

153
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,843
ex-con and all.

154
00:08:58,923 --> 00:09:01,575
Except they'd have to
know you were an ex-con.

155
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,016
Have you been going around campus

156
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:04,960
sharing the story
of your personal journey?

157
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:07,857
Only in your criminology class
when you asked me to.

158
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:14,165
Oh, yeah, right.

159
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:28,421
Pell applications are on the right.
Change of address cards are...

160
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,921
Actually, I'm a private investigator.

161
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:33,754
I'm working for Eli Navarro.

162
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:36,119
I'd like to ask you
some questions about I.D.s.

163
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:38,004
I'm sorry. You're a what?

164
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,927
- I'm a private investigator.
- How old are you?

165
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:42,100
I'm 19.

166
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,716
So, can you tell me
how student I.D.s work?

167
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:48,421
Oh, well, exactly like debit cards.

168
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:50,555
Each term, students can
add money to their account

169
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:52,728
that can be drawn upon
by any campus vendor.

170
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:55,630
I collect the cash and infuse
the cards with their new limit.

171
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:58,533
And you've got the only machine
on campus that can program the cards?

172
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,649
Yeah.

173
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:02,237
The company who makes them,
magneta-corp,

174
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:05,219
only leases the machines
to institutions like colleges.

175
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,294
If it breaks down
or needs to be serviced,

176
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,601
we have to send it all back to Marietta,
Georgia, to get it reprogrammed.

177
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:13,290
- Thanks for holding my check, Karin.
- Oh, no problem Ross.

178
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,749
For what it's worth, I happen
to know your client, mr. Navarro,

179
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:18,518
has access to my office.

180
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,937
He let me in once
when I locked myself out.

181
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,553
- So, you're working for Eli Navarro.
- You know him?

182
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:27,346
Yeah, he tried to feed me
a bogus workman's comp claim.

183
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:30,481
I'd say that your client could
use further rehabilitation.

184
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:33,656
Thanks.

185
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:36,154
Thanks for your time, miss.

186
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:40,592
One more thing... How did you know
that the fakes were fakes?

187
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,033
We didn't. One of our food-court workers

188
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:46,015
noticed a number of
suspicious names on student i.D.S.

189
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:49,282
She started a watch list,
eventually handed it over.

190
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:51,195
Sounds like my kind of girl.

191
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:59,450
- Jalisa Jones?
- That's me.

192
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:02,277
You're the one
who discovered the fake I.D.s, right?

193
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:04,901
Hearst college must have been grateful.

194
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:08,478
They offered to put a statue of me
in the middle of the quad.

195
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:12,497
So, what made you think that
the names on the cards were aliases?

196
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:25,819
"Niels Bohr, Sylvia Plath,
Leonardo Fibonacci, Honus Wagner"?

197
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:28,413
Just because I didn't go
to a school with a water polo team

198
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:30,685
doesn't mean I don't know
who Fibonacci is.

199
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,282
Who wouldn't know?

200
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:36,099
Greatest european mathematician
of the middle ages.

201
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:37,379
Yeah, of course.

202
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,898
Do me a favor...

203
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:41,680
Give me a call
if any of the other names pop up.

204
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:44,527
Sure, but after Sylvia Plath
and Honus Wagner

205
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:46,738
got busted, the others stopped coming.

206
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:52,488
I just got an e-mail
saying I got a $50 fine

207
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:54,565
for a lost book
I've never even heard of.

208
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:56,642
- Name?
- Abigail Montgomery.

209
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,435
Oh, you're cool. No fine.

210
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,512
- What?
- I'm a private investigator.

211
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:06,955
I've been hired by Eli Navarro
to find out who's making the fake I.D.s.

212
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:08,682
Is this a joke?

213
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:11,989
I'm bona fide.

214
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,733
So, what, you're working undercover
at the help desk or something?

215
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:18,637
More moonlighting.
Tell me how you met my client.

216
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,422
Last thursday,
I went to pay for my lunch,

217
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,211
and the teller told me
I was out of money.

218
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:28,801
I was standing there with my burrito
and fruit cup, totally humiliated.

219
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:31,181
Later that afternoon,
this guy comes up to me and

220
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:33,970
offers to sell me
a $1,000 card for 100 bucks.

221
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:35,775
- And so you paid him?
- Yeah.

222
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,524
He asked for a fake name, and...
told me to meet him the next day

223
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:41,006
in the basement of
the history building at 1:00.

224
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:43,565
I showed up. He handed me the card.

225
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:47,353
You know, I didn't want to
do something dishonest.

226
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:49,988
It's not like I can stop eating.

227
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:53,993
And believe me,
I hated turning in that janitor guy.

228
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:57,125
I'm sure he's got kids
to feed or something.

229
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:27,113
Excuse me,

230
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:30,652
who do I talk to about library fines?
I got an e-mail.

231
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,536
Let's forget about the fine.

232
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:37,152
I just need to ask you a few questions.

233
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,383
Hey. So, what'd you learn?

234
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:46,549
I learned you're in a battle
with Hearst over workman's comp.

235
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:49,972
Yeah. They were giving me the runaround,
and now that I've been fired,

236
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:51,780
they're refusing to pay altogether.

237
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:54,886
Any chance you decided to get even by

238
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:56,982
taking what they owed you?

239
00:13:57,117 --> 00:13:58,156
No.

240
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:00,211
Both witnesses...

241
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:03,961
The bright-Eyed, freshly
scrubbed types juries love...

242
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:07,880
Claim you met them at 1:00
in the basement of the history building.

243
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:10,284
1:00? That's my lunch break.

244
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,220
Which you spend daily
with your co-workers,

245
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,720
all of whom will eagerly vouch for you?

246
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,791
Which I usually spend
in my car, napping.

247
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,637
Sheriff!

248
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:24,291
My bail come through?

249
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:26,631
Yep. You're free to go.

250
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:28,150
Excellent.

251
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:31,456
But I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

252
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,452
That machine in the bursar's office...

253
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:37,894
Campus cops just found an identical one
in the empty locker next to yours.

254
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,298
Talk to your public defender, Eli.

255
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,945
The best deal you're gonna get is
the one they're offering now.

256
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,851
This is your end-of-term project?

257
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:03,241
I should have been an aerospace major.

258
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:06,722
A 1/32 model of
an amphibious regional turboprop.

259
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,468
I call it the sea monkey.

260
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:13,174
Which would make more sense
if monkeys were amphibious...

261
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:15,155
- Or could fly.
- Trust me.

262
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:17,309
It makes perfect sense
when you're running on about

263
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:19,564
15 minutes sleep in the last week.

264
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,794
And here Piz thought you were spending
all your time with a secret girlfriend.

265
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,016
Only love life I have is some dude
who's always following me around.

266
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:28,563
- What, like you're being cruised?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,698
Remind me which color bandana
I'm supposed to wear

268
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:33,854
that says I'm straight...
but flattered and nonjudgmental.

269
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:35,799
- No idea who the guy is?
- None.

270
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:38,723
But I saw him take some of
my old homework out of the trash.

271
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:44,082
If he's a souvenir-taker, it's easy.
Just leave some tantalizing bait...

272
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,851
I'd suggest your
cut off jean short-shorts...

273
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,371
And double back and watch him.

274
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:53,294
- And...
- Here's dr. Winkler. You're ready?

275
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:57,101
Magnetic stripe coercivity?

276
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:00,832
It's a fancy way of saying how hard
it is to copy a bank or a debit card.

277
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:03,755
A Hearst student I.D.
is quite simple, actually,

278
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:07,115
provided you work at the CIA
and have access to a supercomputer.

279
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:10,942
- You know how digital codes work?
- A bunch of ones and zeroes and stuff?

280
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:13,784
A student I.D. takes your name,
I.D. number, balance, whatever

281
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,763
and stores it on a magnetic strip.

282
00:16:15,878 --> 00:16:18,089
But they also insert
an encrypted signature

283
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:21,643
that prohibits from making a counterfeit
or making changes to the card.

284
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:25,295
How super does a computer
have to be to crack an encrypted card?

285
00:16:25,391 --> 00:16:27,405
There's one in the physics lab.
Of course,

286
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,619
they won't let you touch it
unless you have a phd.

287
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:32,481
We lowly mechanical engineers
had to build our own... Daisy.

288
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:35,794
So, what are the odds on
a maintenance worker with a G.E.D.

289
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,756
- getting time on Daisy?
- Wouldn't matter.

290
00:16:37,852 --> 00:16:40,313
Someone would have to write
the software, wait for it to run.

291
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:42,909
Even if someone had the machine
that made the original I.D.s?

292
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:44,813
That would simplify things.

293
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:47,260
Maybe you should talk to Leon,
one of my grad students.

294
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:49,856
Guy just got a paper
published on cryptography.

295
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:52,292
Where might I find this Leon?

296
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:55,657
Here, just not while the sun's up.
Leon's part vampire.

297
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,725
What's the big deal?

298
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:02,648
- I didn't say it was a big deal.
- Then ask him.

299
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:04,590
I suspect your radio career

300
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:08,013
will put you across the mike from
bigger fish than small-town sheriffs.

301
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:11,346
I'm not intimidated about asking the
local sheriff to be on my show, okay?

302
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:14,423
I'm intimidated about asking
the father of the girl

303
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:16,135
whose body is...

304
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,654
as much as it kills me
to quote John Mayer...

305
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,058
a wonderland.

306
00:17:20,154 --> 00:17:21,193
All right?

307
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:30,905
What happened to the courtesy knock?

308
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:35,367
What happened to whalebone corsets
and courting chaperones?

309
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:37,912
Who wants falafel?

310
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,070
Uh, mr. Mars...

311
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,592
Could you come down to Hearst tomorrow?

312
00:17:45,707 --> 00:17:48,226
I'd like you on my show.
I'm doing an election special.

313
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:51,572
Hearst's 4,000 votes could go a long way
to determining the election.

314
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:54,553
I don't know, Stosh.
My schedule's pretty tight.

315
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:57,034
It's just... I mean,
I wouldn't want Vinnie Van Lowe

316
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,913
getting all the airtime without
giving you a chance to rebut, you know.

317
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,933
- What time is the show?
- Bright and early... 8:00.

318
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,561
Fine. If you think Vinnie is willing
to miss his morning cartoons,

319
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:11,365
- I'll be there.
-As long as you're in a munificent mood,

320
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,980
how about buying the office
a new answering machine?

321
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:16,269
- Munificent?
- What's wrong with the old one?

322
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:19,074
The yoders have one just like it.

323
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:21,824
- Who are the yoders?
- The amish family in 3b.

324
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:26,721
You may have gone digital,
but I remain firmly analog.

325
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,680
No, I'm digital.

326
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:30,795
You remain firmly cheap.

327
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:34,174
My day was fine.
How was yours, Veronica?

328
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:37,116
Proved Weevil didn't do it.

329
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:40,308
Honey, I don't think
you can let Eli off the hook.

330
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:43,575
I talked to
a mechanical engineering prof.

331
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:44,805
He said

332
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:49,263
it would be impossible for Weevil to
program the machine you found in his...

333
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:51,815
- What?
- We dusted the box.

334
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:55,103
It's covered with Eli's prints...

335
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,142
Only Eli's.

336
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:03,481
You wanna know if someone could
make a counterfeit Hearst student I.D.?

337
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,423
Dr. Winkler says you're
the real expert here at Hearst.

338
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:09,154
Dr. Winkler said that?

339
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:14,491
So...

340
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:18,203
Possibly, but that someone
would need an awful lot of smarts.

341
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:20,101
Here.

342
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:22,775
You're more than welcome
to look in my...

343
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,494
What the hell?

344
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:26,771
What is it?

345
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:29,436
All my research materials...
They're gone.

346
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:30,879
Someone stole them.

347
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:38,740
We're back,
and we've got sheriff candidates

348
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:41,028
Keith Mars and Vinnie Van Lowe in studio

349
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:43,624
telling us why they deserve
to be your chief lawman.

350
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,207
As you might not be surprised to hear,
a big issue with Hearst students

351
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:50,612
is the recent crackdown
on underage drinking in off-campus bars.

352
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:53,266
- That's his thing... Don't look at me.
- The legal drinking age

353
00:19:53,382 --> 00:19:56,994
is 21 for a reason.
I plan to continue enforcing it.

354
00:19:57,074 --> 00:19:59,129
Know what laws I plan to enforce?

355
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:03,513
The important ones,
like murder and terrorism.

356
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:07,340
These aren't just the subjects
of our favorite movies and tv shows.

357
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,778
These are the things that threaten us
here and now In Neptune, okay?

358
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:14,452
Once those things are taken care of,

359
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:18,394
maybe I'll have time
to drop in on campus-area bars...

360
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
For a cold one.

361
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:29,726
Line one, you have a question
for either of our candidates?

362
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,187
<i>For sheriff Mars,</i>

363
00:20:31,283 --> 00:20:33,071
- <i>this one's a two-parter.</i>
- Shoot.

364
00:20:33,185 --> 00:20:35,493
<i>First, why do you suck?</i>

365
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:38,724
<i>And the second part...
What's it like to suck so hard?</i>

366
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:38,759
Dude, hey, look, man,
I don't know what you...

367
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,489
Are you familiar with The Castle?

368
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:44,008
I've heard of it.

369
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:45,412
Wallace Fennel,

370
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:50,278
I've been authorized to inform you
that you've been tapped for admission.

371
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:51,874
If you tell anyone,

372
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,907
your invitation will be rescinded,
and there will be consequences.

373
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,734
Do you accept?

374
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,594
If we're assuming someone's framing you,
they had only 24 hours...

375
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,228
- to get...
- If we're assuming?

376
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,166
If we're not assuming, then
I guess we're assuming that I did it,

377
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:13,007
which means that I hired you
to get to the bottom of my own crime?

378
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:15,241
That's a pretty dumb assumption,
don't you think?

379
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:17,257
Touchy. I'll rephrase.

380
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:20,078
Whoever framed you had 24 hours

381
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:22,270
to get your fingerprints
on the ringer I.D. machine.

382
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,866
We need to retrace your steps.

383
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:27,424
Try and remember everything you touched
the day before you got busted.

384
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:30,133
A day in the life
of Weevil's hands, huh?

385
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:32,453
Let's see. I woke up,
I hopped in the shower...

386
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:35,201
What say we fast-forward
to your day on campus?

387
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:36,434
No problem.

388
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:39,684
First call was the radio station.
Deejay blew a fuse.

389
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,565
Did you happen to see this?

390
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:46,444
It's the I.D. machine
they found next to your stuff.

391
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,675
Well, that box does not look familiar.

392
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:53,963
Let's take a little field trip,
see if we can't jog your memory.

393
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:58,649
Fine, but you're gonna have
to slow your ass down.

394
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:06,314
<i>Let's say you got
two calls at the same time.</i>

395
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:09,409
<i>One was for, let's say,
a kidnapping in progress,</i>

396
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:12,563
<i>but the other involves
a 20-year-old having a beer.</i>

397
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,429
<i>Which call would you take first?</i>

398
00:23:14,615 --> 00:23:17,961
I think this ground has been
well-covered by candidate Mars.

399
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:20,845
I, for one, think
we should hear his answer.

400
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:24,822
I'd respond to
the kidnapping call first.

401
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:30,661
Let's talk a little bit about
law-enforcement experience.

402
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:32,971
- I'm glad you bring that up, Stosh.
- As am I.

403
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:35,099
I first learned
law-enforcement techniques

404
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:38,215
while serving in this
great country's armed forces.

405
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:41,849
During my stint in the military police,
I saw crime drop

406
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:45,131
20% across U.S. military bases.

407
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:47,706
And you believe you were
responsible for that drop?

408
00:23:47,786 --> 00:23:48,804
I did my part.

409
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,411
And was that before
your dishonorable discharge?

410
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:53,221
Did this campaign just go negative?

411
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,586
- I thought we had an agreement here.
- That's fine.

412
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:57,891
The kid gloves are off now, Keith. Okay,

413
00:23:57,988 --> 00:24:00,988
in the past two years
of tranquility in Neptune

414
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,734
under the steady watch of
sheriff Don Lamb, citizen Mars

415
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:09,152
was cited six times for infractions
ranging from impersonating a law-

416
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:12,094
enforcement officer
to withholding evidence.

417
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:14,936
His comely daughter, a Hearst student,

418
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,263
was arrested twice in that time.

419
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:21,011
The question isn't whether
sheriff Mars can clean up Neptune.

420
00:24:21,485 --> 00:24:24,639
It's... Can sheriff Mars clean up
his own household?

421
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:28,754
Uh, well, we'll pick up where
we left off right after this.

422
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:37,726
So, I walked in here like this,
sat in that chair over there...

423
00:24:37,841 --> 00:24:39,571
Mr. Navarro, might
I ask what you're doing?

424
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,089
I talked with the human resources suit
for a couple minutes.

425
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:44,203
- Get out of my office.
- You touch anything,

426
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,490
- pick anything up?
- No, I don't think so.

427
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,890
You were fired, okay? You are not
permitted on Hearst property.

428
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:51,678
- I'm calling security.
- Wait a minute.

429
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:54,790
I did pick up an envelope
on the suit's desk.

430
00:24:54,905 --> 00:24:58,858
It had his home address on it.
I'm not sure what good that'll do me.

431
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:03,470
- Anything else?
- Nah.

432
00:25:07,912 --> 00:25:09,624
Hi. You remember me...
Earlier this week?

433
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,567
- Yeah, the sink guy.
- I think I left a tool

434
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:14,221
- when I was fixing your drain.
- Mind if we take a look around?

435
00:25:14,336 --> 00:25:15,605
No problem. Come on in.

436
00:25:18,898 --> 00:25:21,071
- The sink's worked great.
- What can I say?

437
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,840
I take pride in what I do.

438
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:28,878
Veronica, the last time I was here,
they had a bunch of crap under the sink.

439
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:31,432
I had to move it all out of the way
to get at the drain, but

440
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:33,298
I didn't pay attention
to what I was moving.

441
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:35,855
My roommate tried to dump
ramen down the sink.

442
00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:37,567
She's such a blonde.

443
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:45,063
You could have left your prints
on the box without even knowing it.

444
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:48,736
Hey, that message from Joey
on the board, did he leave it...

445
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:54,512
Hi, there. I'm Veronica.
Aren't you in my criminology class?

446
00:25:55,293 --> 00:25:57,774
You remember my friend Eli, right?

447
00:25:57,947 --> 00:26:01,659
From class? Your talk was so...

448
00:26:01,774 --> 00:26:02,926
edifying.

449
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:04,196
I get that a lot.

450
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,927
So, what are you up to now?

451
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:09,020
- Oh, he thinks he left a tool behind.
- His tools are his livelihood.

452
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:11,251
What'd you do with the stuff
you had under the sink?

453
00:26:11,347 --> 00:26:14,463
- I love your hair.
- Thanks.

454
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:19,365
Do you mind if I take a picture of you

455
00:26:19,481 --> 00:26:22,769
- for my stylist?
- I guess not.

456
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,423
Say "cheese."

457
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,718
Super.

458
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:34,775
We've got what we need, Eli.

459
00:26:35,487 --> 00:26:37,083
I'll see you in class.

460
00:26:41,748 --> 00:26:44,042
Your stylist? What was that all about?

461
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:45,235
Walk me to work.

462
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:47,863
I'll show you what
the inside of a library looks like.

463
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,169
I thought you
were supposed to be good at this.

464
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:54,458
- She's out of focus.
- Easy, Sleazy.

465
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,611
You're looking at the wrong thing.

466
00:26:56,717 --> 00:26:59,929
I didn't care about her.
It's the picture behind her

467
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:02,352
Watch closely now.

468
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,025
Look who we have here.

469
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,814
It's the girl from my criminology class.

470
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:09,820
We knew that 20 minutes ago.

471
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:12,647
There's our Sylvia Plath.

472
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:15,070
She pulled you out of a line up.

473
00:27:15,205 --> 00:27:18,971
And this is the guy who actually
knows how to program the cards.

474
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:22,775
I'd bet one of these guys in masks
is our Honus Wagner.

475
00:27:23,773 --> 00:27:25,542
- We got them.
- Question...

476
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:28,615
Do you want to just
get yourself off the hook, or...

477
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:32,557
do you want to take all these Aspen
ski bums down at the same time?

478
00:27:32,939 --> 00:27:34,958
How are we gonna I.D. the others?

479
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:37,123
You leave that to me.

480
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:40,279
And I've got all
the frequent-flier miles we need.

481
00:27:40,914 --> 00:27:43,298
Come out every
other weekend if you want.

482
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:44,837
Who you talking to?

483
00:27:44,926 --> 00:27:46,657
- Parker.
- Parker?

484
00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:48,542
I don't even know her!

485
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:51,311
Sorry about that. That was Dick.

486
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:53,407
He's gearing up for finals.

487
00:27:56,229 --> 00:27:57,363
Hey Logan.

488
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:00,956
The night my brother
jumped off the roof, did you, like...

489
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:02,475
try and stop him?

490
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:06,838
I got to call you back.

491
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,742
Yeah, bye.

492
00:28:13,062 --> 00:28:14,812
Everything okay, Dick?

493
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:18,312
I duct-taped him to his bike,

494
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,883
his feet to the pedals.

495
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:22,823
He was maybe 10, and I just
left him out there on the cul-de-sac.

496
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:24,787
Forgot about him for hours.

497
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:26,594
I went outside,

498
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:28,861
and there he was,
still riding around in circles.

499
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:31,681
Dick, I'm not sure if spending
happy hours with your dad

500
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:34,124
is the best way to deal with all this.

501
00:28:35,621 --> 00:28:38,217
Tomorrow we'll catch a few waves.

502
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:40,579
We'll get you back on a board.

503
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:43,636
- You'll see things clear.
- Yeah, okay.

504
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,425
That sounds sweet.

505
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:48,233
But I'm inviting 24 little buddies

506
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:51,735
just in case I don't like
what I see when things are clear.

507
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:58,704
Hey, isn't that your photo?

508
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:01,756
"I met this great
group of people from Hearst

509
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:04,358
skiing over christmas break,
but I didn't get their names,

510
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:06,618
and I'd like to track them down.

511
00:29:06,714 --> 00:29:11,003
If you know who they are,
please e-mail vmars@aol.com."

512
00:29:12,285 --> 00:29:13,400
Freaky!

513
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:16,862
Do you want me to
jot down that e-mail address?

514
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:24,417
What?

515
00:29:25,186 --> 00:29:27,455
Miss Mars uses venus razor.

516
00:29:27,562 --> 00:29:30,446
Because if she doesn't,
her legs look like Pluto's.

517
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,696
And she's down-to-earth, to boot.

518
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:36,228
I think I read in teen people
that a clean leg shave

519
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:39,671
will make that special boy
sit up and take notice.

520
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:42,417
I read in FHM
that boys like bare breasts.

521
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,724
Interesting.

522
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,705
I did not know that.

523
00:29:46,705 --> 00:29:48,436
Bare breasts, you say?

524
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,543
Jeez, what does
that thing run on, nail polish?

525
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:58,273
- It's a methanol-oil mixture.
- That's why I drive a Saturn hybrid.

526
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:01,594
Hey, did anyone else hear there's gonna
be a matchbox twenty reunion show?

527
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:04,466
So? Rob Thomas is a whore.

528
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:05,584
Yeah.

529
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:08,834
Hey, you never told me what happened
with your whole man-crush thing.

530
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,819
- Wallace has a man crush?
- The man crush isn't me, is it?

531
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:14,165
Some guy following him around campus.

532
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:16,486
- Is it Piz?
- All right, now, it was...

533
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,369
nothing, you know?

534
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,794
It was just nothing.

535
00:30:20,678 --> 00:30:23,524
Man, this new wet
suit's like a cheap motel.

536
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:25,001
No ballroom.

537
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:30,957
So, what's the protocol
for a plane christening?

538
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:33,435
I mean, does someone
get to, like, smash the

539
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,625
Sea Monkey with
a miniature bottle of champagne?

540
00:30:35,705 --> 00:30:39,432
The protocol... Pray to whatever
god you believe in she flies.

541
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:41,990
Otherwise, my ass is grass.

542
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:45,467
Orville Wright's
exact words, if I recall.

543
00:30:46,236 --> 00:30:47,519
I'm so nervous.

544
00:30:47,942 --> 00:30:49,729
This is totally
knotting up my inner nerd.

545
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:51,711
Wait, you have an inner one?

546
00:31:11,517 --> 00:31:13,017
- We're up!
- Yes!

547
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:24,217
Hey, look, a toy plane.

548
00:31:25,737 --> 00:31:27,294
Don't touch the plane.

549
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:30,183
Hey, hey, look
who's sunbathing at the beach.

550
00:31:30,414 --> 00:31:31,734
What's up, hot legs?

551
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,734
Score one for teen people.

552
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:35,730
Hey, we're blowing off
a little dead-week steam

553
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,308
- if you kids want to hang.
- We can't. We're helping Wallace.

554
00:31:38,388 --> 00:31:41,386
Actually, Wallace needs
a little time to himself.

555
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:51,461
I feel so bad for Wallace.

556
00:31:51,654 --> 00:31:53,269
He needs more thrust.

557
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:56,019
Don't say it.

558
00:31:57,565 --> 00:31:59,161
That's what she said.

559
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:03,925
I think I'm gonna go help Wallace.

560
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:07,464
Hey, Mac, wait up.

561
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:17,047
I know you and me
haven't always been, like,

562
00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:19,697
best buds, but, do you want to know why?

563
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,430
- Not really.
- 'Cause

564
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,739
you were both so smart, you and Beav.

565
00:32:23,987 --> 00:32:25,410
And I could tell, you know, that

566
00:32:25,506 --> 00:32:28,794
you thought I was an idiot,
so I figured my best bet was to...

567
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:31,618
You know how a best defense
is a good offense?

568
00:32:31,714 --> 00:32:33,002
So, I thought...

569
00:32:34,592 --> 00:32:37,361
The way I treated you
and beav was totally uncool,

570
00:32:37,477 --> 00:32:39,746
And I'm totally sorry
for all those things I said.

571
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:41,185
Yeah. Okay.

572
00:32:41,282 --> 00:32:44,608
- Accepted.
- It's cool. You're so cool.

573
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,471
I get it now what my brother saw in you.

574
00:32:52,984 --> 00:32:54,927
Don't tell Logan, okay?

575
00:32:58,004 --> 00:33:00,244
You know, a couple of
my high-school friends surfed.

576
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,456
They'd drive down to
Sunnyside early in the morning,

577
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:04,923
but I always had to work
these crappy jobs over the summer.

578
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:06,793
It must have been cool
growing up down here.

579
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:08,763
It must have been great working.

580
00:33:11,184 --> 00:33:13,088
That's what makes you so real, Piz,

581
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,626
so salt-of-the-earth.
My life, on the other hand... Frivolous.

582
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:19,453
- No, that's not what I was saying.
- You're right. Not frivolous...

583
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:21,318
Full of frivolity.

584
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:24,613
You hear that, Veronica? The subtext?

585
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:27,594
Piz worked for a living
while I frittered my days away.

586
00:33:27,844 --> 00:33:29,133
Impressed?

587
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:30,781
I'm not impressed right now.

588
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:32,956
- What's your problem, man?
- Fundamentally,

589
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:35,511
I guess it's that I lack
a working man's backbone.

590
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:36,818
Logan, enough.

591
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,261
Wallace got it working.

592
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:46,242
We should get back.

593
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,979
<i>Looks like someone's main squeeze
is from Marietta, Georgia,</i>

594
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:11,941
<i>the same town where
they make the Magneta-Corp machine.</i>

595
00:34:12,038 --> 00:34:15,266
<i>And guess whose dad is
an executive at Magneta-Corp?</i>

596
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:17,538
I guess you know who I am by now.

597
00:34:17,711 --> 00:34:20,112
Wild guess... Patrick Nickerson.

598
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:23,554
There's some people we want you to meet.

599
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:06,343
I guess you're all asking yourself
why I called this meeting.

600
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,785
What? That's comedy gold.

601
00:35:10,285 --> 00:35:11,958
She knows about my dad's company.

602
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:16,296
And I know that Leon's cryptography
research wasn't really stolen.

603
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,967
Let's see, one guy to steal the machine,

604
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:22,735
one guy to program it,

605
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:26,927
and everyone to point the finger
at the ex-con maintenance guy.

606
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,882
And the injustice league strikes again.

607
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:33,267
- Who are you calling?
- The surgeon general.

608
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:35,632
She's calling her dad, the sheriff.

609
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:36,899
Good call, Jenny.

610
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:39,091
See, you're not here
just for your looks.

611
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:41,373
Hang on. Please. We can work this out.

612
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:43,104
You can be one of us.

613
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,563
Is this where
you turn me into a vampire?

614
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,777
We can make it worth your while.

615
00:35:49,098 --> 00:35:50,790
All right, I'm listening.

616
00:35:50,886 --> 00:35:52,905
What is that maintenance guy
paying you, anyway?

617
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:54,596
- Cash.|- Don't turn us in,

618
00:35:54,676 --> 00:35:57,556
and you could have
your very own Hearst I.D.

619
00:35:57,653 --> 00:35:59,823
Oh, I have one, thanks.

620
00:35:59,903 --> 00:36:02,977
This one is the everlasting
gobstopper of spending money.

621
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,951
You'll never have to pay
for another textbook,

622
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:07,567
another ticket to
a campus performance, another meal.

623
00:36:07,663 --> 00:36:11,775
Assuming I want to eat meals in
the food court for the rest of my life?

624
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:14,964
Besides, you're lying.
You don't have the machine.

625
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,329
You left it in the locker
next to mr. Navarro's.

626
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,906
- There's a third one.
- I've already programmed it.

627
00:36:20,038 --> 00:36:23,019
The only reason we got busted
is because we used stupid aliases.

628
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:25,361
We get new cards, generic names,

629
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,265
|and we don't get caught again.

630
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,263
You're a scholarship kid, right?

631
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,378
Yeah, that must be pretty tough,
paying for all those meals, textbooks.

632
00:36:35,045 --> 00:36:36,083
It is...

633
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:38,696
which is why

634
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,502
a bunch of kids who
can afford to ski in Aspen

635
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:43,436
getting their kicks
by ripping off my school

636
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:46,207
and blaming it on the nearest kid
from the wrong side of the tracks

637
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,058
pisses me off so much.

638
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:50,036
You think that ski picture is proof?

639
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:52,055
That doesn't prove anything.

640
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:54,610
But this conversation does.

641
00:36:54,892 --> 00:36:56,469
<i>Hang on. Please,</i>

642
00:36:57,027 --> 00:36:59,315
<i>we can work this out, okay?
You can be one of us.</i>

643
00:36:59,603 --> 00:37:01,719
<i>Is this where you turn me
into a vampire?</i>

644
00:37:01,815 --> 00:37:03,392
<i>We can make it worth your while.</i>

645
00:37:03,527 --> 00:37:07,289
I won't bore you with the rest,
but I'll bet it means jail time.

646
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,077
Or, if you'd prefer,

647
00:37:09,174 --> 00:37:12,539
you can go throw yourself
at the mercy of the campus police.

648
00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:15,421
I'm sure they'll have more
mercy for you than my dad,

649
00:37:15,556 --> 00:37:19,014
particularly when he finds that
third machine in one of your dorm rooms.

650
00:37:19,129 --> 00:37:21,379
Like we'd keep it in a dorm room.

651
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:25,265
If I don't hear that
the charges against my client

652
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:27,027
have been dropped by tomorrow noon,

653
00:37:27,123 --> 00:37:28,910
I'm taking everything I've got

654
00:37:29,006 --> 00:37:31,889
to the finest law-enforcement
organization in Balboa County.

655
00:37:32,906 --> 00:37:36,483
And try and keep it down in here, okay?

656
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:38,040
It's the library.

657
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:52,932
Weevil, I need you to get to
the engineering lab right away.

658
00:37:53,025 --> 00:37:55,044
I think they're hiding
a third box there...

659
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,637
One that's functioning. I don't want
the ski patrol to destroy it.

660
00:38:17,122 --> 00:38:18,872
Dude, what are you doing?

661
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,430
Man, I'm not sure if
I should show you this.

662
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,076
What is it?

663
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,903
Well, you have to see it.

664
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:28,096
I can't say the words out loud.

665
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:31,516
It's cued up. Just hit the space bar.

666
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:35,513
<i>I so wish I could be with you right now.</i>

667
00:38:35,821 --> 00:38:37,206
That's Veronica.

668
00:38:37,757 --> 00:38:39,449
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

669
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:42,430
<i>Well how about that?</i>

670
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:44,353
And that's that Piz dude.

671
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:53,611
Yeah, here's the money.

672
00:38:53,717 --> 00:38:56,323
Not what I'd call bodacious, but firm

673
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,167
supple, pleasing to the eye.

674
00:38:58,247 --> 00:38:59,669
Where did you get this?

675
00:38:59,802 --> 00:39:01,340
It's going around in an e-mail.

676
00:39:01,453 --> 00:39:04,626
You think Veronica knew
there's a camera in the room?

677
00:39:05,665 --> 00:39:06,665
No.

678
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:10,170
Here's what this good catholic boy
could never get straight.

679
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:13,190
Good people go to heaven,
bad people go to hell,

680
00:39:13,286 --> 00:39:16,075
and the rest of us all go
to a place called purgatory.

681
00:39:16,171 --> 00:39:17,171
Really

682
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:18,611
What the hell's purgatory?

683
00:39:18,707 --> 00:39:20,764
It's just some place
where you have to suffer a lot

684
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:22,226
and strive to be better people.

685
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:24,957
I mean, isn't that just
life on earth all over again?

686
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:38,848
Come back here, you...

687
00:39:49,768 --> 00:39:53,050
Before I left the station,
I received word from the campus police

688
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,394
that a bunch of kids turned
themselves in for those fake I.D.s.

689
00:39:57,394 --> 00:40:00,215
Huh. They must have had
a collective crisis of conscience.

690
00:40:00,295 --> 00:40:02,198
Yeah. I bet that was it.

691
00:40:02,505 --> 00:40:03,717
What you got?

692
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,747
Who's cheap now?

693
00:40:16,074 --> 00:40:18,035
Speaking of El Diablo.

694
00:40:20,155 --> 00:40:24,559
Good news.
You're a free man, Eli Navarro.

695
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:26,155
They confessed.

696
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:30,019
- You find anything in the lab?
- Nothing here. No machine.

697
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:32,748
It was worth a shot.
It's okay. We don't need it.

698
00:40:32,828 --> 00:40:33,885
<i>Thanks, V.</i>

699
00:40:34,404 --> 00:40:36,289
Hey, I forget.

700
00:40:36,898 --> 00:40:38,378
Who owes who now?

701
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:41,590
You owe me, clearly.

702
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:44,032
- You sure about that?
- <i>Not really.</i>

703
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:46,158
Night, Weevil. Bye.

704
00:40:57,686 --> 00:41:00,398
Honey, can I see you in my office?

705
00:41:08,761 --> 00:41:10,569
You want to tell me what this is?

706
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:13,835
<i>Hang on. Please,</i>

707
00:41:14,335 --> 00:41:16,829
<i>we can work|this out, okay?
You can be one of us.</i>

708
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:19,021
<i>Is this where you turn
me into a vampire?</i>

709
00:41:19,137 --> 00:41:21,233
<i>We can make it worth your while.</i>

710
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,771
It's a confession. You can erase it.

711
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:26,964
Confession?
No one confessed to anything on there.

712
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:29,627
Fortunately, they didn't know that.

713
00:41:32,204 --> 00:41:33,223
Hello?

714
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:52,279
There's something you should know.

715
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,144
