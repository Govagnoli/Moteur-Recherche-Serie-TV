<i>Previously on Veronica Mars</i>

2
00:00:03,117 --> 00:00:05,689
She has attitude with certain teachers.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,498
She falls asleep in class.

4
00:00:07,499 --> 00:00:08,719
I can't see you anymore.

5
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:10,396
All here?

6
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:12,108
All here.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,847
They're all dead!
It just went straight off the cliff!

8
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:18,639
The bus crash...

9
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:20,670
it was meant for me.

10
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,600
It's a voice mail from one of the
students who died in the crash.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,480
She called just as the bus went over.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,633
<i>Hey, about next weekend...</i>

13
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:29,907
<i>Oh, god!</i>

14
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:32,990
The bus was sabotaged.

15
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,246
If that sound is an explosion,

16
00:00:34,345 --> 00:00:35,849
not only were those kids murdered,

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,483
but the guilty party is still at large.

18
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:51,898
Good morning, Veronica.

19
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,899
The school counselor 
would like to see you.

20
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:04,140
You were sleeping in class.

21
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,994
Mrs. Taft said she's reprimanded you

22
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:08,656
three times for wearing headphones

23
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:10,092
while she was teaching.

24
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:12,262
She's reading "The Golden Bowl"...

25
00:01:12,403 --> 00:01:13,867
aloud...

26
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:15,222
...with a fake english accent.

27
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:19,840
You were caught ripping down 
another student's poster.

28
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,234
Am I being followed?

29
00:01:23,244 --> 00:01:25,690
The student who made the poster 
would like to have her photos back.

30
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:29,954
Something you want to talk about?

31
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:33,473
Yeah, but Jennifer Love Hewitt
might be more qualified.

32
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:34,741
How's that?

33
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,065
I'm being haunted.

34
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:39,215
And she's the ghost whisperer.

35
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:40,668
These are the jokes.

36
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,330
Haunted?

37
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,629
Yeah, by the kids who died
in the bus crash.

38
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:46,865
I take it you don't see them?

39
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:50,334
-No, Veronica, I don't.
-Good. Neither do I.

40
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:53,618
Except come bedtime,

41
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:57,235
the second I close my eyes,
there they are...

42
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,221
acting like they're dying 
to tell me something.

43
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:05,714
We have Cervando,
the academically inclined P.C.H.Er...

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,615
Betina, Dick Casablancas' 
booty buddy...

45
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,671
Rhonda...

46
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:15,435
all I know about her so far

47
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,998
is that she called her friend
Michelle right before the crash.

48
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:21,405
Oh, Marcos,
of "Ahoy, Mateys!" fame...

49
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:23,275
he had a pirate radio show.

50
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,821
I've been listening to it nonstop,
hence the headphones.

51
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,533
And Peter,

52
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:32,476
who generously posted the details
of his unrequited gay love

53
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:34,223
on neptunepirateship.com.

54
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:36,054
So now we're like this.

55
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,716
And then there's Meg.

56
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:43,097
Actually,
you might be able to help.

57
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:46,853
What do you know about 
a janitor named Lucky?

58
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:48,205
Why?

59
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:50,712
Meg had a lot to say about him.

60
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:56,909
This is so cool.

61
00:02:57,529 --> 00:02:59,191
Yeah,
it's just dreamy.

62
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:00,965
I really want to spend eternity

63
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:03,225
like a plastic scuba diver
in someone's fish tank.

64
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:05,838
So, Meg,
what's with that guy, Lucky?

65
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:08,384
Your parents' friend from church?

66
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:12,165
Can't picture them wanting 
to set you up with someone.

67
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:16,234
They weren't outwardly setting us up.

68
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,505
They just kept having him
over for dinner

69
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:20,308
so he could talk about
his four months in Iraq

70
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:22,647
and how he took a shrapnel
in the ass for America.

71
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:25,717
He'd quote the bible.
They'd point out how great he was.

72
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,265
Fun, fun, fun.

73
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,731
But you thought he was creepy.

74
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:31,013
Have you been reading my e-mails?

75
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:36,759
My sister gave my computer files
to Duncan, not you.

76
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:38,900
Those are my personal,
intimate...

77
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:41,069
wait.

78
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:42,759
I forgot.

79
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:45,994
I'm dead.

80
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:49,099
In Veronica-land,
no pulse, no privacy.

81
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:52,401
I'm trying to help.

82
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:53,165
Look,

83
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:54,779
my parents think Lucky's a saint

84
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:56,649
because he sings hymns
with his eyes closed

85
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,019
and he helped my dad
move an air conditioner.

86
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,393
He's just a janitor at 
the high school he graduated from

87
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:04,361
who buys beer for guys like Logan
to hang on to his glory days.

88
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:07,837
But you know all this from my e-mails.

89
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:12,094
Veronica,
when did these dreams start?

90
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:14,457
A few days ago.

91
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,836
Michelle Thompson set up
this booth in the hallway.

92
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:19,893
She's trying to raise money 
to buy a yearbook spread

93
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:21,809
for every kid who died 
in the bus crash.

94
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:24,171
She's the one you should be talking to.

95
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:28,582
She has that wide-eyed 
"Margot Kidder in a bush" look.

96
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:30,300
Total nutjob.

97
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,412
I've already raised $200,

98
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:34,103
and I've only been doing it for a day.

99
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,426
You know,
if I raise enough,

100
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:37,862
I might be able to get 
one of those audio chips,

101
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:41,118
like the kind that play "happy 
birthday" when you open the card.

102
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,343
I know it's a bit much, but

103
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,969
wouldn't it be great to hear them
laughing and happy?

104
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,271
What did michelle mean about
hearing everybody laughing?

105
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:52,582
Her friend Rhonda
left a message for her

106
00:04:52,723 --> 00:04:54,642
right as she was going off the cliff.

107
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:56,846
I knew about that one.

108
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:57,576
That one?

109
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:00,766
Turns out, Rhonda called
Michelle's home first,

110
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,474
left a message there, too.

111
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,080
When michelle told me about it,

112
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:08,982
she said she could hear 
all the kids laughing on the bus.

113
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:10,489
So I asked if I could hear it.

114
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,700
I seriously cannot believe
you're missing this.

115
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,784
I know you can hear.

116
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:22,698
Betina. Hey, Betina!

117
00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:26,362
You ready for a little...
bow, chicka, wow, wow?

118
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:28,389
You need to call me.

119
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,086
Did you hear your friend Meg?

120
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:38,124
No, but I heard someone I know.

121
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:39,585
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:41,842
I guess it is upsetting.

123
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,970
More disturbing.

124
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:46,792
He wasn't on the bus.

125
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,375
You heard Dick Casablancas' voice.

126
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:50,745
Yep.

127
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:53,532
Even though there's no way he could
have been on the bus at the time.

128
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:55,757
Freaky, huh?

129
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:58,631
Did you tell your dad about this?

130
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:01,087
Funny you should ask.

131
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:04,214
Michelle, why aren't you picking up?
You big loser.

132
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:04,918
Rhonda?

133
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,847
I can't believe you bailed
on the field trip without telling me.

134
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:09,423
About next weekend...

135
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:11,961
Nooo !

136
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:17,273
I'm fine.

137
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,069
It was just a bad dream.

138
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:25,116
Did you watch "House of Wax" again?

139
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:27,679
You know that Hilton girl 
gives you nightmares.

140
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,061
Peter Ferrer...

141
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:35,765
Rhonda...

142
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:38,436
these are the kids who died on the bus.

143
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:40,554
Maybe this isn't 
the best bedtime reading.

144
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,302
Betina played these phone messages
from Dick for everyone on the bus.

145
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,723
This was in the cd player.

146
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:48,927
And how did it get here?

147
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:51,455
I willed it?

148
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:52,947
You snuck onto the bus?

149
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:54,164
Yeah, like you didn't?

150
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:54,925
Veronica.

151
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:56,807
Why didn't you tell me
about the drawing?

152
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:58,244
I didn't see a drawing.

153
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:01,258
I was on the bus for a minute
before security came in.

154
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,962
It was drawn on the back
of one of the bus seats.

155
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:18,342
"I am god"

156
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,820
"Because I have the power to put myself

157
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,297
and my classmates 
in individual coffins."

158
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:26,989
You think the person who drew
this is responsible for the crash?

159
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,736
I think it's possible.

160
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:30,623
The bus was brand-new.

161
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,102
There was no other graffiti.

162
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,919
Why nine tombstones?

163
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,402
Eight people were killed in the crash.

164
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:40,930
I guess the artist wasn't
expecting me to get off the bus.

165
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,279
Can I see the artwork?

166
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,916
Oh, my.

167
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,872
One of the kids who died
on the bus drew that.

168
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:00,799
I need to find out who.

169
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,394
<i>A long time ago,</i>

170
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:09,239
<i>We used to be friends but I</i>

171
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,882
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

172
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:16,375
<i>Come on, now, sugar!</i>

173
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:18,910
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

174
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:22,290
<i>Just remember me when</i>

175
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,628
<i>We used to be friends</i>

176
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,910
<i>A long time ago</i>

177
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:29,558
<i>We used to be friends</i>

178
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:34,094
<i>Veronica Mars 2x18
"I Am God"</i>

179
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:45,124
Yep, I have no idea what
compelled me to do that.

180
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:46,474
Is it because you're 5?

181
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:50,363
I'm a little punchy.
I haven't been sleeping.

182
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,519
Thoughts of me?

183
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,382
Hey, I get it.

184
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:54,646
Sometimes I'm up all night,
just thinking about myself.

185
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,936
Do you know a guy named Lucky?

186
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,321
He's one of the night janitors here.

187
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:01,546
Tommy Dominick?
Yeah.

188
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:02,560
Why "Lucky"?

189
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:04,898
Well, he graduates,

190
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,419
and his parents file chapter 11.

191
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,053
He has to drop out of college.

192
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:10,308
He signs up for army rangers.

193
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:12,927
He gets sent to iraq.
And four months in,

194
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,825
he gets shot.

195
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:17,942
And that makes him lucky?

196
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,417
Hey, they shot him in the butt.
It could be worse.

197
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:23,110
You met him, too,
you know.

198
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:25,841
Remember?

199
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:29,514
<i>[Sia - "Breathe Me" (Four Tet mix)]

201
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:40,279
Hey, Logan.

202
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,575
Is there a point to this story?

203
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:42,653
Will you let me finish?

204
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:45,080
Sheesh.

205
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:51,489
<i>Ouch I have lost myself again</i>

206
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:55,832
Oh, good.
We have an audience.

207
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,596
Okay, lover boy, that's enough
face-sucking for now.

208
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:04,583
We have things to do.

209
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:07,934
You're on a tight schedule 
of smoking pot and playing "Halo".

210
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:09,230
I can't wait to graduate.

211
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:09,991
Come on, man.

212
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,173
We're done screwing around.

213
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,203
The ball's in our court.
Someone's got to pay.

214
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:14,869
But after we make someone pay,

215
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,589
we're gonna get high 
and play "Halo," right?

216
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,635
Get it together, Dick.

217
00:10:19,456 --> 00:10:20,565
90 seconds.

218
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:21,748
Wrap this up.

219
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:22,720
I'll be there when I'm there.

220
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:26,199
<i>Hold me...</i>

221
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:29,045
Remind me...
why did we break up?

222
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:31,080
You thought the other
guy had greener grass.

223
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:34,426
Or was it something about
me being too much man?

224
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:36,100
No, wait!

225
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,963
It was you.
You were too much man.

226
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:44,727
Hey! Hey!

227
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:46,580
As I was saying,

228
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:49,154
each team will design a device
to protect an egg

229
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:50,956
dropped from increasing heights.

230
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:53,896
The pair whose egg survives
the highest drop

231
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:55,880
will earn an "A"

232
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:02,236
Plus the team will be excused from
mr. Wu's notorious, GPA-killin'...

233
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:05,398
...final exam.

234
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:08,302
Mr. Wu must really like 
his egg-drop soup.

235
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:11,628
Uh, does this assignment
come with pot sticker?

236
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:12,695
Students!

237
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:18,837
This experiment is a major test grade.

238
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,856
For some of you,

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,669
it means passing this class or not.

240
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:26,812
Dude,
is mr. Wu hitting on me?

241
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:29,159
Okay, people,
that does it.

242
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:31,099
I'm assigning 
your partners alphabetically.

243
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,085
Dick, it's bad idea for you and 
mr. Echolls to be working together.

244
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:35,920
So bad it's good?

245
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,836
No.

246
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,742
God, I don't know
how I'm gonna quit you.

247
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:43,052
Shh!

248
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:45,822
It's not me.
It's Wu.

249
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,317
Dick Casablancas,
your new partner's Angie Dahl.

250
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,116
Score!

251
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:53,435
Logan Echolls,
you'll join Wallace Fennell.

252
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:57,898
Gentleman Dick at your service.

253
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,231
Foot massage?

254
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:00,373
Coconut-oil rubdown?

255
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:01,557
Just stay out of my way.

256
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:03,998
I need to be excused
from the final exam.

257
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:09,385
Gonna get all superachiever
on me, are you?

258
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:11,087
I'm just trying to avoid flunking.

259
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:13,454
Hearst will yank my scholarship.

260
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:16,815
Excellent. The bar is so low,
we can step over it.

261
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:30,488
Just because you wiggle your finger
doesn't mean Dick's gonna come.

262
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,817
<i>"I know who you did last summer"</i>

263
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:44,784

what are you up to?

264
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:47,440
Oh, you know,
this, that, the other.

265
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,980
<i>You ready for a little... bow,
chicka, wow, wow? Betina!</i>

266
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:54,528
<i>Pick up, pick up, pick up,</i>

267
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:55,971
<i>you little frickin' hottie.</i>

268
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:58,294
Tell me about you and Betina.

269
00:12:58,525 --> 00:12:59,522
Who?

270
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:02,501
Uh, wait.
What?

271
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:04,669
Everybody has their secret shame, "V."

272
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:06,524
You get tanked at the wrong party,

273
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:08,649
stumble a couple rungsdown
the food chain.

274
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:11,494
You know how it is.
You dated that cop.

275
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,847
Patience dwindling.

276
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:18,043
Sometimes you don't need 
the prettiest horse,

277
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:19,951
just one that lets you ride bareback.

278
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:23,738
Ever think maybe...

279
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:26,401
that was a little, I don't know,
dangerous?

280
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:27,806
What am I, stupid?

281
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:30,158
She was on the pill.

282
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:32,869
I don't why you're in a bunch.
I don't hear her complaining.

283
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:34,882
You know she's dead,
right?

284
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:36,409
And she did complain.

285
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:39,664
She played your messages for the whole
bus on the way home from shark field.

286
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:42,253
That's not a satisfied customer, Dick,

287
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:43,762
that's a woman scorned.

288
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:45,933
Well, she had nothing
to be scorned about.

289
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:48,363
I even gave her 
a little gift that day...

290
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:50,556
a sharks premium ticket package,

291
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:52,027
my sharks memorabilia gift bag.

292
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,375
The tickets they raffled off?

293
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,255
You didn't win the tickets.

294
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:57,519
I saw that gay kid who won them
toss them in the trash,

295
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,278
and I thought Betina might like them.

296
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:01,283
Or she could sell them 
for grocery money or whatever.

297
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:04,244
Pissed-off, white-trash 
booty buddy, free tickets.

298
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:05,592
It's a no-brainer.

299
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,006
-Dad?
-Dad?

300
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,170
Maureen?
Hi. I'm Veronica.

301
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:22,446
I'm helping michelle 
with the yearbook tribute.

302
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:24,650
I already gave her 
all the good pictures of Betina.

303
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:28,879
I know. We were just wondering
if you had any poems or artwork,

304
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:32,123
something of Betina's 
that was more personal?

305
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:33,871
Nothing she'd want in the yearbook.

306
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,183
Is there someone else I should ask,

307
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:39,038
another friend, a boyfriend?

308
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,691
She didn't have a boyfriend.

309
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:42,062
Oh.

310
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:45,060
I thought I saw her at a party
once with Dick Casablancas.

311
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:48,562
Dick Casablancas is 
the bastard child of Satan.

312
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:51,280
Well,
that would explain a lot.

313
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:55,009
I don't know what you heard,
but he was horrible to Betina.

314
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:57,070
He treated her like a free hooker.

315
00:14:57,637 --> 00:14:59,051
I know, she let him.

316
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:02,494
But it's my friendial obligation
to blame it all on him.

317
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:04,154
I know Dick.

318
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:05,113
Blame him.

319
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:07,157
Betina just lost her mind over him.

320
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,589
The worse he treated her,

321
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:10,038
the more she lapped up after him.

322
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,029
He was her ideal guy...

323
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:14,564
rich and completely indifferent to her.

324
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,369
The joke so would have been on him.

325
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:19,684
What do you mean?

326
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:23,115
All he wanted was to mess around
with her and have no one know.

327
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:24,706
And all she wanted

328
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:25,852
was for him to knock her up

329
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:27,445
so she could shout it
from the rooftops.

330
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,232
What's with the t-shirts?

331
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,677
You need help keeping us
straight in your head?

332
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:41,902
Straight?

333
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:46,772
"Queer eye for the dead guy" has Petey
wearing a rhinestone fricking rainbow!

334
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:49,778
Seriously,ever heard of Butch?

335
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:51,840
I have important information.

336
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:52,997
Don't we all?

337
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:54,627
It's time for the bus to crash.

338
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,336
And here it comes... Imitation crab.

339
00:15:58,277 --> 00:16:00,577
The winner of this week's
"Cock Of The Walk" countdown...

340
00:16:00,674 --> 00:16:02,056
Don't leave them hanging, captain.

341
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:04,363
...Is Logan Echolls.

342
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:06,118
That's 40 weeks running.

343
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:08,224
"Rosemary's baby...
the teen years."

344
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:13,931
If at four feet,
it survives, we pass.

345
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:18,175
Here goes nothing.

346
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:28,586
Mazel Tov.

347
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,896
Two passing grades,
over easy.

348
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:34,309
I guess our work here is through.

349
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:38,458
Ah.

350
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:40,279
My buffalo burger has arrived.

351
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:49,464
Thank you.

352
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,088
Must be nice.

353
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:53,378
Not for the buffalo.

354
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,450
You don't like me much,
do you?

355
00:16:57,592 --> 00:16:58,916
The last time we actually talked,

356
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,058
you were bashing Veronica's
headlights with a crowbar.

357
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,537
Oh, foreplay.

358
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:09,592
-Good evening.
-Wallace,

359
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,330
have you met my fluffer?

360
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:20,961
Did I see you at school today?

361
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:23,204
I don't know.
Were you hallucinating?

362
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,374
You were dressed
in that exact snazzy outfit,

363
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:31,619
which, if I'm not mistaken,
is your dating uniform.

364
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:35,551
Is there some miss James 
rekindling I should know about?

365
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:40,537
You've got mail
from Stanford University.

366
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,968
It's a little anorexic
for an acceptance letter.

367
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:50,104
Good news or bad,
you know I'm proud of you.

368
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:11,835
"Dear ms. Mars,

369
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,538
it is with great pleasure that the
admissions board at stanford university

370
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:17,874
welcomes you to our institution."

371
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:24,638
You did it, baby.

372
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:35,188
Veronica, Angie,
thank you for coming in.

373
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:37,150
It turns out there's been an error

374
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:39,686
in the calculations
regarding the class rankings.

375
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:42,212
It seems to only affect
the two of you, who

376
00:18:42,384 --> 00:18:44,860
remain in the running
for the Kane scholarship.

377
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,460
An error?
What...

378
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:48,428
what kind of error?

379
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:52,566
Angie was awarded an "A" for 
the summer-at-sea elective she took.

380
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,314
It was a college-level course.

381
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,809
So rather than a 4-point "A," Angie 
should have been awarded a 5-point "A".

382
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:02,010
The adjusted grades have pushed
Angie ahead of you.

383
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:05,556
You could have taken the class.

384
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:08,321
-It was open to anyone.
-Yeah?

385
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,572
How much did that semester-at-sea
class set you back?

386
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:12,983
How should I know?

387
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:17,417
Veronica,
I know Angie Dahl.

388
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:19,776
And I don't think she's 
the witch you're painting her as.

389
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,229
She's a demon spawn.

390
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,320
Story of my life.

391
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,970
I get five minutes of thinking
my dreams may come true,

392
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:29,274
and then some rich kid
slaps reality back into me.

393
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,126
So, how was last night?
Any bad dreams?

394
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,279
If I say no,
do I have to keep coming back here?

395
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:40,597
I'm still nonstop
"Nightmare on Elm street".

396
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:44,050
And I haven't been able 
to figure out who drew the picture.

397
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:47,481
There is one silver lining.

398
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,239
My dad seems...

399
00:19:50,682 --> 00:19:51,945
happy.

400
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:54,677
Well, that's wonderful,
Veronica.

401
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,644
I'm very happy for him.

402
00:19:59,694 --> 00:20:01,995
I'm glad you are in touch again.

403
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:04,447
Uh, we're not.

404
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:07,237
There's nothing about you
that says second place.

405
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,545
Nothing but my GPA.

406
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:11,833
Angie Dahl's parents convinced
the school board that the grades

407
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:14,744
she purchased should be 
worth more than the ones I earned.

408
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:16,543
Oh, you need to shake this off.

409
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,565
Just work through it.

410
00:20:18,977 --> 00:20:21,251
The lowest point of the ebb 
is the turn of the tide.

411
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:23,187
Don't quote.

412
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:26,071
Sorry.

413
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,817
I'm having a mexican 
standoff with the sandman.

414
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:30,359
He's winning.

415
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,140
When I die, I want you to raise
money for my spread in vibe.

416
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:39,616
Oh, didn't I e-mail you?
You're never allowed to die.

417
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:41,502
Would you look at that?

418
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:44,445
The most innocent-looking picture 
is the girl who was hell on wheels.

419
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:48,565
Rhonda and her sister Natalie
were in Clemmons' office all the time,

420
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,496
always in trouble for huffing paint,
stealing, fighting.

421
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,151
Anything to reinforce
the PWT stereotype.

422
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:58,248
There's a "Pretty Young Thing"
stereotype?

423
00:20:58,756 --> 00:20:59,627
Do I fit it?

424
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:01,125
PWT...

425
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:02,756
Poor White Trash.

426
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,523
Oh, them.

427
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:07,907
So, can you point Rhonda's
sister out to me after school?

428
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:10,087
What else am I gonna do?

429
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:13,273
"First name basis" is so much
better than "it's just coffee".

430
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:16,029
Believe me. 
I've tried all the services.

431
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:18,161
I like that I don't have
to send out a picture.

432
00:21:18,297 --> 00:21:20,037
I like not giving out my real name.

433
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:21,592
I mean,

434
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:24,641
I sure wasn't disappointed
when I saw you wander up.

435
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:27,723
You weren't disappointed 
when you saw me, were you?

436
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,989
I wasn't.

437
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:30,906
I didn't think so.

438
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:32,296
In fact,

439
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,745
I thought I saw a smile.
Am I right?

440
00:21:38,074 --> 00:21:38,926
Angie?

441
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:40,656
Your mother has sent you something.

442
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:43,130
Apparently it's more important
than my class.

443
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:52,791
Logan,
you and Wallace are up.

444
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:55,648
I could rub your head for luck.

445
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:57,042
You could try.

446
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:08,766
Whoo!

447
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:15,746
I'm in.
I got into Stanford.

448
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,330
All right!

449
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:21,172
You can be roomies with Veronica Mars.

450
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:23,022
There's a pillow fight I'd like to see.

451
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:25,261
Veronica Mars got into Stanford?

452
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:26,468
Yeah, Veronica Mars.

453
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:27,618
Stanford.

454
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:30,281
Well, I guess somebody
has to do the football team.

455
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:31,705
Echolls/Fennell,

456
00:22:32,256 --> 00:22:34,918
you've got what
all cruising seniors desire...

457
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:36,178
a passing grade.

458
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,200
If you'd like to aim higher tomorrow,

459
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:40,820
I won't hold my breath.

460
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,916
I heard in dorms 
all the girls shower together.

461
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:46,224
Maybe you and Ronnie
can soap each other's backs.

462
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:47,512
Mr. Wu?

463
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:48,641
I want another partner.

464
00:22:48,926 --> 00:22:52,217
Dick is being inappropriate
and didn't help with our project.

465
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,264
Dick?

466
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:54,692
Dude, I totally helped.

467
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:59,045
Can you pick up your project,
bring it to me?

468
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:19,074
I'll see you in summer school, Dick.

469
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:19,955
What?

470
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,740
Believe me,
I'm no happier than you.

471
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:27,305
Congratulations.

472
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,783
You've single-handedly fulfilled
the stanford bitch quota.

473
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:32,617
Enjoy trade school,
Logan.

474
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,904
If you don't mind,

475
00:23:41,102 --> 00:23:42,599
I'm gonna keep working on the project.

476
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:45,032
Come by later.
I'm in.

477
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,961
What's time to a hog?

478
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:00,221
All right I think
that's Rhonda's sister.

479
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:02,240
Natalie.

480
00:24:03,293 --> 00:24:05,829
Are you sure there's a "P"
before that "WT"?

481
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,976
That's definitely her.

482
00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:09,833
She's driving a 'vette now.

483
00:24:10,194 --> 00:24:12,845
Last year she offered to make out
with me for cigarette money.

484
00:24:23,144 --> 00:24:24,882
Hey, is this your car?

485
00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:27,528
No, it's my roller skate.

486
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:29,270
This is so cool.

487
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:32,165
I was thinking about moving up
to a sweeter ride myself.

488
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:33,503
How does she handle?

489
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,217
Better than the bus.

490
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:45,747
Yowza.

491
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:47,904
You can take the girl out of the trash,

492
00:24:47,957 --> 00:24:49,973
but you can't take
the trash out of the girl.

493
00:24:50,517 --> 00:24:52,867
Oh, the time and effort she saved me.

494
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:01,895
Why aren't you learning something?

495
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:03,956
And a good day to you, too, sir.

496
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:06,479
I was thinking about
some great advice you gave me.

497
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:07,927
Look both ways?

498
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:09,338
Don't stick that in your nose?

499
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,764
Follow the money.

500
00:25:11,564 --> 00:25:12,727
Could you run the financial records

501
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,937
of the families with kids
who died in the crash?

502
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:17,806
Will do. Got to go.
Important meeting.

503
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:23,061
You know who you remind me of?

504
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:26,924
That guy on "Seinfeld," George.

505
00:25:27,157 --> 00:25:28,042
Oh, how so?

506
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,661
Well, he's a nice guy,
like you.

507
00:25:31,176 --> 00:25:35,248
But there's so much
unrealized potential.

508
00:25:35,523 --> 00:25:37,930
A guy who really wants
to meet women goes for it.

509
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:39,555
You know, he dresses to impress,

510
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:41,796
a little cologne, a gym membership.

511
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:44,395
-You...
-...should make more of an effort?

512
00:25:46,192 --> 00:25:48,455
My ex-husband went
for a hair transplant.

513
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:50,734
He looked fantastic afterwards.

514
00:25:50,905 --> 00:25:53,871
Cologne, new suit, hair.

515
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:56,714
I should probably
write this stuff down.

516
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:05,257
We magnify the drag,
decrease the velocity,

517
00:26:05,452 --> 00:26:07,580
minimize the force,
and decelerate...

518
00:26:07,636 --> 00:26:08,786
Decelerate yourself.

519
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:12,947
Four is officially your espresso limit.

520
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:18,936
So, I know why I'm trying
to help out Veronica.

521
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,890
I want her to get to go to Stanford.

522
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,142
Why are you doing it?

523
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:26,346
I don't know,
not for Veronica.

524
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:28,267
Then what?

525
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:31,872
The spirit of competition.

526
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:35,647
Yeah.

527
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:37,010
All right.

528
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:38,859
Why don't you chill
while the glue dries?

529
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,033
I got to see a man about a horse.

<i>...Look at the hurdles

<i>Who is the real Aaron Echolls?</i>

<i>Rumors of Echolls sometimes...</i>

544
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,949
they rerun it twice a day.

545
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:25,562
I hear it's a top-rated episode.

546
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:30,874
<i>And son Logan's rocky relationship

548
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:38,214
Got something for me?

549
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:40,830
The love in my heart,

550
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:42,423
chili on the stove,

551
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:45,990
oh, and I ran those financial records.

552
00:27:46,307 --> 00:27:47,725
-I'm a great father.
-Mm-hmm.

553
00:27:48,562 --> 00:27:51,780
None of the families of the crash
victims made money on insurance.

554
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:56,238
They basically got enough
just to pay for the funerals.

555
00:27:56,586 --> 00:28:01,874
However, Rhonda's family won a separate
lawsuit with a $2 million payout.

556
00:28:02,372 --> 00:28:03,631
You'll never guess who from.

557
00:28:03,697 --> 00:28:04,505
You're right.

558
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:06,721
I won't.

559
00:28:06,797 --> 00:28:07,952
Woody Goodman.

560
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:14,501
Woody's burgers paid Rhonda's
family a secret $2 million payout.

561
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,441
Apparently her mom found
a finger in her ribwich.

562
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:37,599
Sometimes opportunity doesn't knock.

563
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:40,706
It waits for everyone to go to lunch
and sneaks in using a key.

564
00:28:40,947 --> 00:28:42,609
It's a long shot
that my dead classmates

565
00:28:42,678 --> 00:28:44,636
will have something helpful
in their permanent files,

566
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,364
like being suspended
for drawing on school property.

567
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:56,364
Sorry about the inconvenience.

568
00:28:56,758 --> 00:28:58,200
It's one of my bad habits.

569
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:02,284
And Veronica won't let me buy
nice sunglasses anymore

570
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:04,060
because I'll lose them within the week.

571
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:07,007
-Making any headway in the case?
-Slowly.

572
00:29:07,305 --> 00:29:09,179
We've had three more cases diagnosed

573
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:11,914
just this week
of generalized anxiety disorder.

574
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:14,041
You'd think it was contagious.

575
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,521
And all these students
are section 1123 now,

576
00:29:16,574 --> 00:29:18,534
all of them coming
from the same doctor?

577
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,327
Yep. My faculty is about to revolt.

578
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:23,977
They're supposed to offer
these students deadline extensions,

579
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,596
makeup dates on exams,
and unlimited time on tests,

580
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,044
all at these students' own discretion.

581
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,979
I hope to have something
you can use very soon.

582
00:29:34,928 --> 00:29:35,760
My coat?

583
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:37,701
Right.
It's in the closet.

584
00:29:47,226 --> 00:29:48,631
Yep.

585
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:50,476
That's mine, all right.

586
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,924
I was one of those people saying,

587
00:29:57,994 --> 00:29:59,570
"Keith Mars should be run out of town,"

588
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:01,984
going after that sweet Jake Kane,

589
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:04,740
making our nice little town
look like Bozoville.

590
00:30:05,492 --> 00:30:07,295
And then when I found out
what really happened,

591
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,495
I was so embarrassed.

592
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:14,016
I confess I never vote 
in the local elections,

593
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:17,505
but I went out this year
just so I could vote for you.

594
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:20,276
I totally carried the pity vote.

595
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,264
But enough about me.

596
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,225
Tell me about you.

597
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:28,800
Oh, it's dull.
Trust me.

598
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,316
I'm the office manager
for a local doctor.

599
00:30:33,116 --> 00:30:34,220
Really?

600
00:30:35,548 --> 00:30:36,971
I'd love to hear about it.

601
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,308
Peter, as I have learned
from his postings,

602
00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:41,545
had in his words "yellow fever"

603
00:30:41,603 --> 00:30:43,936
and was extremely hot
for a certain teacher.

604
00:30:44,265 --> 00:30:46,310
There was one incident
in Peter's permanent file.

605
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:49,285
It didn't say what happened,
only that it involved mr. Wu.

606
00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:52,253
Can't help but wonder if
teacher decided to take a pet.

607
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:53,895
Hello, Veronica.

608
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:57,052
Would you like to donate
to the yearbook tribute

609
00:30:57,104 --> 00:30:58,321
for the kids on the bus?

610
00:30:58,392 --> 00:30:59,694
Of course.
I've been meaning to.

611
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:01,385
I figured.

612
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:03,447
Peter was a friend of mine.

613
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:05,004
I know you two had a connection.

614
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:06,887
I'm sorry for your loss.
You must miss him.

615
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:08,796
Do you miss him?

616
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,685
As a bright and dedicated student, yes.

617
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:14,218
In the way I think you're implying, no.

618
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:18,699
Peter was gearing up for what 
he called the "outing of all outings".

619
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:23,395
I was wondering if he was pulling 
his favorite teacher out of the closet.

620
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,426
Veronica, I think when you get
out in the world a little more,

621
00:31:29,476 --> 00:31:32,450
you'll discover that not all
well-dressed, articulate,

622
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,415
detail-oriented men are gay.

623
00:31:35,112 --> 00:31:36,675
Many of them are just asian.

624
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,800
So, you knew
Peter had feelings for you?

625
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:41,911
Yes, I did.

626
00:31:42,957 --> 00:31:44,129
He confessed these feelings to me

627
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:46,621
on the unfortunate night we ran
into each other at possibilities.

628
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:48,917
Why were you at a gay bar?

629
00:31:49,244 --> 00:31:51,593
Not that I need to explain myself
to you, Veronica,

630
00:31:51,871 --> 00:31:53,763
but it was a cousin's birthday party.

631
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:55,398
I was being supportive.

632
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,209
I explained the situation
to mr. Clemmons.

633
00:31:58,546 --> 00:31:59,805
I believe he has it all on file.

634
00:32:01,732 --> 00:32:04,247
Sorry. You're right.
None of my business.

635
00:32:06,777 --> 00:32:10,193
Did Peter have any hobbies
like drawing or painting?

636
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:11,922
I thought he was your friend.

637
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:20,266
<i>[Daft Punk - "One More Time"]

638
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,391
So, do you believe him?

639
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:24,239
Mr. Wuuu!

640
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:25,837
Yes.

641
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:29,117
And I hate to disappoint you, but

642
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,118
even if he were gay,

643
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:35,097
I don't think it would qualify
as the "outing of all outings".

644
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,946
You think you know me
because you read my postings?

645
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,293
Every line of your postings
like 80 times.

646
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:44,703
I know you like the back of my...

-Nothing.

649
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,516
You're asking the wrong question.

650
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:57,374
All right, maybe a better question...

651
00:32:58,326 --> 00:33:00,066
is why was I even on the bus?

652
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:06,575
Why would I even be interested
in going to a baseball stadium?

653
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:08,295
Huh?

654
00:33:09,806 --> 00:33:12,295
Mull that one over for a while, okay?

One P.C.H.Er died on the bus crash,
Cervando Luna.

00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:33,970
Grade-point average... 3.8

average trips to the
principal's office per week... 3.2,

00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:38,978
including a visit during summer school

663
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:42,059
for pushing Cassidy Casablancas
against a wall and threatening him.

664
00:33:42,894 --> 00:33:44,414
Busy Beaver,
always working.

665
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,590
What's up, Veronica?

666
00:33:46,452 --> 00:33:47,498
During summer school,

667
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:49,940
you had a run-in
with a kid named Cervando?

668
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:52,959
He ran me into a wall,
if that's what you mean.

669
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,724
I'd dunk the eight ball
a couple of times,

670
00:33:55,084 --> 00:33:57,266
jack up my fingers like
I don't know how to hold the cue.

671
00:33:57,657 --> 00:34:00,641
I see Liam all winking at his cousin,
thinking he's got one.

672
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:03,405
Every time I made a shot,
I'd be all excited,

673
00:34:03,457 --> 00:34:05,719
then act all scared like
I was worried that he'd do something.

674
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:06,941
Check this out.

675
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:10,925
Courtesy of Liam Fitzpatrick
being a sucker...

676
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:15,504
$200 jeans. Look at these things.
I'm never taking them off.

677
00:34:15,573 --> 00:34:16,766
Boom, boom, boom.

678
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,983
-Yo, man, you crazy?
-Get out of here, Dick.

679
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:26,351
Cervando, you know, he's normally
a pretty cool guy for a P.C.H.Er, but

680
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,384
But the next day, that dude,
he was seriously on the warpath.

681
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:33,111
Dick's squirt gun
was loaded with bleach.

682
00:34:34,827 --> 00:34:35,914
You owe me a pair of jeans.

683
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:38,470
W-what are you talking about?

684
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:40,995
Size, style, color.

685
00:34:41,384 --> 00:34:42,807
But I didn't do anything.
It was Dick.

686
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,007
Well, I'm not telling him.
I'm telling you.

687
00:34:45,058 --> 00:34:46,514
Gentlemen,
that's quite enough.

688
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,464
Cervando, come with me.

689
00:34:57,407 --> 00:34:58,804
I guess Dick was too big for him.

690
00:34:58,861 --> 00:35:00,696
So he figured he'd settle
the score with his little brother.

691
00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:03,607
Story of my life.

692
00:35:06,836 --> 00:35:07,601
What's this?

693
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:10,860
It's a tape of dr. Burns' office
manager offering to hook Veronica

694
00:35:10,918 --> 00:35:14,306
up with a diagnosis 
of generalized anxiety disorder

695
00:35:14,357 --> 00:35:16,385
for a $1,000 consultation fee.

696
00:35:18,264 --> 00:35:19,240
How did you get this?

697
00:35:20,054 --> 00:35:21,095
Painfully.

698
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:25,732
You got to kiss a lot of toads before
you find your medical office manager.

699
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:37,574
Okay, folks,

00:35:45,798 --> 00:35:47,603
Mr. Fennell, mr. Echolls,

702
00:35:47,956 --> 00:35:50,138
you're our last remaining team

703
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,751
still in the running
for an exemption from mr. Wu's

704
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:55,556
notorious gpa-killing final exam,

705
00:35:56,444 --> 00:35:59,025
as well as the accompanying hardware.

706
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,549
Yeah!

707
00:36:02,998 --> 00:36:04,435
Do it! Yeah!

708
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:10,837
Do it!

709
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:31,965
Scramble.

710
00:36:35,434 --> 00:36:36,856
That's awesome about the egg drop.

711
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:39,528
You ready for miss Murphy's 
"Crime and Punishment" exam?

712
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,568
Nope. I was up all night
working on my egg thing.

713
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,848
I'm requesting an extension because of
my generalized anxiety disorder.

714
00:36:46,864 --> 00:36:50,886
<i>Ahoy, Mateys! 540 on your
A.M. Dial. Listen...</i>

715
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:54,881
Oh, am I still keeping you up at night?

716
00:36:56,136 --> 00:36:57,113
You look like Steve Buscemi.

717
00:36:57,939 --> 00:37:00,282
You...are such...

718
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,717
a catch.

719
00:37:03,303 --> 00:37:05,305
How has Hannah been able to keep away?

720
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:11,806
Maybe you should cut him
some slack sometimes.

721
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:19,805
Attention,
faculty and students.

722
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:23,059
I have an important announcement
to make regarding school policy.

723
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,807
Due to some recently discovered abuses,

724
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:30,395
Neptune high will no longer be honoring
special exemptions or extensions

725
00:37:31,145 --> 00:37:33,730
for section 1123 students.

726
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:46,284
Veronica.

727
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:48,409
Veronica!

728
00:37:49,742 --> 00:37:51,949
Do you want to solve this problem,
or do you want to sleep?

729
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,887
How did you get home
the day of the crash?

730
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:18,358
Weevil?

731
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,622
Hey, don't you think that's weird?

732
00:38:21,423 --> 00:38:22,709
The bomb didn't kill us.

733
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:26,380
It killed the driver, probably,
but it was a long drop off the cliff,

734
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:28,915
and crashing onto the rocks
that got the rest of us.

735
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,699
FYI...
I made it through that.

736
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:36,229
I got to drown.

737
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:44,728
Say a person wants to just
take out the bus driver.

738
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,940
They could do it
here, here, here,

739
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,980
basically anywhere along the way.

740
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:55,900
But to get the whole bus,

741
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,039
they'd have to know
when it was approaching a cliff.

742
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:06,617
They'd have to be close enough
to see exactly where we were.

743
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:12,218
Hey, look.
He's bald.

744
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:14,476
You think it was Weevil?

745
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:16,696
I am god.

746
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:17,638
What?

747
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:21,110
I... am... god.

748
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:24,078
<i>[The Wannabes - "I am god"]
I am god</i>

749
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:26,914
<i>I am god </i>

750
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:29,116
<i>I am god </i>

751
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:31,586
<i>I am god </i>

752
00:39:32,102 --> 00:39:33,943
<i>I am god </i>

753
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:36,588
<i>And that's our show,
pirates and pi-ladies.</i>

754
00:39:36,945 --> 00:39:39,756
<i>You've been listening to
"Ahoy, Mateys!" This is Cap'n Krunk...</i>

755
00:39:39,808 --> 00:39:43,410
<i>-And imitation crab...
-Signing off saying... Arr!</i>

756
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:02,635
So, that's it? The tombstone artwork
was just an album cover?

757
00:40:03,478 --> 00:40:04,975
And Rosebud was just a sled.

758
00:40:06,725 --> 00:40:08,852
I didn 't just ruin "Citizen Kane"
for you, did I?

759
00:40:09,068 --> 00:40:09,901
No, no.

760
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,618
Good.

761
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,427
So, are we done?

762
00:40:14,097 --> 00:40:16,588
Well, that depends. Do you think
you're through being haunted?

763
00:40:19,193 --> 00:40:20,392
I better be.

764
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,971
I was thinking about the great advice
I gave you about following the money.

765
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:35,579
The money wasn't on the bus.

766
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:39,915
The rich kids were behind,
driving in the limo.

767
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:44,251
So, maybe whoever crashed the bus

768
00:40:44,304 --> 00:40:46,314
was counting on them being on it?

769
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,531
Richard Casablancas took
an insurance policy out on his sons

770
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,403
three days after marrying Kendall.

771
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:56,743
Dick and Beaver are worth
more dead than they are alive.

772
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:07,179
Kind of disappointing,
huh?

773
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:10,450
Not a suicide thing.
Just a song I liked.

774
00:41:11,232 --> 00:41:12,393
That brings us back to you.

775
00:41:12,786 --> 00:41:13,551
To me?

776
00:41:13,773 --> 00:41:15,155
It was a fun exercise,

777
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:17,890
probably comforting for a while,
thinking it's someone else's fault.

778
00:41:19,024 --> 00:41:20,581
But it's not, is it?

779
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:22,519
We died because of you.

780
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:25,871
Ooh, what do you think
this means, Veronica?

781
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:28,310
Think I got what it takes
for art school?

782
00:41:39,642 --> 00:41:40,612
It's for you.

783
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:49,667
Where are you, loser?

784
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:50,668
