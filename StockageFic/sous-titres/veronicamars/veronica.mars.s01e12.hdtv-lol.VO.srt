1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,835
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:04,004
God, Lilly, I see the Prozac's working.

3
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,715
I've got a secret. A good one.

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:10,302
Socially, she seems to be a bit isolated.

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,930
I'd say Veronica's doing pretty well,
given the circumstances.

6
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,015
I know how close she was with Lilly Kane.

7
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,100
The truth is gonna come out.
It doesn't add up.

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,603
- Lilly?
- What? You forgot about me already?

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,814
- What are you doing?
- Why do you have Lilly's name on your arm?

10
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,775
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah, I really wanna know!

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,486
My husband gets a lot of
disturbing letters from fans.

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,655
I swear, I don't know you.

13
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,702
The word is out.

14
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,300
Our illustrious Guidance Counsellor
has received a grant

15
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,651
to study the long term effects
of grief in adolescence.

16
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,796
She's demanding an audience with
each of us hardest hit by Lilly's death.

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,466
I was going to decline a session,
then I had a thought.

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,433
Well there's something
you don't see everyday.

19
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,937
Yeah. I cannot wait to get out of Neptune.

20
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,730
MIT, huh?

21
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,190
Early admission.

22
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,361
Bet you're gonna miss
this place when you're gone.

23
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,989
- Not really.
- I didn't think so.

24
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,659
Veronica? Sorry to make you wait.
Come on in.

25
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,957
Do you remember when we talked
last year, right after Lilly's death?

26
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,335
You were...inconsolable.

27
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,839
I'm really hoping that this year,
you're able to talk about it.

28
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,090
You know, you're never going
to come to terms with Lilly's death

29
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:34,253
if you keep all that pain bottled up inside you.

30
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,682
Wow. I have that exact same
platitude-a-day calendar at home.

31
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,602
It's how I know beauty comes from within.

32
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,897
Look, Veronica, for whatever
reason, I don't think you...

33
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,401
care for me very much, so if you
prefer talking with someone else, that's...

34
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,863
Sorry, that was rude.

35
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,532
It's not you. It's the talking.

36
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,701
I don't want to talk away my grief.

37
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,871
I want to turn it into something else. Fuel.

38
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,300
I know how I'm gonna feel better and

39
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:06,685
it's not by talking about how sad I am.

40
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,003
Veronica!

41
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,506
Yeah. Nervous habit.

42
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,973
So how is it you're going to find, uh,

43
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:25,229
and I really hate to use this word
but it is appropriate...closure?

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,151
I'll find closure when Lilly's killer's
rotting away in prison.

45
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,406
Miss Jeffries?

46
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,619
Rick! You're wanted in the office.

47
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,172
- The Sheriff is here to-
- Morning, Rick.

48
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,842
How's your head this morning,
a little bit of a hangover?

49
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,848
That's nothing compared
to how your buddy Tim is feeling.

50
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,290
Tim had to have a tube put down his throat

51
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:07,360
so they could pump his stomach.
He's in a coma, Rick.

52
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,398
Oh my god.

53
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,525
According to a surveillance tape,

54
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,320
your evening ended at 1:30am
when you dropped, and I mean dropped,

55
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,365
an unconscious Tim outside
the Neptune Memorial ER.

56
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,784
I-I didn't have a choice.

57
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,288
Right.

58
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,833
Someone must have put a gun to your head,
forced you on a pub crawl?

59
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,253
By the way, how did you get into those bars?

60
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,213
We got fake IDs.

61
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,305
You and half the kids in Neptune.

62
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,183
These things have been popping up
all over the place. The way I see it,

63
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,977
they're coming from your school.

64
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,318
I think you owe it to your friend
to tell me who's making the fakes.

65
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,613
Look, Rick.

66
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,657
The three of us?

67
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:05,162
We're not leaving this cosy
little room until you give me a name.

68
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,880
Veronica Mars.

69
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,521
Sending out the big guns
in the morning. I'm flattered.

70
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,065
Veronica, the Sheriff wants
to have a look inside your locker.

71
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,107
Course he does.

72
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,403
Just out of curiosity, what are
you gentlemen hoping to find in here?

73
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,864
Al Capone? The Lindbergh baby?

74
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,500
We have reason to believe that
you are manufacturing and distributing

75
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,315
fake driver's licenses.

76
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,288
- Ooo, that's a new one.
- It's a second degree felony.

77
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,250
Lord knows, I hate to disappoint you boys...

78
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,797
Wait a minute, those aren't mine.

79
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:04,096
I'm gonna need to search your purse
as well. Either we can do this here...

80
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,515
Or down at the station?

81
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,070
Lilly Kane's driver's license.

82
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,908
Driver's license for a twenty two
year old Veronica Mars.

83
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:28,161
A San Diego State student ID.

84
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:36,920
- Licensed massage therapist.
- Oh yeah. Those are mine.

85
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,258
- You really don't have to do that.
- You're right about that.

86
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,594
But I'm going to anyway.

87
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,471
And Veronica, don't bother coming back
to school for the next three days.

88
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,432
You're suspended.

89
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,150
You better call your daddy, Mars!

90
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,403
Ah, it's your turn, huh? Ha ha.

91
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,705
Gosh, I hope they use
that shot in the yearbook.

92
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:43,067
<i>Season 1 - Episode 12
Clash of the Tritons</i>

93
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:51,078
I know an adequate one
who just posted your $500 bail.

94
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,372
They take Diners Club here?

95
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,041
- Seriously, Cliff, thanks.
- It's quite all right.

96
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,627
It's all part of my full
service legal counsel.

97
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,129
Is there any way you could
not tell my dad about this?

98
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,758
- Why didn't you call him?
- He's busy chasing a bail jumper in Arizona.

99
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,177
Trust me, your dad's gonna
find out one way or the other.

100
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,999
Besides, I may need to sic him on you
if you don't show up at the courthouse.

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,828
Next Tuesday, 9am.

102
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,060
So, are we gonna beat this wrap?

103
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,896
Well, possession, they've got
you pretty cold on that one.

104
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,357
The stuff in your wallet is Mickey Mouse.

105
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,860
It's the IDs in the locker
that they care about.

106
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,653
- They were blank.
- Right.

107
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:28,073
So until the coma guy wakes up, the only
thing they have tying you to this supposed

108
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,409
fake ID ring is the testimony
of the other kid.

109
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,537
- What other kid?
- Your buddy...Rick.

110
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,747
Excuse me?

111
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,584
Howdy, Rick.

112
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,170
Do I know you? No.

113
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,964
Then why'd you tell Sheriff Lamb
I sold you a fake ID?

114
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,175
It's...it-it's what they told me to say.

115
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,885
- Who's they?
- No way.

116
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:52,264
- They're everywhere. They will destroy me.
- I'll destroy you worse.

117
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,976
- I can't talk about it here.
- Tomorrow in school, we talk.

118
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,228
No! I just- I told you, it
has to be done in secret.

119
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,563
Oh, it will be.

120
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,985
- You'll be hearing from me.
- I thought you were expelled?

121
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,572
La femme Veronica.

122
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:13,911
I heard it took three officers and a
stun gun to haul your butt outta school.

123
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,498
You must be the only student who didn't
see my walk of shame in person.

124
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,333
I grabbed your books.

125
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,128
- And your homework from the teachers.
- I need to ask another favour.

126
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,048
This mission better involve
me seducing the head cheerleader.

127
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,717
I need you to poke around
and see if you can get me a fake ID.

128
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,931
If you must seduce the head cheerleader
in order to accomplish your mission, so be it.

129
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:34,932
No sweat.

130
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,644
- How do I do that?
- Play on her insecurity.

131
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,896
- I meant the fake ID part.
- Okay.

132
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:45,943
Let's pretend for a moment that this
mythical head cheerleader of yours
has just asked you out on a date.

133
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,195
In exchange for seven minutes in heaven,

134
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,322
you have to get her into the hottest
nightclub in Neptune or

135
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:53,200
at least buy her a pack
of strawberry wine coolers.

136
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,370
The stakes are high,
Wallace Fennell. Think, now.

137
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,372
How would you do it?

138
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,087
Hey, Veronica?

139
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,797
Yeah?

140
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,299
I need you to get me a fake ID

141
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:13,554
so I can get some fake
action from a fake cheerleader.

142
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,681
- Wallace?
- Yeah?

143
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:19,560
Please find out who else
at school is making them.

144
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,448
<i>If you're breathing, then you've heard
about Aaron Echolls getting ginsued
at his own Christmas party.</i>

145
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:37,703
<i>Explain to me why a guy who's
married to Lynn Echolls would want
to bang the frigging help.</i>

146
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,999
<i>It's like the old saying goes,
show me a hot chick and I'll show you
a guy who's tired of hitting that.</i>

147
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,919
- Logan!
- Yeah. Be right there.

148
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:20,162
In my humble opinion,
your mom's totally hotter.

149
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,413
You shut the hell up.

150
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,125
Big mistake, son.

151
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,801
Break it up! Break it up.

152
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,387
- Get off!
- It's enough.

153
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,727
To tell you the truth, I-I...

154
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,438
I really don't remember that week.

155
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,816
You don't remember being in this office?

156
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,778
You slammed the chair
against the wall, Eli.

157
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:58,116
The last time that we met it seemed
that Lilly's death had affected you
in quite a profound way.

158
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,077
Well, yeah. I was mad.

159
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:03,497
You know, the same day Lilly Kane died,

160
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,625
a little girl went missing
in my neighbourhood.

161
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,795
They found her body three months later.

162
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:14,967
Where were the cameras when she went missing,
where was the grief counselling for her?

163
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,804
What happened to Marisol Reyes
was a tragedy, Eli. People do care...

164
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,642
<i>Right now I just want
to talk about Lilly, okay.</i>

165
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,062
<i>Oh, well then, why don't you call
some of her rich, white friends in here?</i>

166
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,522
<i>I want you to listen to something.</i>

167
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,648
It's a letter you wrote.

168
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,985
"You tore my heart out.

169
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:36,113
You can act like what we had together
meant nothing to you,

170
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,657
but you can't stop me from loving you.

171
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,827
For the rest of your life, wherever
you go, I'll always be there,

172
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:45,080
just out of sight, in the shadows."

173
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,167
You know, I-I don't
remember cc'ing you on that.

174
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,200
Lilly wanted to be transferred out
of your PE class last year,

175
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:53,430
she was having trouble with a boy.

176
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,465
She gave me these to prove it.

177
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,137
I never would have hurt her.

178
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,849
Look, the cops already rubbed my nose
in those letters so what-what...

179
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,475
Lilly and Weevil?

180
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,396
<i>Look, Eli, I didn't bring you
in here to embarrass you.</i>

181
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,816
I invited you in here to talk about
why you wrote these things.

182
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,238
Her and Logan had just broken up.

183
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:24,745
And uh, Lilly swore to me that
she'd never go back to him but then...

184
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:29,291
one day that punk snaps his fingers and...

185
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:34,963
all of a sudden it's like, like, we
don't even know each other any more.

186
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:42,262
And...she was someone
I could have loved, you know?

187
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,100
And she felt it too, I know she did.

188
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,021
Why didn't Lilly tell me about him?

189
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,482
Was Weevil her big secret?

190
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,823
- Hello?
- Back parking lot, fourth row.

191
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,247
Where are you?

192
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,874
- Is anyone watching you?
- No, I don't think so.

193
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,673
Slide on in.

194
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,349
So where were we?
Right! Who framed me?

195
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:31,562
They're called the Tritons.
It's a secret society at school.

196
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,188
Why haven't I heard of them?

197
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,108
Stupid question. Keep going.

198
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,736
The Tritons have been around
as long as Neptune High.

199
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:43,073
Six new members are inducted
in junior year by the six seniors.

200
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,285
Tim and I were among their pledges.

201
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,494
Who's in charge?

202
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,997
No one even knows for
sure who the brothers are.

203
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,583
Then who invited you to join?

204
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,794
Two weeks ago, I found a note in my locker.

205
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:14,062
- So this was all part of a hazing ritual?
- The twelve labours.

206
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,315
The first few challenges weren't so bad.

207
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,442
But on Friday when I opened up my locker,

208
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,653
I found a fake ID with
my yearbook picture on it.

209
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:24,990
The instructions said we were supposed
to go to a bunch of bars
and have a shot at each of 'em.

210
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,867
Let me guess. Twelve?

211
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,869
Tim passed out at the eleventh.

212
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,998
All the other pledges freaked out
and left me there to take care of him so I-

213
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:36,585
I threw him in the car and I took him
to the hospital as fast as I could.

214
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,087
If they're so secret,
how do you know all this?

215
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:43,759
My dad was a Triton.
So were my two older brothers.

216
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,226
<i>Blame Veronica Mars</i>

217
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,646
All I cared about at that moment
was staying on their good side.

218
00:14:56,438 --> 00:15:01,527
If they found out that I betrayed their
secrets, let's just say I'd be better off in jail.

219
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,446
These guys will destroy your life,
it's their mission statement.

220
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,990
So that's your defence?
That you were just following orders?

221
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,575
That doesn't cut it, Rick.

222
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,702
I know that now and I'm sorry.

223
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,205
You've gotta believe me.

224
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,784
After what they did to Tim?

225
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:17,487
And now his family's threatening to sue me.

226
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:20,462
I can't even talk to my own dad about it.

227
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,715
He calls me a coward
and a traitor for what I did.

228
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,469
But how can I belong to a club
that almost killed my best friend?

229
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,973
All I want now is for the Tritons to go down.

230
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,976
- So, who are the other pledges?
- Anyone who's anyone.

231
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:38,313
The Tritons supposedly chose the best
guys in everything: academics, sports...

232
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,900
they're pretty much
the six guys you'd expect.

233
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,318
I want their names.

234
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:49,366
Harry Diddon, Steve Argo, Matt Barron,

235
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,994
Duncan Kane.

236
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:58,917
So if I follow Duncan,
I can find the Tritons.

237
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,311
Thanks, I appreciate it.

238
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,980
- Logan, let's go.
- How long did I get?

239
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,566
You're not being suspended.

240
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:28,155
The Vice Principal wants all three of us
back here on Friday
for a disciplinary conference.

241
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,074
Listen. I'm not happy
that you were fighting

242
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,452
but I am proud of you
for sticking up for your mother.

243
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,786
- You're proud of me!
- Yeah.

244
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,080
Oh great. Good. I can die happy.

245
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:42,961
You keep smarting off
and I'll help arrange it.

246
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,506
Is everything okay?

247
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,843
Sorry Cliff, I'm late.

248
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:56,892
Hi, Dad. Their case is
fuzzy and circumstantial.

249
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:03,065
You know the odd thing?
Those were also her very first words.

250
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,984
I think I've got a good lead
on who's making the fake IDs.

251
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,654
It's a secret society at
school called the Tritons.

252
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,114
Rick told me that he was 
bullied into turning me in.

253
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:14,034
I'm positive they're the ones
who set the blanks in my locker.

254
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:18,539
Look, Veronica. The criminal case
is the least of our problems.

255
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,083
- Tim's parents are suing.
- Us?

256
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,711
And pretty much everyone else involved
in their son's night of debauchery.

257
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,381
Every bar in town is gonna
be named in the suit.

258
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,466
The thing could be worth millions.

259
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,896
Aaron! Come on in.

260
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,106
Thank you.

261
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,651
So, how's it going?
Do you need anything?

262
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,529
Uh...yeah, some water would be good.

263
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,994
So, I, uh, I guess I should have
cancelled that party after all, huh?

264
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,124
So. How you hangin' in.

265
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:09,339
This I can handle but these...

266
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,886
I've been trying to
regain my family's trust.

267
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:17,389
And I meant what I said when I told you
that I was going to give up all of that...

268
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:21,226
but these stories. I mean
they're tearing my family apart.

269
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,354
My daughter Trina's the only one
who will talk to me anymore.

270
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:27,983
I can't blame Logan or his mother, I just...

271
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,573
Any idea who could know
such intimate details about you?

272
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:40,662
Paparazzi. But then again they would
have printed the stories right away.

273
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:46,877
- Someone on my staff?
- Jealous boyfriend or husband?

274
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,880
That's a possibility.

275
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,968
Well, let me dig around.

276
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:55,928
Listen.

277
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,182
My wife's really fragile.

278
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,894
I don't know how much more
scandal she can take.

279
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,730
Let me see what I can do.

280
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,444
Triton, son of Neptune,
the god of the sea:

281
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:17,407
with his great horn Triton commands
the dark waters and all the creatures within.

282
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,537
- Trick or treat.
- What's the news?

283
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,541
Nobody I talked to at school
knows anything about fake IDs.

284
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:31,088
But then, this afternoon, a kid from
my biology class comes into Sac'n'Pac,

285
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:34,132
buys a six pack from my boss, like it was no problem.

286
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,551
Did you figure out where he got his fake?

287
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,636
Slow down. This is my story.

288
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,097
Followed him out to the parking lot

289
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,308
and I was like "Yo, fella, check it out.
You're on "Candid Camera"

290
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,188
Gave him the four-one-one on
our video playback capabilities,

291
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,316
you know, leaned on him.
Like I was Shaft or somethin'.

292
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,401
Shut yo' mouth!

293
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:53,902
Long story short.

294
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,780
The guy claimed that there's
a mystery locker at school.

295
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,199
- Ooo, I like it already.
- Here's how it works.

296
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,578
You put your name and two hundred
and fifty bucks in locker one-ten
first thing in the morning.

297
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:07,416
Come afternoon, brand spanking
new licence that says you were born
in 1983 arrives in your locker.

298
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:12,045
Are you willing to put $250 into some
strange locker just to see if this works?

299
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:15,007
Hell, no. I'm using your money.

300
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,018
How many times have I walked
through the main hallway?

301
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:32,107
And how many times have I not noticed
that our school's insignia includes
Trinton's conch shell.

302
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:43,327
According to Wallace, locker one-ten
isn't assigned to anyone in school

303
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,954
but clearly someone has the combination.

304
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:51,251
If all one has to do in order to procure
a fake ID is slip cash into locker one-ten,

305
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:55,756
it stands to reason all I have
to do is see who opens said locker.

306
00:20:55,881 --> 00:21:00,219
This is made tougher, though
not impossible, by my suspension.

307
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:14,399
Then Wallace will drop the
two fifty in the mystery locker.

308
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,653
Thanks for coming in, Logan.

309
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,989
Thanks for getting me out
of a calculus class, Becky.

310
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,783
It's Miss James please.

311
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,869
<i>So the week Lilly died would
have been our second anniversary.</i>

312
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,704
We were together since junior high.

313
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,665
Off and on?

314
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:31,834
Yeah, off and on.

315
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,337
- And at the time of her murder you were-
- Off!

316
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,340
Temporarily.

317
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,133
Why were you broken up?

318
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,469
Uh, we were supposed
to go to this party.

319
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:47,099
And, uh, Lilly was pissed
at me for something,

320
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,852
I can't even remember what, you know.

321
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:53,856
And, uh...Lilly stands me up.

322
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:57,651
I end up getting pretty hammered and

323
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:01,029
...wind up kissing this other girl for like three seconds.

324
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:04,324
- And Lilly saw you two?
- Nope, someone else did.

325
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:05,357
You must know her.

326
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,848
Word is you're real close with her dad.

327
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,372
You could do better.

328
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,374
You need to leave my personal
life out of this, Logan.

329
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,085
Yeah, let's not get personal about this.

330
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,088
You know what, it sounds
like you blame Veronica.

331
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:19,731
You know Veronica was my friend too.

332
00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:21,777
<i>And if she hadn't ratted me out...</i>

333
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,845
...then Lilly and I would have stayed together.

334
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,973
And Lilly wouldn't have been alone that day.

335
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,517
I would have been there.

336
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:34,229
So, yeah, I blame Veronica.

337
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,995
And I blame myself for being stupid

338
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:42,289
and I blame Lilly for being
a bitch that week.

339
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,782
You know there is another
of looking at this, Logan.

340
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,870
If you'd still been together,
you might be dead too.

341
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:54,082
And what is so great about living.

342
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,631
Hey, Wallace. How was practice?

343
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,549
I was on fire out there.

344
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,760
Three point line, hand in my face,

345
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:07,763
fade away like Jordan! Boom!

346
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:08,597
Great.

347
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:10,390
'Course you're not listening to word I say.

348
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:14,353
So I might as well have said,
"blah blah blah, blah, blabbity blah blah."

349
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:17,731
How'd you like to go on a little field trip?

350
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:22,486
Duncan's on the move and if we hurry,
we might be able make it for the
branding and the blood sacrifice.

351
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,404
Actually, I planned on hitting a few bars.

352
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:28,951
I found this little beauty in my
locker after seventh period.

353
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,202
Let me see that.

354
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:35,290
The ink is bleeding at the edges,
the hologram is missing and

355
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,502
...the photo...is that your
yearbook picture, Wallace?

356
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:39,795
So what?

357
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:43,423
So this is a $250 piece of crap.

358
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:47,970
Now I'm not just falsely accused,
I'm genuinely offended.

359
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,765
All right, all I've heard, these guys
are bad news, so I want you to be careful.

360
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:58,146
I'm afraid, Veronica! I'm afraid!

361
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:16,665
I'm sure the Triton leaders consider
this initiation painful for their pledges

362
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:20,794
but honestly, aren't we the true victims?

363
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,296
Nice performance, Duncan.

364
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:25,716
I was wondering if you could introduce
me to a few of your Triton buddies.

365
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:28,385
Brawny gods just flocked up
to quiz and vex him.

366
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,095
If you could just tell me
who's in charge then I can

367
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:33,432
personally thank him for
putting fake IDs in my locker

368
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,851
and getting me hauled off
to the sheriff's department.

369
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:38,562
Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim, I...

370
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,481
That's very illuminating.
Forget about me for a second.

371
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:46,236
Tell me about Sunday night, you do know
that the Tritons are responsible for
putting a kid in the hospital, right?

372
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,741
Tim is in a coma right now because of
what your secret club forced him to do.

373
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,201
Can you live with that, Duncan?

374
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:55,454
The quick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dog, I...

375
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,673
Let's get out of here.
This is going nowhere.

376
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:11,178
Heads up. Looks like your
boy's having second thoughts.

377
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:14,223
Are you ready to talk?

378
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,022
The judges hold the vital scores.

379
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,525
You shall hear my voice
once I've heard yours.

380
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,818
The Great Triton.

381
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:33,742
Aw, what's up? What's up?

382
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:41,583
Next up we have... Veronica Mars!

383
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:47,506
Sing! Sing! Sing!

384
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:26,128
This song goes out to my
friends in the Tritons.

385
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,720
One way or another

386
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,263
I'm gonna find ya

387
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,265
I'm gonna getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha

388
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,642
One way or another

389
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,144
I'm gonna win ya

390
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,146
I'm gonna getcha, I'll getcha

391
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,607
One way or another

392
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,192
I'm gonna see ya

393
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,235
I'm gonna meetcha, meetcha,
meetcha, meetcha.

394
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,696
One day, maybe next week

395
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,281
I'm gonna meetcha.

396
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,241
I'm gonna meetcha, I'll meetcha.

397
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:59,286
I'll walk down the mall,
stand over by the wall

398
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,206
Where I can see it all,
find out who ya call

399
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,208
Lead you to the supermarket check out

400
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,627
See some specials and rap then

401
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,295
Get lost in the crowd

402
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,631
One way or another

403
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,716
I'm gonna getcha, getcha,
getcha, getcha

404
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,259
Getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha

405
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,428
One way or another

406
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:18,388
I'm gonna getcha, I'll getcha

407
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,140
I'll getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha

408
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,392
One way or another

409
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:24,269
I'm gonna getcha, I'll getcha

410
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:25,979
I'll getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha

411
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:28,315
One way or another

412
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,275
I'm gonna getcha, I'll getcha

413
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,944
I'll getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha

414
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:34,279
One way or another

415
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,031
I'm gonna getcha, I'll getcha

416
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,658
I'll getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha

417
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,910
One way

418
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:45,457
Thank you.

419
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:54,508
- Let's here it for Veronica Mars!
- Nice job, V.

420
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,094
<i>Meet me in the bathroom - alone.</i>

421
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,309
Hello?

422
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:07,896
The Great Triton is listening.

423
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:12,442
I wanna know why you planted
all those fake IDs in my locker.

424
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:17,823
The Great Triton did that
to you because he's great.

425
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,118
Yeah, you're a real pal unless
you need a ride to the hospital.

426
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:22,703
The Great Triton...

427
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:27,124
doesn't really know
what you're talking about.

428
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,837
- Who are you?
- Jeff.

429
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:35,883
- What are you doing in here?
- Some dude, he gave me twenty bucks.

430
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:39,219
He said he wanted to pull
a prank on one of his friends.

431
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:04,661
Veronica! They found out.

432
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:07,289
I don't know how but they must have
found out I've been talking to you.

433
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,540
Easy! What happened?

434
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:12,878
Last night, there was a knock on the
door. When I opened it, I found a rat.

435
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,922
They nailed the thing alive
to the front door.

436
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,423
Pull it together, Rick.

437
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:19,218
We've a seven figure
lawsuit to worry about.

438
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:21,386
There's no doing this thing halfway.

439
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,473
We have to make sure what happened
to Tim never happens again.

440
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,322
You missed our last three appointments.

441
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,368
I'm sorry. I've been buried.

442
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:46,995
Thanks for waiting around for me.

443
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:54,419
<i>Lilly used to make this face
when my mom was railing on me
that would make me lose it.</i>

444
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:59,842
So I-I'd try not to look at her but I
could like, feel her making the face at me.

445
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:03,136
And that's what it's like, all the time.

446
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,973
I think she's watching me.

447
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:10,853
It's like whenever I do anything,
I-I can feel her there and

448
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:15,440
she can see me. It-it's like
I'm never, ever alone.

449
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,279
I sound like a total psycho.

450
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:24,700
- You sound like someone who lost his sister.
- And his mind.

451
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,202
How long have you been feeling like this?

452
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,621
Since I stopped taking my meds.

453
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:33,292
Uh, does your physician know about this?

454
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:36,336
Have you had any episodes?

455
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,549
Oh, I only stopped the anti-depressant.
I'm still taking the old stand-bys.

456
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,593
- What kind of episodes?
- I'm not stupid.

457
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,636
What kind of medication?

458
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,555
<i>It does explain a lot.</i>

459
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,932
The medication...calmed you.

460
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:53,896
Maybe even prohibited you from
fully processing your sister's death.

461
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:58,692
You know, all that turmoil was suppressed
for the past year, maybe it's...

462
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:01,320
finally making its way to the surface.

463
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:05,532
- What, you don't agree?
- I don't know.

464
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:09,203
I think she's mad that I don't remember.

465
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:11,747
Are you starting to forget
things about Lilly?

466
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:15,584
Oh, I remember Lilly. I-I just don't
remember what happened.

467
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:18,837
I remember being at soccer
practice that morning.

468
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:22,841
Then I was in the back of a limo and...

469
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:28,972
it was three days later and Lilly was
dead an-and all that time in between was just...

470
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,059
gone.

471
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:38,148
Aren't you forgetting something,
Wallace? The secret knock?

472
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,527
Hey! Hey!

473
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:02,631
Hey, Wallace, whatcha doin'?

474
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:06,134
Uh-huh. No, I haven't seen that one.

475
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,470
Yes, Dave Chapelle is great.

476
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:13,308
Listen, the real reason
I'm calling? Funny story....

477
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:29,783
Thanks, Wallace.

478
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:37,040
Uh, Veronica? I'm assuming you didn't
accidentally lock yourself in the trunk?

479
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,417
I'll tell you all about it later, Wallace.

480
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,712
Right now I have to track down Duncan
and figure out where the Tritons
are meeting tonight.

481
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:44,381
<i>Triton. Son of Neptune.</i>

482
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:47,885
<i>Rise up from the wine dark sea.</i>

483
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,595
<i>Oh great one.</i>

484
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:54,474
<i>With your horn, we summon you
from beneath the terrible waves.</i>

485
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:59,104
<i>With your horn, we summon
your awesome powers.</i>

486
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:04,776
<i>With your horn, we summon
your unrivalled wisdom.</i>

487
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,283
Congratulations.

488
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:13,785
When you began this journey
twelve days ago,

489
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:16,246
you were told that it would be perilous.

490
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:20,918
I am pleased to say that this year,
all the pledges have passed
the Great Triton's test.

491
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:24,505
Oh yeah? Except for kid who
almost drank himself to death.

492
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,090
And the kid that you
almost scared to death.

493
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:29,801
Now that our scared number
is again complete,

494
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:34,014
you may look upon the other
Tritons as your brothers.

495
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:43,982
Hi everybody! Say repressed homosexuality.

496
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,026
Gotta boogie!

497
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,180
Man! Did you see me lay
rubber in that LeBaron?

498
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:16,890
Don't get carried away.

499
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,478
All right. All I have to do now is show
that the Tritons are the ones operating
the mystery locker.

500
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,689
Match one of their faces in these shots

501
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:27,401
with the frame of whoever picked up
the two-fifty for your fake ID.

502
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:28,861
Piece of cake.

503
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,044
This doesn't make sense.
Someone had to open that locker.

504
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:47,838
How else could they have gotten the money?

505
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:50,048
How else could they have
gotten Wallace's name?

506
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:52,759
Veronica, I'm still here, you know?

507
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,263
- One-ten is a top locker, right?
- Yeah.

508
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:57,848
No one goes near it.

509
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,726
I know how it went down.

510
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,353
Great. Can I go home?

511
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,481
Aaron, thanks for stopping by.

512
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:09,950
No problem, I, ah, gotta be at school
at nine for a parent conference.

513
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:11,219
You were on the way.

514
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:14,406
I found out who's been
selling the pictures.

515
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:15,991
You're not gonna like it.

516
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:19,661
It couldn't get much worse
than it already is.

517
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,670
Your court date isn't until
next Tuesday, right?

518
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:30,839
We might as well go ahead and
cancel that while I'm here.

519
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:32,925
Really? Why's that?

520
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:35,552
Well I thought, for a change,

521
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:39,264
you might be interested in having
the real criminal stand trial.

522
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:41,642
In the meantime, I'm gonna
have a seat in your lounge,

523
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:44,353
learn how to turn men into jelly
with a new way of walking and

524
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:46,563
wait for the bad guy to turn himself in.

525
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:47,731
I don't have time for your games.

526
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:50,400
And I don't have time to wrongfully
tamper with a government issued document

527
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:54,488
if I'm stuck here in your office.
I'll make you a little deal, Lamb.

528
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:59,284
If I don't deliver the person who put
Tim in the hospital by 5pm today,

529
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:02,579
I promise to walk,
with a little something extra,

530
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:07,668
into the courthouse on Tuesday and plead
guilty to anything you want to throw at me.

531
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,253
What do I have to do?

532
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,672
Just pick a name.

533
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:17,094
Write the name of any
student on this post-it,

534
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:20,430
put it in the envelope and have one of
your minions drop it into locker one-ten.

535
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:23,016
By the end of the day,
that kid'll have a fake ID

536
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:24,977
and you'll have yourself a crook.

537
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,688
And I'll be sittin' over here,
chillin' like a villain.

538
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,129
Hey, Rick. I'm down at the sheriff's office.

539
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:55,048
Hey, they're hauling in the
real bad guy this afternoon.

540
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:58,260
Oh, and I found out who the Tritons are.

541
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:02,681
You don't want to miss it.
I'm going to nail 'em to the wall.

542
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:14,610
So... What was the plan?

543
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:16,820
Embarrass me?

544
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,490
Destroy my career?

545
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,618
Soften up public sentiment
for a generous divorce settlement?

546
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,203
Turn me into Costner?

547
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:28,290
Course, you'd think of your career and
your money before you'd think of the obvious.

548
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:32,252
Did it ever occur to you, I just want
to hurt you like you've hurt me?

549
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:35,631
- You had private detectives following me.
- Only on location.

550
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,925
The women here I've always known.

551
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:42,179
Gosh, Mom. Gee, Dad. Will I be
going to live with Grandma?

552
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:44,598
Listen to me.

553
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:48,560
If you try to divorce me,
I will leave you with nothing.

554
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:49,811
No house.

555
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,273
No career. No club memberships.

556
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,234
No maid and no friends-

557
00:37:55,275 --> 00:38:00,239
Dad, you say another word
to her and I will kill you.

558
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:05,244
I cannot take this anymore.

559
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:43,365
The thing about a felony charge is,

560
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:46,952
it doesn't get wiped off your record
just because you turn eighteen.

561
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:51,206
It's like this black eye that you
have the whole rest of your life.

562
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:58,005
- Is he here yet?
- He just arrived.

563
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:02,259
Uh, it's just like she said.
Found the fake in his locker.

564
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:05,596
Process of elimination. I didn't do it.

565
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,598
What, me? Are you crazy?

566
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,559
How else do you explain
the two fifty in your wallet?

567
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,144
Cough it up.

568
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,190
Big deal, this money's mine.
It doesn't prove anything.

569
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:18,525
Why don't you take a closer
look at the one on top.

570
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,986
Read what's written over Grant's head.

571
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:22,738
Veronica Mars is...

572
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:25,824
- smarter than me.
- Oh, you stop it!

573
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:29,119
So this is Rick's locker that Deputy
Sacks put the envelope in this morning?

574
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:30,412
Not exactly.

575
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:52,434
The night Tim went to the hospital,
he and Rick were using their own fake IDs,

576
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,608
buying their own drinks and

577
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:56,605
enjoying the profits of
their own fake ID biz.

578
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,357
You were never hazed.

579
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,401
You tried blaming the Tritons because
you were pissed off at them.

580
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:03,195
Your dad and your brother are Tritons

581
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:05,405
but you didn't measure up, did you Rick?

582
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:08,325
You weren't even invited
to join their secret society.

583
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:11,036
So when you were called into the office,

584
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,914
you dumped a bunch of blank
IDs and you blamed me.

585
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,084
But why me?

586
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:20,087
Was is just because people
would believe that I did it?

587
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:24,466
All right. Since you asked.

588
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:30,264
Last year your dad was hired to track
down a hedge fund manager for embezzlement.

589
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,432
That was my father.

590
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:37,813
Only the newspapers never mentioned
that his company cheated him out
of his bonus three years running.

591
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,732
They took our house, they took our cars.

592
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:44,570
Eventually, my parents got a divorce.

593
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:48,991
You must be proud.

594
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:55,038
Hey!

595
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,209
These are for you.

596
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:03,797
You look kinda cute in one of them.
Surprised but...cute.

597
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:08,260
Your secret's safe with me.

598
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:13,223
- I heard that guy Tim came out of his coma.
- Yeah.

599
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:19,104
Look, I never should have
doubted you, Duncan.

600
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,607
I'm sorry I came after the Tritons.

601
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:24,818
And who are the Tritons?

602
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,744
Another hole in Duncan's memory?
At least he can joke about it.

603
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,997
To pass him in the hallway,
you'd never guess that anything was wrong.

604
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,082
But I heard it out of his own mouth.

605
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:42,461
So what exactly is your
mystery illness, Duncan?

606
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:45,506
And what other pills are you taking?

607
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:57,309
<i>Dispatch, this is G12 requesting assistance
for possible jumper on the Coronado Bridge.</i>

608
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:00,145
<i>The abandoned vehicle is a red Dodge Viper,</i>

609
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:04,024
<i>licence plate ECHOLLS 2
blocking the northbound lane.</i>

610
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,297
<i>Roger that, 12.</i>

611
