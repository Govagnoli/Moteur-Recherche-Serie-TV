00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,506
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:02,603
It's Terrence Cook and...

3
00:00:02,614 --> 00:00:04,622
Miss Dumass,
the journalism teacher.

4
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:06,008
Who died in the bus crash.

5
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:08,465
He also has some gambling issues.

6
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,900
I have information about
that mexican kid who got killed.

7
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:13,972
Your 911 caller,
aka Tom Griffith,

8
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:16,102
is dr. Tom Griffith.

9
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:17,532
Our favorite plastic surgeon

10
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,073
seems to be owned
by the fighting Fitzpatricks.

11
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,362
Hey, daddy.

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,423
So you guys were like a couple?

13
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:26,757
I was madly in love and 100% gay.

14
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:28,224
What is that?

15
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:29,758
What do you call yours?

16
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:34,456
[The Dandelions - "On the 54"]

17
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:38,763
Yeah, yeah!

18
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:40,442
Shake it out now

19
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:41,950
Shake it out now

20
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:43,251
Come on,

21
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:44,817
Shake it out, yeah!

22
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:46,344
Shake it out now

23
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,227
Shake it out now

24
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:49,399
Come on,

25
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:50,955
Shake it out, yeah!

26
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:52,385
Shake it out now

27
00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:53,870
Shake it out now

28
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:55,413
Come on,

29
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:57,201
Shake it out, yeah!

30
00:00:57,412 --> 00:00:58,722
Shake it out now

31
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:00,127
Shake it out now

32
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:01,472
Come on,

33
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:03,303
Shake it out, yeah!

34
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:12,956
Dick!

35
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,361
You totally nailed me.

36
00:01:14,362 --> 00:01:15,446
Oh, man.

37
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:17,748
So you're the fingernails chick
from my new year's party.

38
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:19,080
I did nail you.

39
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:21,234
That's funny.
I remember you taller and less uppity.

40
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:22,752
My car just now.

41
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:24,386
Oh, jeez.

42
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:26,012
Maybe we should get
the highway patrol down here

43
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:27,182
and take some pictures
or something.

44
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,179
Give me a break.

45
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,792
I barely even touched your stupid door.

46
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:31,242
You left some paint.
Look.

47
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:33,168
It's only the most valuable
thing on your car.

48
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:35,603
You might want to frisk her
before you get in the backseat.

49
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:37,388
She could be smuggling junk.

50
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,490
You're ones to talk.

51
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:40,068
Baseball players, right?

52
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:41,868
Remind me. Which one of you pitches

53
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:42,789
and which one catches?

54
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:45,983
Relax, Dick, we're not
saying that you're gay.

55
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,309
I mean, just because you make out
with a dude here and there.

56
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:57,700
Strawberry soda.
It's a fine choice.

57
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:06,150
Well, where were we?

58
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,208
Oh, yes, I remember.

59
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:16,541
You sure you don't want to take
this somewhere else more private,

60
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,831
like the trunk of your car?

61
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:22,277
It's called a stolen moment
'cause we're sneaky about it.

62
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:26,079
Ever consider that maybe you're not
as notorious as you think you are?

63
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:28,578
Come on. Admit it.
Your dad went off on you

64
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,871
for getting cuddly with me
at the carnival, right?

65
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,643
My dad didn't say a thing.

66
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:38,821
Maybe it's just that I really
want to be alone with you.

67
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:42,861
So when do you want
to be alone with me again?

68
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:44,645
Saturday.

69
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:46,925
I'm staying at my dad's this weekend.

70
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,597
You can come by and
watch a movie if you want.

71
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,406
I want.

72
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,204
I got Lamb turning
my house upside down.

73
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:58,877
I got the paparazzi
following me day and night

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,376
just waiting for me to fall apart
and make a run for it in my bronco.

75
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,301
I swear, there's a news chopper
following me around.

76
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:09,828
If Lamb doesn't press charges,
if you're not indicted,

77
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,407
this media frenzy will be
gone before you know it.

78
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:15,237
Let's concern ourselves
more with keeping you out of jail.

79
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:15,949
How?

80
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,683
I mean, you said it yourself.

81
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,227
If all I took was a phone
call to blow up that bus,

82
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:21,797
anybody could have
done it from anywhere.

83
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:22,869
So why not me?

84
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,522
A gambler, a cheater,

85
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:26,485
a deadbeat. Who's gonna...

86
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:27,958
Stop.
You had me at "gambler."

87
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:31,008
Terrence, relax.

88
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:34,788
Just tell me what you can remember
from the day of the crash.

89
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:37,586
I met those kids out at the park.

90
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:42,144
And like I said, I talked
with Woody, signed some stuff.

91
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:45,868
I was out of there
around 5:00, I guess.

92
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:47,861
The bus went over at 7:03.

93
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,244
Next thing I can remember
was around 11:00 maybe,

94
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:52,474
when I turned on the
tv and heard the news.

95
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:55,703
You don't remember anything
you did in between 5:00 and 11:00?

96
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:58,205
Nope.

97
00:04:01,122 --> 00:04:02,553
You got something to say?

98
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:03,849
You remember nothing?

99
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:05,945
Where were you at 7:03 that day?

100
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:09,686
I suppose I don't know.

101
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:11,505
Well, maybe you blew up the bus.

102
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:24,463
"Who  will spot the imposter
cheering in the second row?

103
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:29,706
How long can my pep-squad smile
hide the me I cannot show?" Wow.

104
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:31,819
That is so precious, Marlena.

105
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,821
And you even made it rhyme,

106
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:36,485
just like an indigo girls song.

107
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:37,669
I didn't write that.

108
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:38,702
Got  it.

109
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:43,184
Must be some other pep-squad lez
who has her gym locker next to mine.

110
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:44,985
Oh, wait.

111
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,536
Here's my favorite part.

112
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,389
"Taking off our clothes,

113
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,792
I put on my disguise.

114
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:51,551
But when we're in the shower,

115
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,064
can madison feel my eyes?"

116
00:05:01,873 --> 00:05:02,965
I've got a problem.

117
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:09,926
Have you heard about
the pizza-boy muggings?

118
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:11,476
I heard about Corny.

119
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,841
Yeah, Corny was victim number five.

120
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:13,941
I was number four.

121
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,148
Look, I need you to find
the guy who ripped me off.

122
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:20,457
Sounds like a police matter to me.

123
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,755
I had something in my wallet...

124
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:25,292
a list that wasn't supposed
to get out ever.

125
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,100
That whole Marlena thing...

126
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:28,952
it was my fault.

127
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:31,525
I don't get it.

128
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:35,961
Well, Marlena's name was on a list
with nine other gay students.

129
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:38,048
That poem everyone was making fun of,

130
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:40,198
Marlena posted it onto
a website that I set up.

131
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,793
You set up a poetry website?

132
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:42,782
A chat room.

133
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:46,175
It's called the pirate's S.H.I.P....

134
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:49,124
You know, "student homosexual
internet posting."

135
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:52,524
I was in charge of maintaining
user names and passwords.

136
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:53,278
Only the list...

137
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,406
I follow. But why would a mugger
want to out sweet little Marlena?

138
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:01,997
Because she didn't have the $5,000
he demanded from her to stay in.

139
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,403
Why can't the evil just get
jobs like the rest of us?

140
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:08,613
Look, we're willing to pay you.

141
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,565
Who's "we," and what are you offering?

142
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:13,827
I can't give you names,
but we're each good for $100.

143
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,705
Find out who's doing
the blackmailing, all right?

145
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,463
<i>We used to be friends, but I</i>

146
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:29,397
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

147
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:32,646
<i>Come on, now, sugar!</i>

148
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:35,213
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

149
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:38,725
<i>Just remember me when</i>

150
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,148
<i>We used to be friends</i>

151
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:43,011

<i>Veronica Mars 2x14

154
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,951
So what they'd get off you,
Corny?

155
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:55,028
Oh, all the cash and my tunes.

156
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,735
Oh, and the pizza, you know?

157
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:58,863
It was pepperoni, thick crust.

158
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,159
It was a real nice pie.

159
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,351
Sound like the guy who mugged you?

160
00:07:03,564 --> 00:07:04,633
Yeah, same part of town even.

161
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,607
I got hit in south Neptune,
down on Alvarado.

162
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:08,484
Do you think they were
real orders, or...?

163
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:09,357
No. Bogus.

164
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,763
Mr. Cho called both places
back after the muggings.

165
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:13,271
The people there hadn't ordered pizzas.

166
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:15,798
Either of you remember the names
that went with the fake orders?

167
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:17,680
Yeah, man, I do.

168
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,106
You know Amy Asparzo from gym glass?

169
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:22,311
That's whose house I was headed to.

170
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,628
I remember distinctly
'cause I was like,

171
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:28,549
"damn, what if Amy answers
the door in her unmentionables?"

172
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,878
That would've been sweet.

173
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:35,302
Can you get me a list of the names
and addresses the mugger used, Ryan?

174
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:39,774
First of all, I'm not letting her lear
to surf on one of my boards.

175
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,233
I'd sooner let her paddle out
on my mother.

176
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:42,673
Of course you would.

177
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:45,475
Right? I'm thinking she can
come with us to Cabo.

178
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:49,526
Hey, you two look like you're in the
market for some spirit paraphernalia.

179
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:50,702
I recommend the button.

180
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:52,248
They're awful tempting.

181
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:54,247
Well, they're for a really good cause.

182
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:56,171
That was sarcasm,
by the way.

183
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:58,000
Dude, you know where we got to go?

184
00:07:58,206 --> 00:07:59,790
We got to go to scorpion bay again.

185
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:00,563
Thanks.

186
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:02,187
Camping on the beach.

187
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,883
Endless right-point break.

188
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,130
That's our place, man.

189
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:19,312
I need your help,
Veronica.

190
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,891
Sorry, Kylee. I'm working
at capacity right now.

191
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:22,947
You don't understand.

192
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:26,845
I'm being blackmailed.

193
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:30,089
It's just... Ryan told me
I could talk to you.

194
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:30,873
Really?

195
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:32,649
You're being blackmailed?

196
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,778
Sorry to blow your mind,

197
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,228
but  I'm a lesbian, Veronica.

198
00:08:35,743 --> 00:08:36,791
Oh.

199
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:39,685
Well...that's cool.

200
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:41,211
Only when you're in college.

201
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:42,735
Did you bring the blackmail note?

202
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:46,872
I don't have that kind of money.

203
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,885
I'm  dead.

204
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,028
Respond to the e-mail.

205
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,713
Ask for another 24 hours.

206
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,668
I'll handle the cash
and drop-off, okay?

207
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:56,080
Thanks, Veronica.

208
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:02,167
Got it.

209
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,536
Mars Investigations.

210
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:09,123
Sure.

211
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:15,001
Thanks.
I'll let him know.

212
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:23,163
They're gonna fax through that
credit-card statement you asked for.

213
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,701
Good.
Thanks, honey.

214
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,499
Terrence Cook's credit-card statement.

215
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:33,181
So...are we working for
accused mass murderers now?

216
00:09:33,878 --> 00:09:34,739
That's right.

217
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,624
You sure you're not clouded
by your years of being his biggest fan?

218
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:40,153
I don't know.
Maybe.

219
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:42,972
Let's just call it a gut thing.

220
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,787
Besides, I thought you'd be excited.

221
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:45,744
By what?

222
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:48,570
If Terrence is guilty,
that means I'm off the hook?

223
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:51,089
Everyone didn't die because of me?

224
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:56,130
Excited that I'm helping
your friend's dad.

225
00:09:57,035 --> 00:09:59,089
Where are you getting your intel?

226
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:04,900
Jackie and I aren't exactly
the sisterhood of the traveling pants.

227
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:07,683
She's not what you'd call huggable.

228
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:10,817
Whereas you warm right up
to people? Hmm.

229
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:12,943
Hmm.

230
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:13,888
Hmm.

231
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:19,243
I want to help, and your
gut is good enough for me.

232
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:22,616
I need to feel like I'm doing
something right now.

233
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:25,524
Terrence will be by in a bit.

234
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:28,411
Would you mind making
a couple calls for me?

235
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:29,563
No sweat.

236
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:38,946
You can head right in.

237
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:40,370
Hi.

238
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:43,762
This is Veronica Mars
calling from Mars Investigations.

239
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:48,429
I've got calls made to your agent, your
brother, your assistant... on and on.

240
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:52,284
No one seems to know where
you were when you made them.

241
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:55,256
Got something.

242
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:56,047
My daughter.

243
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:57,452
Yeah, we've met.

244
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,661
You know the name Hank Melton?

245
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,085
No.

246
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:04,515
He works for mint condition
car detailing off the interstate.

247
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:05,777
Oh, Crazy Hank?

248
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:06,842
Yeah, I know that guy.

249
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,555
He works on my car whenever.

250
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:13,850
Veronica,
can you give us a minute?

251
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:21,147
Terrence?

252
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,749
I call Hank whenever
I hit the Seven Rivers Casino.

253
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:25,903
So you were in the casino that day,

254
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,772
possibly when the bus crashed?

255
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:28,877
Yeah, I say it's likely.

256
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,747
That's great news.

257
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:32,901
Casinos happen to be the most
photographed places on earth.

258
00:11:33,298 --> 00:11:35,931
Well, good luck getting
that surveillance footage, Keith.

259
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,743
Do you know who Leonard Lobo is?

260
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:39,452
The guy who runs Seven Rivers?

261
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:41,510
Actually, several
of the indian casinos.

262
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,397
What's Lobo got against you?

263
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:46,761
Millions  of dollars'
worth of outstanding debt.

264
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:50,496
You know those guys the sheriff
caught loitering outside of my house?

265
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:51,494
Fitzpatricks.

266
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:53,324
Delivering a message for Leonard Lobo.

267
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,041
His way of saying
that my payments are overdue.

268
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,404
<i>Mr. Pleacher and the Neptune High
science department </i>

269
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,025
<i>would like to invite you all
to the annual physics olympics.</i>

270
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:07,520
<i>The competition will be held in the
gym following 7th period this afternoon</i>

271
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:08,715
Last night was a bust?

272
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:12,066
What, two hours spent tracking
a dummy e-mail address?

273
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:13,751
Maybe this will help.

274
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,522
All the names and addresses
to any ordered pizzas.

275
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:19,769
You got to do something,
Veronica.

276
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:22,774
I'm getting like 100 e-mails a day
from my pirate's S.H.I.P. Peeps.

277
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:24,427
They're really starting to freak.

278
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,072
What?

279
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:28,331
What? You know one of them?

280
00:12:28,396 --> 00:12:29,217
Yeah, I've...

281
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,834
<i>Let's go to Kylee Marker for the story.</i>

282
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:32,848
<i>She's out in the parking lot live.</i>

283
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:34,916
<i>The pizza-boy mugger
added to his repertoire.</i>

284
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,597
<i>Although the M.O. was the same,</i>

285
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:37,664
<i>a taser to the neck,</i>

286
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,510
<i>this time he chose
a seemingly random victim...</i>

287
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:42,898
<i>baseball player Kelly Kuzzio.</i>

288
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:44,451
<i>After last night's game,</i>

289
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:46,676
<i>I stopped at sac-n-pac to grab a drink.</i>

290
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:50,158
<i>Got out of my car and bam!
Lights out.</i>

291
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,151
<i>He took my watch,
my wallet.</i>

292
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:53,875
<i>But what really sucked...</i>

293
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,637
<i>he stole my rims.</i>

294
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,726
<i>Six grand those cost me.</i>

295
00:12:58,115 --> 00:13:00,841
<i>Before I send it back,
I'd like to add a personal message.</i>

296
00:13:01,684 --> 00:13:02,524
<i>I'm gay.</i>

297
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,472
<i>Marlena Nichols is my girlfriend.</i>

298
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:06,390
<i>So, pizza-boy mugger,</i>

299
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,676
<i>you can forget
about collecting from me.</i>

300
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:09,824
<i>John?</i>

301
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:15,123
Well, it looks like Kylee
won't be needing my help anymore.

302
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,121
That totally rocks.

303
00:13:36,444 --> 00:13:39,105
Dude, why are lesbians, like,
so pissed off all the time?

304
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:41,775
Let your freak flag fly,
ladies!

305
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,797
How progressive of you, Dick.

306
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,084
Damn.
What is it with you?

307
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:48,973
Do you follow me
around for fun or what?

308
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:52,231
Would it help if I started making out
with my girlfriend in the hall?

309
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:54,196
Yeah, obviously.

310
00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:56,863
But, look, I'll fix your car,
whatever.

311
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:58,465
You got to learn to leave me alone.

312
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:01,750
And here I thought
we were getting to be pals.

313
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:02,767
Please.

314
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:05,029
You date Logan.
He's nailed for murder.

315
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:06,597
You date Duncan.
He's wanted for kidnapping.

316
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:09,613
You get put on Robbie and
Hunter's jury, they get sent to Chino.

317
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:12,421
You're like rich-dude
kryptonite, Veronica.

318
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,587
This rich dude wants no part of it.

319
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,789
Hey, Carmen.

320
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:26,809
Heard from our favorite
videographer lately?

321
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:28,611
He called over Christmas

322
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:31,470
to try to apologize for
that whole popsicle thing.

323
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,048
Like people even remember
my scandal anymore.

324
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:36,310
Pleasuring inanimate
objects was so 2005.

325
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:40,365
Yeah, this year's all about
pulling kids out of the closet.

326
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:43,177
So I have a feeling
we're not just catching up here.

327
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,650
Any idea why the pizza mugger
used your name?

328
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:48,695
No.

329
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,403
You mind looking at something?

330
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:54,596
Obviously you, John Ramos,
and Amy are all students.

331
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,038
You live relatively close,

332
00:14:56,846 --> 00:15:00,218
but is there anything else that would
tie you together in the mugger's mind?

333
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,737
We're all coconuts.

334
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,044
That's what you get called in Neptune

335
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:08,547
when you're latino and date white
people or join honor society.

336
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:10,708
Get it?
Like twinkies and oreos.

337
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,507
Except  we're brown
on the outside and...

338
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:13,662
No. I get it.

339
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:15,140
I...I'm sorry.

340
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:17,159
Hey, you didn't make the rules.

341
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:20,511
I hope you get your bad guy,
Veronica.

342
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:23,079
Actually, you could help.

343
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:27,384
Can you make me a list of everyone you
can think of who gets made fun of for -

344
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:28,989
- you know...

345
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,380
...being a coconut?

346
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:37,024
Sorry about your car,
Kelly.

347
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:38,230
Yeah. Thanks.

348
00:15:38,282 --> 00:15:39,694
Did you get a look at
the guy who zapped you?

349
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,375
No. Nothing.

350
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:44,057
I was getting in my car
at the sac-n-pac.

351
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:46,896
Next thing I knew, I was waking up
and my car was up on blocks.

352
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:48,641
You must have been out a long time.

353
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,789
I can't believe no one called the cops.

354
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,001
I mean, how long would it take
to get the rims off a car?

355
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:54,430
How should I know?

356
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:56,013
I mean, did they bring
their own jack, or...

357
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:58,962
Look, I already told all
this stuff to the cops.

358
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,801
Why do I need to say it again to you?

359
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,998
You gonna let me in?

360
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:25,159
Well, I'm trying to act like
I don't know you, but...

361
00:16:27,842 --> 00:16:29,421
I don't know how you do it.

362
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,809
You've got some serious skill.

363
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,284
It's more of an innate ability
to compartmentalize.

364
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,610
Look, I feel like I'm waiting for
a tip or something.

365
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:41,972
Can you let me in?

366
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,759
My first girlfriend was murdered.

367
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,788
My last girlfriend nearly got
shotgunned by a P.C.H.Er drive-by.

368
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:56,997
Color me crazy,
but I see a pattern.

369
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,277
I'm trying to protect you.

370
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,866
So when did your folks split up?

371
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:21,647
Just a year ago.

372
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:26,092
They tell you why?

373
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:28,977
The official answer...
they grew apart.

374
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:33,407
Unofficially, I kept hearing them
scream at each other about money.

375
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:36,728
Hannah?

376
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:38,189
Hi, dad.

377
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:40,030
This is Logan.

378
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:43,146
Hello.

379
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:50,272
And there's the Griffith charm.

380
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:54,143
Sorry. That's about
the most you'll get out of dad.

381
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,091
What are you doing with my daughter?

382
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:07,672
You want the complete play-by-play?

383
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,164
That's kind of twisted.

384
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:11,958
I want you to get out of my house
and never speak to her again.

385
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:13,713
You really want that to happen?

386
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:15,678
You better rethink what
you saw on the bridge.

387
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:18,738
Scratch that. What the
Fitzpatricks told you you saw.

388
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:20,607
You can't threaten me,
you little punk.

389
00:18:20,653 --> 00:18:22,412
I wouldn't be here
if you couldn't be threatened.

390
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:25,492
So do you want me to explain
to Hannah why you're really here,

391
00:18:25,493 --> 00:18:26,635
try and bully me?

392
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:28,490
Well, why don't you tell her?

393
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:30,851
Sounds like you guys
are already so close.

394
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:32,913
I'm sure she'll see things your way.

395
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:35,625
Please don't do this.

396
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:37,760
While you're at it, try explaining

397
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:41,410
why you never mentioned how you're
the mystery witness in my murder case.

398
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:42,989
That'll be good.

399
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,310
I guess that never came up on
your drive home from the carnival.

400
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:50,511
I'm thinking we're done here.

401
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:52,849
I don't want to keep Hannah waiting.

402
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:00,374
You're joking.

403
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:03,337
Terrence Cook wants another favor.

404
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:07,098
Frankly, I'm not sure he wants to owe
me any more than he already does.

405
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:10,547
Well, he thinks you might
have security footage of him

406
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,181
from september 13 of last year,

407
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,054
the day of the bus crash.

408
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:19,946
And what's he paying you,
mr. Mars?

409
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:22,474
$400 a day.

410
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:25,800
That's $400 a day
he should be paying me.

411
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,140
Terrence Cook's gonna get charged
with murder any day now.

412
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:31,438
Terrence Cook owes me
a significant amount of money.

413
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,977
That's where my interest
in him begins and ends.

414
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:36,812
They can swing him from
the rafters for all I care.

415
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:39,796
Maybe all that swinging will drop
some change from his pockets.

416
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:43,859
It might be a little hard to get
paid by an incarcerated man.

417
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:48,482
Reggie...

418
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,039
check the tapes.

419
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,865
See what you come up with.

420
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:55,683
Do you like to gamble,
mr. Mars?

421
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:58,140
Perhaps I could interest
you in a line of credit.

422
00:19:58,141 --> 00:19:59,081
No, thanks.

423
00:20:00,987 --> 00:20:02,195
Good man.

424
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:04,818
Here's a couple of bucks
on the house, then.

425
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:07,765
Have some fun while you're waiting.

426
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:17,984
See?

427
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:21,002
Wasn't this better than champagne
and ocean views?

428
00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:27,838
Until tomorrow.

429
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,821
I need to talk to you,
Hannah.

430
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:01,950
Sir?

431
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:07,175
It's two bucks, buddy.

432
00:21:12,514 --> 00:21:14,270
And king makes 22.

433
00:21:21,752 --> 00:21:23,925
Oh, man, Cho's is going off tonight.

434
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:26,577
That's what happens when the chains
stop delivering to south Neptune.

435
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:27,701
Cho's 'za.

436
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:28,959
Yeah. No problemo.

437
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:31,227
Can I get your name and number, please?

438
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,147
Jorge Zideo is a ringer.

439
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:43,255
His name's on Carmen's list.

440
00:21:43,256 --> 00:21:45,108
So are you ready to be the bait, Corny?

441
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:46,529
Hell, yeah.
No one's better.

442
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:48,772
I'm what you'd call the "master bait".

443
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:58,277
There you go. Straight off
the surveillance hard drive.

444
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:05,327
There's five minutes missing.

445
00:22:06,331 --> 00:22:09,098
Maybe he was in the john
or the elevator. I don't know.

446
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:11,687
That Terrence Cook
is a mighty slippery fellow.

447
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,871
I need a picture
of him at exactly 7:03.

448
00:22:15,923 --> 00:22:17,132
These aren't going to help.

449
00:22:35,218 --> 00:22:36,480
You got to take it outside.

450
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,412
Your cellphone.

451
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:42,175
We jam all the signals
in a 100-yard radius.

452
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:43,855
Card cheaters.
You know.

453
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,373
- Thanks.
- Sure.

454
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:18,299
Tell... tell him to chill.

455
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,444
Lose the mask.

456
00:23:19,662 --> 00:23:20,720
Down, boy.

457
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:22,271
What's your name, kid?

458
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,344
Do you want to deal with me,

459
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:27,677
or do you want
to deal with mr. Chompers?

460
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:30,328
Arturo.

461
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:31,993
Who are you working with,
Arturo?

462
00:23:32,689 --> 00:23:34,295
I'm not working with no one.

463
00:23:34,343 --> 00:23:37,336
You're telling me you took down
a varsity jock, jacked his car,

464
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:39,623
stole his rims
all by your scrawny self?

465
00:23:39,696 --> 00:23:40,442
No.

466
00:23:40,443 --> 00:23:41,342
That wasn't me.

467
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,409
The others was.

468
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,402
No, I heard about it.

469
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:45,302
I figured I had me my own copycat.

470
00:23:46,184 --> 00:23:47,004
Cool, huh?

471
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:48,108
Give me a break, man.

472
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,871
You're some punk freshman.

473
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,241
Now give me back my tunes
before I kick your ass.

474
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:54,462
Just wait till I'm a P.C.H.Er,
shaggy.

475
00:23:54,463 --> 00:23:56,254
Then I'm gonna find your ass,
and you're gonna get yours.

476
00:23:56,523 --> 00:23:58,963
Thumper telling you to rob pizza boys?

477
00:23:58,964 --> 00:24:01,774
No, I'm proving myself
so he'll let me in.

478
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:04,412
P.C.H. Is back in charge,
lady.

479
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:07,194
Did you just call me "lady"?

480
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:10,033
Okay.

481
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:11,893
So the blackmailing...

482
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:15,094
is that another way
you're out proving yourself, Cholito?

483
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:17,087
Man, what are you
talking about?

484
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:18,938
Black-whatting?

485
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:23,536
Thanks for your cooperation.

486
00:24:23,982 --> 00:24:26,000
Looks like we're done here,
Arturo.

487
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:28,519
Cool.
Can I go home, then?

488
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:30,979
Almost.

489
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:16,834
I need you to get me into
a restricted website.

490
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:18,275
Sure, what's the address?

491
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,342
I don't know.

492
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:22,063
What's it for?

493
00:25:22,258 --> 00:25:25,355
It's a Neptune High gay chat room.

494
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,913
Veronica, you're not...

495
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:30,485
no, I'm just curious.

496
00:25:33,977 --> 00:25:37,762
Curious as to what's posted
on the website, more accurately.

497
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,054
Here we go.

498
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:42,430
Work your funky magic.

499
00:25:45,238 --> 00:25:46,446
And nothing.

500
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:47,907
What's the problem?

501
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,479
You set it up, didn't you?

502
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:55,289
Some ass-face got
onto their message board

503
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:56,934
and wrote some pretty awful stuff,

504
00:25:57,272 --> 00:25:59,639
so Ryan asked me
to beef up their security.

505
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,665
Yeah, I work for Ryan,
too, now.

506
00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:03,659
So if you could just...

507
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:06,465
So then why wouldn't he have
let you on it himself?

508
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:10,288
Damn you and your valid questions.

509
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:15,338
Look, it's still private if
I only see the usernames, right?

510
00:26:15,412 --> 00:26:17,141
Savvy detectives such as yourself

511
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:19,331
might deduce who
the pirate's S.H.I.P.Ers are.

512
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,691
Mac, the only way I can stop
the Marlenas and Kylees of this school

513
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,797
from being tormented is
if I get on that message board.

514
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:33,883
All right, stop it.
You're embarrassing me.

515
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:49,859
Okay, I'll make you a hard copy,

516
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,771
but you have to burn it
when you're done.

517
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:10,172
Excuse me, coach?

518
00:27:10,173 --> 00:27:11,870
Think I could ride
with the team tonight?

519
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:12,940
My car's in the shop,

520
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:15,354
and I promised your star point
guard I'd be there.

521
00:27:16,444 --> 00:27:19,999
Did I mention all the action shots
I'll take for the Navigator?

522
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,699
I'm sorry, Veronica,

523
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:24,618
we have a strict rule against
girls on the team bus.

524
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,588
I want them focused.

525
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:28,374
You can ride with me if you want.

526
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,185
I realize it's no bus filled
with rowdy towel-snapping jocks,

527
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,603
but it'll smell better.

528
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:36,566
I don't know.

529
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:37,747
Um...

530
00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:40,885
do you have room
for my giant foam finger?

531
00:27:40,886 --> 00:27:42,019
I do,

532
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,610
and I can even drop you
off around the block

533
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,224
if you're worried about
being seen together.

534
00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:47,333
Yes.

535
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:51,174
Please, by all means,
protect my reputation.

536
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:06,145
Don't blame Mac.

537
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:08,334
I made her print it out.

538
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:10,226
I don't care who's gay.

539
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:10,846
That's fine.

540
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:13,319
I just didn't want to let
you onto the site myself.

541
00:28:13,388 --> 00:28:14,864
I've let those guys down enough.

542
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:16,412
Ryan,
we caught the mugger.

543
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:19,796
He doesn't have the cranial
resources to spell blackmail,

544
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,345
let alone perform it.

545
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:24,618
The list getting out isn't your fault.

546
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:25,635
It never was.

547
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:28,555
I think the blackmailer
is one of your own posters.

548
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:29,442
What?

549
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,543
You're serious?

550
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,196
I was looking through some old chats.

551
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,847
Um, here.

552
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,302
Back in july, this guy
who calls himself "mizz P."

553
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,518
Went off about "the outing
of all outings in Neptune",

554
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,823
and then he vanished.

555
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:44,727
A tad ominous,
don't you think?

556
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:46,637
Mizz P. Ain't the bad guy,
Veronica.

557
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:51,186
His name was Peter Ferraire,
and...

558
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,192
he died in the bus crash.

559
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:55,197
Oh, I'm...

560
00:28:55,245 --> 00:28:56,686
and there's been
another blackmailing letter.

561
00:28:56,687 --> 00:28:58,044
Who are they after now?

562
00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:00,239
Oh, you can't be serious?

563
00:29:00,554 --> 00:29:02,376
I told the victim they could
come to you for help, but...

564
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:05,694
I wouldn't hold your
breath on this one.

565
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:06,605
Great.

566
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:10,546
I'll just head out into the hall
and look for the guy in the black hat

567
00:29:10,547 --> 00:29:11,783
twirling his moustache.

568
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:31,231
What are you doing?

569
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:32,897
That depends.

570
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,429
What are you gonna let me do?

571
00:29:35,465 --> 00:29:36,269
Look...

572
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:38,544
I know you stabbed
that kid on the bridge.

573
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:39,953
My dad told me everything.

574
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,046
No, your dad is a liar.

575
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,178
I didn't kill anyone, Hannah.

576
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:45,175
Your dad wasn't even there.

577
00:29:45,176 --> 00:29:46,816
I was worried you were
embarrassed of me,

578
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:48,427
and you were just using me.

579
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:49,642
When I met you at the carnival,

580
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,682
I had no idea who you were, I swear.

581
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,289
Look, the reason your parents were
fighting about money all the time...

582
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:57,993
it's because your dad
was blowing it on coke.

583
00:29:57,994 --> 00:29:58,962
My dad's a cokehead?

584
00:29:59,037 --> 00:30:00,742
Please, he's a doctor, Logan.

585
00:30:00,743 --> 00:30:03,723
And that's why a jury's gonna buy
it when he tells them I killed Felix.

586
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:08,483
Your dad is in deep
to the Fitzpatrick family,

587
00:30:08,555 --> 00:30:10,316
the ones who really wanted Felix dead.

588
00:30:14,852 --> 00:30:16,367
And I'm supposed to believe you.

589
00:30:16,993 --> 00:30:18,241
You do believe me.

590
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:22,431
What I'm saying makes
a lot of sense, doesn't it?

591
00:30:28,635 --> 00:30:30,965
Let me go, Logan.
Please?

592
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,070
Yeah.

593
00:30:36,323 --> 00:30:38,148
Just think about it.

594
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,651
Check around the house.
Keep an open mind.

595
00:30:43,914 --> 00:30:45,716
I found our silver bullet,
Terrence.

596
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:48,607
You couldn't have made
the call that blew up the bus.

597
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:50,838
Surveillance shots.

598
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,148
Ta-da!

599
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,989
No cell signal anywhere
in the Seven Rivers casino.

600
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,098
What you got is proof that I was in
a private meeting with Leonard Lobo.

601
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:07,393
You were in a legal gambling
venue placing legal bets.

602
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:10,586
Lobo's name is on the league
unsavory-characters list.

603
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:11,740
He was charged,

604
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:14,333
but never convicted of fixing a
college basketball game

605
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:15,157
back in the '80s.

606
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:18,214
If I admit that I was in his office,

607
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,585
I make myself the next Pete Rose.

608
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:23,349
We'll take these photos to the sheriff,

609
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,866
and I'll make sure they don't get out.

610
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:27,291
All you need is a little leverage.

611
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:47,998
"Kuzzikan"?

612
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:49,492
It's my brother's car.

613
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:51,029
Brother's plates.

614
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,457
Whereas your personalized
plates might read...

615
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,909
"kissnkuzn."

616
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,262
You didn't get mugged, did you?

617
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:05,481
No.

618
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:09,366
You needed to make some
fast cash, isn't that right?

619
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:12,536
Yes.

620
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:15,572
You're gay, aren't you?

621
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:23,380
What do you want from me?

622
00:32:24,845 --> 00:32:27,192
I want to know why you act like you do.

623
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,623
The other day when you and
your pal were making fun of Dick.

624
00:32:30,624 --> 00:32:33,763
When underneath I was really
just bashing myself.

625
00:32:34,248 --> 00:32:35,503
Very insightful.

626
00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:36,506
Want to know why I do it?

627
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,081
Because I want
to survive high school, okay?

628
00:32:40,516 --> 00:32:44,633
So you hock your own rims
for cash to pay the blackmailer,

629
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,487
use the pizza-boy muggings as a cover,

630
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:48,774
then buy new rims
with the insurance money.

631
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:50,844
Sounds bad when you say it.

632
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:52,096
Veronica...

633
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:56,666
you realize people here
find out I'm queer...

634
00:32:58,568 --> 00:32:59,517
and I'm dead.

635
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:01,338
I'm not out to out you.

636
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:06,055
I just want to pay the damn money
and be done with this whole nightmare.

637
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,907
The note...
let me look at it.

638
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:16,295
It was just an e-mail from
some guy named Rick Santorum.

639
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:18,968
He says he wants me
to just mail it to him.

640
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:21,135
He gave a local address.

641
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:24,172
He gave you an address?

642
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:08,509
Rick Santorum's address is a fake.

643
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,663
No surprise there.

644
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:12,386
Kelly mailed his blackmail payoff,

645
00:34:12,402 --> 00:34:14,248
but it's been stalled
at the post office.

646
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:17,612
It's been like waiting for a toaster
to pop these past seven hours.

647
00:34:17,613 --> 00:34:19,407
Well, I'll watch it
if you don't have the time.

648
00:34:19,408 --> 00:34:20,454
I'll call you if I see anything.

649
00:34:20,455 --> 00:34:21,249
No need.

650
00:34:22,384 --> 00:34:23,323
It finally moved.

651
00:34:24,387 --> 00:34:26,853
Let's see where the package ended up.

652
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:29,474
Hubbell street?

653
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:30,958
I know who lives there.

654
00:34:33,124 --> 00:34:34,516
Hey, blackmailer.

655
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,225
I figured I'd be seeing
you sometime today.

656
00:34:38,682 --> 00:34:39,972
Looking for this?

657
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,380
Most people just get pissed
and smash it into a million pieces,

658
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,204
but they're kind of expensive,
so thanks.

659
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,345
And I thought I was being so clever

660
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:49,854
with the whole
dead-letter-office thing.

661
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:50,786
Pretty clever.

662
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:53,276
You knew the money would
make its way to the post office.

663
00:34:53,683 --> 00:34:55,527
How'd you ever get in
to retrieve the package?

664
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:57,130
My mom works there.

665
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,356
Ooh, nice.

666
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:02,599
So I'm assuming
Kelly wants his money back.

667
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:03,454
Safe assumption.

668
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:05,729
Why'd you do it?

669
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:08,081
I wanted to get out of Neptune
after graduation.

670
00:35:08,676 --> 00:35:09,636
There goes that plan.

671
00:35:09,868 --> 00:35:11,594
Community college,
here I come.

672
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,037
Besides, I didn't care much
about self-hating "kissnkuzn".

673
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:16,716
I would have slept just fine

674
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:18,852
knowing that Kelly Kuzzio
was driving around rimless.

675
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,728
Why'd you out Marlena?

676
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,105
'Cause I'm a horrible,
crazy bitch.

677
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:25,727
You want to know what's worse?

678
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:28,003
I told her the blackmailer
was bluffing.

679
00:35:28,285 --> 00:35:29,915
I told her not to pay.

680
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:31,715
I don't get it.

681
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,252
I wanted to be out,
but I wanted Marlena out with me.

682
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:37,343
I wanted to be able
to walk down the halls with her,

683
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:38,396
like a real couple.

684
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:42,599
So she didn't want to come out,
and you did?

685
00:35:43,056 --> 00:35:44,339
Something like that.

686
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:47,028
I want to tell Marlena myself,
if that's okay.

687
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:49,086
Okay.

688
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:57,146
<i>[Starsailor - "I don't know"]</i>

689
00:36:06,012 --> 00:36:11,548
<i>Woke up reeling lost all feeling</i>

690
00:36:12,514 --> 00:36:14,398
<i>Heart on the floor</i>

691
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:16,215
You were right about my dad.

692
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:21,004
<i>Tried to stop me</i>

693
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:24,588
<i>but I was not listening</i>

694

00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:37,001
<i>I don't know what love is</i>

698
00:36:37,097 --> 00:36:38,434
Who's that?

699
00:36:38,435 --> 00:36:40,260
Hannah something,
I think.

700
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,014
I'd be a willowy blonde, too,

701
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,474
if my dad was a plastic surgeon.

702
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,071
<i>See that... </i>

703
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:51,793
Wait a minute.

704
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:54,301
This isn't the way
to the regional finals.

705
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:58,343
If my dad expects me to drive 75 miles
in this bouncy, old bronco,

706
00:36:58,344 --> 00:36:59,816
then he really is a murderer.

707
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:06,316
Okay, which one is monday?

708
00:37:06,317 --> 00:37:09,791
You laugh, but he pretty much used
to have one for every day of the month.

709
00:37:10,556 --> 00:37:12,257
Our lives are so similar.

710
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:15,306
The Mars family hangar
is a spitting image of this one.

711
00:37:15,387 --> 00:37:16,650
Flying's not his thing.

712
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,839
Woody Goodman lets dad
use the hangar for his toys.

713
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,033
So...

714
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,209
what are you in the mood for?

715
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,205
Hot-blooded italian
or cool and teutonic?

716
00:37:30,928 --> 00:37:35,262
How about privileged and upper-crusty?

717
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:44,066
I want you to announce that

718
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:47,057
Terrence Cook has been cleared
of suspicion in the bus crash.

719
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:47,886
What?

720
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:50,269
This some kind of jedi mind trick?

721
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:52,724
Why would I want to do that?

722
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:00,414
Exactly what am I supposed
to be looking at?

723
00:38:00,466 --> 00:38:01,492
His alibi.

724
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,447
You caught Terrence at a casino, huh?

725
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:06,801
There's a surprise.

726
00:38:07,215 --> 00:38:09,673
Those time stamps say that
he was at the Seven Rivers casino

727
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:10,884
at the time of the explosion.

728
00:38:11,393 --> 00:38:13,930
At 7:01 and 7:06.

729
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:16,792
Could have been off
and made a call between then.

730
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:18,700
The casino blocks cell reception.

731
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,316
Pay phones.

732
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:21,384
You really think someone
would make a phone call

733
00:38:21,436 --> 00:38:24,025
on a land line
that would kill a bus full of people

734
00:38:24,026 --> 00:38:29,371
from a location that has 4,000 cameras
and 300 security personnel?

735
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:31,678
Subpoena the phone records,
check the calls.

736
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,023
Ugh, sounds like a lot of work.

737
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:36,725
What's your beef with me,
sheriff?

738
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:37,924
My beef?

739
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:42,890
I suppose it's that
you killed a busload of kids

740
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,461
just to tidy up your love life.

741
00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:47,381
Crazy girlfriend who knew
about you betting on baseball...

742
00:38:47,382 --> 00:38:50,339
that's a liability
you could not afford.

743
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,479
I suggest you go home and enjoy
your last few days of freedom.

744
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,206
You're not gonna press charges, Lamb.

745
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:58,255
Whatever you say, boss.

746
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:03,453
What's this?

747
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:04,792
Play it.

748
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:09,380
I really hope this is
the new Big & Rich.

749
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:20,352
<i>I got a guy in a holding cell
back there,</i>

750
00:39:20,353 --> 00:39:25,530
<i>says you did favors for gentlemen
who bet extensively on baseball,</i>

751
00:39:25,632 --> 00:39:26,871
<i>and he wants to make a deal.</i>

752
00:39:26,872 --> 00:39:30,472
<i>Me, I would much rather deal with you.</i>

753
00:39:30,473 --> 00:39:32,019
All right, what's this,
where'd you get it?

754
00:39:32,071 --> 00:39:34,750
I don't think a grand jury will have
a hard time figuring it out.

755
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:36,698
You don't back off,
sheriff,

756
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:39,236
and that recording is going
straight to Woody Goodman,

757
00:39:39,237 --> 00:39:41,452
newspapers, your grandmama.

758
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:44,270
Right.

759
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:47,948
Here's how it's gonna play out,
slugger.

760
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:51,516
Release the tape,
I lose my $50k civil-servant job.

761
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:55,033
You... you lose your
hall of fame induction,

762
00:39:55,034 --> 00:39:57,193
your color-commentating gig,

763
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,092
your endorsements.

764
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:03,286
Where's the trade in that,
Terrence?

765
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:04,720
The boy can play ball.

766
00:40:05,198 --> 00:40:07,310
Did you see his
"running teardrop" in the lane?

767
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:09,893
Oh, I saw it.
It was jordan-esque.

768
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,327
But tomorrow, we both got
to promise, say nothing to him.

769
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,334
We cannot feed that ego.

770
00:40:16,335 --> 00:40:18,135
I like my Wallace humble.

771
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:21,301
My dad told me that you're
helping out with his case.

772
00:40:22,496 --> 00:40:23,839
That means a lot,

773
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:25,804
especially since he's
already been convicted

774
00:40:25,805 --> 00:40:27,155
by half the people in Neptune.

775
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:31,022
Well, luckily, it's the half
I don't like, so it works out.

776
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:45,171
This is not good.

777
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,671
The top's broken.

778
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:49,695
It's probably just a blown fuse.

779
00:40:50,107 --> 00:40:53,178
Okay, and you sound like
you know how to fix it.

780
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:57,642
Well, if she's anything like
my lebaron under the bonnet,

781
00:40:57,643 --> 00:40:59,186
I'm gonna need a phillips head.

782
00:41:00,013 --> 00:41:01,308
Screwdriver.

783
00:41:18,444 --> 00:41:19,456
You find it?

784
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:24,025
Dad?

785
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,008
Honey, what is it?
What's wrong?

786
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:33,090
Jackie and I borrowed one
of Terrence's cars tonight.

787
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:36,802
I was digging around in the hangar
where he keeps them, and I found...

788
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:39,927
I don't know.

789
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:46,268
But I'm pretty sure it was some sort
of explosive and detonators.

790
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:51,272
So much for my gut.

791
00:41:53,332 --> 00:41:58,344
