1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:02,268
Previously on Veronica Mars…

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,171
Later, Deputy.

3
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:05,301
- Have you met someone? 
- Alicia and I talked about it-

4
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:06,657
Wallace's mom!

5
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:12,351
I know you blame me for your mother's death.

6
00:00:12,408 --> 00:00:14,051
She was your mom, my stepmom.

7
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:15,341
Dad could have used you there.

8
00:00:15,413 --> 00:00:17,245
So now you're worried about Dad's welfare.

9
00:00:17,313 --> 00:00:21,261
Isn't he the big bad wolf? Cigarette burns, broken noses…

10
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:22,730
I never would have hurt her.

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,649
Lilly and Weevil?

12
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:25,261
Lilly is dead. Her killer is in jail.

13
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:26,855
Abel Koontz didn't kill Lilly.

14
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:27,839
You think I killed Lilly.

15
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,174
You haven't seen Duncan tonight, have you? He's missing.

16
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,952
Bob sells a house for $136,000.

17
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:36,527
If he makes 5% commission for every house he sells,

18
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:38,908
how much money did Bob earn on this sale?

19
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:43,298
All I know is, if your boy Bob only gets 5%, um,

20
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:45,550
he's pushin' the wrong product.

21
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,128
I get something to write with here?

22
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:52,795
First fundamental of fundamentals of math?

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,694
Always carry your writing utensil.

24
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,511
So I heard, uh, Duncan Kane took off, huh?

25
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,285
I believe the official story involved a sick relative in Chattanooga,

26
00:01:06,337 --> 00:01:08,190
but, yeah, he took off.

27
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:14,488
Well the word is he bolted 'cause you accused him of killing Lilly.

28
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:18,573
Well, word is wrong.

29
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:22,578
But, you don't think they got the right guy.

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,618
Hey, honey.

31
00:01:28,573 --> 00:01:29,315
Eli.

32
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:31,149
Sheriff.

33
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:36,484
I'm just giving Weevil a refresher for his quiz tomorrow.

34
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:41,613
Well, I guess I'm refreshed.

35
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:43,427
See you at school.

36
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:55,760
Honey, do I need to recap my Concerned Dad lectures?

37
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:59,463
No running with scissors, no candy from strangers,

38
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,776
no smartening up the local criminal element.

39
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,858
He helped me out in the past. I'm just returning the favour.

40
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:06,488
What say you call it even.

41
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:08,490
I'll be at home.

42
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,754
With the only sane member of the Mars family.

43
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:15,452
The one who eats from the garbage and keeps bringing me dead birds?

44
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:16,688
That's the one.

45
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:40,561
Chester!

46
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:43,024
Chester, come here boy.

47
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:44,892
Come here, baby.

48
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:46,239
Chester!

49
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:47,765
Chester!

50
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:50,093
Chester!

51
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:52,757
Oh! Hey.

52
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:53,694
Hey.

53
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,348
So, uh, what do you think?

54
00:02:57,533 --> 00:03:03,131
Like... in general, or is there a specific arena in which you'd like my opinion?

55
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,534
Do you think Duncan, uh, is just cooling off or is he, like, holed up

56
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:11,220
in some hotel room pouring peroxide on his hair and trying to file his fingerprints off?

57
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,513
Honestly, I have no idea.

58
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:17,634
I got the call from Celeste today wanting to know where, uh, I thought he might've gone.

59
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:18,756
What'd you tell her?

60
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,377
The truth.

61
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:22,740
That I don't know.

62
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:30,973
See ya.

63
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:37,056
All righty, Logan.

64
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:40,046
We'll just skip over the two minutes in heaven we had.

65
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:42,078
You wanna pretend it never happened?

66
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:43,409
No argument here.

67
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:46,983
My lips, for all intents and purposes, are sealed.

68
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:56,496
Sorry. This was on your…

69
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:57,827
Thanks.

70
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:00,833
You're Veronica Mars, right?

71
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:01,904
Sometimes.

72
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,355
Do you think I could, like, hire you, or something?

73
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,876
To help me find my dog?

74
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:08,222
That depends. Was he cheating on you?

75
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,336
Lost dogs aren't really my speciality.

76
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:14,868
Oh. Okay. Well, thanks anyways.

77
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:25,528
You know maybe I could make a couple phone calls, uh, maybe help with signage.

78
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,966
Excuse me a sec.

79
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:29,992
Breaking news. Record this date in history.

80
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:33,776
First time Wallace Fennel got the 4-1-1 before the little birdy got it to you.

81
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,892
Do I have to tip you over or are you gonna spill it on your own?

82
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:40,238
Clemmons just got a call.

83
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:42,465
Weevil broke into the Kane house last night.

84
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,798
Neighbourhood security patrol caught him in Lilly Kane's bedroom.

85
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,605
Hi. How are ya?

86
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,407
Better. Now.

87
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:34,054
I haven't heard from you in a couple days.

88
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:36,958
About to show up at your place with my tools of restraint.

89
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,442
Wouldn't recommend it.

90
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,261
Dad usually likes to have a guy to dinner at least once before he cuffs me.

91
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:44,775
So what can I help you with, Miss Mars?

92
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:48,344
My schedule? Sure. I'm off Thursday and Friday.

93
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:50,946
Um, I'm actually here to see Weevil.

94
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:52,885
Do you think I could get a minute with him?

95
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:57,684
What is it about bad boys?

96
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:02,854
Um, tattoos, leather, parole violations. Total good-girl bait.

97
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:04,166
I'm doomed.

98
00:06:04,682 --> 00:06:07,586
Hey, you were here when Weevil was brought in, right?

99
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,223
What did they find on him?

100
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:13,325
The bad-ass standards, $0.17, a couple of condoms, a pen

101
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:24,773
Do  you have that nail file and the J-Lo poster I asked for?

102
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:28,572
Why were you in Lilly's room?

103
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,876
What better house for some B&E?

104
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,743
I know about you and Lilly. I know about the letters.

105
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:34,634
Yeah?

106
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:37,593
Well, whatever you know, that's not all there is to it.

107
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:40,984
I tell you that I'm close to finding Lilly's killer and two hours later,

108
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,318
you're breaking into her room. What do you expect me to think?

109
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:47,230
Look,  I told you what I was doing there. Now if you don't wanna believe me, that's on you, okay?

110
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:49,698
You gonna help me or not?

111
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:53,429
No.

112
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,004
All right, all right, hold on!

113
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,119
Diamond ring.

114
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,089
You broke in to steal a ring?

115
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,379
I was trying to get it back.

116
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,561
It's my mother's and she was saving it for me as an engagement ring.

117
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,433
At one time I was dumb enough to think I wanted Lilly to have it.

118
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:16,276
Find it?

119
00:07:17,197 --> 00:07:17,910
No.

120
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:24,303
Look, uh, the Kanes want me crucified for this and now that I'm 18...

121
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,346
Good-bye juvie.

122
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:29,102
Hello community soap.

123
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:30,980
Yeah.

124
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:35,410
Now I see how crappy mine was.

125
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,483
It was heartfelt crappy.

126
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:42,521
So tell me more about the night Chester disappeared. Your front gate was open?

127
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:46,438
Oh, not mine, the McDades. I baby-sit their son Ryder twice a week.

128
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:48,379
They let me keep Chester in their yard.

129
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,905
- How far do you live from them? 
- Far. I'm more like an 02er.

130
00:07:52,694 --> 00:07:55,618
So, you put up flyers. Did you check the pound?

131
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,481
Well, I called and I left them my number.

132
00:07:57,656 --> 00:07:59,781
You should go down there. Give 'em a flyer.

133
00:07:59,857 --> 00:08:03,328
If they meet you, they're more likely to remember you and Chester if he comes through.

134
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:15,258
Sweetheart. Stay close, okay? Barry's gonna be here any minute.

135
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,650
Research for your next role?

136
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:21,761
No, Phil Jackson gave me this.

137
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,324
He said it would change my perspective.

138
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,280
Maybe you could option it.

139
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:30,561
Nobody  seems to believe me.

140
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:32,108
Not even my own children.

141
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,337
I'm done acting, Trina.

142
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:37,094
It's behind me now.

143
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:39,912
What if something so great came along.

144
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,439
There is nothing greater than living in the moment,

145
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:46,861
being here with the ones I love.

146
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,655
That's my job now.

147
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,444
Lynn's death was my wake up call.

148
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,660
Push in on our hero.

149
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,884
Natural light frames his handsome,

150
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:03,910
weathered face as he passes sage advice to his doting daughter.

151
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,911
The music swells.

152
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,525
Important your family is. Hm, hm.

153
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:15,716
But Daddy, there's this terrific part.

154
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:18,971
It's the villain in this independent feature my boyfriend Dylan's producing,

155
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:21,722
"Escaping Your Past". You'd be perfect. Two days work.

156
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,288
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Trina.

157
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:27,389
Thank you for thinking of me, really, but,

158
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:28,567
but this,

159
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:31,686
this is what I want to be doing now.

160
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:38,131
I'm not sure if you're aware but Lynn updated her will a few weeks before her… death.

161
00:09:38,392 --> 00:09:39,923
Aaron, you were removed.

162
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,183
Well I didn't know that but, uh,

163
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:47,189
well, doesn't surprise me.

164
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,983
It's cool, Barr. Dad's accountants didn't give Mom much of an allowance.

165
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,709
All right, I'll skip to the relevant paragraph here.

166
00:09:57,235 --> 00:10:02,723
To my son Logan, I bequeath my art collection as well as all of my personal effects in the house.

167
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,621
In addition I leave him the balance in my investment account,

168
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:10,233
held with JP Morgan, totalling $115,000.

169
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:16,860
And me? She took me out too?

170
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:20,361
I'm afraid you were never in it.

171
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:26,341
We're looking for a lost Jack Russell terrier, Chester.

172
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,759
Any chance he's come through?

173
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:29,644
Pure breed Jack. 

174
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:32,260
Hadn't come through. Sorry.

175
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:36,460
Veronica Mars? J-dub, this is the coolest girl in Neptune High.

176
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:40,289
Uh, she was gonna get expelled for planting a spy cam in the teacher's lounge

177
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,556
but she had so much dirt, they just let her off.

178
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:43,570
Is that so?

179
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:45,296
Have you seen my dog?

180
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:50,458
Uh, man, no.

181
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:53,247
Aww, I wish I had though, what a cutie.

182
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,451
Keep an eye out, okay?

183
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,715
We'd really appreciate that.

184
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:57,462
- Thanks… 
- Hans.

185
00:10:57,732 --> 00:10:58,521
Hans.

186
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:02,086
You really hid a camera in the teacher's lounge?

187
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:04,071
I have no idea what he's talking about.

188
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:09,361
Good morning, bro. Pop tart?

189
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:12,145
Hm, a tart from a tart.

190
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:15,106
He of the sickle wit. Can I ask you something?

191
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,701
Will you look at that? There was a string attached to my pop tart.

192
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:25,856
Yeah, well, I'm in a little bit of a jam. I could use a loan.

193
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:31,454
Twelve hours to hit me up for my dead mother's money.

194
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,339
Hm, I wonder who had that in the pool?

195
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,562
You know I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

196
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:38,427
Oh, I do.

197
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:39,721
I do.

198
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:43,793
Could I just borrow… ten grand, just for a little while.

199
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:44,832
Ten grand?

200
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:46,563
Will you just hear me out, please.

201
00:11:46,843 --> 00:11:50,089
My boyfriend Dylan spotted me some cash a few months ago and…

202
00:11:50,286 --> 00:11:53,859
now he's bugging me about it. I can't get him off my back.

203
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,686
Did you try standing up?

204
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,932
Thanks. Knew I could count on you.

205
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:01,785
This  afternoon we should post at the pet stores.

206
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:04,139
Pet owners are more likely to call with any tips.

207
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:06,608
Hello?

208
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,097
Yes I did.

209
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:09,858
Oh, you have?

210
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,096
- What happened? 
- Nothing.

211
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,706
Someone was just playing a stupid trick.

212
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:25,424
Lenny Sofer. I had a crush on him last year.

213
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:27,400
I put his picture in my locker.

214
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:29,541
I never told him but somebody did.

215
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:32,162
He's gone out of his way to be mean to me ever since.

216
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:37,134
Oh, Veronica, please, don't worry about it. Really, it's not worth it.

217
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,429
Oh, it's so worth it.

218
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:40,416
- You prank-call Mandy? 
- What if I did?

219
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,631
Well, I want to congratulate you. Shake your hand.

220
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:45,837
Congratulations! You've been named the world's biggest cockroach.

221
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,108
This award is given in recognition of your unparalleled lack of decency and humanity.

222
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:52,637
Bravo! You're gonna die friendless and alone.

223
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,141
Hey, everybody knows you're the biggest-

224
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:58,193
Shut up! If I want you to speak, I'll wave a snausage over your nose.

225
00:12:58,305 --> 00:13:01,543
If you use Mandy again to try to convince yourself that you're not a loser,

226
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:03,584
I will ruin your life - got it?

227
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:05,243
You got it?

228
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:06,927
Okay, geez.

229
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,689
I can't believe you did that.

230
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:13,265
I can't believe that you didn't.

231
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:17,112
If you want people to leave you alone, Mandy, or better yet, treat you with respect,

232
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:19,615
demand it. Make them.

233
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:32,276
Hey, buddy, you wanna go outside?

234
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:34,151
Okay.

235
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:42,697
- Hello. 
- Veronica, it's Hans at the pound.

236
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:44,606
I've got some bad news.

237
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:50,212
One of our guys found Chester by the side of the highway on his way in last night.

238
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:53,971
He'd been hit by a car. They had to put him down.

239
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,609
I found this,

240
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:05,213
saved it for you.

241
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:32,442
Backup and I walk by here almost everyday.

242
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:35,919
This used to be covered with band flyers and surf boards for sale.

243
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:39,406
Now every inch of space is covered with lost dog notices.

244
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,484
Hi. I was calling about your missing Yorkie?

245
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,650
Oh, you did. Great.

246
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:55,554
How did you find him?

247
00:14:57,474 --> 00:14:58,473
Three weeks.

248
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:03,019
No, I haven't seen him, just a concerned dog lover.

249
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,622
How much is the reward?

250
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,307
Hi, is this Bridget?

251
00:15:09,757 --> 00:15:13,752
Hi, I'm calling about your toy Spaniel, Louie. Is he still missing?

252
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,722
I'll definitely be on the lookout for him.

253
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:16,776
Good luck.

254
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:26,782
Only the owners who've offered big rewards have gotten their dogs back.

255
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,720
What happens to the dogs who don't bring a high enough price?

256
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:33,724
Do they end up like Chester, just left by the highway somewhere to die?

257
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:44,619
I can't do anything for Mandy but if someone is stealing dogs in Neptune,

258
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:46,775
they need to be brought down, hard,

259
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,850
then beaten with some sort of tyre iron, and dumped into the nearest body of water.

260
00:15:52,106 --> 00:15:53,523
What did you say to Duncan?

261
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:55,904
Where  is he?

262
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:57,271
Excuse me?

263
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,170
I think you know why he left.

264
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,600
In fact, you're probably the reason he left.

265
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:03,585
What did you say to him, Veronica?

266
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,269
Let's start with what I didn't tell him.

267
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:10,210
I didn't tell him that his mother threatened to kill me.

268
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:14,108
I didn't tell him that his mother drove my mother out of town.

269
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:18,622
I know you think I hate you but I don't.

270
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:21,883
I just can't stand to look at you.

271
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:27,136
Every time I see you, I see everything that's wrong in my life, in my family.

272
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:32,774
I see my husband's infidelity, your mother in his office, in his hotel room.

273
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,354
I see your father trying to destroy us.

274
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:36,706
What are you doing here?

275
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:43,501
I… needed to ask your daughter a few questions.

276
00:16:43,597 --> 00:16:46,045
You don't need to ask her anything. You just leave her alone.

277
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:48,103
You don't scare me, Keith.

278
00:16:49,471 --> 00:16:51,758
If you were such a great detective, you would have seen

279
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:54,954
what was going on right underneath your nose.

280
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,493
Wait.

281
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,469
I'll help you find Duncan if you drop the charges against Weevil.

282
00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:15,450
You want the intruder caught in Lilly's bedroom released.

283
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:19,170
I'm sure I should be surprised but I'm not.

284
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,089
Nothing was stolen, nothing was damaged.

285
00:17:22,218 --> 00:17:25,065
I might have an idea where Duncan went, that's my offer.

286
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,960
Truth is, I have no idea where Duncan might be but she doesn't know that.

287
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,609
As for the whereabouts of lost dogs,

288
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,155
let's see who bites when I increase the reward exponentially.

289
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,863
Is Dad still at dinner?

290
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:49,866
Yeah.

291
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:54,577
But he's not far. I'm sure if you really tried you could blow smoke up his ass from here.

292
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:57,965
Hey Trin,

293
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:02,215
if you take your top off before you get on the mechanical bull, you won't fall off.

294
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:08,011
- What happened to you? 
- Nothing.

295
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:12,629
Don't you have some homework to do, little brother?

296
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,804
That wannabe producer boyfriend do this to you?

297
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:23,249
What's his name, Dylan?

298
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:25,973
Dylan what, what's his last name?

299
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:28,364
- It doesn't matter. 
- It does now! Tell me.

300
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,300
You've made it clear that you have no interest in my problems, Logan.

301
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,456
Don't be wishy-washy.

302
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,437
It's so unattractive in a guy.

303
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,457
I walked in on 'em making out on the couch last night.

304
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,173
- She was sittin' on his lap. 
- Hey, hey, hey!

305
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,838
No discussing parental PDA at lunch! It's your rule!

306
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,221
Sorry. I can't be the only one with that image burned in my brain.

307
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:57,291
I had to share.

308
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:01,556
Hello.

309
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:04,159
Yes, this is Bridget.

310
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:06,366
Wonderful!

311
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,128
Yes, the reward is still a thousand dollars.

312
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,452
How 'bout this afternoon.

313
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:18,034
Great, um, I'll send my brother to meet you.

314
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:19,845
Dog Beach, three o'clock.

315
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:22,617
Thanks, buh-bye.

316
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:24,207
So I'm your brother?

317
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:26,174
I didn't mean brother like, brother.

318
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:27,878
I meant brother like...

319
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:29,482
you know.

320
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:33,874
Yeah, I know. And where are you gonna get a thousand bucks?

321
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:37,034
If you rollin' like that, you really been holding out on a brutha.

322
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:06,289
Tú, eh...lost dog.

323
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,807
Sure did. Hi there Louie. How you doin' boy.

324
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,067
I missed you.

325
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,048
Oh yes, I did.

326
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:16,563
Where was he? How'd you find him?

327
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:17,897
No hablo ingles.

328
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:21,650
Oh. All right, then.

329
00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:25,801
Thanks man.

330
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:26,832
Gracias.

331
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:28,727
Come on.

332
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:54,751
He just ran from me, that's so weird.

333
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,629
- Está loco el perro. 
- Sorry.

334
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:08,426
Tag, you're it.

335
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:11,181
Now it's time to play follow the dog thief.

336
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:14,207
You're walking.

337
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:00,431
Oh crap.

338
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:05,864
You stole the dog.

339
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:15,146
And it's time for the international language of...

340
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,233
Okay, now who stole the dog?

341
00:22:27,782 --> 00:22:28,991
A dog man?

342
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:32,078
Does he drive a white van? Do you know him?

343
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:38,739
Do you know his name? ¿Su nombre?

344
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:48,064
Sure. Let's play dirty charades with the gringa.

345
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,625
Okay, ah, Muchas gracias.

346
00:22:58,004 --> 00:23:01,641
So there's a dog man who hires these guys to return dogs.

347
00:23:01,688 --> 00:23:04,377
He drives a white van, or maybe a white horse,

348
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,674
and he likes to spank busty women.

349
00:23:06,814 --> 00:23:09,512
Basically, that's any male living in Neptune.

350
00:23:17,008 --> 00:23:17,918
Come on, Louie.

351
00:23:19,706 --> 00:23:22,793
All right now, please be hot, grateful, single…

352
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:26,171
Hi. I was wondering if you lost Louie.

353
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,365
You found him.

354
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,737
I sure did.

355
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,305
Thank you so much.

356
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,184
Hello, ladies.

357
00:24:03,156 --> 00:24:04,183
What the…

358
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,315
You kill dogs?

359
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:06,810
What are you doing in my van?

360
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,120
I know what you're doing.

361
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,121
You're kidnapping 09er dogs, holding them at the pound

362
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:13,306
and then waiting for the offer of a big reward.

363
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,205
You break into my van and you're accusing me of stealing.

364
00:24:16,303 --> 00:24:20,198
So I guess when Mandy and I came looking for Chester, you realised you screwed up,

365
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:22,205
dognapped from a poor girl.

366
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:25,395
So you just cut your losses and threw him to the side of the road.

367
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:28,621
Actually, I rounded up 101 of them.

368
00:24:28,698 --> 00:24:30,459
Some crazy lady's makin' a coat.

369
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:33,405
Now get out of my van, you lunatic.

370
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:35,144
How old are you, anyway, Hans?

371
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:36,967
Eighteen. Why?

372
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:39,521
Community soap.

373
00:24:45,154 --> 00:24:47,597
Always gettin' out the back of some dude's van, aren't you?

374
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,224
- You're out. 
- Yeah.

375
00:24:49,392 --> 00:24:52,516
How many get-out-of-jail-free cards do you have up your sleeve, anyway?

376
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:56,525
Pretty sure that was my last, so you might keep your felonies to a bare minimum.

377
00:24:56,803 --> 00:24:58,250
I am what I am, V.

378
00:24:58,328 --> 00:25:00,319
Leopard, spots, you know what they say.

379
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,417
- Hi. 
- Hey, I need your help.

380
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:12,505
Would it be weird for me to start my own drinking game?

381
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,151
Like I have to do a shot every time someone asks for my help?

382
00:25:15,572 --> 00:25:18,439
I need you to track down Trina's leech-of-the-week boyfriend.

383
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:19,755
Why? What'd he do?

384
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:20,682
He beat her up.

385
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,154
I plan on returning the favour.

386
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:25,084
All I know is his first name, Dylan

387
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,291
and he's producing this steamer.

388
00:25:30,098 --> 00:25:30,886
Easy.

389
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:36,938
Hey.

390
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,350
Going out?

391
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:44,474
Oh, not at the moment but just in case, gotta have the game face on.

392
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:48,164
Camera's prying eyes are never far away.

393
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:52,999
Hey, what do you feel like for dinner?

394
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:55,308
I think I'm gonna cook.

395
00:25:55,442 --> 00:25:57,587
Yeah,  I'm not really hungry.

396
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:00,368
Are you okay?

397
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,408
Just boyfriend stuff.

398
00:26:03,624 --> 00:26:04,514
No big deal.

399
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:08,723
You know even if it's a small deal, um, you can always talk to me about it.

400
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:14,682
Well, I sorta got his hopes up about you doing his movie.

401
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,698
And now the financing is falling through and he's freaking out.

402
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:22,424
Trina, you gotta talk to me before you go making promises to anybody.

403
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:25,045
Dad! I so don't care about Dylan.

404
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:27,693
This is me thinking about you.

405
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:31,000
This is a career defining moment you're passing up.

406
00:26:31,082 --> 00:26:33,795
I mean, hello, Travolta, "Pulp Fiction".

407
00:26:34,256 --> 00:26:34,977
Really.

408
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,189
It's that good?

409
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:39,089
It's better than that good.

410
00:26:41,605 --> 00:26:44,717
Well, I guess I better hear about it then.

411
00:26:45,418 --> 00:26:47,410
Why don't you have your boyfriend come by later.

412
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:52,382
Thank you so much, Daddy.

413
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,879
Hi, I'm calling from Todd Russell's office at CAA. He read your script,

414
00:26:58,946 --> 00:27:03,277
"Escaping Your Past" and he went nuts over it. Have you sold it yet?

415
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:05,577
Really?

416
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:07,419
Who's producing it?

417
00:27:09,432 --> 00:27:12,007
Is that G-o-r-a-n?

418
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:15,442
Great. I'm sure he'll want to speak with him.

419
00:27:15,813 --> 00:27:17,619
Maybe we can get you guys a deal.

420
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:19,793
Okay, we'll be in touch.

421
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:21,918
Thanks. Bye.

422
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:25,923
Dylan Goran.

423
00:27:26,157 --> 00:27:29,431
Is there really an agent named Todd Russell at CAA?

424
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:30,746
There could be, maybe.

425
00:27:35,858 --> 00:27:39,200
Looks like Trina's Romeo has had a little trouble with the ladies.

426
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:43,044
Two women have filed restraining orders against him in the last five years.

427
00:27:49,346 --> 00:27:52,015
Dad, hey, I need Trina. It's important.

428
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:54,191
Oh, hey son. She's in the shower.

429
00:27:54,596 --> 00:27:57,749
Her boyfriend's coming over later to pitch me a part in his movie.

430
00:27:57,862 --> 00:28:01,098
Aren't you retired? I thought you were reconnecting with your family.

431
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:06,448
Trina is family, I'm helping her out. It's what dads do.

432
00:28:06,613 --> 00:28:08,168
Oh listen. Trina's boyfriend, he's got-

433
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:14,553
Dylan's on his way to the house.

434
00:28:16,115 --> 00:28:17,487
And Dad's cooking for him.

435
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,101
Dad. This is Dylan Goran.

436
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:28,086
Dylan, my father, Aaron Echolls.

437
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:30,384
Mr Echolls. It's a pleasure.

438
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:32,899
I'm so glad you decided to meet.

439
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:35,498
Please, call me Aaron.

440
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:42,116
Hey, taste this for me, will ya?

441
00:28:47,948 --> 00:28:48,767
Perfect.

442
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,598
Nya, not quite.

443
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,378
So, Dylan.

444
00:28:55,196 --> 00:28:56,754
Tell me about this part.

445
00:28:57,106 --> 00:28:58,581
You'd be playing a hit man.

446
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:00,455
A junkie hit man.

447
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,527
It's only two days of work, three tops. You'd be in and out.

448
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:06,734
If you said yes, they'd have a green light.

449
00:29:10,908 --> 00:29:13,072
A strung-out hit man, huh?

450
00:29:13,394 --> 00:29:14,387
With a conscience.

451
00:29:14,782 --> 00:29:17,352
He's on the junk because he's tormented.

452
00:29:17,618 --> 00:29:19,584
It's the only way he can get out of his head.

453
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:21,211
Escape the pain.

454
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:25,722
You know, it sounds a lot like my old man.

455
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,759
He used to beat me and my mom and then…

456
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,607
try to drink the demons away.

457
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:35,405
Yeah, yeah. It's a lot like that.

458
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:37,688
You could definitely draw from that.

459
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:41,861
Yeah, hell, yeah.

460
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:45,590
He used to beat my mom 'til she passed out.

461
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:48,191
Then she'd cake makeup all over her face,

462
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,906
wear dark glasses around the house but, you know, I could always recognise the signs.

463
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,745
Then, finally, I got the courage up to try and stop him, but,

464
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,375
man, I'm just a scrawny little kid, he's built like a wall.

465
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:09,089
He put a cigarette out on my hand. Said, "Nice try, kid."

466
00:30:09,415 --> 00:30:12,417
Hey, you know you can still see the scars. Look.

467
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:14,481
Wow… wow.

468
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,521
You see 'em there?

469
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,982
Uh, no. I don't.

470
00:30:19,077 --> 00:30:20,902
Come on, it's right there. Right there.

471
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,015
Daddy!

472
00:30:24,104 --> 00:30:25,408
Think you could hit my daughter, huh?

473
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:26,912
Daddy, no!

474
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:28,054
My daughter!

475
00:30:34,864 --> 00:30:35,796
Daddy, stop!

476
00:30:43,254 --> 00:30:44,028
Daddy!

477
00:30:53,508 --> 00:30:54,362
Daddy, no!

478
00:31:14,815 --> 00:31:15,778
Daddy, no!

479
00:31:23,863 --> 00:31:24,820
Oh, hey son.

480
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,367
How was school?

481
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:31,855
Hey, you know what.

482
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:33,678
I considered your offer.

483
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:36,116
I think I'm gonna pass.

484
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:38,809
Logan.

485
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,075
Will you see this young man to his car, please?

486
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:43,785
I'll be happy to.

487
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:55,506
- Wow. 
- Father knows best.

488
00:32:00,997 --> 00:32:03,594
Do you think Lilly loved Weevil?

489
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:07,854
I don't know.

490
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:12,503
Um, Lilly never mentioned anything to me about Weevil.

491
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:16,620
I was wondering when you were gonna ask me about that.

492
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:17,668
Yeah, well.

493
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:23,184
I don't know. When he's caught in her bedroom, you know, I guess you gotta think.

494
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:26,245
You're handling it a lot better than I thought you would.

495
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,263
I loved Lilly

496
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:31,478
and Lilly loved guys.

497
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:34,367
- Logan, you know that she- 
- You know, she used to say that her...

498
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:38,231
her parents worshipped Duncan and tolerated her.

499
00:32:39,465 --> 00:32:41,048
And if she couldn't please 'em,

500
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:43,981
she was gonna go out of her way to piss 'em off.

501
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:47,267
Weevil must have been perfect for that.

502
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:50,525
I know Lilly loved you.

503
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:53,949
Well, it's just not like I loved her.

504
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:56,956
It's okay.

505
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,935
No, uh, you know, it kinda let's me off the hook, you know,

506
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:02,486
I don't know, I don't have to feel guilty anymore.

507
00:33:05,168 --> 00:33:06,792
Feel guilty about what?

508
00:33:09,806 --> 00:33:10,908
Moving on.

509
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,862
What are we doing?

510
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:31,797
No idea.

511
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,626
- We need to talk about this. 
- I know.

512
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,818
Maybe we should just keep it to ourselves for a while and see what happens.

513
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,280
Meet in mop closets? Pass each other secret notes in the hallway?

514
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,283
Come on, I'll drive you home on the back streets.

515
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:12,574
Oh my gosh, look what I found in my cereal box this morning.

516
00:34:13,787 --> 00:34:15,181
It's a spy pen.

517
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:18,467
What's a spy pen?

518
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:21,257
How covert ops of you!

519
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:24,924
I'm gonna use it to pass secret messages to all of my lovahs.

520
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:27,238
This is going to be a very busy little pen.

521
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:29,906
You okay?

522
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,071
Hi.

523
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:43,959
Hi.

524
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,822
I'm going down to the city pound tonight. You wanna come with?

525
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:47,989
What? Why?

526
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:50,729
Because I believe that guy Hans and those guys from the pounds

527
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,247
are dog-napping pure breed dogs from the 09er zip

528
00:34:53,288 --> 00:34:56,719
and holding them there until the owners offer rewards. I plan on proving it.

529
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,391
Do you think there's a chance Chester might still be there?

530
00:35:00,356 --> 00:35:01,917
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

531
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:05,439
Listen, it's stupid and if you don't want any part in it-

532
00:35:05,516 --> 00:35:06,596
I'm in.

533
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:12,555
I need to talk to you.

534
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:14,665
Me.

535
00:35:15,248 --> 00:35:16,632
Finally, me.

536
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,298
I can't date you anymore.

537
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:26,564
Whoa, okay.

538
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,816
Trust me, you don't want to date me.

539
00:35:28,883 --> 00:35:30,978
I'm a train wreck. Seriously.

540
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:34,256
The first guy I ever loved just dropped off the face of the earth,

541
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:35,867
probably because of something I said,

542
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,197
and the last guy I dated turned out to be a drug dealer,

543
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:42,374
and I just made out with my dead best friend's boyfriend,

544
00:35:42,426 --> 00:35:44,172
who, incidentally, I hate.

545
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:46,926
So. Train wreck.

546
00:35:49,665 --> 00:35:52,359
But, Leo, you are the sweetest-

547
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:55,547
Please. Don't tell me how sweet I am.

548
00:35:56,593 --> 00:36:00,638
Well, you're also seriously hot so you'll be single for about three and a half seconds.

549
00:36:00,704 --> 00:36:02,413
See. Now that's more helpful.

550
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:06,366
I'm sorry to dump this on you. I just…

551
00:36:08,395 --> 00:36:11,262
I genuinely care about you and I wanted to be honest.

552
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:15,331
So, my response is supposed to be what?

553
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,094
Thanks?

554
00:36:17,922 --> 00:36:19,474
Probably overshooting a bit, huh?

555
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,049
You could tell me that you understand.

556
00:36:26,808 --> 00:36:29,730
And that we could still be friends?

557
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,239
That'd be cool…

558
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:37,819
'cause I need to follow this confession by asking for a favour.

559
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,673
Open up, Sheriff's Department.

560
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:50,568
We need to take a look around.

561
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,954
What for, look her dog's not here.

562
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:54,516
Take us to the back, now.

563
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:56,308
You wanna show me a warrant?

564
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,566
What are you kidding me? This is a public county building,

565
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,321
you're a county employee, I'm a county deputy sheriff.

566
00:37:01,433 --> 00:37:02,923
Don't make me wake up a judge.

567
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:04,873
Come on.

568
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:15,257
Like you were told, missy, your dog's dead. He's not here.

569
00:37:15,396 --> 00:37:16,593
Well, what's in this room here?

570
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:19,276
What's in that room?

571
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,176
It's locked.

572
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:24,549
It's where we keep dogs with serious contagious diseases.

573
00:37:24,704 --> 00:37:26,496
You go in there you could infect other-

574
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:27,402
We'll risk it.

575
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,364
Your dog's not in there.

576
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:39,469
Well, lookie here.

577
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:42,219
It's Bucko

578
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,291
and Rufus

579
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:47,590
and Shakes

580
00:37:49,673 --> 00:37:50,754
and Lola.

581
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,239
He's not here.

582
00:37:53,462 --> 00:37:55,184
Chester's not here.

583
00:37:56,769 --> 00:37:58,198
I'm sorry.

584
00:37:58,505 --> 00:37:59,878
You have the right to remain silent.

585
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:02,197
Anything you say can and will be used against you-

586
00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:04,882
Wait, you cannot prove that I had anything to do with this.

587
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:08,245
Please. Resist arrest, please.

588
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:11,266
- Look at me. 
- Come on.

589
00:38:15,011 --> 00:38:18,756
That was my dog, you killed my dog.

590
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:22,232
- Do you see what you did? 
- Stop, stop. Hey, hey.

591
00:38:22,351 --> 00:38:24,772
- He was my best friend. 
- Stop, stop.

592
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:27,997
He's not dead, I swear. Please stop.

593
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:29,462
He's not dead?

594
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:32,017
We sold him.

595
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:36,011
We sold the dog when we couldn't get a reward.

596
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,062
Thank you, Leo.

597
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:50,531
Forget about it.

598
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:52,016
It was fun.

599
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:56,527
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?

600
00:38:56,942 --> 00:38:59,624
Do you ask any other kind of questions?

601
00:39:01,191 --> 00:39:04,801
You said Weevil had a pen on him when he was arrested.

602
00:39:04,944 --> 00:39:06,511
Are you sure it wasn't a pencil.

603
00:39:06,782 --> 00:39:08,204
It was definitely a pen.

604
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,988
Pretty girlie one too. Big, pink, plastic.

605
00:39:13,995 --> 00:39:16,064
So much for your bad boy.

606
00:40:00,937 --> 00:40:03,707
Honey. I know you don't always have a curfew these days

607
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:05,329
but you're starting to make me look bad.

608
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:09,154
So, you knew Weevil stalked Lilly. You questioned him.

609
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:11,617
What convinced you he wasn't the guy?

610
00:40:11,806 --> 00:40:15,723
We searched him, his home, DNA, all that stuff, nothing came up.

611
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:17,698
He also had an airtight alibi.

612
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:18,918
I'll show you.

613
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:28,421
All this time you've had Lilly Kane research

614
00:40:28,472 --> 00:40:30,690
in a box marked "Playboys" in the closet?

615
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:33,162
Well, I figured it'd be safe there.

616
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:36,972
It's the closed files, it's just the non-essential stuff.

617
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,625
You think you're slick, don't you?

618
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:40,883
Only 'cause I am.

619
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:44,903
Okay, Weevil was on community service detail.

620
00:40:45,414 --> 00:40:48,046
A dozen people saw him from 8am to 2pm.

621
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:50,284
His time card confirms it.

622
00:40:50,683 --> 00:40:53,928
And now that we know that Lilly's time of death is well after four?

623
00:40:54,223 --> 00:40:56,243
The Kanes covered up Lilly's murder.

624
00:40:56,648 --> 00:40:59,859
We know that. You think they'd go through all that for someone like Weevil?

625
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:06,867
You've come this far.

626
00:41:16,048 --> 00:41:17,440
Hi, I'm Mandy.

627
00:41:17,564 --> 00:41:19,958
I think my friend Veronica talked to you earlier.

628
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,044
Chester! Oh!

629
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:25,284
Oh, hello.

630
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:32,780
Weevil,

631
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:36,742
the night you broke into the Kanes, I gave you a pencil.

632
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:38,521
You were found with a pen.

633
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,353
There was no ring, was there?

634
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:42,579
You found exactly what you were looking for.

635
00:41:43,353 --> 00:41:44,357
You mean this?

636
00:41:45,273 --> 00:41:46,292
You can have it.

637
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:50,571
Any messages inside when you found it?

638
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:52,559
Messages from you, perhaps.

639
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:56,137
Now if I told you, it wouldn't really be a secret message pen.

640
00:41:56,373 --> 00:41:57,351
Would it?

641
00:41:58,654 --> 00:42:03,043
