1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,689
I used to sit there. The only reason I was
allowed past the velvet ropes was Duncan
Kane. He used to be my boyfriend.

2
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:14,000
I’ve got a secret, a good one.

3
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:15,533
Duncan, what happened?

4
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:16,901
Where’s Lilly?

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,693
But you already know how this part of the
story ends. The murder of Lilly Kane. And

6
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,640
Your dad’s out tracking down bail jumpers half the time…

7
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:31,355
…and yet somehow all the cases that come in here
 still get handled. How is that?

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,146
We’re efficient.

9
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,274
Another big Friday night. You got plans?

10
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:45,104
- I don’t know. I might take Backup for a
run or rent a movie maybe.

11
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:50,365
- Congratulations. You’re officially Neptune
High’s most boring person.

12
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,152
- Did I mention the movie might be PG -13?

13
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,959
Ow! Jump back wild child.

14
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:58,380
- What about you Wallace? Your life still a
non -stop Nelly video?

15
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:01,395
- Hey, at least I want my life to be a non -
stop Nelly video.

16
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:02,862
- What do you propose?

17
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:03,741
This.

18
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:04,994
I found this on the floor in gym.

19
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:08,008
- You want to crash an 09er party?

20
00:01:08,043 --> 00:01:10,370
Maybe. I don’t know what an 09er is.

21
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:15,387
- It’s someone who lives in the prestigious
90909 zip code.

22
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:20,144
- Look. You can’t even tell who’s put on it.
You don’t know when it starts, where it is
or nothing.

23
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:23,485
- That’s ‘cause it’s all in code. The moon
tells you it starts when it gets dark…

24
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:29,936
- …the hourglass indicates sand which means
it’s the beach, the Ks and the 9s tell you
it’s more specifically Dog Beach.

25
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,106
And the little eggs?

26
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:38,357
- Friday. It’s in code so undesirables,
which by the way is you and me, don’t show
up.

27
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,588
How do you know all this?

28
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:42,757
- ‘Cause I used to be one of them.

29
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:57,989
- What do you say, dog? You ready to get
this party started? You ready to burn this
mother down. Up, jump… the boogie.

30
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:07,681
- My plan? And I haven’t worked this out
entirely yet so bear with me, was to raise
the roof.

31
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:08,682
See that is so you man, Mr Old School.

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,693
- Me Old School? You’re the one who wanted
to come down and get jiggy wid’ it.

33
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:18,986
- So, uh, wanna go meet the locals or what?

34
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,913
- As long as they’re humble, god -fearing,
salt of the earth types.

35
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:35,254
Everybody say When you hear the call you got
to get it under way Word up It’s the call,

36
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:40,304
word No matter where you say it
You know that you’ll be heard…

37
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:46,122
- Hey, who’s your date, man.

38
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:50,764
- It’s Troy Vandergraf. His father’s the
architect who built the County Museum.

39
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:55,895
Troy, this is Logan. I guess you already
know Caitlin.

40
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:01,629
- So aren’t you supposed to be going back
east for school?

41
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:06,973
- Change of plans. The parents decided they
were going to be staying in So Cal so I am
enrolling here on Monday.

42
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:11,777
- So how’s the party doing, man?

43
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:24,288
- Whoa, huh. Like this? Just like this.
What? Time for S’Mores?

44
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:31,309
- This is the good stuff. Ymmm. Is this
imported?

45
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:32,579
This is a private party, man.

46
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:39,855
- Oh, oh, is it? I-I-I’m sorry. I must have
been confused. Hey, I-let me ask you
something. Have I ever asked if you if I

47
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:02,712
- Am I supposed to apologise? Am I supposed
to shake in my boots?

48
00:04:04,274 --> 00:04:10,740
- Look around you, man. It ain’t 15 on four
tonight. Hey Caitlin. Baby you’ve been to my
house a bunch, right?

49
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:13,007
- It’s nice, right? It’s clean, well kept…

50
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:23,773
- Yeah. Do you wanna know why? It’s because
Weevil’s grandma keeps it that way. She -
she is a good little worker, your grandma,
yeah, spick and span.

51
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:35,730
- Yeah. It’s a tough job, you know. Grandma
says you go through a box of tissue a day.
Your room alone.

52
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:36,731
Well, what can I say? She’s a very sexy lady. 
Thank you.

53
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:47,105
- This is the Sheriff’s Department. I want
your ID’s out. Everyone remain where you are.

54
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:56,181
- No. Let’s get out, get the kegs. Tell the
guys cook -out at my place tomorrow night.

55
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:04,209
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah. Stay right there, stay
right there.

56
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:07,468
- Move your ass little man, come on. I'm losing.

57
00:05:07,492 --> 00:05:09,425
- Sheriff’s Department. Open up.

58
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:13,855
- Don’t worry about it Grandma, we’ll handle
it, all right?

59
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:27,915
- Go in. Boys. Letitia Navarro, I got a
warrant for your arrest. You need to come
with us.

60
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:30,725
- Oh, come on. What’s you problem, officer.
If you want me, be a man about it, bro.

61
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:33,138
Credit card fraud.

62
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,133
- Credit ca -? She doesn’t even have any
credit cards, man!

63
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:45,473
Not in her own name, no. But somebody took 
credit card offers out of the Echolls family
 trash. They opened up accounts.

64
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:48,865
They rang up charges
You heard anything about that?

65
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,581
Hey! Nah,
 I didn’t think so.

66
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:58,772
‘Cause it would take a major league loser
 to let a sweet old lady like that do
 his time for him.

67
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:20,234
- Listen to this list of charges to the card
– half dozen video games, limo rides, Magic
Mountain tickets, motorcycle gear. It goes

68
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:33,877
It’s gotta be the kid, Eli Navarro. What do
they call him?

69
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:34,771
Weevil.

70
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:40,998
- Oh, clearly it’s Weevil. Lamb doesn’t even
believe it’s Mrs Navarro but the PO Box
where the merchandise was sent was in her

71
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:44,857
name plus she was wearing a diamond pendant
purchased with one of the phoney cards.

72
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:47,397
Lamb could have set Weevil up,
 he hates him you know.

73
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:50,792
- Honey, I started picking up Eli Navarro
when he was 12.

74
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:51,793
He just helped me out of a jam recently,
 that’s all.

75
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:58,222
- Look, I’m sure he’s a real mensch but I’ve
got a grandma in jail and I’d really like to
get her out.

76
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,915
- We’ll dive in, thanks Cliff

77
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:08,014
Honey, he goes
to your school. You mind taking point on

78
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:10,523
this for a few days at least.
 I’m working on something.

79
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,022
I’ll see what I can find.

80
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:28,830
The trouble with befriending the leader of a
motorcycle gang is that at the end of the
day, he’s still the leader of a motorcycle

81
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:32,302
gang. And as much as I’d like to believe
differently, I doubt it’s his grandmother

82
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:35,444
who’s buying video games and paying for new
motorcycle paint jobs.

83
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,664
I’ve hospitalised people for less than what
you’re doing right now.

84
00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:43,345
What? Admiring your paint job?

85
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:46,388
- No, what you’re doing and admiring my
paint job isn’t it.

86
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:50,283
- I’m just following up on a few things for
the lawyer who’s representing your grandma.

87
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:52,981
- Yeah, I met the guy. He says I should
confess.

88
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,414
Do you think you will?

89
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:57,419
- I’ve got nothing to say to you, man.

90
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:06,588
- I’m just saying with your reputation, you
can’t blame McCormack for thinking that -

91
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:15,265
- My reputation? Oh well then I guess what
everybody says about you is true too, huh?
That you, you like it a little freaky, don’t

92
00:08:16,177 --> 00:08:23,508
you. That you spy on Duncan Kane. That you
send him pictures of yourself. Be honest
Veronica. You think you’re this big outsider

93
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:32,469
but, push comes to shove, you’re still one
of them. You still think like one of them.
Take off. I don’t want you around here.

"Dar crédito a quien lo merece"</b></i>

102
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:13,993
- Are you gonna wear that cap inside?
 At the table?

103
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:19,830
Do you think I’m offending someone?
 In here?

104
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:21,879
Simple etiquette, that’s all.

105
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:38,260
Ahhhh, if it isn’t my 
predecessor and mentor.
 How’s the dirty picture biz, boss?

106
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:45,154
- Looks like it’s better than being Sheriff,
actually. Yeah, you got a killer on the
loose, Lamb. In a daring daylight escape,

107
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:51,917
Ray Lee Hampstead, denied bail earlier this
week after his arrest for manslaughter,
broke out the back windshield of a Balboa

108
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:54,686
County’s Sheriff’s Department cruiser and
fled on foot.

109
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:57,730
Meeks and Johnson lost him. 
I think those are two guys you hired.

110
00:09:58,186 --> 00:10:05,535
You hear that, honey? That’s leadership.
 Way to stand up on your own two feet, Lamb 
and say, hey, the buck stoooops there.

111
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:11,089
You know what’s coming up October 3rd.
 Are you doing anything special to mark
 the one year anniversary of

112
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:16,222
Lilly Kane’s murder? Got it. 
Dress like a Sheriff and crucify some poor,

113
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,931
grieving father, just for old time’s sake,
 you know?

114
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:24,827
- Tell me again how you solved the crime of
the century. Now wait a minute, I remember,
I remember. An anonymous tip leads you to

115
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:29,862
the supposed killer’s houseboat. Did anybody
show up to collect the $100,000 reward

116
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,512
for that information?
 Do’ya find that strange?

117
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:39,740
- No. What about your theory? Jake Kane
murders his own daughter. We’ve got an
eyewitness and phone records that have him

118
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,354
nowhere near the house. And all the Kanes in
fact were accounted for
 at the time of the murder.

119
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:52,657
Hmm, what’s that? Nothing to say to
that, right? Sacks, we got our order ready?

120
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,946
- Good luck with that fugitive Don.

121
00:10:57,274 --> 00:10:58,661
- Smell ya, later.

122
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,408
Smell ya later?

123
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:07,167
- I gotta run. The counsellor wants to see
me before class.

124
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:07,949
About what?

125
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:13,322
- Uh, my schedule and my attitude, not
necessarily in that order. Her words.

126
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:31,875
- Giv’us a smile, luv.

127
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:46,764
- Oh hey. I signed up for diving but there
were only like four people in class so they

128
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:51,473
cancelled it, stuck me in here. So don’t you
mess with me, all right? I’m an Office Aide.

129
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:52,503
- That’s great!

130
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:53,856
Yeah, for who?

131
00:11:53,891 --> 00:12:01,751
- For me. I need you to copy all of Weevil’s
attendance records from this past month and
get them to me.

132
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,048
Do I look like James Bond to you?

133
00:12:05,237 --> 00:12:11,182
- Am I asking you to retrieve a nuclear
warhead? No. Just copy the attendance
records. It’s cake. Facile.

134
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:21,621
<i>- …why don’t you bring the caption down. See
how it works.</i>

135
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:24,864
- Can I help you with something?

136
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:32,242
- Ah, yeah. The counsellor stuck me in here.
She says I’m disconnected and passionless.

137
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:34,273
- Miss Dent?

138
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:36,699
Caitlin?

139
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:39,651
- I’m gonna go down to the gym to talk to
people for the student poll.

140
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:44,603
- Be back by the end of the period. And
remember that we are a multicultural school

141
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:48,626
with a diverse population of students from a
wide range of socio - economic backgrounds.

142
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:49,831
Meaning?

143
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,651
Meaning don’t just interview your friends.

144
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,896
So Veronica, welcome to newspaper class.

145
00:12:57,996 --> 00:13:00,063
- I was thinking maybe I could just take
pictures?

146
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:04,624
- Well I’m not sure if you can just do that
but we can start you there. Do you have any
experience with a camera?

147
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:12,463
- This is a 35mm camera. Now my suggestion
is you’re starting out is just to set it on
auto and that way you

148
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:18,708
- I’d really be more comfortable if I could
just use my own camera Um, the swivel LCD
really comes in handy when you’re doing

149
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,132
overhead shooting or
 ground level macro - shooting.

150
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:27,132
- The optical zoom actually goes up to
71.2mm and it's good to have
 the raw file option because you can

151
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:32,150
mess with the images post -exposure without 
nearly the loss of image quality you’d get
 with a JPEG file.

152
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:37,464
- And… when it’s dark outside, you should -
you should use a flash.

153
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:42,890
I have your first assignment.
 Are you free after school tomorrow?

154
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:43,987
I guess.

155
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:46,560
We’re doing a feature on Bodie Chang,
 you know him?

156
00:13:46,595 --> 00:13:49,293
- Surfer. Up until 20 minutes ago, I was in
study hall with him.

157
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:53,834
- That’s the guy. So he’s winning all these
competitions. He’s got another one up at
Gold Coast. Let me introduce you to the guy

158
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:59,179
who’s doing the story. Duncan Kane, this is
Veronica. Veronica’s going to be taking

159
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:01,592
pictures tomorrow and I arranged for you to
ride with Bodie’s parents.

160
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:02,669
I’ll drive.

161
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,007
- Great, maybe Veronica can -

162
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:04,997
I can drive too.

163
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:08,463
OK. Oil crisis be damned.

164
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:18,161
- Look at this. Half of these credit card
purchases are online orders and the ones

165
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:23,404
that were made on school days were made
between 11am and 12pm. That’s 4th period.

166
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:30,997
- Yeah, you realise don’t you that this guy
you’re trying to help out, duct taped me
butt naked to a flagpole just last week.

167
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,285
Man, you really hold a grudge.

168
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:37,057
- Yeah, I’m funny that way. Hey you’re
welcome for those records.

169
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:40,694
- Wallace, King Kong ain’t got nothin’ on
you.

170
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:41,671
How you know .

171
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:47,092
- But think about this. How can a guy who
according to these records was in autoshop

172
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:50,546
seven of the eight days these purchases were
made manage to make on - line orders.

173
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,730
- Aren’t you supposed to be trying to prove
he did it? So you can get his grandma out of
jail.

174
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:58,853
- But it’s impossible. There’s no internet
connection in autoshop.

175
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:00,881
- It can’t be hard for him to just slip out
of there.

176
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:02,202
Seven times?

177
00:15:04,768 --> 00:15:06,985
- Yeah but his arraignment isn’t until
Monday.

178
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:08,680
I don’t think he did it.

179
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,584
Who didn’t do what?

180
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:15,729
- Weevil. Listen, I was looking through the
attendance records at school and I just
don’t think it’s possible

181
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:16,692
- Veronica.

182
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,020
- Cliff’s just got back from the courthouse.

183
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,179
- They released Letty Navarro a couple of
hours ago.

184
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,122
That’s great.

185
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:26,335
- They released her because Eli ‘Weevil’
Navarro came in and confessed to the crime.

186
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,654
- No seriously, how difficult is it to find
good help these days.

187
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:44,218
- We had to let her go. If you can’t trust
your domestics, you don’t feel safe in your
own home.

188
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:52,792
- Did you guys know that 90% of all identity
theft is committed by relatives of the
victim?

189
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:56,832
That’s an interesting fact. At least
I think so.

190
00:15:57,543 --> 00:16:04,209
- But you know what? No one cares what you
think Veronica Mars. Not any more. Not since
you stabbed all your friends in the back.

191
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:09,338
- Tell the truth Veronica. Did you just sign
up for newspaper so you could be around
Duncan.

192
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:17,077
- No. I’m here so I can be closer to you. In
fact they’re thinking of putting me in your
4th period government class.

193
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,079
- We’ve got computer lab 4th period.

194
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Oh shoot. My loss.

195
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:34,686
- I printed out the entire browser history
from Logan Echolls' computer in his 4th period computer lab class.

196
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,265
So, is he guilty?

197
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:44,104
- Well of wanting desperately to see
pictures of Alyssa Milano naked, yes. But of
making bogus credit card charges, I don’t

198
00:16:44,593 --> 00:16:53,161
think so. Wait, the Neptune Grand. Logan
visited the Neptune Grand Hotel website. He
didn’t make reservations online but…

199
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:59,561
- But there’s a charge on the credit card
for the honeymoon suite.

200
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,464
Bummer

201
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:21,465
Flat?

202
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:22,466
Just as God made me.

203
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:39,633
- Are you always this Persnickety ?

204
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:44,758
- Sometimes I’m even persnickity - er. I’m
supposed to be taking surf competition photos

205
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:51,015
in Gold Coast in 30 minutes and this
is my second mysterious flat since school
started.

206
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:57,564
- Well here, I mean, let me help you. I’m
Troy, by the way.

207
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:58,980
I’m Veronica.

208
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:04,912
- Really. Veronica. OK, yeah, that -that
does make a lot more sense.

209
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,558
M-makes more sense how?

210
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:13,211
- Aaa, it’s nothing. I just, uh, should
never listen to those guys. I mean really,
who names a daughter Trampy McBitch.

211
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:19,762
- Nice ride.

212
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:22,025
- Hey munch, how ya’ doin’?

213
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:23,792
- Bien
- Two miles on there.

214
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:25,095
I know. It’s new.

215
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:25,988
- It’s cool. Been round school all day?

216
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,442
- What’s Troy doing talking to Veronica?

217
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,755
What do you care?

218
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:34,915
I don’t, I just… Has anyone told him?

219
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:49,685
- Hey Veronica, you need a ride? If we don’t
go now, we’ll miss it.

220
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,787
- Go ahead. I’ll finish this up and throw
the tools in the trunk.

221
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,552
Chivalry not dead. Good to know.
 I’m right over here.

222
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:16,143
I should have walked to Gold Coast. It’s
only 30 miles but with the awkward silence,
it feels like 300.

223
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:19,980
In five seconds, I’m just going to do the
Charlie’s Angel roll right out of the moving
car.

224
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:22,587
Five… four… three-

225
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:24,052
- Lilly loved this song.

226
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,333
- Why’d you join Pep Squad, Veronica?

227
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:33,270
Umm, the PE credit. You?

228
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:41,486
- Veronica, I suffer from too much pep. I
needed a pep outlet. Plus Sassy says girls
who join a club really get the fellas.

229
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:44,109
‘Cause you really need a lot of help on that front.

230
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:51,421
- Well, you know what my mom says. You have
to kiss a few toads… That’s it. That’s her
entire philosophy.

231
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:57,221
- All your mom ever says to me is: Veronica,
shouldn’t you be getting home soon?

232
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:58,105
- That sounds like her.

233
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:00,712
Why does she hate me?

234
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:05,927
- Um, it’s not your fault. She would hate
anyone she thought that Duncan might love as

235
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:12,640
much as her. Friendly advice. Watch her.
She’ll break the two of you up if she can.

236
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:32,385
- Licence and registration. Can I have the
two of you step out of the car.

237
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:40,808
- Got an impound notice on this vehicle.
Bunch of parking tickets and a moving
violation dated October 3rd.

238
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:52,747
- They want to impound the car. Guess there
were a bunch of tickets. No. Not mine.
Lilly’s.

239
00:21:53,808 --> 00:22:02,637
- Just outside of town on the PCH. About a
mile from the Real Inn. It’s a long story.
I’ll tell you when you get here.

240
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,585
- Pull it round the front.

241
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:26,618
Officer! Officer, ah, have you
 called this into the Sheriff?

242
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:30,966
- Aah, no sir. We generally don’t call in
routine traffic violations.

243
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:41,130
- Well, all right, why don’t you give him a
shout. Duncan? Did you get everything out of
- Hello, Veronica.

244
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:56,054
The last time my dad and Jake Kane were in
the same place at the same time, was in a

245
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:57,767
Sheriff’s Department interrogation room.

246
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:09,430
When Jake finished his story, Dad told the
 most powerful man in town that he was

247
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:12,851
sure he was somehow involved in
 his own daughter’s death.

248
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:19,812
Jake went to the press, the adoring press,
tears in his eyes and told the world how

249
00:23:20,235 --> 00:23:23,183
much he missed his baby and how
 he was wrongfully accused.

250
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:29,780
The fine people of Neptune gathered their
pitchforks and torches, stormed the County

251
00:23:29,804 --> 00:23:37,176
Commissioner’s Office and ran Dad out of
office. My friends got on the bandwagon as

252
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,766
well. They gave me a choice. I could stand
by my dad or stand by Duncan and my dead

253
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:56,041
best friend’s family. I chose Dad. It’s a
decision I live with every day. And you want
to know the kicker? I don’t even know what’s

254
00:23:56,065 --> 00:24:01,598
true anymore. Maybe everyone else is right.
Maybe Dad screwed up the investigation.

255
00:24:01,622 --> 00:24:07,664
Maybe I gave up my circle of friends, my
life over an error in Dad’s judgement.

256
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:15,370
- Hold on, we’re not going to move the car,
okay. So sorry Mr Kane, I had no idea.

257
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:26,707
- So? What’s up? You and Duncan starting to
hang out again?

258
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:31,694
Yeah, I’ll tell you the details of my
personal life if you tell me why you went

259
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:34,726
after Jake Kane when to everyone else he was
a heart-broken father.

260
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:43,685
- No. School assignment, that’s all. Can we
stop by the Neptune Grand?

261
00:24:48,913 --> 00:24:52,322
- Isn’t that already solved? I thought that
they had the confessed criminal in jail.

262
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:02,273
Oh,
all right. Fine. What do you need me to do?

263
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,649
- Excuse me. We need to talk to somebody in
security right now.

264
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:15,702
Right now!

265
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:18,388
Dad! Will you just back off and let me handle it?

266
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:21,677
- You handle it or I handle it but we’re
gonna get to the bottom of this, right now.

267
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,294
- No! You just stand over there. You’re
scaring people. Hi. I’m really hoping you
can help me with this.

268
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:34,939
- I came in here about a month ago with a
guy… Long story short, I’m pregnant.

269
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:44,471
- Um, here’s the thing. The next part’s a
little embarrassing. I don’t remember the
guy’s name. Or what he looks like.

270
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:48,186
Tequilla?
Never again

271
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:56,607
My dad’s wondering if there’s
any sort of surveillance video we could take
a look at or… Here’s the credit card bill.

272
00:25:58,105 --> 00:25:59,442
He had me pay for the room.

273
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:14,997
- You were a little bit over the top.

274
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:19,380
- You think it worked? A little bit. I can
bring it down. You try it. You try being bad
cop.

275
00:26:24,268 --> 00:26:30,425
- I’m sorry but we only keep video
surveillance for two weeks but I did get
your detailed bill summary.

276
00:26:32,836 --> 00:26:43,556
- Oh, thanks. Guess who signed for room
service in a room charged to the Echolls
family credit card?

277
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,552
- Logan’s girlfriend, Caitlin Ford.

278
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:54,909
I know it was you.

279
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:59,684
- You stole your mom’s credit cards but you
made a mistake when you went to the Hotel

280
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:02,779
Neptune Grand ‘cause you let Caitlin sign
for the room service tab.

281
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:18,518
- Pretty cool, huh?

282
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,566
Wanted man, coming through.

283
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:36,236
I believe you misplaced this.

284
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,537
- Tommy, go on, get him to holding.

285
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:44,812
- You don’t think we should alert the media,
I mean take some pictures. I thought that

286
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:55,155
was standard operating procedure here now.
Hi, Inga. How are Trixie and Bud?

287
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:57,486
- Trixie just had puppies. There’s still one
left.

288
00:28:00,108 --> 00:28:10,256
- Now do you plan on cutting the reward
cheque personally or should I talk to Cathy
down in accounts payable? Shall I follow you?

289
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,636
- That’s so typical.

290
00:28:16,874 --> 00:28:17,951
- How’s that spare tire holding out?

291
00:28:18,537 --> 00:28:21,242
Aah. There it is, the quid pro quo.

292
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:27,170
- Hey, this great nation of ours was built
on quid pro quo. I am having a party on
Saturday and you should come.

293
00:28:27,194 --> 00:28:28,879
Well, both of
you.

294
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:35,088
- Haven’t you heard? I’m not allowed in the
first class cabin.

295
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:46,246
- Look. Uh, I don’t believe in much but I do
believe in this. When sexy, sassy girls
can’t come to a shindig of mine, it’s time

296
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,401
for all parties involved to stand up and
just admit that, hey, maybe I was a little

297
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:56,836
bit wrong or sorry. I mean let bygones be
bygones, screw pride. Let’s dance baby,
let’s dance.

298
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,538
- That was beautiful, man.

299
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:01,666
We’ll see.

300
00:29:01,788 --> 00:29:04,721
An open mind. That’s all I ask.

301
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:13,746
Is it that easy? Saying maybe I was wrong
and get my old life back?

302
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,504
- Where you off to, superfly?

303
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:27,875
I’m gonna nail that sucker.

304
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,925
And this kid Troy, how long
 have you known him?

305
00:29:38,983 --> 00:29:46,185
- Oh, a few years. His family has the slip
next to ours down at the marina. They
usually come in August. Stay the month. They

306
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:51,397
move around a lot. You know, wherever his
dad has a project. Hey, I’m going to get a
burrito. Want something?

307
00:29:54,574 --> 00:29:56,416
- Well you are in charge of your
girlfriend’s purse.

308
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:43,735
- Yeah, hi. Uh, this number appeared on my
cell phone bill and I don’t recognise it.
Can you tell me who this is?

309
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:32,311
- Baby? Hello? Baby? Ah, you want to play
the silent game. Alright, baby, later we’ll
play a tickle game if you want.

310
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:41,173
- That’s cool baby, I’ll just talk. I know
you like it. I miss you mama. I can’t wait
to see you.

311
00:31:57,613 --> 00:31:59,028
- Confess, it’s good for the soul.

312
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,918
- Moron says what.

313
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:04,261
- You’re busted, Chardo, do I have to spell
it out for you?

314
00:32:04,685 --> 00:32:05,904
Yeah, why don’t you?

315
00:32:07,337 --> 00:32:14,310
- All right. So one day, you go to pick up
your grandma at the Echolls house and she
asks you to take out a bag of trash and

316
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:20,762
there they are in front of you, virgin, high-
limit, pre-approved credit card
applications. Just phone in the confirmation

317
00:32:20,786 --> 00:32:28,125
code and start spending. Then you use Logan
Echolls’ family’s credit cards to take out
Caitlin Ford in the manner to which she’s

318
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:34,362
accustomed. Gourmet meals, five star hotels,
limo rides. But the best part about it… is

319
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:37,719
that your cousin Weevil takes the fall for
you. So you’re promoted.

320
00:32:37,743 --> 00:32:41,288
- I didn’t want that to happen. Weevil’s
like my brother.

321
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,448
- You know what? It’s killing me, okay? But
you see, I got a plan.

322
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:51,062
I’m all ears.

323
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:59,320
- Caitlin and me. We’re gonna run away. We
are and once we’re gone, then I’ll write a

324
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,410
confession, I’ll send it back. They gotta
let Weevil go then.

325
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:06,972
- Chardo? Caitlin Ford is never gonna run
away with you.

326
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:08,308
You don’t know her.

327
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:14,498
- Oh, I know her. She’s a thrill seeker.
Doing you was like doing the do and that’s

328
00:33:14,522 --> 00:33:19,328
all it was. You can’t go out there because
Logan knows and he wants your head on a
stick.

329
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:22,782
I ain’t hiding, am I?

330
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:24,678
- What are you going to do when Weevil finds
out?

331
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,222
- How’s Weevil gonna find out.

332
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:29,633
You should turn yourself in.

333
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:36,851
I ain’t going nowhere without her. 
 Caitlin and me, we love each other.

334
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:44,343
- So tell me why every time I see her, Logan
Echolls has his hands all over her.

335
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:51,740
- I don’t understand why you’re doing it.
You know that Chardo gave you that pendant

336
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:53,629
but you’re letting Weevil do the time for
him?

337
00:33:55,111 --> 00:34:03,207
- Eli is still 17. Chardo is 18 and he’s got
a record. They’d send him to prison. Weevil
can do four months of juvie.

338
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:04,928
- Weevil thinks he’s taking the fall for you.

339
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:06,653
I have dinner to fix.

340
00:34:10,024 --> 00:34:15,416
- Do you know what he was doing with those
credit cards? He spent all that money,

341
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:24,547
thousands of dollars, taking out a spoiled,
rich, white girl. Logan Echolls’ girlfriend.
You must have met her. Caitlin Ford?

342
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:30,299
Iee no, not her. Huh! She doesn’t like her
 ice cubes made with tap water.

343
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:37,638
- You lost your job and now Weevil’s doing
time so that Chardo can take this girl out
in style.

344
00:34:41,598 --> 00:34:42,803
Let me see those receipts.

345
00:35:01,244 --> 00:35:06,457
- Veronica Mars, I hear you’re to thank for
this Kodak moment. Didn’t you get the memo?

346
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:10,008
The bad guy was already in jail. Gimme some
love.

347
00:35:10,032 --> 00:35:12,663
- Eho, I wanna make you something to eat.

348
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:20,336
- You should know. The judge issued a
warrant for Chardo after authorising your
release. They’re out looking for him.

349
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:27,226
- Logan and the 09er’s are after Chardo too.
You should find him before they do.

350
00:35:30,352 --> 00:35:36,429
- Baby, it’s me. I’m outside. This is it.
It’s time to go, it’s what we talked about.

351
00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:42,083
Caitlin! Look outside your window. I’m here.
What’s wrong, baby?

352
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:58,648
- Well. If it isn’t the bad apple thinking
he can steal my girl.

353
00:35:58,649 --> 00:35:59,649
I already stole your girlfriend. 
You’re just too dumb to know it.

354
00:36:09,276 --> 00:36:10,221
Check it out man.

355
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,091
Sweet music, huh?

356
00:36:22,536 --> 00:36:23,659
- - Hold him.

357
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,789
Don’t move.

358
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:38,451
- Well, I guess this is what they call
inevitable, huh? Hey look, you even got
 home court advantage.

359
00:36:39,835 --> 00:36:40,911
Let’s talk.

360
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:47,185
- What’s up with that, man.

361
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:00,431
- - Let him go.

362
00:37:00,455 --> 00:37:01,651
- I said let him go.

363
00:37:17,618 --> 00:37:22,455
- You’re the man, you know what I’m saying.
You were there for me. I like that. I
appreciate it, you know what I’m saying.

364
00:37:24,818 --> 00:37:32,097
Most of all to you man. I’m sorry you had to
take the fall. I was gonna get you out. You
and me, we’re brothers.

365
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:35,425
You’re out.

366
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:40,083
Out of the club. Out of my life.

367
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:42,249
And you know what that means.

368
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:52,264
- Weevil, come on! Cous! Hey, let me make it
up to you. Eli! Eli!

369
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,098
- Pull them off before they go too far.

370
00:37:58,652 --> 00:37:59,481
You got it boss.

371
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:18,658
Dad?

372
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:20,660
- Yeah, honey.

373
00:38:21,996 --> 00:38:23,999
- What made you go after Jake Kane?

374
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:27,797
What makes you ask?

375
00:38:29,783 --> 00:38:38,432
- Other than that question defines our very
existence? I think if I knew more about the
case and the evidence…

376
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:46,888
- Honey, it’s ugly. I want thoughts of
Lilly’s death out of your head. I don’t
wanna pour more into it.

377
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:47,932
I can handle it.

378
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:54,970
- Let’s look at it this way. If I knew what
would happen to us, that your mom would
leave,

379
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:58,931
that school would get tougher for
you, I never would have pursued Jake Kane
the way I did.

380
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,663
I still wanna know.

381
00:39:02,348 --> 00:39:04,646
I know you do. Let’s go home.

382
00:39:08,274 --> 00:39:13,958
A couple of weeks before Lilly was murdered
and Dad was still Sheriff, she and I snuck
into the backroom and made ourselves fake

383
00:39:13,982 --> 00:39:21,940
IDs so we could get into clubs. I had them
sent to my house. The arrived days after her
body was discovered. I stuck them in a

384
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:27,805
drawer and forgot about them until the
deputy mentioned Lilly’s October 3rd ticket.
The good thing about visiting the Sheriff’s

385
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:32,482
Department on a Sunday, is that most of the
people who work on weekends don’t remember
me. They’re new.

386
00:39:35,185 --> 00:39:40,465
- Yeah, the insurance company called my dad
and said we had an outstanding ticket. Um,
there’s the licence number.

387
00:39:41,117 --> 00:39:42,564
OK and can I see your ID?

388
00:39:47,372 --> 00:39:49,163
What are you doing here?

389
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:51,216
- I’m just paying off a ticket.

390
00:39:54,703 --> 00:39:58,856
Hey, any luck finding Chardo Navarro?
 No? You should

391
00:39:59,058 --> 00:40:01,071
talk to my dad, he’s really good at that
sort of thing.

392
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:03,320
You got a smart mouth, kid.

393
00:40:07,662 --> 00:40:10,203
- Yeah, I don’t think there’s any wiggle
room on this one.

394
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:11,590
Thanks. I’ll mail in the payment.

395
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:14,571
All right, Miss Kane. Sorry ‘bout the bad news.

396
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:27,323
I haven’t gone more than 30 minutes without
glancing at the ticket. One of those
automated intersection cameras caught Lilly

397
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:36,266
running a red light at 6:02PM, almost two
hours after her supposed time of death. I
don’t know if it’s the photo of Lilly,

398
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:43,810
singing and smiling on the final day of her
life that’s been haunting me or the fact
that suddenly none of the Kanes have alibis

399
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:50,406
that hold up – Jake, Celeste, even Duncan.
Dad was right. The case doesn’t add up.

400
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:56,655
I made a choice a long time ago. Stand by Dad
or stand by the people tearing him down.

401
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:01,998
You didn’t make it Saturday night.

402
00:41:04,043 --> 00:41:07,398
- I guess I didn’t feel I was even a little
bit wrong or sorry.

403
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:14,102
- Well a wise man once said that a ‘No’ is
like a ‘Yes’ except with different letters

404
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:18,189
and arranged in a different order and spoken
out loud but, you know, it disappears on the
wind.

405
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:26,042
- There goes the neighbourhood. They just
put Golden Tee in at Sac-n-Pac. You need to

406
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,481
go there ‘cause your not going to get your
free game-

407
00:41:27,516 --> 00:41:28,757
Guys. Look.

408
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,070
Hate to be her.

409
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:01,784
- Yeah, that would suck. I’ve never played
Golden Tee but I’m pretty sure I can kick
both your asses.

410
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:02,782
- Ooh.

411
00:42:02,806 --> 00:42:04,209
- Lead the way.

412
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,186
I’m just saying…

413
00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:07,189
- I think we got a competition…

414
