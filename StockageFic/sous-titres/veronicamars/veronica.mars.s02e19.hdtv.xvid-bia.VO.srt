1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:02,144 --> 00:00:03,499
It's my stepmom.
She's a gold digger.

3
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:04,957
It's obvious to everyone else
in the world.

4
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:08,142
Mrs. Hauser may have seen 
an ill-conceived cutting board.

5
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:10,100
I saw tagging.
I saw code.

6
00:00:10,153 --> 00:00:11,553
Tell me about you and Betina.

7
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:13,155
She had nothing to be scorned about.

8
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:15,346
I even gave her my sharks
memorabilia gift bag.

9
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:17,783
To get the whole bus,
you'd have to be close enough.

10
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:20,835
To see exactly where we were.

11
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,892
You think it was Weevil.

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,153
You're cash-strapped.
I can help.

13
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:28,897
But quid pro quo, mrs. C.
Quid pro quo.

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,401
It's Weevil!
I'm telling you -- he set me up!

15
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:32,574
And I got something on you --

16
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:37,444
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

17
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,592
Would you like me to repeat
the question, miss Mars?

18
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:47,375
Could you?

19
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:53,176
You said you saw mr. Echolls and
ms. Kane having sex on the videotape.

20
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,179
That's right.

21
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:56,008
The actual act of intercourse?

22
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:58,038
A sheet was covering them, but

23
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:02,034
the motion of their bodies
suggested copulation.

24
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:04,371
-It just looked like sex.
-And sounded like sex.

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,727
Is this an area you have a particular
knowledge in, miss Mars?

26
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:08,922
Mr. Levois.

27
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:10,777
She said it looked as though
they were having sex.

28
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:13,575
I need to make sure she knows
what sex looks like.

29
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:17,117
I'm sure miss Mars has had 
the required sexual education course 

30
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:18,861
provided by Neptune high school.

31
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:19,890
I got an A-minus.

32
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:22,368
Plus, I watch animal planet.

33
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:26,296
Statutory rape is a grave accusation.

34
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:27,732
Not to a murderer.

35
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:30,059
I just have one more question,
miss Mars.

36
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:34,304
Are you still keeping in touch
with Duncan Kane?

37
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:42,580
Prepare to have your mind blown.

38
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:44,930
Are you ready?

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,252
Think back 18 years.

40
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:49,659
Small blond baby --

41
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:51,066
born ready.

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,550
Richard Casablancas was using
the life insurance

43
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:56,248
they had taken out for Dick
and Cassidy as a tax shelter.

44
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,824
The payout on their policies
is over eight figures,

45
00:01:58,908 --> 00:01:59,737
and here's the kicker --

46
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:03,132
the beneficiary, should both brothers
die simultaneously...

47
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,570
Kendall Casablancas.

48
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:09,403
The wicked stepmother trying 
to bump off her rich husband's spawn.

49
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:11,269
That's a Disney movie,
isn't it?

50
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,472
She certainly had motive.

51
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:15,208
It's her capability I'm not sure of.

52
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:17,846
I wouldn't underestimate
her capabilities.

53
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:21,253
She went from spandex
to cashmere pretty fast.

54
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:24,168
I think I'll poke around, see what she
was up to the day of the crash.

55
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,087
Random locker searches --

56
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:32,197
a bummer for the unknowing students
caught with loot.

57
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:40,662
-Veronica Mars?
-Here.

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,896
Eli Navarro?

59
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:46,137
Eli?

60
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,345
I think it's time for you
to feed buddy.

61
00:02:48,697 --> 00:02:50,403
It's breakfast time!

62
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:54,546
Come and get it, girl.

63
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,370
Someone was hungry, huh?

64
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:08,777
Someone is baby-talking a python.

65
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:12,722
Yeah. We got a special connection,
me and buddy.

66
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:14,608
Top of the food chain.

67
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:17,219
Well, on behalf of nature,

68
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:19,783
thank you for doing your part
in the circle of life.

69
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,648
Hey, I got no problem
sacrificing a rat.

70
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,481
Mac-attack,
what's the haps?

71
00:03:39,957 --> 00:03:42,415
I got mugged.
By my own principal.

72
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:44,263
They took my cellphone interceptor 

73
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:46,704
and apparently plan on keeping it
until the end of the year.

74
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,401
What happened to "end of the day"?
Why wasn't that working?

75
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:53,017
Everyone still kept bringing
in their cellphone interceptors?

76
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:54,735
Is there any chance
you can get it back for me?

77
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:56,165
I borrowed it from 
my buddy at radioshack

78
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:58,604
because apparently I've become a
psycho ex-girlfriend,

79
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:01,097
and I wanted to listen 
to Beaver's cellphone calls.

80
00:04:03,374 --> 00:04:05,983
-You're judging me.
-Nope. I'm judging myself.

81
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:08,440
"Why don't I have
a cellphone interceptor?"

82
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:10,530
Please respect the business model,
Veronica.

83
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:13,255
I do the gadgets.
You do the actual espionage.

84
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:14,999
I'll see what I can do.

85
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,589
I don't know if waiting for Clemmons 
to go lunch qualifies as espionage,

86
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,860
but setting off 
his secretary's car alarm?

87
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,384
Pure Bond.

88
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:34,625
He changed his lock?

89
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,570
Man, he's gotten paranoid.

90
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:42,661
Hey, Vincent.

91
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:44,373
I was hoping you could do me a favor.

92
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:47,418
That box of confiscated items
in your dad's office --

93
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:48,901
the locker-search booty?

94
00:04:48,953 --> 00:04:49,910
Yeah?

95
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:53,214
I was hoping you could help me get
something out of it for my friend Mac.

96
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:56,527
-What's in it for me?
-You get to stick it to the man?

97
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:58,119
And by the man,
I mean your dad.

98
00:04:58,709 --> 00:04:59,978
I get to do that plenty.

99
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:03,068
I do need a prom date, though.

100
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:05,500
I am not going to prom
with you, Butters.

101
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:06,931
I wasn't asking.

102
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:10,250
So,  what? I'm supposed to go out
and find you a prom date?

103
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,449
I want to go with your friend Mac.

104
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,741
I think that can be arranged.

105
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,558
My dad always has bus-circle duty

106
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,264
immediately after
the last bell of the day.

107
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:23,711
Meet me in his office.

108
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:38,910
-That  was your secret knock?
-The genius is its simplicity.

109
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:41,676
We have exactly 11 minutes
before my dad gets back.

110
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,271
The box is under there.

111
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:47,237
Wow, Butters.
This is way cool of you.

112
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:51,638
Just so you know, I'm an excellent
dancer, so don't worry about that.

113
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:53,557
Oh.

114
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:56,952
Okay.
I'll try not to.

115
00:05:58,377 --> 00:05:59,832
Well, I don't have to dance, though.

116
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:03,202
I enjoy it, but I also enjoy
a good conversation.

117
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:05,093
Look -- fake vomit...

118
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:09,934
courtesy of locker 213
and whoever is in locker 792

119
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:12,850
is sans one "smell it, bitch" t-shirt.

120
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:15,836
So, Mac, what color dress
are you wearing?

121
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,302
I'm actually wearing pants.

122
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:22,653
I just don't want the corsage
to be, like, blue,

123
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,319
and your dress is red,
and you think I'm an idiot.

124
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:33,181
-Veronica?
-Oh, your cellphone interceptor.

125
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:41,658
Do you mind if I give this 
"Anarchist Cookbook" back to Weevil?

126
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:43,023
You know his locker number?

127
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,671
Who else would brag about
meeting Satan halfway?

128
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:47,268
Fine.

129
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:50,114
I'm thinking white limo.
If that's cool.

130
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:55,377
Wow.

131
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:59,384
You look exactly like this calendar
in my uncle's garage.

132
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:02,367
Now hop your ass off
before you scratch my paint.

133
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:04,321
You seen Thumper lately,
Weevil?

134
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,985
It's just...nobody's heard
from him in weeks.

135
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,147
He doesn't show up soon,
he's gonna miss prom.

136
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:12,402
Yeah, well,
I'm sure he's crushed.

137
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,450
So, I found this in Clemmons' office.

138
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:18,925
According to the note,

139
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,886
it was confiscated from your locker
the first week of school.

140
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:25,451
Any particular reason you needed
"the Anarchist Cookbook"?

141
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,905
Yeah. I tried making
the survivalist stew.

142
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,478
Didn't much care for it.

143
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:31,109
Yeah, on top of the stew,

144
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,202
it's also a manual for making
bombs in your basement.

145
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,213
Wait a minute.

146
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:37,597
Just so we understand each other,

147
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:39,432
are you accusing me 
of blowing up the bus?

148
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,858
I'm exploring a theory.

149
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:44,689
You didn't just happen to be at 
the gas station out on the P.C.H.

150
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:45,857
You were following us,
Weevil.

151
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,987
The explosion didn't kill those people.

152
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,419
The drop into the ocean did.

153
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:51,670
Who else could have timed it like that?

154
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:54,074
You could have hit "send" 
on your cellphone,

155
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:55,902
blown up the bus without 
me even knowing it.

156
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:58,970
Except why would I blow up a bus
with one of my boys on it, huh?

157
00:07:59,028 --> 00:07:59,753
You didn't mean to.

158
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,667
You and Cervando meant
to take out the limo.

159
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:05,733
You, mr. "I sacrifice rats",

160
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,748
even put a dead one on the bus
to force the rich kids into it.

161
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:09,737
And what?

162
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,533
We got the big yellow bus
and the long black limo confused?

163
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:14,963
Nope. You put the bomb
in Dick's goody bag.

164
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:17,673
You didn't realize
he gave his bag to Betina.

165
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:21,587
You really think any of those 09ers
was worth all that effort to me?

166
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:23,774
-Logan was.
-He wasn't even there.

167
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,837
He was supposed to be.

168
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:29,027
Are you telling me you wouldn't off
the guy who killed Felix?

169
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,526
Well, at least you got it right
with Thumper.

170
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,385
That makes you top of the food chain
again, right, Weevil?

171
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,681
<i>A long time ago,</i>

172
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:51,683
<i>We used to be friends but I</i>

173
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:55,089
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all</i>

174
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:58,990
<i>Come on,now, sugar!</i>

175
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:01,244
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

176
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,534
<i>Just remember me when</i>

177
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,990
<i>We used to be friends</i>

178
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,260
<i>A long time ago</i>

179
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:11,853
<i>We used to be friends</i>

180
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:16,460
<i>Veronica Mars 2x19
"Nevermind the Buttocks"</i>

181
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,529
You've been following me.

182
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:31,130
I hear you can find stuff.

183
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,244
Sometimes...for a fee.

184
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:37,018
I want you to find the owner of a car.

185
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:39,747
My, uh...

186
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:43,166
my dog, Apache.

187
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:45,387
Someone ran over him.

188
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:50,185
They swerved right onto the lawn,
and they killed him.

189
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:51,872
That really sucks.

190
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,431
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:55,711
I heard tires skidding.

192
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:57,724
I caught a glimpse 
of the back of the car.

193
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:03,999
How much would you charge
to track it down?

194
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,109
Depends.

195
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:09,092
50 bucks if it's easy online stuff.

196
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:11,035
If I really have to dive in,

197
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:13,009
it  could run you $250.

198
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,667
Is there any way
I could pay you with meat?

199
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:16,478
Meat?

200
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:19,185
The best times of my life
were with that dog.

201
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:20,914
He loved to go hunting.

202
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,386
Loved it.

203
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,095
That's  it.

204
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:25,788
Except it was green.

205
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,620
Okay.
Green plymouth barracuda.

206
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:32,098
1970 to '73.

207
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:34,020
Good news, Harry.

208
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:37,840
I don't see a lot of 'cudas except on
"Nash Bridges" reruns.

209
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:44,562
Now let's see exactly how many
are registered in Neptune.

210
00:10:57,632 --> 00:10:59,831
Exactly none.

211
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:01,933
But you'll keep looking?

212
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:06,433
I will.

213
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:08,678
Can no one find Bob Patton?

214
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,646
He owes me a 10-inch story
on the high price of graduation.

215
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:14,616
Veronica, you mind digging up
a generic student-life photo?

216
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:16,335
Any photo. We've got a hole to fill.

217
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,141
How much would it be
to buy an ad that size?

218
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,195
40 bucks.

219
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:27,163
Veronica,
I've got a favor to ask.

220
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:28,085
Who doesn't?

221
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:30,733
I was hoping you could put in
a good word for me at the hut.

222
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:33,195
I already dropped off an application.

223
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:34,440
Like, for a job?

224
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:38,141
Please, Jackie.

225
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,107
$6.75 an hour isn't gonna keep
your dog in sweaters.

226
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:42,790
The Cook family assets
have been frozen.

227
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,853
The only company at home
are repossessors.

228
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:48,869
Okay.
I'll see what I can do.

229
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,852
Oh, hey.

230
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,055
Um, I know you're looking
for another waitress.

231
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,301
Um, someone I know --

232
00:12:03,997 --> 00:12:05,980
a friend --
dropped off an application.

233
00:12:06,036 --> 00:12:07,182
Her name is Jackie.

234
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,132
I got a whole stack of applications.

235
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:11,386
Your friend has no experience. None.

236
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:12,802
She's never held a job.

237
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,666
She could really use it.

238
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:16,490
You'll vouch for her?

239
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:18,145
If she sucks, you'll fire her?

240
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:21,923
-Yeah.
-She can start tomorrow.

241
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,651
There's no way
you're working that hard.

242
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:32,991
You heard me coming and turned off
"South Beach," didn't you?

243
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,060
Can you think of
any reason Logan Echolls

244
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,275
would have gotten three calls from
Kendall on the day of the crash?

245
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:44,210
Well, let's see.

246
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:49,628
I believe the latin term
is "coetus sordidus."

247
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,039
They were sleeping together?

248
00:12:52,668 --> 00:12:55,160
That was weeks before
Kendall's husband fled the country.

249
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:58,057
Logan may be a little fuzzy
on the commandments.

250
00:12:58,116 --> 00:13:00,161
Wow.
And you knew about this?

251
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,096
Not at the time.

252
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:06,942
You think you could stomach finding out
if Logan happened to be

253
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:08,702
with Kendall at the time of the crash?

254
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,803
As a rule, I like to start
every school day

255
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:19,158
with a hot blonde waiting for me
in the parking lot.

256
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:20,247
Me too.

257
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,333
-I'm not blond.
-Or hot.

258
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:23,502
Got a question for you.

259
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:27,092
Remember back when you were doing
the deed with Dick's stepmom?

260
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:30,134
Mmm, vaguely.
I remember she thought I was hot.

261
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,995
Were you with her
on the day of the crash?

262
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:34,214
You two talked on the phone
a few times that day.

263
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:36,485
Man,  you're obsessed with my sex life.

264
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:39,056
Do I need to start carrying around
a webcam from now on?

265
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:41,450
-Logan.
-Day of the crash, day of the crash...

266
00:13:41,718 --> 00:13:45,182
uh...I'd really have to consult
my feelings journal to be sure.

267
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,643
Kendall stood to make millions

268
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,325
by sending Dick and Beaver
over that cliff.

269
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:49,789
There was an insurance policy.

270
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:52,578
Kendall requires a domestic staff
to make cereal.

271
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,324
Think she could really plot a murder?

272
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:55,822
Were you with her at 7:03?

273
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,310
Actually, she kicked me out
before the sheets were dry.

274
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:00,860
But considering her husband's
fondness for handguns 

275
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:03,064
and the fact that Dick and Beaver 
could come home any minute,

276
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:04,207
who could blame her?

277
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:05,724
Anything else?

278
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:09,750
Oh, I got to second base
with Tammy Forester

279
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:11,893
in eighth grade in Duncan's closet.

280
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,609
Last summer,
I made this townie girl moan

281
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,017
without even using my hands.

282
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,734
Is any of this relevant?

283
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:19,462
Should I make a list?

284
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,169
Veronica...

285
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,021
you placed this ad, right?

286
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,244
This is your e-mail?

287
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:28,302
-Yeah.
-I've seen this car.

288
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:29,947
This car mooned me.

289
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:31,892
Or at least some guy in the car did.

290
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:32,849
Where? When?

291
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:35,989
September 13th, 7:00 P.M.,
Pacific Coast Highway.

292
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:36,926
Gia...

293
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:38,101
it passed by our limo

294
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:40,343
just a few minutes
before the bus went off the cliff.

295
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:49,537
So you're saying a green barracuda
passed you guys in the limo?

296
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,366
Yeah.

297
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,841
I mean, is this a barracuda?
I'm not a car person.

298
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,903
Yes.

299
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:56,338
What did the guy look like?

300
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:57,742
All I saw was his butt.

301
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:59,946
He gave us a pressed ham
as they drove by...

302
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:01,383
or should I say "gave me"?

303
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,568
I was the only one in the limo
facing that direction.

304
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:06,371
I just figured they were
a couple of stupid college kids.

305
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,437
Why is that?

306
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:10,155
They had this mascot sticker
in the side window.

307
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:12,003
How long before the crash was it?

308
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:13,332
A few minutes.

309
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:15,526
I only remember because I was
on the phone with my dad.

310
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,028
He was calling to see where I was

311
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:20,080
to make sure I was able to pick up
Rodney after his piano lesson.

312
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:22,246
Thanks.

313
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,411
Okay, I tried.

314
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:25,893
It doesn't work.

315
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,828
You want us to do this platonic thing,

316
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:30,011
you gonna have to make
some adjustments.

317
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:31,046
Like what?

318
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:34,413
Like...that.

319
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:35,559
And this.

320
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:37,228
What do you want me to do, Wallace?

321
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,790
My burka's at the cleaners.

322
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:40,727
Let me drop this dumb pals act.

323
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:41,850
Wallace, I told you.

324
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:43,205
It's been two weeks.

325
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,666
That's like a decade
in high-school years.

326
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:47,732
Jane's going on a date this weekend.

327
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:49,766
Why are you so worried
about what other people think?

328
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,543
I mean, you're already that girl
whose dad blew up the kids.

329
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:56,649
Think anyone's out there saying,

330
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,415
"yeah, but at least she keeps her hands
off of other girls' ex-boyfriends"?

331
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,746
Thanks for breaking it down,
Wallace.

332
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:03,064
Hey, come on.

333
00:16:03,386 --> 00:16:04,523
You know what I'm trying to say?

334
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,975
Yeah?

335
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:33,194
Hi. I'm Veronica.

336
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:35,019
Yeah, you go to Neptune, right?

337
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,290
You're  like a cheerleader or something?

338
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,232
Or something.

339
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,962
Can you tell me where I can find Harry?

340
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:40,962
What'll you give me?

341
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,151
Two bits, four bits,
six bits, a dollar.

342
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:45,168
And as a bonus,
I won't beat you silly.

343
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:46,722
I might like that.

344
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,887
Ow! Ow!

345
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,605
No, I don't think you would.

346
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:53,268
He's out back.

347
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,102
I hate fake deer, too.

348
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:11,806
Every time I see their stupid
fake-deer faces,

349
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:14,255
I want to grab a shotgun
and go all Cheney on them.

350
00:17:14,562 --> 00:17:15,561
So, did you find the guy?

351
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:18,977
Not yet.
Just a small lead.

352
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:21,054
Maybe.

353
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:23,984
But you will find him, right?

354
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,636
Do you have some deep-seated deer
issues you want to talk about?

355
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:31,409
Nope.
I love animals.

356
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:32,611
They're delicious, right?

357
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,810
Ha ha.

358
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:38,523
So, you said there was a lead?

359
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:40,873
Uh, sort of.

360
00:17:42,215 --> 00:17:43,498
Do you remember on the car,

361
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,779
was there a sticker on the window?

362
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,249
I don't know.
There might have been.

363
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,584
It was pretty dark.

364
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,730
-Is it important?
-Uh, I don't know.

365
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:50,861
It could be nothing.

366
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:56,225
I really want this guy found.

367
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:16,487
Come here to start something, dawg?

368
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,994
Just let me wash up beforehand...

369
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:23,210
unless you don't mind grease
around your throat.

370
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:24,487
You made a mistake.

371
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:25,655
Mistake?

372
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,317
So you come here 'cause
you think you can take it back?

373
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:30,250
'Cause it's all I can do.

374
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:33,252
It's the Fitzpatricks,
Weevil.

375
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:35,137
They've been all over us.

376
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:37,117
Just treating us like their bitches.

377
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,113
My guess would be that's 'cause
you are their bitches.

378
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:41,660
Just been getting worse, man.

379
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:44,058
We need help.

380
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:45,977
You still here, Hector?

381
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:47,603
Remember Arturo?

382
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:50,184
That freshman you wouldn't let join up?

383
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,341
He got a cigarette lighter to his face
when he missed a payment.

384
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:56,840
People are gonna die, Weevil.

385
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,350
Your people.

386
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:01,336
Thought you should know.

387
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,845
Hey, dad.

388
00:19:11,222 --> 00:19:12,062
Okay, honey.

389
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:14,485
Now prepare to be impressed.

390
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:17,006
Dad, you've shown me your yearbook.

391
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:19,331
The whole Rick Springfield,
feathered-hair thing --

392
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:20,423
it looked awesome on you.

393
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,902
But those days are over,
and it's time to move on.

394
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:26,469
This is Kendall Shiflett's
high-school yearbook.

395
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:29,212
And she was named "most likely
to commit murder for profit"?

396
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,108
That would really support
our latest theory.

397
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:32,812
Page 87.
I marked it.

398
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:48,009
Hello, weird-hairdo-girl
who is not Kendall.

399
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:49,058
It gets weirder.

400
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:56,371
Priscilla Banks?

401
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:58,696
A senior?

402
00:19:59,035 --> 00:19:59,898
I don't get it.

403
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,668
Neither did i until I found this.

404
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,627
The real Kendall Shiflett is dead.

405
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:11,738
And even weirder still,
miss Banks, our fake Kendall,

406
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,134
was at the wheel when she was killed.

407
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:18,146
The lengths a woman will go to
to shave a few years off her age.

408
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:19,848
Or the name change had something to do

409
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,003
with the six months she spent
in prison for wire fraud.

410
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,481
Rather interesting, huh?

411
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,112
Admit it -- the old man's
got some P.I. Chops.

412
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:43,339
Well, I thought it was 
some pretty sweet detective-ing.

413
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,044
I got to run.

414
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,792
I just got a lead on the barracuda
that ran over a classmate's dog.

415
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:08,085
It now occurs to me that a bat

416
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:10,286
or a large stick might have been
a good idea,

417
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:13,110
given the profile of your average
muscle-car-driving,

418
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,264
ass-flashing, dog-murdering...

419
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:18,604
-Who are you?
-Uh, hi.

420
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,327
I was just wondering if you've seen
a green muscle car

421
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:24,371
...around the neighborhood.
A barracuda.

422
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:28,177
Young lady, I haven't seen anything
since my cataracts came back.

423
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:31,044
-I'm sorry.
-What do you want with my car?

424
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:32,605
Wow. It's yours.

425
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:36,598
It's just that 
my dad is super into them,

426
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:39,036
and he's always talked about
getting a "souped-up 'cuda".

427
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:42,256
That car belonged to my dear
departed husband, bless his soul.

428
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,756
And it's staying 
right where it is in that garage

429
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,602
until they carry me out in a box.

430
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:49,888
Now, excuse me,
but I'm missing Vanna and Pat.

431
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:58,734
And what enjoyment exactly do the blind
get out of "Wheel of Fortune"?

432
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:15,914
-Hello?
-Hello, mr. Banks?

433
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:17,085
Yes?

434
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:21,707
This is Terry Whittaker calling from
the Handley High Alumni Association.

435
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,772
We're planning the big reunion,

436
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:26,778
and we're having some trouble
locating Priscilla.

437
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,215
We'd sure like to track her down.

438
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:30,899
Well, so would we.

439
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:32,699
I'm sorry?

440
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:35,610
Last we heard, she was living
in Neptune, California.

441
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,873
I only know 'cause she sent her ma a
"get well soon" card a few months back.

442
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,918
Did you happen to keep
the return address?

443
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:42,436
There wasn't one.

444
00:23:42,864 --> 00:23:44,475
I guess she didn't want us
writing back.

445
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:48,363
Thanks for your time,
mr. Banks.

446
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,243
If you find her, you mind telling her
her ma passed on?

447
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,233
You here to confess?

448
00:23:58,285 --> 00:24:00,215
Is that your tail
I see between your legs?

449
00:24:00,443 --> 00:24:03,035
No. But I can see
how you might get confused.

450
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:04,888
I need you to get me
into Clemmons' office.

451
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:08,376
Look, I know you got a key. You spend
as much time in there as he does.

452
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:09,341
You want my help?

453
00:24:09,537 --> 00:24:11,384
You're gonna have to answer
a few questions for me.

454
00:24:11,668 --> 00:24:14,267
First, what do you need
out of Clemmons' office?

455
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:16,912
A paddle.
It belonged to Thumper.

456
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:18,718
Clemmons confiscated it.

457
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:21,761
Belonged?
Interesting use of the past tense.

458
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,727
What's so special about this paddle?

459
00:24:24,991 --> 00:24:27,571
I saw it when I dumped the carnival
cash in Thumper's shop locker.

460
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,881
It had license plates and grids on it.

461
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:32,082
I'm guessing those plates
belong to the people

462
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:34,076
he was delivering product to
for the Fitzpatricks.

463
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:36,908
He probably made it
as some kind of insurance policy.

464
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:38,362
How's that working out for him?

465
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,846
The Fitzpatricks have turned
the P.C.H.Ers into slave labor.

466
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:44,547
There's nothing those guys
won't do to ensure timely payment.

467
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:46,625
Threats, beatings, torture.

468
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:48,677
That paddle,
if it is what I think it is,

469
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:50,407
it's serious leverage.

470
00:24:50,544 --> 00:24:51,437
Fair enough.

471
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:52,879
Second question.

472
00:24:53,155 --> 00:24:55,635
Why were you following the school bus
the day of the crash?

473
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:56,638
Cervando.

474
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:59,919
I loved the guy, but he was book-smart
and street-dumb.

475
00:25:00,772 --> 00:25:03,644
He was telling anybody who listened how
he hustled Liam Fitzpatrick, and

476
00:25:03,722 --> 00:25:05,778
word was out that
Liam was looking for him.

477
00:25:06,197 --> 00:25:08,079
I had his back,
just in case.

478
00:25:10,002 --> 00:25:10,929
You believe me?

479
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:13,955
How could I not when you're batting
those Maybelline lashes at me?

480
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:17,082
Hey, dad.

481
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:18,599
I'm heading out, honey.

482
00:25:18,675 --> 00:25:19,683
See you at home soon?

483
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,283
I have a shift at the hut.

484
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:22,969
Lock up, would you?

485
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:26,367
Eli.

486
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:27,516
Sheriff.

487
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:31,466
Key, please?

488
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:39,724
-Keep it.
-Seriously?

489
00:25:39,786 --> 00:25:40,517
Yeah.

490
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:41,772
Clemmons changed his locks.

491
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:43,158
It's worthless.

492
00:25:44,191 --> 00:25:46,700
What? You make me jump through
all your hoops just so --

493
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:48,839
Lucky I have a copy of this, huh?

494
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,136
You're unbelievable.

495
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:01,105
What do you say we figure out
who some of those fine folks are?

496
00:26:08,023 --> 00:26:08,743
What a relief.

497
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:11,831
It seems I wasn't lying about
Jackie's waitressing skills.

498
00:26:13,348 --> 00:26:16,425
Nice to see all those Manhattan
ballet lessons finally pay off

499
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:17,615
in the service industry.

500
00:26:27,523 --> 00:26:28,255
Hey, Jackie.

501
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,890
Table eight requested
to sit in your section.

502
00:26:42,462 --> 00:26:44,066
-Hey.
-Hey.

503
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:46,321
Look, what I said to you at school --

504
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,254
don't worry about it.

505
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,581
Can't help myself.
I'm worried.

506
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,455
I didn't mean for it
to come out like that.

507
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:54,533
What I was trying to say was,

508
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,044
if it's really your own reputation
that you're worried about,

509
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,691
then I hope you can get past that.

510
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,689
But if it's not about your reputation,

511
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:05,735
if it's just that yodon't feel the same
way about me that I feel about you...

512
00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:08,852
then I'll understand.

513
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:10,936
And I'll back off.

514
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:12,636
It's not that.

515
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:17,214
I like you a lot, Wallace.

516
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,223
Too much, I think.

517
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:21,815
Then to hell with
what anyone else thinks.

518
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:26,708
-I've been accepted to the Sorbonne.
-Hey, that's great.

519
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:28,418
It's in Paris.

520
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:31,278
I leave the day after graduation.

521
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:33,419
What's that give us?
Five weeks?

522
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,844
Just enough time to get
our hearts broken?

523
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:38,734
There's no happy ending
out there for us.

524
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:53,956
The barracuda is on the move.

525
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:57,461
Sorry to ask you this
on your first night, Jackie,

526
00:27:57,503 --> 00:27:59,483
but can you cover my tables
until closing?

527
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,945
Sure. No sweat.

528
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:01,995
Thanks.

529
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,010
I owe you.

530
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:13,180
Wait for it.

531
00:28:22,897 --> 00:28:25,493
<i>["Treat Her Like a Lady"]
You've got to treat her like a lady</i>

532
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:27,544
<i>[Cornelius Brothers and Sister Rose]
and she'll give in to you,</i>

533
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:30,824
<i>Uh-huh now, who can see?</i>

534
00:28:31,313 --> 00:28:32,632
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

535
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,463
<i>Oh, you got to love her
Love her</i>

536
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:37,161
<i>And tease her 
Tease her</i>

537
00:28:37,394 --> 00:28:41,014
<i>But most of all you got to please her
Please her</i>

538
00:28:41,091 --> 00:28:42,947
<i>You got to hold her
Hold her</i>

539
00:28:42,997 --> 00:28:44,547
<i>And want her
Want her</i>

540
00:28:44,782 --> 00:28:48,275
<i>And make her feel you always need her
Need her</i>

541
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:50,110
<i>You know a woman
Woman</i>

542
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:51,532
<i>Is sentimental</i>

543
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,316
I think he's still inside.

544
00:28:55,623 --> 00:28:57,356
I just saw a flashlight moving around.

545
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,002
Hand me my gun out of the glove box.

546
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:02,095
<i>And she'll give you happiness</i>

547
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:07,937
-Hey, sweetie.
-Dad, I need your help.

548
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:11,592
I'm following this guy, and I'm pretty
sure somebody's gonna get shot.

549
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,051
Tell me where you are, honey.

550
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:16,486
The northwest corner
of Satsuma and Chandler.

551
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:18,677
I want you to pull up
in front of the house

552
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:20,140
and wait for me
with the engine running.

553
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:21,753
If you see anybody but me
coming toward the car,

554
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:23,444
you get the hell out of there.
You understand?

555
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:24,635
Where are you?

556
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:26,339
Dad?

557
00:29:26,858 --> 00:29:29,082
<i>Dad?! Talk to me what's going on?</i>

558
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:31,752
<i>Dad?</i>

559
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:33,836
<i>Dad?</i>

560
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:35,300
Dad?

561
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:43,561
Dad?

562
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,017
Help you find something?

563
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,379
Oh, my, my, my.

564
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:18,115
But maybe it is true
about the luck of the irish.

565
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,089
Keith Mars on the wrong end
of a robbery in progress.

566
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:24,339
Unbelievable.

567
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:26,845
Hey. You want to make a run for it --

568
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:29,695
it'll just help sell my story when
the crime-scene investigator show up.

569
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:30,963
Liam...

570
00:30:34,058 --> 00:30:35,263
don't do this, please.

571
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:40,406
I have a daughter.

572
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:41,376
We've met.

573
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:42,811
Sweet girl.

574
00:30:43,737 --> 00:30:45,466
I'll keep an eye on her
when you're gone.

575
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:57,249
What are you doing here?

576
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:02,077
Who's that in my house?
What the hell is going on?

577
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,045
Move, or you're a hood ornament.

578
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,936
Why was the former sheriff in my house?

579
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:33,629
He didn't say.

580
00:31:34,014 --> 00:31:35,370
This is bad.

581
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:36,520
Yeah.

582
00:31:36,717 --> 00:31:38,496
I got to track him down and ask him.

583
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,897
That would be worse.

584
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:43,388
His gun wasn't loaded.

585
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,421
If you wouldn't have hung up on me,
I could have told you.

586
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:51,426
The bullets are in the ashtray.

587
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:01,755
Think we should return them?

588
00:32:12,152 --> 00:32:16,547
So I take it Kendall Casablancas/
Priscilla Banks has a secret house.

589
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:19,175
Yep. I take it you found
your barracuda?

590
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,477
Yep. You find anything in the house?

591
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,066
Say, plans to blow up a bus?

592
00:32:24,752 --> 00:32:25,686
Just this.

593
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:29,155
Her hard drive.

594
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:40,974
Bingo.

595
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:42,063
All right, you guys a in.

596
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:44,601
-Thanks, mac.
-I'm not speaking to you.

597
00:32:44,974 --> 00:32:47,115
Butters asked if he should rent
a room for prom night.

598
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:48,432
I'm doing this for your dad.

599
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:50,670
Mr. Mars,
what else can I do for you?

600
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:53,273
You mind printing every e-mail,
every document?

601
00:32:53,323 --> 00:32:54,935
Your wish is my shift-command.

602
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:58,513
Little computer humor for you there.

603
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:01,404
I liked it better when
you weren't speaking to me.

604
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:20,131
Oooh yeah!

605
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:26,803
So, how'd we make out
in school this week, ladies?

606
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,552
That's all there is.

607
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,622
Little light.

608
00:33:35,949 --> 00:33:36,951
Well, this is bad.

609
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,512
I've had a doozy of a night.

610
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:41,542
I'm really not in the mood.

611
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:42,651
Supply and demand.

612
00:33:43,744 --> 00:33:45,024
That's all that people are buying.

613
00:33:45,076 --> 00:33:46,931
Then create demand.

614
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:48,587
What is this?

615
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:51,394
They act like the rich kids
were the only ones with money.

616
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:54,748
Throw a rave on the beach.

617
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:57,771
You got finals coming up, right?
People need to stay awake.

618
00:33:57,823 --> 00:33:59,053
People need to study.

619
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:02,176
It's called "pusher" for a reason.

620
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:10,049
All right, what do you say we try
a new motivational technique?

621
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,033
You.
The scrawny one.

622
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:15,693
He's been short two weeks in a row.

623
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:17,065
Come here.

624
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:25,669
Stop!

625
00:34:33,973 --> 00:34:39,354
Now, I will cut the kid down
as soon as this hat is full of bills.

626
00:34:40,729 --> 00:34:41,932
But in the meantime,

627
00:34:42,904 --> 00:34:44,425
Gecklan here --

628
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,352
he's gonna show me some of that...

629
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:49,422
he's always bragging about.

630
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,303
Work the body.

631
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,071
Work the body!

632
00:35:13,073 --> 00:35:14,744
Well, hey, hey!

633
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,104
Didn't this used to be your gang?

634
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:21,696
Why don't you help us whip
some of your boys into shape here?

635
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:25,735
The P.C.H.Ers
ain't dealing for you no more.

636
00:35:29,028 --> 00:35:30,290
Okay.

637
00:35:30,997 --> 00:35:32,457
So, what?

638
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:35,739
We just shake hands
and walk away like gentlemen?

639
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:37,379
Not sure I'm interested
in the handshake,

640
00:35:37,432 --> 00:35:38,820
but I'm fine with the walking away.

641
00:35:38,872 --> 00:35:42,930
You know, retirement ain't all 
it's cracked up to be.

642
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:44,592
Ask Thumper.

643
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,057
You're not threatening me,
are you?

644
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:49,351
'Cause you ought to be nicer
to a guy who's got this.

645
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:51,201
What's that supposed to be?

646
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:52,456
Just a list...

647
00:35:53,173 --> 00:35:54,416
of all your big-shot clients,

648
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:55,545
lawyers on speed,

649
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:58,321
coked-up pro athletes, 
celebrities' kids rolling on "E."

650
00:35:58,377 --> 00:35:59,378
Ask yourself this question --

651
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,294
exactly how much business
did Heidi Fleiss do

652
00:36:01,352 --> 00:36:02,624
when her little book went public, huh?

653
00:36:05,992 --> 00:36:07,194
Might want to hold onto that for me.

654
00:36:07,854 --> 00:36:09,284
We'll call it collateral.

655
00:36:15,854 --> 00:36:18,880
So, how do I know
you didn't make a copy of this?

656
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:19,833
Oh, I did make copies.

657
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:20,926
Lots of them.

658
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:23,921
And the day I go missing
is the day they go public.

659
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,499
Might want to keep that in mind.

660
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,768
You might want to watch your back.

661
00:36:28,038 --> 00:36:29,897
Why? You're gonna be
watching it for me.

662
00:36:36,316 --> 00:36:38,385
Yeah! Weevil!

663
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:41,083
I knew you'd come through
for us, Weevil!

664
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,087
All right, boys.

665
00:36:43,254 --> 00:36:44,442
You're on your own now.

666
00:37:13,434 --> 00:37:14,520
Find anything?

667
00:37:15,739 --> 00:37:17,875
Found out that little old lady
with the barracuda,

668
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:18,902
Mary McDonald,

669
00:37:19,094 --> 00:37:21,317
is Liam Fitzpatrick's
maternal grandmother.

670
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,719
That it?

671
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:29,201
Weevil said this kid on the bus,
Cervando,

672
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:30,785
thought the Fitzpatricks
were after him.

673
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:31,885
He ripped them off,

674
00:37:31,938 --> 00:37:32,987
then went bragging.

675
00:37:33,832 --> 00:37:36,584
Liam wanted to shut Cervando up
pretty bad.

676
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:41,594
And since Liam had access to explosives
through his cousin Danny...

677
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,597
that's the best I can come up with.

678
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:46,690
I've looked through all this stuff,

679
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:49,253
and I still can't find anything
to connect Liam and Kendall.

680
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:52,392
How about prisoner number 246219?

681
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:53,661
What?

682
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,913
65 e-mails, all to Cormac Fitzpatrick,

683
00:37:56,966 --> 00:37:59,852
Liam's older brother
doing time up in San Quentin.

684
00:38:00,373 --> 00:38:02,127
The dots are starting to connect now.

685
00:38:02,384 --> 00:38:03,456
What's he in for?

686
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:04,434
Fraud.

687
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:08,017
Cormac and Kendall were partners,
grifters working the long con.

688
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:08,960
She was his roper.

689
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:10,714
That stint she did --

690
00:38:10,826 --> 00:38:13,705
I think she took the rap for Cormac,
save him a third strike.

691
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,020
I'd say the rest of the Fitzpatricks
owe Kendall a big one.

692
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:19,024
Maybe Liam was following the bus.

693
00:38:19,082 --> 00:38:21,136
Could have just been out there
as Kendall's eyes.

694
00:38:21,915 --> 00:38:23,466
Called her just at the right moment.

695
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,947
Kendall could have made the call
that blew up the bus

696
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,986
while sipping margaritas
by the Casablancas' pool.

697
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:31,508
Talk to Logan?

698
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:32,967
He was with her that day,

699
00:38:33,018 --> 00:38:36,187
but he says Kendall kicked him out
hours before the crash.

700
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:46,547
I've been thinking about what you said.

701
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,419
-And?
-And I don't care.

702
00:38:48,628 --> 00:38:50,306
I say five weeks is five weeks.

703
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,452
Why don't we make the most of it?

704
00:38:52,802 --> 00:38:54,770
Forget about the happy ending, Jackie.

705
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,036
Just worry about being happy now.

706
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:04,634
I just don't know when I'm gonna meet
another girl like you.

707
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,124
I think it's safe to say

708
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:08,597
there's not another Wallace Fennel
out there, either.

709
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:13,688
So, what do you say?

710
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,701
Will you go to prom with me?

711
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:20,347
Yeah.

712
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,411
I'll do that.

713
00:39:26,345 --> 00:39:27,347
Well, all right, then!

714
00:39:28,547 --> 00:39:30,298
I guess I better head down
to Eric's formal wear.

715
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,838
I hear those top hats
and those canes go quick.

716
00:39:33,728 --> 00:39:34,528
Veronica!

717
00:39:34,626 --> 00:39:36,653
<i>When a construction crew
came across the object...</i>

718
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:37,297
What is it?

719
00:39:37,405 --> 00:39:39,132
<i>Buried just feet from where the body...</i>

720
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:40,274
It's a special report.

721
00:39:41,527 --> 00:39:44,931
They found the murder weapon,
that one... used to kill Lilly.

722
00:39:44,993 --> 00:39:47,332
What about the glass ashtray
you found in the pool?

723
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:48,704
We figured that's what he used.

724
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:49,984
Why else would it be in the pool?

725
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:53,755
Okay, but that doesn't really
change anything, does it?

726
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:56,053
They found it buried
in the Kanes' backyard.

727
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,864
The new owners
were removing the swimming pool,

728
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:00,607
and they found Aaron's oscar statue.

729
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:01,946
What?

730
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:06,768
But doesn't that help us?

731
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:08,753
I mean,
with his prosecution?

732
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:10,656
Honey, in addition to Lilly's blood,

733
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:14,799
the sheriff found some of Duncan's hair
on the murder weapon.

734
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,739
He's in his room.

735
00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:31,608
-Hold it.
-Ow! What are you doing?

736
00:40:31,818 --> 00:40:33,133
Looks like you had a rough night.

737
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:35,375
Is that your bike out front?

738
00:40:36,074 --> 00:40:36,784
Yeah.

739
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:40,790
You know exactly who killed
your brother's dog, don't you?

740
00:40:41,882 --> 00:40:43,404
Same guys who ground up your face.

741
00:40:43,728 --> 00:40:45,818
Liam Fitzpatrick.
What happened?

742
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:47,545
A little late with a payment?

743
00:40:49,262 --> 00:40:51,368
I've learned that
when someone just stands there

744
00:40:51,414 --> 00:40:52,727
with his mouth open like that,

745
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:54,186
it means he's guilty.

746
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,436
Listen,
just don't tell Harry.

747
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:57,585
If he finds out what happened --

748
00:40:57,636 --> 00:40:58,538
Cry to someone else.

749
00:40:58,841 --> 00:41:00,484
This beating you've got coming.

750
00:41:00,774 --> 00:41:02,175
Wait, wait.

751
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:03,954
It's not me I'm worried about.

752
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:06,204
My brother hears that Liam
was the one that killed his dog,

753
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,288
he'll go after him.

754
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,523
I swear to god, man,
Harry isn't afraid of anybody.

755
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:14,010
So you're asking me to lie to him
to save his life?

756
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:15,438
I'm asking you not to tell him

757
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:17,404
so my brother doesn't spend 
the rest of his life in prison

758
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:20,315
because he put a razor-cut,
three-blade, broadhead arrow

759
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:21,977
through Liam Fitzpatrick's throat. 

760
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:25,191
<i>Billy, who is it?</i>

761
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:26,977
Please.

762
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:32,604
So, all I have to do is give Harry

763
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,640
the name of the man
who tried to kill my dad

764
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,059
in cold blood last night --

765
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,673
Liam Fitzpatrick.

766
00:41:38,201 --> 00:41:38,916
He's a killer,

767
00:41:39,157 --> 00:41:41,059
and there's a good possibility
he's responsible

768
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,852
for the deaths
of everybody on that bus.

769
00:41:43,135 --> 00:41:44,846
I, for one, wouldn't miss him.

770
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:51,352
Were you able to find out
who ran over my dog?

771
00:41:59,221 --> 00:42:00,546
No.

772
00:42:00,547 --> 00:42:05,187
