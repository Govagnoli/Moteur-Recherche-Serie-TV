1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:02,692
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:05,268
oh, my god.

3
00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:06,085
Mr. Echolls?

4
00:00:06,182 --> 00:00:07,080
I know what happened.

5
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:10,133
He's psychotic.

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,708
These rich boys think they can get away with anything.

7
00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:14,529
What do you think you can do to me?

8
00:00:14,796 --> 00:00:15,953
I'll think of something.

9
00:00:16,453 --> 00:00:17,969
My dad had a paternity test.

10
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,453
I'm not your sister.

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,310
Aah!

12
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,460
Keep driving.

13
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,880
Veronica,

14
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:25,928
where are the tapes?

15
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:32,655
I knew you'd come.

16
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:33,799
I knew you'd save me.

17
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:37,390
Table for three?

18
00:00:38,398 --> 00:00:39,142
Right this way.

19
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:42,741
"Normal" -- that's the watchword.

20
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:44,133
Sounds good, doesn't it?

21
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,218
Senior year begins tomorrow, and all appears hunky-dory.

22
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,973
Best friend -- check.

23
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:51,362
Boyfriend -- check.

24
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:53,852
Lily's killer behind bars -- check.

25
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:55,898
A waitress will be right with you.

26
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,088
Normal job, just like other people my age.

27
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,024
I just wish fewer of my classmates showed up here.

28
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:02,972
Kelvin Moor. One?

29
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:07,017
I need your help, Veronica.

30
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,366
In finding a table? I'm your girl.

31
00:01:09,508 --> 00:01:12,297
I got kicked out of athletics for my entire senior year.

32
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:15,777
I failed the mandatory drug test.

33
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:17,314
So what's new, Kelvin?

34
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:19,685
You failed it last year, too, if I remember correctly.

35
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,594
Yeah, but I'm clean now, for going on 10 months.

36
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:26,249
Give me your hands, look into my eyes, and swear to that fact.

37
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:30,822
Veronica...

38
00:01:31,027 --> 00:01:34,980
I swear that there is no possible way I could have failed that drug test.

39
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,013
Hmm.

40
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:39,917
So, am I lying?

41
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:41,816
I don't know.

42
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:43,928
Then what was all that for?

43
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:45,528
To see if you'd do it.

44
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:49,477
You were very convincing, but I don't do that kind of work anymore.

45
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:51,681
So who's supposed to help me out, then?

46
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:54,548
Encyclopedia brown.

47
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,370
I hear he's good.

48
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:58,138
I guess it's true what they say about you.

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,688
Probably, but you're gonna have to narrow it down for me.

50
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:01,979
You're an 09er now.

51
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:04,646
You went and landed yourself some rich boyfriend.

52
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:08,211
And last year was just some big ol' act for you.

53
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:10,424
You got to pick sides in this town these days.

54
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,661
You picked yours.

55
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:16,632
Figures how none of the rich kids failed their drug test, huh?

56
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:20,049
I got to jet. See you around, Veronica.

57
00:02:20,335 --> 00:02:21,274
You sleep well.

58
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:25,660
What, no biscotti?

59
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:27,953
Yeah, kind of bitchy, I know.

60
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:29,152
But Kelvin's a bully.

61
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,152
I'll sleep just fine.

62
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:30,762
Veronica...

63
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:32,675
come here.
Check it out.

64
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:35,995
Your dad's on television.

65
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,776
...Coverage of the Lilly Kane murder.

66
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,677
The press made you out to be some kind of Barney Fife character.

67
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,959
Are you feeling a sense of redemption?

68
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,032
A sense of relief would probably be more accurate.

69
00:02:48,654 --> 00:02:50,773
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have days...

70
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:53,997
weeks, even, of doubting myself.

71
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:55,787
Ah, yes -- the book.

72
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:59,450
Dad didn't want any part of it, but given the medical bills,

73
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:02,598
dad's convalescence, and mom running off with 50 grand,

74
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,641
he had to listen when the crime reporter from the San Diego Tribune

75
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:07,848
secured a book advance for his story.

76
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:12,385
What I did know was that Mr. Kane was lying about the circumstances...

77
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:13,377
Your dad's hot.

78
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,588
Take us back to that night three months ago.

79
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,446
The night Aaron Echolls was captured,

80
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:21,117
you were nearly burned alive rescuing your daughter.

81
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,963
Come on, dad. Just lay it out there for her.

82
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:29,891
"Father crawls through fire to save daughter, father rushed to hospital.

83
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:32,695
Daughter's night? Just beginning."

84
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:49,562
I was hoping it would be you.

85
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,450
- Logan?

86
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,401
- Hey, Veronica.

87
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:02,549
Logan, what happened?

88
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,637
They caught me alone on the bridge.

89
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:11,129
Who's "they"?

90
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:19,100
Uh... it was Weevil... and all the P.C.H.Ers.

91
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,853
Seriously, what do you -- what do you think you can do to me, huh?

92
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:27,163
I'll think of something.

93
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,433
What were you doing there?

94
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:30,928
Having a drink.

95
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,275
What do you think, Veronica.

96
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:36,960
You'd broken up with me, accused me of killing Lilly.

97
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,072
Whoo-hoo!

98
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:43,163
One down.

99
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,346
Oh, son!

100
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:47,135
You don't know what you just did.

101
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:51,274
Get him, man.

102
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,266
Unh!

103
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:55,406
Aah!

104
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,323
You're lucky you're alive.

105
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:09,394
Yeah, well, that's one way of looking at it.

106
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:12,715
What is that supposed to mean?

107
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:14,325
Are you okay?

108
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,302
Just lay there. I've called an ambulance.

109
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,213
What don't you do me a favor and drop that knife.

110
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:26,608
Huh?

111
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:38,814
Oh, my god, Logan.

112
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:40,745
But I didn't stab him, Veronica.

113
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:42,458
I believe you.

114
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:48,135
I threw the knife in the water and got in my car and drove.

115
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:51,244
Logan...

116
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,832
there's something that you need to know about your dad.

117
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:58,272
Aaron Echolls, charged with murder.

118
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:02,096
It's all over the radio.

119
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,017
Hey, Veronica.

120
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,967
I'm looking for Logan Echolls.

121
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,555
I saw his S.U.V. parked out front.

122
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,902
I know he's here.

123
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:34,482
This would be better for everyone.

124
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:57,640
You have the right to remain silent.

125
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:00,602
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

126
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,054
Suffice to say, I've got plenty of material

127
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:07,938
for any back-to-school "what I did last summer" essay I'm asked to write.

128
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:12,364
I was watching that.

129
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:14,579
Here it is -- senior year.

130
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:15,582
A fresh start.

131
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,384
Try not to screw it up, Veronica.

132
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:20,214
Seniors rule!

133
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:21,562
Hey!

134
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,713
You didn't call me back last night.

135
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:25,457
Don't go getting all girl on me.

136
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,875
Man, I got kicked off the basketball team.

137
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:28,526
What?

138
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,014
I failed my drug test.

139
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:31,659
I'm booted from athletics for the whole year.

140
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:32,975
You don't do drugs.

141
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:34,777
No duh, Sherlock.

142
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:37,396
And it wasn't just me. Five of us total failed.

143
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:39,599
And Jimmy day, our starting quarterback, he passed it.

144
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,790
And everybody saw him blazing one up on the boardwalk.

145
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,000
I heard no 09ers failed it.

146
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,250
You think it's a conspiracy?

147
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:49,195
This is Neptune. Nothing happens accidentally.

148
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:52,005
Well, you were wrong about the drug test.

149
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,499
- One 09er did fail.
- Who?

150
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:55,556
You're not gonna believe it, either.

151
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:57,707
I'm not the one who's easily shocked.

152
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,770
- Meg.
- Meg?

153
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:04,857
So you'll help?

154
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,650
Do you even have to ask?

155
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:10,795
Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in.

156
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:15,749
<i>A long time ago, we used to be friends</i>

157
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:20,427
<i>but I haven't thought of you lately at all</i>

158
00:08:21,187 --> 00:08:26,382
<i>come on, now, sugar, bring it on, bring it on, yeah</i>

159
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:31,932
<i>just remember me when we used to be friends</i>

160
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:36,457
<i>a long time ago, we used to be friends</i>

161
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:44,167
You're standing there in nothing but a jock.

162
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,266
They hand you this little itty-bitty cup.

163
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:48,318
You go into the stall.
You do your business.

164
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,075
Then as you watch, they seal it with this piece of tape.

165
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,683
And then they make you sign the tape.

166
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:54,003
Then what?

167
00:08:54,177 --> 00:08:55,215
Then they send it to a lab.

168
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,947
If the seal is broken, the lab is supposed to reject it.

169
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:00,936
So there's no way anyone could have switched the samples.

170
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,630
Nope.

171
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:06,709
Hey, what period do you have office aid this year?

172
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,677
I didn't sign up for a second year of office aid.

173
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:12,170
Yeah, that doesn't work for me.

174
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:13,460
You can take that up with moms.

175
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,379
She had crazy ideas about me having a well-rounded education.

176
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,258
But don't underestimate.

177
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:20,620
The master key.

178
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:24,729
Yeah, and I got all the administrative passwords I could get my hands on.

179
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:26,851
- Ooh, you're good.
- You know, you know.

180
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,997
I get all my criminal tendencies from you.

181
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:31,398
So, how you gonna go at this?

182
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:35,032
Try to figure out what the connection is between all the people that failed the test.

183
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:38,237
Got any enemies you know about?

184
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,477
Well, there's the Klan.

185
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:40,966
This is not really their M.O.

186
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:43,870
I guess that leaves everybody that hates you.

187
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,580
So, where's your boyfriend?

188
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,824
I expected to be ignored at lunch today.

189
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,546
He's skipping the first couple days of school.

190
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:54,201
He's visiting his dad.

191
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:56,362
Why would he want to do that?

192
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:57,808
That's what I said.

193
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,177
Later.

194
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:00,689
I'll say this --

195
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,804
there was something much easier about having a secret relationship.

196
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:07,142
But I guess from now on, that's next to impossible.

197
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,407
That guy over there asked to sit in your section.

198
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,296
You know him?

199
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:15,555
Yeah, I know him.

200
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:19,277
- Hey.
- Hey.

201
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:22,242
I haven't seen you around this summer.

202
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:24,935
Yeah. It's been kind of complicated.

203
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,002
You know, parents on trial.

204
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,479
Mom and dad finally had enough.

205
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,891
They've moved up to the Napa house for the duration.

206
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:35,083
At least until this blows over.

207
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,927
But you're staying here?

208
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:39,428
I don't want to transfer to a new school for senior year.

209
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:42,572
I have the presidential suite at the Neptune grand.

210
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,161
Of course you do.

211
00:10:44,387 --> 00:10:45,569
Veronica, your boyfriend's here.

212
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:50,549
Latte, when you get a minute?

213
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:51,931
Okay. Yeah.

214
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:56,674
- Hi.
- Hey.

215
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:01,804
Hi.

216
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:04,126
Logan and Duncan don't speak anymore.

217
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:07,335
I guess that's what happens when your best friend starts dating your ex.

218
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,700
Now, where was I?

219
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:10,825
Oh, yeah.

220
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,633
Who's out to get Neptune's top athletes.

221
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,557
Kelvin, I've had a change of heart.

222
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:20,648
Oh, yeah.

223
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:23,755
I heard your beard, Wallace, got nailed, too.

224
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:26,293
So I guess that changes everything now, huh?

225
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:27,342
I guess so.

226
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:29,634
So -- and I mean other than me --

227
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:31,719
can you think of anyone who would want to do this to you?

228
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:32,899
Unh-unh.

229
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,828
People love me.

230
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,559
No. They don't. You pick on the weak and helpless.

231
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,799
I call a geek a geek, if that's what you mean.

232
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:44,053
Wait -- now that I think about it, there was this one kid who swore he'd ruin my life,

233
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:46,489
but he doesn't have the cojones -- trust me.

234
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:47,229
Who?

235
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:49,295
This kid -- Sophomore.

236
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:50,994
They call him "Butters."

237
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:56,076
He was climbing the pegboard in gym class before P.E. Last year, trying to show off.

238
00:11:56,353 --> 00:11:57,265
He pissed me off.

239
00:11:57,507 --> 00:11:58,121
So?

240
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:59,469
So I pantsed him.

241
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:00,867
It was hysterical.

242
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,299
Wow, you're cool.

243
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:06,333
My dad's getting sued by Boatloads of Fun Corp.

244
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:08,089
They don't sound fun at all.

245
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,326
My dad brokers vacation property down in Cabo.

246
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:15,712
He leased a beach house to a group of families that call themselves "Boatloads of Fun."

247
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:17,852
You know, Steve Wacker's parents and that crowd.

248
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:22,303
The roof leaked in one room, so they're demanding all their money back.

249
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:25,469
You know Jennings Crawford?

250
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:27,055
Who doesn't?

251
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:29,200
I beat him out for number-one singles last year.

252
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:30,625
He threw a fit.

253
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,982
His parents even tried to have coach hart fired.

254
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:36,849
There was a school board meeting, and they brought in Ilie Nastase

255
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,192
to testify that Jennings was a better tennis player.

256
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:40,274
It was crazy.

257
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:43,302
Thanks.

258
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:46,025
There used to be one 09er girl I could call friend.

259
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:49,402
She was the one of her kind who actually treated me like a human

260
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:51,216
when no one else in that crowd did.

261
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:54,178
When Duncan broke up with her, she blamed it on me.

262
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,084
Things have been chilly, at best, ever since.

263
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,274
Meg. Hey.

264
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:05,013
Senior year, huh?
We're almost done.

265
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:08,964
Did you want something?

266
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:13,336
Well, I heard that... you were kicked off the cheerleading squad.

267
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,634
Yeah, but you know me. I'm a major stoner.

268
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,564
It was affecting me, too.

269
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:19,103
I was like, "let's go!

270
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:20,050
"Let's go!

271
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,136
"L-e-t-s...

272
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:23,681
duh..."

273
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:27,985
Can you think of anyone who might have done this to you?

274
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,680
Well, there is this one person.

275
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,918
I used to think she was a friend, but, uh...

276
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:34,999
but, yeah, yeah, now that I think about it,

277
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:38,912
she'd have no reservations, and she definitely has the talent to pull it off.

278
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:41,816
Let me know if you have any luck tracking her down, okay?

279
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,985
The metal detectors are new, but they come as no surprise.

280
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:50,570
Tensions in Neptune are the highest they've ever been

281
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,446
between the haves and the have-nots -- 09ers and non-09ers.

282
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,785
And guess who the lightning rod is.

283
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,266
The passing motorist who probably saved Logan's life called 911,

284
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:03,296
then he left the scene before the police arrived.

285
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:05,971
The knife that killed Felix was never found.

286
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,602
Logan's high priced lawyer crushed the P.C.H.Ers who testified against Logan in the preliminary hearing.

287
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,780
"Weren't they there, after all, to kill Logan?

288
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:17,793
Didn't Logan have the bruises and broken ribs to prove it?

289
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,212
If Logan did stab Felix, wasn't it self-defense?"

290
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:24,399
The D.A. Decided he didn't have enough evidence to convict,

291
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,077
so six weeks after he was arrested, Logan walked.

292
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:28,890
And the town went crazy.

293
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:31,565
Another rich kid getting off scot-free.

294
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:33,899
You know what else I found out today?

295
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:37,124
This failed drug test goes on my permanent file.

296
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:39,002
Any college I apply to is gonna see it.

297
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:41,787
If you would have taken another year of office aid,

298
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:43,493
we could have done something about that file.

299
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:44,931
Yeah, 'cause this is my fault.

300
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:46,974
Did you learn anything today?

301
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:50,741
Kelvin moor, while giving up his pot-smoking ways,

302
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,493
has not given up being an obnoxious jackwad.

303
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,820
He pantsed that sophomore Butters?

304
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,735
- Yeah, I was there.
- You were?

305
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:00,150
It was in the gym after spring-sports pep rally.

306
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,398
A few of us were there, even some cheerleaders.

307
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:05,108
I have never seen somebody blush like that.

308
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:07,095
People were laughing.

309
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:09,287
Butters was swearing at everybody.

310
00:15:09,347 --> 00:15:10,643
He said he was gonna get even.

311
00:15:10,694 --> 00:15:12,168
Cheerleaders -- was Meg there?

312
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:13,729
I think she was.

313
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,428
Viet was there.

314
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,375
Jilly Ho was there.

315
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:19,103
Try and remember.

316
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:21,245
Were you one of the ones laughing?

317
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:22,512
What can I say?

318
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:24,200
It was fun-ny.

319
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:25,471
It was funny.

320
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:29,604
I'll talk to Butters tomorrow, get this sussed out.

321
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,143
Hey, did you know that you're my hero?

322
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:36,109
Mr. Mars. I saw you on TV last night.

323
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:37,386
Wallace.

324
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:40,597
I know a 24-year-old floozy who thinks you're hot.

325
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,435
This floozy, did you get her digits?

326
00:15:43,118 --> 00:15:45,069
Now, don't make me have to go home and tell my mama.

327
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,886
Your mom and I have an understanding.

328
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:47,800
You do?

329
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:49,120
Yes, and it's this.

330
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:51,563
I behave myself and she doesn't leave me,

331
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:56,242
so please, tell her nothing other than I worship the ground on which she treads.

332
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:57,994
I'm leaving now.

333
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:00,352
Ground on which she treads.

334
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:01,911
You might want to write that down.

335
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:03,193
Got it.
All right.

336
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,530
So, senior year.

337
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,600
How was your first day of school, honey?

338
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:10,657
Great.

339
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:14,761
I beat up a freshman, stole his lunch money, and then skipped out after lunch.

340
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,528
What, no premarital sex?

341
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:18,448
Oh, yeah -- yes.

342
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,682
But don't worry. I swear you're gonna like these guys.

343
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:22,668
That's my girl.

344
00:16:23,393 --> 00:16:24,197
I missed you.

345
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:25,599
I missed you, too.

346
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:28,800
Now, where's my turkey pot pie, woman?!

347
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:36,697
Butters?

348
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:41,121
"Butters" is the name of the weak loser suck-up on "South Park."

349
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:46,215
- "Butters" implies soft, fat
- but oh, so delicious.

350
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:48,404
Vincent is my given name.

351
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:51,821
I hear you were pantsed in gym last spring, Vincent.

352
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:53,591
Are you requesting a private viewing?

353
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:55,914
Now the guy who pantsed you and all the people

354
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:59,244
who might have chuckled end up kicked off athletics for the year.

355
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:00,513
Curious.

356
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:01,651
Justice.

357
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:03,265
It can be a bitch.

358
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:04,935
So you got even? Is that it?

359
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:06,572
It looks that way.

360
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,456
You're playing a dangerous game.

361
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:10,306
Kelvin will take your head off

362
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:12,734
if I tell him you're the reason he's off football this year.

363
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:16,743
You know what? I don't think he will.

364
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:18,361
Hey, pop.

365
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:19,582
Son.

366
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:53,585
Permanent files are in that brownish-beige filing cabinet.

367
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,927
I can't believe after a year of working here,

368
00:17:56,978 --> 00:17:59,147
you don't know the make and model of the filing cabinet.

369
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,251
Yeah, it is hard to believe.

370
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:05,254
Usually memorizing that information is the first thing I do

371
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:07,433
when I enter a room containing a filing cabinet.

372
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,778
Well, get comfortable, then, Mr. Sarcastic,

373
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:11,397
because this might take a while.

374
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:14,312
Unless...

375
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:19,160
I can't believe you didn't know Butters was Clemmons' kid.

376
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:22,278
I make it a point not to know freshmen.

377
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:27,114
Scary, isn't it?

378
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:28,571
The lax security.

379
00:18:29,204 --> 00:18:31,094
What if someone was trying to alter your permanent file?

380
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:33,935
We're trying to alter it right now.

381
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,240
Alter it back.

382
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:37,444
There's a difference.

383
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,426
Alter it back. Cool.

384
00:18:40,114 --> 00:18:42,629
I was wondering where we were drawing that ethical line this year.

385
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,614
And there it is.

386
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,682
The way I imagine it, the results were all overnighted to Mr. Clemmons.

387
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,576
But before the elder Clemmons reviewed them,

388
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:53,642
junior got in and forged the negative results.

389
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:56,331
I just need to get my hands on them to prove it.

390
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,573
Can you pull a couple other negative results for me to compare them to?

391
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,199
Anything?

392
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:21,009
Nothing. There's no way this could have been altered.

393
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:23,248
Different color inks, full sentences.

394
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:25,071
I thought it might just be a checkmark,

395
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:29,648
but there's no eraser marks, no whiteout, and both hand-signed by...

396
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:31,228
Jim Chimoree.

397
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,251
Jim Chimoree?

398
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:35,145
That's the guy's name, the lab tech who signed off on the results.

399
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:37,999
So there's no alterations, there's no forgery.

400
00:19:38,683 --> 00:19:39,539
So it appears.

401
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:42,042
So I'm screwed, basically.

402
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,827
Unless the results were accurate.

403
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,238
Yeah, mon.

404
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:49,185
Maybe I smoke so much ganja, I don't even remember doing it.

405
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,446
What if you did ingest an illegal substance,

406
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:55,366
but it was such a mild dose that you weren't even aware of it?

407
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,933
Eat any mystery brownies lately?

408
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:02,851
Spirit bo-- the day of the back-to-school athletics banquet,

409
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,493
there were spirit boxes in our lockers.

410
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:06,729
There weren't any brownies, but there were cookies.

411
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:07,726
Did you eat one?

412
00:20:07,777 --> 00:20:08,586
I ate six.

413
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:10,235
That's my Wallace.

414
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:11,595
Well...

415
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,414
can you meet me at my house in, say, 20 minutes?

416
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:15,921
I'm gonna stop at the drugstore first.

417
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:17,453
Nah, I'll just follow you.

418
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:19,329
You don't want to go out alone.

419
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:22,631
No, I guess you don't.

420
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:24,439
You never know what might happen.

421
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:27,794
After the D.A. decided not to press charges against Logan,

422
00:20:27,953 --> 00:20:29,611
Neptune became a different place.

423
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,230
All right, I should go.

424
00:20:35,662 --> 00:20:38,802
Because my dad is probably watching us through a telescope.

425
00:20:40,258 --> 00:20:42,153
Then he's probably impressed with your virtue.

426
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,802
And that telescope is mounted on a rifle.

427
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:49,612
Five more minutes.

428
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:52,132
You should feel lucky.

429
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:55,071
You could be out with some pretty-boy drunk looking to get laid.

430
00:20:55,193 --> 00:20:57,334
What are you saying -- you're not pretty?

431
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,499
What I'm trying to say is I'm in love with you.

432
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:08,429
The things guys will say to get past second base.

433
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:19,369
Aah!Aah!

434
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:29,380
Are you done yet?

435
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:32,727
It is never going to happen if you keep doing that.

436
00:21:33,316 --> 00:21:34,143
I see.

437
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:35,510
Stage fright?

438
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,249
I'm making you nervous.

439
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:41,052
Well, according to the box, we only need a few drops,

440
00:21:41,103 --> 00:21:43,933
and it'll test for cocaine, steroids, pot...

441
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:45,672
what's up, honey?

442
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:48,433
Wallace is having trouble giving me a urine sample.

443
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:53,528
Can't you talk on the phone and paint your nails, like other girls?

444
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,317
This is a health-class project.

445
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:57,196
Come on, you're a man.

446
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:58,613
Can you give him some pointers?

447
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:03,806
Wallace?

448
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,699
Yeah?

449
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,397
You try turning the water on?

450
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:07,785
Mm-hmm.

451
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:11,294
Also, pinching your own nipples can sometimes work.

452
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:12,901
Aah! Man!

453
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:14,584
Gross!

454
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,053
Honey, it works.

455
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:17,754
I can barely even look at you now!

456
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:19,399
I can't believe how squeamish you are.

457
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:22,118
You're clean.

458
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:23,816
Of course I am.

459
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,522
If you didn't test positive,

460
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,658
that means Butters didn't lace the spirit cookies,

461
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:28,921
and we're back to square one.

462
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:31,248
How do you figure in?

463
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:34,254
You're the expert.

464
00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:38,013
I'm just standing here thinking it's gonna be a bad year for Neptune athletics.

465
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,169
Every player on this list is a starter -- a star player.

466
00:22:41,388 --> 00:22:44,655
Do you know the people who are gonna start with all of you suspended?

467
00:22:44,882 --> 00:22:46,656
Yeah, my backup is Bob Patton.

468
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:52,519
Jennings Crawford will go back to being first singles, taking Viet Nguyen's spot.

469
00:22:53,864 --> 00:22:55,898
Sheni Fauver will replace Jilly Ho.

470
00:22:57,472 --> 00:22:59,653
And Steve Wacker will take Kelvin's linebacker slot.

471
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:01,018
Wacker? Really?

472
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:07,176
And Shelly Pomroy was bumped up from J.V. Cheerleading to take Meg's position.

473
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:10,760
Dad?

474
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:12,701
What are you thinking?

475
00:23:13,536 --> 00:23:14,458
It's probably nothing.

476
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:15,915
You beckoned?

477
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:20,389
If I know the name of a corporation, how do I find out its shareholders?

478
00:23:20,586 --> 00:23:23,002
You get the strangest homework in health class.

479
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,662
Can you keep your trap shut if we tell why we need it?

480
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:27,356
No running off and telling your girlfriend.

481
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,229
Agreed.

482
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:32,993
Wallace has been kicked out of athletics for his entire senior year

483
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,024
for failing the mandatory drug test, but Wallace is clean.

484
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:38,441
See for yourself.

485
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:39,481
Hey, I-I --

486
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:40,606
I take your word for it.

487
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:44,003
We don't think Mrs. Fennel need know if we get it cleared up quickly.

488
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:45,978
You know what my mom is like.

489
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,364
What's the corporation name?

490
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,172
Boatloads of Fun Corp.

491
00:23:53,444 --> 00:23:54,915
You want the names of the partners?

492
00:23:55,045 --> 00:23:55,863
Yeah.

493
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:57,441
Billy and Mary Jo Patton.

494
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,955
Larry and Nancy Crawford.

495
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:02,657
Milt and Millie "Fo-ver."

496
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:05,810
Fo-- Mike and Lill Wacker.

497
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:07,395
Esther Pomroy.

498
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,608
And there's one more.

499
00:24:10,948 --> 00:24:12,473
Walt and Bunny Day.

500
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:16,066
Wait, what do they have -- Jimmy Day's parents.

501
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:18,339
Our starting quarterback.

502
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,562
Well, we know why he passed his drug test.

503
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,429
We got them.

504
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,164
The way I figure it, the only way they could pull it off

505
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:31,453
is if they bought off someone at the testing facility,

506
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:32,917
because the samples went in clean

507
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:35,012
and the results weren't altered once they got here.

508
00:24:35,861 --> 00:24:36,776
So what's the plan?

509
00:24:37,532 --> 00:24:38,673
We're gonna scare them.

510
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:40,801
And how's that gonna help me?

511
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:44,002
Well, it'll be fun.

512
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,081
I'm gonna send an e-mail to each partner at the Boatloads of Fun Corp today.

513
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:51,883
Sort of an "I know what you did this summer" kind of thing.

514
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:54,677
Tell them that Jim Chimoree wants to meet with them,

515
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:56,412
talk about a new financial arrangement.

516
00:24:56,649 --> 00:24:58,292
Jim Chimoree -- the lab tech.

517
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:00,222
You think he's the guy.

518
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:01,291
It doesn't matter.

519
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:02,375
It's gonna scare them.

520
00:25:03,072 --> 00:25:04,061
Veronica...

521
00:25:04,374 --> 00:25:05,678
did you bring your permission slip?

522
00:25:06,126 --> 00:25:07,188
Yes, I did.

523
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:10,967
Thanks.

524
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:13,090
New journalism teacher.

525
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:13,983
Yeah.

526
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:15,551
She seems all right.

527
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,097
She's taking anyone from newspaper, yearbook,

528
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:21,454
and the broadcast-news class who wants to tour shark field tomorrow.

529
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:24,413
Wow. I can't believe you're going.

530
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:26,128
I like baseball.

531
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:28,142
Yeah, but you don't like people.

532
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:30,192
I love people.

533
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:31,643
I'm a people person.

534
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,547
I'm just a normal teenage girl going on a normal school field trip.

535
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:38,896
Right. I know.

536
00:25:40,263 --> 00:25:41,373
"Normal" is the watchword.

537
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,365
In Neptune these days, you're forced to choose sides.

538
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:07,398
Logan had to take summer school after he missed all his finals

539
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:09,513
due to his own arrest, as well as his father's.

540
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:11,994
I'd come down to school just to have lunch with him.

541
00:26:12,358 --> 00:26:13,922
My sister is negotiating with networks

542
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,974
to sell her version of the Aaron Echolls story.

543
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,075
I think the sticking point is she's insisting she play herself.

544
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:23,102
The producers are insisting on Tara Reid.

545
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:24,854
Trina wasn't even around.

546
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,132
Who do you suppose cares?

547
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:30,761
I always wanted a TV movie version of my life.

548
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,482
You think they can get Tom Welling to play me?

549
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,866
Dream on.

550
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,739
Logan and Logan's special lady friend,

551
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,557
who I approve of wholeheartedly and without reservation.

552
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:41,669
Dick.

553
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:42,912
Hey, Cassidy.

554
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:43,774
What's up, Veronica?

555
00:26:43,908 --> 00:26:44,676
Boys.

556
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,740
Got the supplies.

557
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,040
N-bone and Ramsey are gonna meet us at the sac-n-pac.

558
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:51,489
Uh...

559
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:53,328
can't we do this later?

560
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,966
What's all the gasoline for?

561
00:26:56,607 --> 00:26:57,377
We're gonna...

562
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,673
go kill the grass on the pan high football field.

563
00:26:59,724 --> 00:27:00,985
Spell out "pan sucks."

564
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:02,306
Which it does.

565
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:10,984
The next day, the community pool at the city park somehow caught on fire.

566
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,874
The city had to close it down for the rest of the summer.

567
00:27:14,312 --> 00:27:17,536
Of course, all the 09ers have pools in their backyards.

568
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:25,008
Don't make me go in there and get all "ordinary people" on you, Beav.

569
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:27,911
The older brother drowns, dumbass.

570
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:30,472
What's the dealio, bro?

571
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:32,184
You ever showing up at school?

572
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:33,217
Eh, what for?

573
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:35,615
No one seems to care.

574
00:27:35,718 --> 00:27:36,929
I'm practically an orphan.

575
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:38,663
I can do whatever I want.

576
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:53,693
Welcome home, children.

577
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,094
How was school?

578
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:58,044
Who wants a Rice Krispie Treat?

579
00:27:58,148 --> 00:27:59,586
Gee, mom, you're the best.

580
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:01,895
But I'll pass.

581
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:03,427
You met momsie, right?

582
00:28:03,944 --> 00:28:06,204
The club, the clambake -- remember?

583
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:07,814
God, you're retarded.

584
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:11,885
Yet I managed 400 points higher than you on my S.A.T.S.

585
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:14,675
You don't want me to tell your father you couldn't play nice.

586
00:28:14,922 --> 00:28:16,836
Uh, I want a Rice Krispie Treat.

587
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:20,015
Go make it yourself, then, kid.

588
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:22,444
Do I look like a cook?

589
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:43,982
You guys are twisted.

590
00:28:45,317 --> 00:28:46,633
So, where did your dad meet her?

591
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:49,462
She was a Laker girl, and you know my dad.

592
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:51,398
He has good seats.

593
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,284
A certain Laker all-star's wife had her fired.

594
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:55,622
Didn't like the look of her.

595
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:56,988
What are you doing tonight, bro?

596
00:28:58,385 --> 00:29:00,570
Well, as much as I enjoy the company of men,

597
00:29:00,892 --> 00:29:02,471
I've got other plans tonight.

598
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:04,691
That, I can respect.

599
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,542
Um, we're, uh, meeting someone here.

600
00:29:10,636 --> 00:29:11,827
The name's Chimoree.

601
00:29:12,268 --> 00:29:13,035
Oh, yeah.

602
00:29:13,838 --> 00:29:15,059
Right this way.

603
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:23,358
Hello.

604
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:25,778
Are you guys expecting more people?

605
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,373
'Cause we can move you to a bigger table.

606
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:33,028
Walt, what have you gotten us into?

607
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:33,995
We need to stay calm.

608
00:29:34,135 --> 00:29:36,060
How much is this Mr. Chimoree requesting?

609
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:38,735
Heard enough?

610
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,023
I believe I have.

611
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,828
Veronica.

612
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:45,772
Your boyfriend's here.

613
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:55,144
Hi.

614
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:55,680
Hi.

615
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:02,503
So, yeah, my love life got a bit complicated this summer.

616
00:30:02,953 --> 00:30:04,865
But it sorted itself out nicely.

617
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:08,892
Ahh. Young love.

618
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:17,459
You're coming on the field trip?

619
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,589
I figured you and the other jets would be rumbling with the sharks.

620
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,370
Cool it, action.

621
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:26,167
And I think I'm gonna pass on the field trip.

622
00:30:26,218 --> 00:30:28,068
But call me when you get home.

623
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:28,792
Tell me all about it.

624
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:30,237
Let's just get on the bus.

625
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:32,603
I'm gonna miss you.

626
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:45,746
Excuse me.

627
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,244
Sorry.

628
00:30:49,005 --> 00:30:51,433
Did I mention that he didn't take the breakup that well?

629
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:57,762
I kept thinking that if I just stuck by you that you'd get past this...

630
00:30:58,443 --> 00:31:00,107
this phase, and...

631
00:31:00,951 --> 00:31:02,364
you'd be you again.

632
00:31:03,496 --> 00:31:04,978
Are you breaking up with me?

633
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,645
I can't stay with you.

634
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:11,412
Not with you and your toadies cruising around at night and hatching plans,

635
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:14,167
refusing to let everything get back to normal.

636
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:16,263
Someone's gonna get killed, Logan.

637
00:31:16,314 --> 00:31:17,557
Someone already has.

638
00:31:17,608 --> 00:31:18,928
Did you forget that already?

639
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:22,348
Most of the people in this town think I did it.

640
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,289
Those people you call toadies are my friends.

641
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,222
They've got my back.

642
00:31:25,322 --> 00:31:26,415
It's not about protection.

643
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,760
It's about pride.

644
00:31:28,994 --> 00:31:33,495
And the thing that I can't stand is that I'm pretty sure

645
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:35,855
there's a part of you that's having fun with all of this.

646
00:31:36,052 --> 00:31:36,719
Fun?

647
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:39,230
Fun?

648
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:45,988
My mom is dead!

649
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:47,493
My girlfriend is dead!

650
00:31:47,544 --> 00:31:48,740
My dad is a murderer!

651
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:52,043
And the only person I still care about is dumping me!

652
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:53,171
You think I'm having fun?!

653
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:54,323
Answer me, okay?

654
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:55,284
Just tell me the --

655
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:58,967
You don't talk to my daughter that way.

656
00:32:00,314 --> 00:32:03,300
You're leaving now, and you're never coming back.

657
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:11,089
Miss Dumbass.

658
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,863
It's "Dumas", Dick.

659
00:32:13,156 --> 00:32:15,370
Well, my name's pronounced "Rishard."

660
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,801
And it stinks back here.

661
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:18,176
I think someone died.

662
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:19,869
You're free to sit closer to the front.

663
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,653
That's okay. I don't think that's gonna help. Thanks anyway.

664
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:29,083
Hey.

665
00:32:29,473 --> 00:32:32,151
Who's the lovely young flower blossoming into womanhood?

666
00:32:33,936 --> 00:32:35,255
Let me guess -- you want to pluck her.

667
00:32:46,825 --> 00:32:47,502
Hi...

668
00:32:47,556 --> 00:32:49,049
can Dick and Beaver come out and play?

669
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:51,706
Let's see if we can find them.

670
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:00,216
Coming?

671
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:02,890
We've got to stop meeting like this.

672
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:04,791
Why do I love baseball?

673
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,332
The home run.

674
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,828
The long ball.

675
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:11,315
I'll admit it -- I'm no purist.

676
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,229
Give me an 11-9 slugfest, and I'm in heaven.

677
00:33:15,938 --> 00:33:17,562
Ah, so that's why sharks pitching sucks.

678
00:33:17,772 --> 00:33:19,082
That's exactly the reason.

679
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,224
I spend all my money on hitters.

680
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:23,294
I want to see the ball going out of the yard.

681
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:26,024
Now, I know some of you.

682
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:28,550
I even coached a few of you back in little league.

683
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:33,077
I wanted to host this little afternoon outing for one specific reason.

684
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:36,132
As many of you know, I'm running for mayor of Neptune.

685
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:40,922
And I thought it was important as a mayoral candidate that my daughter, Gia,

686
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:42,756
attend the public high school in Neptune.

687
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:45,137
Her favorite class at country day was newspaper.

688
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:48,718
So I thought I'd invite the journalism classes out

689
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:51,384
and give Gia a chance to make some new friends.

690
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,208
Hello, friend.

691
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:55,223
Hello.

692
00:33:56,507 --> 00:33:57,706
Okay, so far, working.

693
00:33:57,887 --> 00:33:58,488
Yes.

694
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:01,591
Just so everyone knows, I don't always dress like this.

695
00:34:02,026 --> 00:34:03,864
I didn't know if you guys were doing, like,

696
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:07,509
relaxed beachy or the west coast wannabe, east coast urban.

697
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:11,868
So F.Y.I. -- This is not a statement, just doing the new-school blend-in thing.

698
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,104
My daughter. She's a cool kid.

699
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:18,601
Play nice.

700
00:34:19,365 --> 00:34:24,060
It's like, you know, what Willy Wonka would be like if he owned a professional baseball team.

701
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:26,180
You never played little league?

702
00:34:26,652 --> 00:34:27,673
Oh, well...

703
00:34:28,244 --> 00:34:30,069
mom was afraid a ball would hit me in the face,

704
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,468
dad was afraid it would interfere with mock U.N.,

705
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,494
And I was afraid I couldn't hit a curve ball.

706
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:37,155
I'm afraid you're gonna get love handles if you eat all that.

707
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,652
I have an excellent metabolism.

708
00:34:40,672 --> 00:34:41,543
Well, then, it's official.

709
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:42,375
I hate you.

710
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:43,894
Check it out.

711
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:45,865
You did this to me.

712
00:34:46,847 --> 00:34:47,578
Wow.

713
00:34:47,946 --> 00:34:48,822
In the flesh.

714
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:50,385
It's all right.

715
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,182
Come on, I'll introduce you.

716
00:34:53,162 --> 00:34:54,060
Hey, gang.

717
00:34:54,169 --> 00:34:55,085
Special guest.

718
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:57,709
The greatest shark that ever played the game,

719
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,047
back when we had pitching to go with our hitting,

720
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,956
future hall-of-famer Terrence Cook.

721
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:10,030
Hey.

722
00:35:10,421 --> 00:35:12,799
We're not taking that stank-ass bus back to Neptune.

723
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:14,452
My dad's sending a limo.

724
00:35:14,856 --> 00:35:18,498
Would you and your girlfriend, whose quick wit I find enchanting,

725
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:20,758
like to take a trip back in style?

726
00:35:21,014 --> 00:35:22,538
Miss Dumbass said it was cool.

727
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:23,542
Hell, yeah.

728
00:35:25,388 --> 00:35:26,280
Fine.

729
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:27,266
Cool.

730
00:35:29,314 --> 00:35:30,236
I feel dirty.

731
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,379
"Dirty" --

732
00:35:31,985 --> 00:35:34,153
one r or two r's?

733
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:34,967
Hmm.

734
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:45,479
Duncan, I can't take this anymore.

735
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,413
I'm gonna try and talk to Meg one more time.

736
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:50,503
You ride in the limo 'cause it's gonna be easier if we're not together.

737
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:52,397
You don't owe her anything.

738
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:54,067
You didn't do anything to her.

739
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,699
You are so not a girl.

740
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:00,500
Excuse me, Mr. Cook?

741
00:36:01,002 --> 00:36:01,743
Yes, ma'am.

742
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:06,012
I just wanted to say you are my dad's favorite baseball player ever.

743
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:09,715
He keeps your rookie card vacuum-sealed inside a safe.

744
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:11,110
Well, that is an honor.

745
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:12,780
Tell him "thanks" for me.

746
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,626
When my dad finds out about this,

747
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:15,946
he's not gonna let me wash this hand.

748
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:17,761
Who's your favorite player?

749
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:18,513
Um...

750
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:20,759
Tell him. Be honest.

751
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,326
It's Johnny Damon, isn't it?

752
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:24,671
He's so pretty.

753
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:33,179
Hey.

754
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:36,205
So, I hear you're back on the cheerleading squad.

755
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:37,408
That's great news.

756
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,195
Oh, yeah. That's right.

757
00:36:41,947 --> 00:36:43,032
I forgot.

758
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,321
I'm supposed to pay you or something, right?

759
00:36:47,682 --> 00:36:48,519
Never mind.

760
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,856
The way she's acting, you'd think I seduced Duncan on their wedding day.

761
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,516
That's not how it happened.

762
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:59,965
Duncan said he'd been visiting the hut every day before I ever took a job there.

763
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:04,011
True or not, he showed up almost every day I worked there this summer.

764
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:10,959
<i>Tore it up and walked away
why'd you wanna go do that for?</i>

765
00:37:13,695 --> 00:37:19,691
<i>Threw your lego in the lake
why'd you wanna go do that for?</i>

766
00:37:20,944 --> 00:37:21,546
<i>And you're</i>

767
00:37:21,597 --> 00:37:23,204
<i>a long time coming</i>

768
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:26,295
<i>a long time coming home</i>

769
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:32,352
<i>do you see me reeling
off the lines?</i>

770
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:33,737
<i>I've seen your</i>

771
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:37,244
<i>I've seen your eyes</i>

772
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,912
I heard through the grapevine that Duncan broke up with Meg on the last day of school.

773
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:47,299
Whether that had anything to do with learning we weren't half-siblings, I don't know.

774
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:48,908
You'd have to ask him.

775
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:51,749
I was with Logan and I was absolutely faithful.

776
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:54,989
Duncan and I didn't get together until my 18th birthday,

777
00:37:55,115 --> 00:37:57,299
weeks after dad threw Logan out of the apartment.

778
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:35,768
I'm sorry Meg is hurting -- truly sorry.

779
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:38,195
But I can't say I have any regrets.

780
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:45,396
Five minutes, people.

781
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,539
Veronica.

782
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:54,371
Come on, dorkus.

783
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,241
Lilly?

784
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:06,386
What are you doing here, huh?

785
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:09,463
Shouldn't you be running for homecoming queen or something?

786
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:11,447
I'm safe standing here, right?

787
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:13,564
I mean, you're not gonna shoot me, are you?

788
00:39:16,236 --> 00:39:17,103
All here?

789
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:18,424
Yeah.

790
00:39:18,797 --> 00:39:19,397
Yeah.

791
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,022
All here.

792
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,395
So, did you like your taste, your little year of living dangerously?

793
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:29,659
Did you get your fill?

794
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,241
As soon as they'll have you back, you go running to the 09ers.

795
00:39:34,102 --> 00:39:37,495
And as a little bonus, you give it up to the richest boys in school.

796
00:39:37,604 --> 00:39:38,211
Wow.

797
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,088
Well, hell, I'm sure their sheets are clean.

798
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:42,809
You don't know anything about me.

799
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,861
And you don't know anything about them.

800
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:45,658
Yeah, I do.

801
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,134
I know that Logan killed Felix.

802
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:51,189
And he got away with it because he's rich and he's white.

803
00:39:51,415 --> 00:39:53,115
Six guys jumped Logan.

804
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:54,204
They broke his ribs.

805
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:55,534
They gave him a concussion.

806
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:59,596
Yet somehow he managed to wrestle away one of their knives and stab Felix?

807
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:01,073
You didn't see it.

808
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:02,136
You were out cold.

809
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,818
So I guess Felix stabbed himself?

810
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:05,636
Well, somebody stabbed him.

811
00:40:05,754 --> 00:40:09,044
My boys? Nothing goes down without my say-so.

812
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:12,636
So I guess you know about the shotgun blast that almost killed Logan and me?

813
00:40:13,363 --> 00:40:15,622
Bikers ride up, blow a hole through Logan's car?

814
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,679
You sure you're still in charge?

815
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:48,985
Hey, Wallace.

816
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:49,804
Whatcha doing?

817
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,020
Never mind.

818
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:58,062
Hop on.

819
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:24,374
<i>I've waited and given the chance again, I'd do it all the same</i>

820
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:32,781
<i>but either way, I'm always outplayed up on your down days</i>

821
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:37,098
It just went straight off the cliff.
It didn't even slow down.

822
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:38,695
They're all dead.

823
00:41:39,045 --> 00:41:39,946
Veronica!

824
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:41,492
They're all dead.

825
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:48,740
<i>Now watch me rise up and leave all the ashes you made out of me</i>

826
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,887
<i>when you said that we were wrong</i>

827
00:41:51,046 --> 00:41:52,058
This is Neptune.

828
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:54,233
Nothing happens accidentally.

829
00:41:58,454 --> 00:42:01,180
<i>I sink like a stone</i>

830
00:42:01,906 --> 00:42:04,259
<i>I lost my control</i>
