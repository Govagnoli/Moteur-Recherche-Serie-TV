1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,693
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:02,694 --> 00:00:04,357
I like being sweet to you.

3
00:00:04,358 --> 00:00:05,763
I'm really glad.

4
00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:08,268
- So you sell tests.
- Yeah, it's not easy.

5
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:11,035
- Tell me you're a business major.
- Philosophy.

6
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:14,941
You've been so sweet to me. I've just...

7
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:25,567
That old bag, one more perm,

8
00:00:25,602 --> 00:00:27,398
and she won't have a hair on her head.

9
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:29,352
She got plenty on her arms, baby.

10
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:30,471
Sure does, don't she?

11
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:32,566
I can't believe this is a class.

12
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,077
Hey, without film studies,

13
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:37,113
how will we know what movies mean?

14
00:00:37,148 --> 00:00:38,476
So...

15
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:41,245
Piz didn't say anything...

16
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:43,959
about the whole party... thing?

17
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:45,816
Like how you two made out in the hall

18
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:48,083
And then you took off?

19
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:49,811
Why? Is he calling you all the time?

20
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:52,970
He called once.

21
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:54,995
The day after.

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,128
But... how would you interpret his mood?

23
00:00:58,163 --> 00:00:59,927
You want me to have this talk?

24
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:01,656
- Am I a 12 year old girl?
- No.

25
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:05,645
But you're drinking fresca and
watching Joan Crawford movies.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,891
Look, I told you be honest,
let him down easy. But...

27
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:10,332
So he's gone all mushy.

28
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:11,512
I don't know.

29
00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:15,244
My interpretation of Piz's mood... normal.

30
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:17,511
So is the girl talk over?

31
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:19,649
I'm trying to watch the women here.

32
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,310
How was your day?

33
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:25,847
It's official: two fewer burglaries

34
00:01:25,882 --> 00:01:27,350
this month than last.

35
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:29,029
I smell a trend.

36
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:30,232
And the registration deadline

37
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:31,821
for the special election is monday.

38
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:32,914
So you're running...

39
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:34,831
Unopposed.

40
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:40,866
Might stand a chance.

41
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:44,982
Okay, Johnny Scopes and
Desmond Fellows met where?

42
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:46,140
NYU, dean's office

43
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:48,430
Johnny dropping out and Desmond expelled.

44
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:51,041
formed My Pretty Pony the next day.

45
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:52,647
Score one for Arnold.

46
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:54,311
Piz, name three my pretty pony songs

47
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:55,905
That made the college radio charts.

48
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,666
"Black cat", "you break me, you buy me",

49
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,392
"Jesus saves, but where does he shop?"

50
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:01,240
Their last album was released...?

51
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:03,053
'96 "More problems". Game over.

52
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:06,061
"The wake E.P.", 1997,

53
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:08,702
Released over Desmond's
objections after Johnny died.

54
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,403
Their official last album.

55
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:11,729
Oh.

56
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,804
Congratulations, Piz. Job's yours.

57
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,669
You replace Joe.

58
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:18,834
There's a lot riding on this. Don't blow it.

59
00:02:19,412 --> 00:02:21,310
Hey, veronica, guess what.

60
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:22,578
What?

61
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:24,444
You know my pretty pony?

62
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,276
Yeah. I totally love them.

63
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,287
I know, right?

64
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:28,982
So, Desmond fellows is coming to hearst.

65
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,128
and guess who just won
the my pretty pony off

66
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:32,486
and gets to be his guide?

67
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,885
- I'm guessing you?
- Mm hmm.

68
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,754
Wow. That's awesome.

69
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,554
Why is he coming here?

70
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:40,855
One of our idiot deejays swore on air,

71
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,660
And the fcc is literally
fining us into oblivion,

72
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:47,100
So we got Desmond to come
play a fund raiser to pay them off.

73
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:49,592
Otherwise the station is dead.

74
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,015
Johnny scopes died, didn't he?

75
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,206
Yeah, but Desmond has the actuall
backing tapes with johnny's vocals,

76
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,426
So he plays all the my pretty pony
songs along to the tapes.

77
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:00,436
It's just awesome.
This guy is like one of my all time heroes.

78
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,414
And I can get tickets
if you maybe want to...

79
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,182
Yeah. Maybe.

80
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,880
Um... I'll see.

81
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:08,426
I got to run. I'm late.

82
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:10,766
.. as you can clearly see.

83
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:14,536
And finally, consider this

84
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:16,866
Do you know anyone
who doesn't wear shoes?

85
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,131
Very nice, donaldson.

86
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,491
So...

87
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:26,943
Logan Echolls.

88
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:28,859
What have you got for us?

89
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:30,706
Uh, actually, I was hoping

90
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:32,843
I could present my business plan on monday.

91
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,093
Why am I not surprised?

92
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:39,451
I didn't get the chance to
say this on the way over,

93
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,296
but I was the biggest my pretty pony fan.

94
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:42,262
Sweet.

95
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:44,345
Hey, that's my drink, right?

96
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,502
Uh, yeah tonic and ice.

97
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:54,607
Hope this is okay. Nicest place in Neptune.

98
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:56,282
All the amenities.

99
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:00,815
What's he still doing here?

100
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,237
Waiting for the tip.

101
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:05,586
It's a customary thing... in America.

102
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:17,299
Here you are, my good man.

103
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:19,120
That'll get you 20 bones on ebay.

104
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:23,052
- Why?
- I'm Desmond Fellows.

105
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:27,724
Obviously, he's not cool.

106
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:31,803
We'll leave that for the room service guy.

107
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,601
You know what, Fez? I'm pretty beat.

108
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:38,245
Why don't you go out,
see if you can't grab us

109
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,055
a few of those old mini
bottles off of a cart?

110
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,326
I'm just gonna catch some z's.

111
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:44,862
Surprise.

112
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:46,582
Whoa.

113
00:04:46,617 --> 00:04:49,496
You really do have all the amenities.

114
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,171
You said surprise me, so...

115
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:56,741
Surprise.

116
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,372
Right.

117
00:04:58,407 --> 00:04:59,933
I said...

118
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:01,276
Who are you?

119
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,446
Um...

120
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:04,273
Blackcat70.

121
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:05,239
Arr!

122
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:07,751
All the e-mails?

123
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:09,980
"Surprise me when I'm in town".

124
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,539
Uh...

125
00:05:11,574 --> 00:05:14,326
That was you

126
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:17,078
Oh, my god.

127
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:18,253
Right.

128
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:20,513
Misunderstanding.

129
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:29,928
Thunder is

130
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,462
Here we're drying apples.
Apples for apple...

131
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:34,201
Going to be gabriel's thunder.

132
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,906
Ramone goose is a double tonight.

133
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:37,874
Sorry.

134
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,380
Do come see the show.

135
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:42,708
Advice never meet your idol.

136
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:47,128
More advice always confirm
the accuracy of photos.

137
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,728
So you said there was a beach?

138
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:52,782
Uh, yeah. More than one.

139
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:54,323
Yeah.

140
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:57,526
Or we could forget the beach.

141
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,449
Go to Mexico. Get really weird.

142
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,337
Mexico I'm not sure we can do.

143
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,444
Show's off, so why not?

144
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,800
What? W- why?

145
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:09,190
All the backing tapes and stuff
used to be in this bag.

146
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:12,886
Now it contains only this.

147
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:17,608
Veronica Mars

148
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:20,609
3x17- Debasement Tapes

149
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,310
Transcipt: vitac. com
Syncro: Camilla [VeronicaMars. it]

150
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:41,057
Vieni a trovarci!

151
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:43,646
veronicamars. it

152
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:48,777
Is the eggplant good?

153
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:50,008
It's okay.

154
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,481
How about that stuff?

155
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,447
It's good.

156
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:56,447
It's probably horrible for you, right?

157
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,940
I'll stay with the eggplant.

158
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:00,984
No, wait. What do you think?

159
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,958
I need to see a psychiatrist.

160
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:05,302
I was thinking more an english professor.

161
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,398
What we're dealing with here

162
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:09,460
is an absurd level of symbolism.

163
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,755
- Two veggie lasagnas.
- Okay.

164
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,068
Symbolism.

165
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:16,468
I mean, the Bronson parmesan
is good for me, but ooh!

166
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,937
The Maxuccine looks awfully tempting.

167
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,372
It's not my fault Max won't stop calling.

168
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,777
Like you should talk.

169
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:24,764
Me? I'm not ordering good boy

170
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,717
while wishing I ordered bad boy.

171
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:27,887
No. You gave up bad boy

172
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:29,582
but keep asking for samples of good boy.

173
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,390
No. I...

174
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:33,449
Wait, what?

175
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:36,278
Okay, if Logan is the fettuccine

176
00:07:36,313 --> 00:07:37,934
It's the eggplant.

177
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:40,395
Piz.

178
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,236
Actually, I wanted to talk to you, too.

179
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:46,603
I... need to apologize.

180
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:49,664
At the party, I was irresponsible.

181
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,341
I think we should file the party
away and just be friends...

182
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:53,517
For now.

183
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:55,873
I kind of got that.

184
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:59,699
I'm actually calling 'cause
I need help with a case thing.

185
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:02,589
Oh.

186
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,566
- Hey.
- Hey.

187
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,501
Forget something?

188
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,842
No, just saying hi.

189
00:08:19,877 --> 00:08:22,379
I haven't seen you since Parker's party.

190
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,096
What brings you here?

191
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,604
Oh, just... a case thing.

192
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:30,347
Actually, can I ask you something?

193
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:35,834
The weekend that you
almost got your head shaved,

194
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:38,349
Your dad said you were staying at Wallace's.

195
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:41,152
It was just you and Piz, huh?

196
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,094
Yes, but, no.

197
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,353
No.

198
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:47,589
I mean, I slept in Wallace's bed,

199
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:50,293
it was just a place to stay.

200
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:51,471
Nothing was...

201
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:53,610
Oh, thank god you're here.

202
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:55,991
Uh... hey.

203
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:01,679
Hey.

204
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:05,138
Good luck.

205
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:11,631
Empty. Just a hotel robe stuck
in there to make it look full.

206
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,793
Look, without those tapes, he can't...

207
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:16,926
Hey, Puss, this is all we have left,
which I won't touch.

208
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:18,720
You need to contact management immediate...

209
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:20,434
Hey, is that your girlfriend?

210
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:22,157
Uh, no, just a friend.

211
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:24,714
Veronica. Hi. I'm a really big fan.

212
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:27,237
You're just using him to get to me.

213
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:28,902
Mercenary. I like it.

214
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:30,605
I'm doing a show tomorrow night.

215
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,642
If you want to hang backstage, Monica...

216
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:34,009
Her dad's a P. I.

217
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:36,300
She's gonna help us find
the woman who took the tapes.

218
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,737
Oh, yeah, I think I figured
that whole thing out.

219
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:41,408
Come here. Check it out.

220
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:45,629
Is that the woman?

221
00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:47,511
That was my mistake.

222
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,275
That's blackcat80.

223
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,764
The woman in my room was blackcat70.

224
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,534
Number trouble.

225
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:54,892
So, do you have any pictures

226
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,927
of the woman who was in your room?

227
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:00,644
No.

228
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,195
Anyone ever tell you

229
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,759
You look like a feisty young Barbara Eden?

230
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,179
How did she know you'd be here?

231
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:08,939
How old are you, monica?

232
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,547
I'm 11.

233
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:12,183
You arranged this how?

234
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:13,749
Instant messaging.

235
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:16,486
But I didn't save any of the...

236
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:19,597
Wow. All business.

237
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:22,064
Deadly.

238
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:24,461
Yeah, there she is blackcat70.

239
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:28,205
It's a shame she was so old.
She seemed cool.

240
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,899
So you didn't get her name?

241
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,069
Just blackcat70.

242
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:35,169
What's that?

243
00:10:35,204 --> 00:10:37,911
She try and draw herself?

244
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:40,583
It's a chinese character.

245
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:43,017
I know a couple guys taking chinese.
We could ask them.

246
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:45,808
It's a start.
Was there anything in the bag?

247
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:48,943
Just medications, pills.

248
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:50,481
What are you taking pills for?

249
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,022
Ah, you know.

250
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:55,711
Life.

251
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:03,160
You ever have that nightmare

252
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,939
where you forget you're taking a class

253
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:06,442
and you have to take the final?

254
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:08,007
No.

255
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,240
I have to come up with an
entire business plan by monday.

256
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,148
Dude, that's a bummer.

257
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:14,917
oh!

258
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:17,188
What are you doing?

259
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:19,527
Getting famous.

260
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:23,362
Who is that?

261
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:25,018
Dude, that's me.

262
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:28,072
Ghost ridin' the whip! Check it out.

263
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:31,007
# Now gas, brake, yeah

264
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:32,952
# Gas, brake, yeah

265
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:37,490
# Shake them treads

266
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:40,290
# Let me see you show your grille

267
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,595
You run over your own foot?

268
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,680
Yeah, which is why
I think I have a real shot...

269
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:44,874
at the top of the charts.

270
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:48,884
This is something people do?

271
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,685
Cool people.

272
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:58,989
You did good for your first time.

273
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:00,387
Next time, it'll be easier.

274
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:01,803
The next and last time I run

275
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:03,367
Will be to chase down and kill

276
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:04,897
The inventor of ultimate frisbee.

277
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:09,072
Hello?

278
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:11,460
Hey, Logan. Parker's not here.

279
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,830
Me?

280
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:15,485
Grade my ass.

281
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,071
Dot net, yes.

282
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:21,372
I need to present a viable
business plan for a class.

283
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,879
I need a lowest common denominator

284
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,668
Website with a simple, interactive element

285
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,440
That I can build a business plan around.

286
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,177
You can put this together in your sleep.

287
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:29,176
I'll pay.

288
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:32,228
And the catch? It's due monday morning.

289
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:33,826
I'll need red bull and licorice.

290
00:12:33,861 --> 00:12:35,294
Deal.

291
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,351
You're on the air

292
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:38,184
With Desmond fellows of my pretty pony,

293
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:40,638
Playing a benefit tomorrow
night at liberty lunch,

294
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:43,224
Brought to you by wrigley's extra gum.

295
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:45,542
Okay, caller, are you there?

296
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:48,145
Their leftover gum?

297
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,813
The brand.

298
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:51,399
Extra gum.

299
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:52,916
Sugarless.

300
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:54,551
Okay, caller, are you there?

301
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:56,116
Desmond, you rock.

302
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,453
Make sure you play "You
break me" tomorrow, okay?

303
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,950
Oh, yeah. All the old hit.

304
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:02,098
You bet.

305
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:06,401
Hey, are you that redhead
out in the food court?

306
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:09,763
How do you feel about
showing me those big old...

307
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:15,188
Okay! Uh...

308
00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:16,965
Second caller, you're on with Desmond.

309
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,932
Dude, you suck.

310
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,568
Oh, hey, thanks a lot, man.

311
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:22,135
So, what's your question?

312
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,974
You just scrounge money off
the memory of your dead partner.

313
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,540
How do you live with yourself?

314
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:28,940
Well, I drink heavily, and I abuse drugs.

315
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,406
Hack!

316
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:33,110
Moving on. You're on with with Desmond.

317
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,620
I'm calling from semites for the savior.

318
00:13:35,655 --> 00:13:38,095
We want everyone to know
this man makes songs

319
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,916
that mock our religious beliefs.

320
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:42,953
You're a jewish group,
and your initials are S. S.?

321
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,280
Oh, god.

322
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:46,895
We encourage everyone to pray with us,
and he cancels the show and...

323
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,123
Nazi gonna happen.

324
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:49,332
Now, don't worry about it.

325
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,471
The show's canceling itself.

326
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:53,163
I would pray, instead, for a girlfriend.

327
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:55,978
Hey, what's up? It's Des.

328
00:13:56,013 --> 00:14:02,013
Dude, party, miller hall, room 404, tonight.

329
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,734
Got a pen?

330
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,722
That was great. Home, please.

331
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:10,585
Piz?

332
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,428
What did he mean, canceling itself?

333
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:13,490
It's nothing.

334
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,749
He just misplaced the backing tapes.
It's no big deal.

335
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:18,636
You know what happens
if we have to cancel this show.

336
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,136
Fax! Come on, this ain't night court.

337
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:25,997
Sacks!

338
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:29,484
Where are those drug stats?

339
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:31,303
- Sheriff.
- Leo.

340
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,998
Sheriff Mars.

341
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:36,015
What brings you around here?

342
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,247
I was hoping I could have a word with you.

343
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,368
What have you been up to, Leo?

344
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:42,420
Doing security at sport haus,

345
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:44,454
Which is what I wanted to talk to you about.

346
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:46,219
I was on the afternoon shift,

347
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:49,109
And I noticed one of the stock
guys acting kind of weird

348
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:52,114
Making calls from the pay
phone across the street,

349
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:54,368
Taking the occasional photo of the floors,

350
00:14:54,403 --> 00:14:56,081
Back offices on the cellphone.

351
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:58,836
What, like he's casing the joint? Kind of.

352
00:14:58,871 --> 00:15:01,974
And I noticed a new name
on the cleaning crew roster.

353
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:03,644
Danny Boyd.

354
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,998
Fitzpatrick flunky.

355
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:06,737
I tell my supervisor my concerns.

356
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,146
He says he'll look into it.

357
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:12,583
Next day, I'm switched to a new shift.

358
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:14,483
Something's not right.

359
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:16,866
Danny boyd, huh?

360
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,754
I'm friendly with a judge

361
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,595
Who might give me a tap on boyd's phone.

362
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,163
Stay put, and I'll see what I can do.

363
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:28,697
What I want to know is how did that guy

364
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:30,366
Write cool, insightful songs?

365
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:31,982
Or did Johnny do the good ones?

366
00:15:32,017 --> 00:15:33,563
Desmond wrote all the good ones.

367
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,369
I think he's just tired.

368
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:37,659
He's been on the road all spring.

369
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:39,915
We got class in five minutes, so...

370
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,535
Veronica, Vincent, Marty.

371
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,274
I figured, between them, they'd know.

372
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,978
We need to figure out what that means.

373
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,782
Okay.

374
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:51,900
So, this represents what's the word?

375
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:54,984
It's like a pleasing quality, you know?

376
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,327
Like... charming.

377
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:57,643
Or more.

378
00:15:57,678 --> 00:16:01,931
It's a spiritual quality,
but like charming or effortless.

379
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:03,088
God.

380
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:05,395
I got it grace. Grace. Right, yeah.

381
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,888
What?

382
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:17,273
Look, I... What is say?
Pretty pony huge was fan.

383
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:19,522
Desmond and I exchanged messages.

384
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:20,979
And believe it or not,

385
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,717
I wasn't always a boring
associate professor of chinese.

386
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:26,585
I was once... rather wild.

387
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,248
Was? You climbed down from
the room above on a sheet.

388
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:31,877
We're not the wild patrol.
We just need his stuff back.

389
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:32,891
What stuff?

390
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:35,090
From his bag... that you took after

391
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,556
I didn't take anything.

392
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:39,193
You were the only one
alone with his backpack.

393
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:40,498
He was a jerk, so

394
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,805
I didn't take anything, kids.

395
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,242
Professor Schaffer,
the situation is life and death.

396
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:51,645
There was medication in there,
which Desmond needs...

397
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,011
To live.

398
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,020
Oh, my god. Is he okay?

399
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,215
I'll cancel my class.
Okay, we'll call my doctor.

400
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,783
What's he missing?

401
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:03,317
So you believe her?

402
00:17:03,352 --> 00:17:04,922
I kind of do.

403
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,497
She would have given a kidney
to Desmond had we asked.

404
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:10,531
Who was that guy who called

405
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:12,829
Praying Desmond's show was canceled?

406
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:15,391
Semites for the savior.

407
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:17,578
Maybe they heard that god is now helping

408
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:19,869
Those that help themselves.

409
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:25,478
So, look wise, you're
thinking bright, fun, simple.

410
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:26,805
Well, accessible.

411
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,642
Quick loading to maximize click throughs.

412
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:30,441
Don't put the best asses at the top.

413
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:32,010
Make people hunt for them.

414
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:33,748
I compiled studies of browsing behavior

415
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:34,753
And drew up ratios of

416
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,215
But you don't want them too hidden.

417
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,651
If you can't find the good ones,
you'll feel cheated.

418
00:17:38,686 --> 00:17:41,171
And his role in this enterprise?

419
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:43,282
Consultant. I'm an ass expert.

420
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:45,358
Yes, except for the expert part.

421
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:47,072
I'm an ass?

422
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,905
Who would you ask for advice
about lions, a lion or a gerbil?

423
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,869
Gerbil, you say? No, you would ask a lion,

424
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:55,708
Because by virtue of being a lion,

425
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:58,274
A lion is an expert on lions.

426
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:00,842
So...

427
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:04,678
Okay. I don't see how you
hope to launch a website

428
00:18:04,713 --> 00:18:07,620
About hot asses without me, but fine.

429
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,094
It's friday night.

430
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,444
If I walk long enough in
a straight line, I'll hit a party.

431
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:19,438
State legislators will
meet later in the week

432
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,696
to discuss a bill banning
the sale of condoms...

433
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:26,203
I take it you failed.

434
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:28,909
We found the groupie,

435
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:31,436
But she said she
didn't take the tapes, so...

436
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:33,248
We have some other leads.

437
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,853
We'll find the tapes and get them back

438
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:45,565
Do the show,

439
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:50,518
and I'm a ha a a a ck.

440
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:55,333
Party time. What to wear?

441
00:18:56,764 --> 00:18:58,363
What was that?

442
00:18:58,398 --> 00:18:59,962
- The song?
- That?

443
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:01,702
Nothing.

444
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:03,741
- It's a... thing.
- No. It's cool.

445
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,884
It reminds me of the demo
on the wild parties reissue.

446
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:08,944
Indie rock or rock rock?

447
00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:11,910
Rock rock.

448
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:14,088
'Cause the bad boys get the chicks.

449
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:15,264
I mean, look at you.

450
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,702
You're single, and you're very nice, Pez.

451
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:19,095
There's a correlation.

452
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,418
Do you still write stuff?

453
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:23,095
Well, people want to
hear the old hits, so, no.

454
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,158
What about the one you just played?

455
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:27,462
That was a cool song.

456
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:29,697
There's no bridge.

457
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:32,098
Who cares, anyway, you know?

458
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:36,748
I play the old hits,
I get paid, go to parties.

459
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:38,205
If it ain't broke...

460
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,587
- It's gonna be a lame party.
- Really?

461
00:19:40,622 --> 00:19:42,408
I should go to Mexico.

462
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:44,149
I mean, if you stay here
working on the song,

463
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,483
you wouldn't miss much.

464
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:50,698
My stuff's locked up in the club.

465
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:53,778
I got a guitar in my room.

466
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,663
Well, if it's gonna be a lame party, maybe.

467
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,731
I'll be back in 15 minutes, okay?

468
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:05,060
...78 year old woman
neighbor opened the door,

469
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:06,375
Pointed a shotgun at them,

470
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,672
And then chased the girl
scout and her father

471
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,413
Off her property with the loaded weapon.

472
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,290
And finally, a blast from the past.

473
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,881
After 10 years in the
where are they now? File,

474
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,646
Desmond fellows appears tomorrow

475
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:20,403
To give fans of cult fave my pretty pony

476
00:20:20,438 --> 00:20:23,715
A taste of what they've been missing.

477
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,957
# And back at work, they still love you

478
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:32,066
# So why does it still
feel like your interview?

479
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:37,140
# Payday, and your money's
all that matters now

480
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:40,004
# You'd complain but you don't know how

481
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,213
When we come back, a household item

482
00:20:42,248 --> 00:20:44,841
That could be dangous
to your pets and children...

483
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,050
Sorry about that. Go.

484
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:52,659
Drew Barrymore.

485
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:53,825
Yeah.

486
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,488
Rose Mcgowan.

487
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:57,081
Ooh. Yes.

488
00:20:57,116 --> 00:20:59,165
- Jennifer Move Hewitt.
- Twice.

489
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,347
Dude, you are my idol.

490
00:21:02,906 --> 00:21:04,494
Who are you?

491
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,290
So, you surviving?

492
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:20,238
Surviving what?

493
00:21:20,273 --> 00:21:22,117
Helping Piz.

494
00:21:22,152 --> 00:21:25,302
You know, his puppy
dog eyes on you all the time.

495
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:27,960
It's weird.

496
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,079
Like you said, normal Piz.

497
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:34,129
Like... nothing ever happened.

498
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:36,437
Which bothers you because
making out with you

499
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:38,710
Is supposed to be some
life changing experience.

500
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:41,488
I don't know. I just...

501
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:42,582
Why are we talking about this?

502
00:21:42,617 --> 00:21:44,734
I thought you loved these
kind of conversations.

503
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:45,451
No.

504
00:21:45,486 --> 00:21:46,391
I was hoping we could follow it up

505
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:48,380
With a cuteness countdown
of the baldwin brothers.

506
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,581
I hope we're still
friends after I taser you.

507
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:55,644
So this is totally modular.

508
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,890
You can swap out content whenever.

509
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,503
Like franchisable.

510
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:01,918
You want to do boobs, legs, kitts, whatever,

511
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,298
You can have a new site
up and going instantly.

512
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,668
And bring your advertisers along.

513
00:22:06,703 --> 00:22:08,968
Okay, we'll sell that in the pitch.

514
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:11,444
So the difference between
income models would be what?

515
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:13,766
Eh. Not exactly my hacker forte.

516
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:16,019
Information wants to be free.

517
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:19,013
But I know someone who kind of knows.

518
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,397
Well, could we call this someone?

519
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,832
Max?

520
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:35,364
Yeah, hi.

521
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:42,338
Buzz! Bizen! Dude, you're in time!

522
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:45,586
We're going skinny dipping!

523
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:58,188
Okay, the key to good skinny dipping is...

524
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,021
What I call total nakedness.

525
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:05,201
It's not just physical nakedness
but spiritual, as well.

526
00:23:07,556 --> 00:23:13,556
La paz, capital of Bolivia...
get weird, man!

527
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:15,311
This is my lifestyle!

528
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:20,073
Whoo hoo hoo! Whoo! Whoo!

529
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:25,595
Whoo hoo hoo!

530
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,579
God, in his heaven, it's freezing.

531
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:38,082
Oh, my god, I don't recommend this!

532
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:41,532
Hey, man, want to turn that off?

533
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,645
It really kills the mood.

534
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,266
# And it's fading

535
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,518
"Hey, Jude", "Yesterday", "Get back".

536
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:54,475
Catchy tunes, yes. Rock 'n' roll, no.

537
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,954
What kind of musician
doesn't recognize the Beatles

538
00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:58,818
As the greatest rock band of all time?

539
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:01,357
I don't recognize them
as a rock band at all.

540
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:03,985
They were... tunesmiths.

541
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,362
Hey, man, I didn't get all pissy

542
00:24:07,397 --> 00:24:08,780
When you denied my claim

543
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:11,371
That marshal Dillon was
the greatest sheriff of all time.

544
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:12,632
Marshal Dillon was a marshal,

545
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,437
And, more importantly, is fictional.

546
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:16,643
That's what the Beatles are to me fictional.

547
00:24:16,678 --> 00:24:20,575
"Revolution", "hey, jude"
these were real songs, man.

548
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,876
Norwegian wood.

549
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:25,748
I sorry. I'm sorry.

550
00:24:26,683 --> 00:24:30,156
I used to know a rent boy from
oslo who called himself that.

551
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:34,038
Uh, mr. Mars, I think Desmond
is just winding you up.

552
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:36,306
Most critics reference the Beatles influence

553
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,417
In Desmond's material.

554
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:39,594
Oh, you mean those Beatles.

555
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:40,862
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,669
I thought you meant the other ones

557
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:45,460
With the two e's from the lower east side.

558
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:47,367
No, they're totally fictional.

559
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,298
John, Paul, George, and the drummer?

560
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:50,672
Oh, those guys are awesome.

561
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:53,969
Veronica, could you have
sacks bring me the leg irons?

562
00:24:54,004 --> 00:24:58,128
Come on, dad. Let it be.

563
00:25:01,222 --> 00:25:03,266
Here's what I did on my term paper site.

564
00:25:03,365 --> 00:25:04,187
Break it down.

565
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:06,548
For the lazy, search and
credit button right there.

566
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:11,055
For the dumb, billable links at
the top disguised as functions.

567
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,127
So they link without realizing.

568
00:25:13,162 --> 00:25:14,496
And I make a dollar.

569
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:15,957
See, the point of the internet

570
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,634
Is to make money off stupid people.

571
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:19,305
I like how you think, Max.

572
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,844
That sound you hear is my
idealism quietly shattering.

573
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:24,406
That other sound you hear

574
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,194
Is my cynicism laughing at
your idealism shattering.

575
00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:29,947
It won't be laughing when I'll
crash your greedy little evil website.

576
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:31,613
I'll be laughing when you try.

577
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,362
Will you? Maybe I'm in your
trusted host table already.

578
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:35,606
Should I get a camera?

579
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:37,895
There's got to be someone that'll pay

580
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,874
To see this hot nerd on nerd action.

581
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:42,518
Welcome to Semites for the Savior.

582
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:43,254
- Hi.
- Shalom.

583
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:44,327
Who's in charge here?

584
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:46,209
Me. You guys interested in joining?

585
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,176
- No.
- Yes, we are.

586
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:49,496
And we want to know what you guys are doing

587
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:52,133
- To try and stop that Desmond fellows show.
- That guy?

588
00:25:52,168 --> 00:25:54,970
We sent a sternly worded
letter to the dean's office.

589
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:56,481
- And we also called...
- Realistically.

590
00:25:56,516 --> 00:25:59,036
Like a real way to, you know...

591
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:00,427
Take care of it.

592
00:26:00,462 --> 00:26:01,749
- Veronica.
- Yeah?

593
00:26:01,784 --> 00:26:05,433
That was the bellboy who showed
Desmond and me to the room.

594
00:26:05,468 --> 00:26:07,279
Ratner.

595
00:26:07,314 --> 00:26:09,056
Oh, great.

596
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:11,186
What are you gonna accuse me of this time?

597
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:13,053
Hmm. How about...

598
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:16,354
Stealing Desmond Fellows' backing tapes?

599
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:17,845
Congratulations.

600
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,267
Wrong again.

601
00:26:19,302 --> 00:26:21,262
You had Desmond's bags in your possession.

602
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:23,899
You're a member of a group
protesting his presence.

603
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:26,501
That, to me, is a thing
that makes you go, hmm?

604
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:28,969
What's the thing that makes you go away?

605
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,060
I didn't know who that guy
was until George told me.

606
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:32,503
Who else could have put
the hotel robe in there?

607
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:33,882
- You got access.
- What robe?

608
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:36,878
The big, blue hotel robe in the bag.

609
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:40,834
You said it was a neptune grand robe.

610
00:26:40,852 --> 00:26:42,290
Yeah. A fluffy blue robe.

611
00:26:42,325 --> 00:26:43,728
Neptune grand robes aren't...

612
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:46,824
- Blue.
- They're white.

613
00:26:47,811 --> 00:26:51,754
Okay. I'm apologizing.

614
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:54,736
I'm sorry for thinking you were guilty.

615
00:26:54,771 --> 00:26:58,136
I don't accept your apology.

616
00:26:58,171 --> 00:27:00,219
I'll live.

617
00:27:01,528 --> 00:27:03,955
So, can I see the bag and the robe?

618
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:11,764
Right. Not a neptune grand robe.

619
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:14,817
So, what that's a clue?

620
00:27:14,852 --> 00:27:16,085
What kind?

621
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,833
Nothing else was in there.

622
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,990
So... did you solve it?

623
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:25,203
Yes.

624
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:28,593
The answer is danny cleaver's bag

625
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:31,389
And all my time this weekend.

626
00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:34,499
What are two things you
didn't mean to take but did?

627
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:37,209
- Huh?
- This isn't your bag.

628
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:40,509
You must have switched at
the airport with danny cleaver.

629
00:27:40,544 --> 00:27:42,652
It's a los angeles phone number,

630
00:27:42,687 --> 00:27:44,726
And the show is in four hours, so...

631
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:47,863
We should have your
tapes back right on time.

632
00:28:02,212 --> 00:28:04,025
Danny cleaver?

633
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,844
Did you happen to notice that
your backpack was full of tapes?

634
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,974
I've been kind of hung over.

635
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:12,133
My bags are still in the car.

636
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,211
How does this guy make it
through airport security?

637
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:25,135
Johnny's vocals from 'more problems. '

638
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,727
This album, my freshman year of high school,

639
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:30,284
I had a job washing dishes
at a nursing home,

640
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,750
But all the boss did

641
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:35,790
Was talk about bar fights and
weird sexual encounters.

642
00:28:35,825 --> 00:28:37,065
How weird?

643
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,463
Worst year of my life.

644
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:43,061
But an off brand mp3 player and
this album got me through it.

645
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,751
When I was on dance team,
I tried to convince them

646
00:28:45,786 --> 00:28:47,978
To do a routine to why you shot me down,

647
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:50,815
But changed the words
to we threw a touchdown.

648
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,618
Wait, you were, uh...
you were on a dance team?

649
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:55,761
I was a dance teamer with a deep soul.

650
00:28:55,796 --> 00:28:56,732
Hmm.

651
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,443
Plus, I thought Desmond was cute.

652
00:28:59,478 --> 00:29:04,121
Who knew he'd turn out
to be such a wastoid lech?

653
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:06,023
I don't think he's always been like that.

654
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:07,623
Still, it's gonna be a good show.

655
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:08,809
I'm glad we saved it.

656
00:29:10,277 --> 00:29:12,491
Good thing I got the nerve to call you.

657
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:14,039
Why wouldn't you have called?

658
00:29:14,074 --> 00:29:15,302
You know.

659
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,692
I thought it might be awkward.

660
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:22,047
Me and you... after... that.

661
00:29:22,082 --> 00:29:24,905
Yeah.

662
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,041
I'm glad it's not.

663
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:28,315
Awkward.

664
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,012
Oh, it is. No, I'm very uncomfortable.

665
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:32,009
I thought it would be
even more uncomfortable.

666
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:37,316
New crap?

667
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:39,583
What album was that?

668
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:41,781
This is not an album.

669
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:43,841
He said he'd been working on some new stuff.

670
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:45,866
He actually, uh... played some stuff for me.

671
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:47,372
It was pretty cool.

672
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:58,869
# She picked me out of the millions

673
00:29:59,575 --> 00:30:03,707
# Thumbing an o. E.D.

674
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:09,742
# Dressed me down to civilian

675
00:30:09,945 --> 00:30:15,167
# Cracks the code on the rosetta stone

676
00:30:15,202 --> 00:30:20,389
# Says the word for alone is alone

677
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,951
That truck it shouldn't be here.

678
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:26,166
They're getting an early start.

679
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:34,927
What?

680
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:42,848
Danny Boyd.

681
00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:46,883
It's happening now.

682
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:48,784
Those are guns.

683
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:51,004
Jeez.

684
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,155
Vinnie?

685
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,430
He was their man getting
the security layout?

686
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:57,603
Yeah.

687
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:02,468
- How do we play it?
- Wait for backup.

688
00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:06,768
- Keith?
- Yeah, Sacks, it's me.

689
00:31:06,803 --> 00:31:10,251
I'm at sport haus, and
there's a robbery in progress.

690
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:12,952
Get some cars down here.

691
00:31:45,743 --> 00:31:47,158
Yeah?

692
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:49,936
Someone else just called
to report a robbery at sport haus.

693
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:51,879
He says he trapped them inside the store.

694
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:54,942
Isn't that where you are?

695
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:57,456
Vinnie.

696
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:00,660
What are you doing here?

697
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,580
Working for a living.

698
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:08,872
Owner hired me.

699
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:12,268
Got wind of some foul play,
and he brought me in.

700
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:15,818
So I infiltrated their gang, and...

701
00:32:18,123 --> 00:32:20,797
Sealed with a kiss, sheriff.

702
00:32:20,832 --> 00:32:23,471
Hey, Vinnie, open the door!

703
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:26,411
Vinnie, open the door!

704
00:32:36,102 --> 00:32:37,717
Are you kidding?

705
00:32:38,118 --> 00:32:39,262
Desmond.

706
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:41,396
Just waiting on the tapes.

707
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:43,064
They should be here any second.

708
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:45,152
I never should have let Piz handle this.

709
00:32:45,187 --> 00:32:47,205
You know, if we have to refund those tickets

710
00:32:49,107 --> 00:32:52,810
Piz, where are you?

711
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,081
It's for you.

712
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,779
Hey, man. Did you get the tapes?

713
00:32:57,814 --> 00:33:00,266
Yeah, we got them,
but we're stuck in traffic,

714
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:02,509
And I don't think we'll make it in time.

715
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:04,917
Oh, man. How long?

716
00:33:04,952 --> 00:33:08,139
Well, there's an accident. I don't know.

717
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:12,772
Is there anything you can
do until we get there?

718
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:14,769
Did you ever finish any of those new songs?

719
00:33:14,804 --> 00:33:16,743
Um...

720
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:19,432
Maybe a few.

721
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:22,128
Can you start with one of those?

722
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:24,755
Uh... let me think about it.

723
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,393
You realize you've left
your fate in the hands

724
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:29,390
Of a spineless and semi alcoholic

725
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:31,162
Has been rock star.

726
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,449
What are you gonna do?

727
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:57,660
So, I- I bet you all want to hear
some my pretty pony hits, huh?

728
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:07,725
Um... how about some new solo material?

729
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,803
All right, new solo material it is, then.

730
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:31,566
# She picked me out of the millions

731
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,496
# Thumbing an O. E.D.

732
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,885
# Dressed me down to civilian

733
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:47,052
# Cracks the code on the rosetta stone

734
00:34:48,293 --> 00:34:52,188
# Says the word for alone is alone

735
00:34:56,617 --> 00:34:59,821
# My before and after

736
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:03,717
# My before and after...

737
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:20,539
# She found that armor was truly

738
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:25,259
# Some work of genius she held...

739
00:35:25,294 --> 00:35:28,313
Piznarski, you're a good guy.

740
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:35,942
#... said the church of his holiness light

741
00:35:35,977 --> 00:35:41,020
# This world's no dead and its park and ride

742
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:54,443
Thanks for coming. Have a good night!

743
00:35:54,478 --> 00:35:57,477
Thank you.

744
00:36:01,052 --> 00:36:03,466
Pez, you made it.

745
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:06,348
Hey, were you able to catch
the end of the show, at least?

746
00:36:06,383 --> 00:36:07,758
Yeah, we caught the whole thing.

747
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:10,225
Were you screwing with me?

748
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,028
I wanted to hear the new stuff.

749
00:36:12,063 --> 00:36:13,796
It was just it was awesome.

750
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:14,980
It was awesome.

751
00:36:15,015 --> 00:36:18,480
You're a bad man, piznarski.

752
00:36:28,183 --> 00:36:30,450
Is this about right?

753
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:32,687
You're all set to fleece idiots.

754
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:34,856
Thanks for helping us out.

755
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:36,956
Hey, free food. Why not?

756
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:39,780
Just remember, you got to link to me.

757
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:43,504
Sure you want to compromise your reputation

758
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:46,142
On your cheating site with
a link to our ass site?

759
00:36:46,177 --> 00:36:48,892
Anything to help you guys out.

760
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:51,608
You up for breakfast tomorrow?

761
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,950
I've got to finish up.

762
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:56,299
Rain check.

763
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:03,655
What?

764
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,405
Nothing.

765
00:37:05,493 --> 00:37:07,293
Hey.

766
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:11,450
You're still kind of a jerk, but...

767
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:14,938
- That was kind of incredible.
- Thank you.

768
00:37:14,973 --> 00:37:20,973
Want to go grab a drink, get away
from all these damn kids?

769
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,785
If I do say so, a... m ass terpiece.

770
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:34,342
So what's up with veronica and Piz?

771
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,656
She...

772
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:38,845
She, like, dating him or what?

773
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,999
She's trying to let him down easy.

774
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:44,465
But...

775
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,967
I don't know. When we were

776
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:50,605
When we were dating,
did they ever... you know?

777
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,271
No more talk of Veronica's love life.

778
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:56,082
Ever.

779
00:37:56,117 --> 00:37:57,618
But I will say, if you think
she was unfaithful,

780
00:37:57,653 --> 00:38:00,044
You're an idiot.

781
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:02,224
Now, if you'll excuse me...

782
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:04,793
It's morning.

783
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:10,091
Okay.

784
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,650
So it's what, just "Mac"?

785
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:16,532
Actually, forget the check.

786
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:19,888
How about a 50% stake?

787
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,789
So you're part owner.

788
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:28,722
Saw his numbers and figured
I'd be a millionaire by 2050.

789
00:38:31,654 --> 00:38:34,611
- Bronson.
- Hmm?

790
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,811
I, uh...

791
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:42,904
You're a great guy, Bronson. You really are.

792
00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:46,962
And I really feel almost insane saying this,

793
00:38:46,997 --> 00:38:50,333
But I really think I have to.

794
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,634
I think we should break up.

795
00:38:53,669 --> 00:38:58,237
I think that's how it should be.

796
00:38:58,272 --> 00:39:03,749
I'm really, really sorry.

797
00:39:03,784 --> 00:39:08,385
The average teen spends
16 hours a week online

798
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,379
And clicks on hundreds of links.

799
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,015
And in this day and age,

800
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,197
Someone is there to make
a percentage on each click.

801
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:18,300
What does the average teenager want to see?

802
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,462
The female posterior.

803
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:26,828
It commands a huge slice

804
00:39:26,863 --> 00:39:29,437
Of the average surfer's online attention.

805
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:32,012
Our goal is to take that tiny percentage...

806
00:39:32,047 --> 00:39:35,219
All right, mr. Echolls, thank you.

807
00:39:35,254 --> 00:39:36,577
We've seen quite enough.

808
00:39:36,612 --> 00:39:38,216
No, I'm not screwing around, sir.

809
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,872
It has income strings

810
00:39:39,907 --> 00:39:45,907
That'll do. You can sit down now.

811
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:55,095
Are you serious? Keith: yeah.

812
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,234
A, I feel responsible for you being fired.

813
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:01,429
The owner was wrong to fire you, but

814
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:02,510
What's b?

815
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:05,706
B is we need men.

816
00:40:05,741 --> 00:40:09,108
What do you say, Leo?
Feel like getting back in?

817
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:10,647
I'll come in for the paperwork.

818
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:14,418
Leo? Are you under arrest?

819
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,160
Because I've got an in with the sheriff.

820
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:19,581
Me too. I'm a deputy again.

821
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:23,011
So I guess I'll be seeing you around.

822
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:29,011
Just like old times.

823
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,465
He's back?

824
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,340
Yep.

825
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,036
How's your rocker friend?

826
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:38,702
On his way to play
university of alaska. Good.

827
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:43,240
I don't want to be square,
but you keep away from musicians.

828
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:47,589
Mr. Van lowe. To what do we owe the honor?

829
00:40:47,624 --> 00:40:49,285
Just a follow up, you know?

830
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,947
On that crime I stopped.

831
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,238
And to say thanks.

832
00:40:53,273 --> 00:40:55,460
It was the actions

833
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,949
Of local private investigator
vincent van lowe

834
00:40:57,984 --> 00:41:00,404
That led to the suspects being apprehended.

835
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:02,805
'Vinnie did a great job on this one,'

836
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,021
Said acting sheriff keith Mars.

837
00:41:05,056 --> 00:41:07,130
'He's an asset to this community. '

838
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,205
He's an asset to this community.

839
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,633
That's great, keith.

840
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,511
You can't buy that kind of publicity.

841
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:13,965
I've tried. You really can't.

842
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,719
Hardly need to these days, Vinnie.

843
00:41:15,754 --> 00:41:17,340
You're the only p. I. In town.

844
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,716
I didn't mean for my business.
I mean for my campaign.

845
00:41:20,751 --> 00:41:23,035
Campaign? For sheriff.

846
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,285
The special election.

847
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,925
Sport haus owner and a bunch
of his pals said I should,

848
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,832
So I... threwy hat in this morning.

849
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:33,194
Vinnie van lowe

850
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:35,740
He's an asset to this community.

851
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:39,703
Sheriff Mars.

852
00:41:39,738 --> 00:41:42,484
That's gonna look great on my posters.

853
00:41:49,572 --> 00:41:51,602
