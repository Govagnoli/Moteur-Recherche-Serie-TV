1
00:00:00,708 --> 00:00:02,625
Previously on Veronica Mars…

2
00:00:02,681 --> 00:00:05,289
It's been a year and a half since my best friend Lilly Kane was murdered.

3
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:06,884
I never would have hurt her.

4
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:08,144
Lilly and Weevil?

5
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:11,358
So what is the mystery condition that's causing your ex-boyfriend

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,698
and possible half-brother to black out.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,636
Did you know that Clarence Wiedman, Head of Security at Kane Software,

8
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:20,390
was the one that made the tip call that got Abel Koontz arrested?

9
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:21,783
You're dying, Abel.

10
00:00:22,393 --> 00:00:26,331
Did you know that there's a traffic ticket that proves that Lilly's time of death is three hours off?

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,190
Jake and Celeste. Either of them could have gone home on their own and killed Lilly.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,160
So Abel Koontz has a daughter.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,030
And now Clarence Wiedman knows that I know.

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,515
But what do I really know?

15
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:42,269
That Jake Kane bought a dying man's confession?

16
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:44,322
That the Kane family needed a fall guy?

17
00:00:45,397 --> 00:00:46,881
Amelia DeLongpre.

18
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,549
She's the one person who can prove my theory.

19
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:52,541
I have to track her down before Clarence Wiedman finds her and…

20
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,197
Loyola Marymount?

21
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:56,844
What do you know?

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,607
She lives in LA.

23
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:05,979
Hello?

24
00:01:14,418 --> 00:01:16,435
Hello. Ms DeLongpre?

25
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:19,235
Uh, who are you?

26
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:21,212
I'm looking for Amelia DeLongpre.

27
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,375
I'm sorry. She left about five minutes ago with some friend of hers.

28
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:26,853
Could you describe this friend?

29
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:30,397
Tiny, blonde, cute as a bug.

30
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:33,644
I'm sorry. I don't think I can do this. I don't even know you.

31
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,741
Your father's attorney, Clif-Mr McCormack sent me to get you.

32
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,453
We found some new evidence, evidence that may prove your father is innocent.

33
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,272
What?

34
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:45,118
Amelia, get in the car. If you don't get in the car, you're putting yourself in danger.

35
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:46,889
I haven't spoken to my father in years.

36
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:48,293
I don't understand.

37
00:01:48,414 --> 00:01:51,338
You're a threat to the Kane family now that you know about the payoff.

38
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:52,424
What payoff?

39
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:56,208
You just told me you're receiving millions in Kane Software stock.

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,995
But mom said that was an out of court settlement.

41
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,535
It's not a settlement. It's a payoff.

42
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,324
For pleading guilty to the murder of Lilly Kane.

43
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:05,101
Your father is innocent.

44
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:24,271
Not exactly the Ritz but hopefully you'll only be here for a couple of days.

45
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:26,881
Exams are next week.

46
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,396
One dank room is as good as the next.

47
00:02:31,014 --> 00:02:32,728
You know, I think this might actually be perfect.

48
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:35,735
Before you dive in, you need to call your mother

49
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:39,087
and have her overnight the Kane settlement documents right away.

50
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:42,759
Tell her to pay in cash and make sure she uses a fake name.

51
00:02:42,902 --> 00:02:44,080
What will those prove?

52
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,017
They'll prove your father's being paid to take the fall.

53
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,405
And don't use your cell phone. Use this. It's not traceable.

54
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:53,891
Okay.

55
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:57,428
But I have to be able to take calls from my boyfriend.

56
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,187
Unless you also want the police, marines and the National Guard out looking for me.

57
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:04,279
I'll check the caller ID. Only him. No one else.

58
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:05,416
No one else.

59
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,034
And Amelia?

60
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:09,030
He can't know your location.

61
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,063
Veronica?

62
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:15,041
Yeah?

63
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:16,361
Have you…

64
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:19,491
Have you seen him?

65
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:21,692
You know, in prison?

66
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:23,975
Yeah.

67
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:26,013
How…

68
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:28,732
How is he?

69
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:33,176
Dying. But if you know that, it's doubtful you'll help me.

70
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:35,398
He's doing fine.

71
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,738
As if I didn't have enough stress in my life,

72
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:23,501
today marks that orgy of tension known as midterms.

73
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:28,719
Some handle it better than others.

74
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:33,741
Top right. Yes, that's my face that you see on a phone sex ad.

75
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:36,526
I was getting phone calls for this all night long.

76
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:40,940
I got zero sleep and my dad's a doctor, we can't just unplug the phone.

77
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:42,066
I've been bad.

78
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:46,597
And this morning, someone let the air out of my tire. It's not fair.

79
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:47,709
Of course, Sabrina.

80
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,470
We'll find a time for you to take the test la-

81
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:52,644
Oh, wait. What happened to you're late, too bad, no exceptions.

82
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:56,531
Mr Cho? When someone personally attacks you, we'll talk.

83
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:59,551
Go to the library, we'll reschedule.

84
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:00,395
Thanks.

85
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:09,203
How 'bout, when my mom's elected school board president, we'll talk.

86
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:11,041
Veronica?

87
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:14,010
I heard this was kind of like your office.

88
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,152
I need your help.

89
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:17,277
A little club soda on the sleeves?

90
00:05:17,363 --> 00:05:19,268
This is because I had a flat.

91
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,083
I had to change it myself and there was no hole, somebody just let the air out.

92
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:24,378
Do you know Caz Truman?

93
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:27,626
Basketball player, drives a Yukon?

94
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:31,700
Yeah. I broke up with him two months ago and since then he's been harassing me.

95
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:34,502
This is just the latest of these so-called pranks.

96
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,958
I hear that you do things. I need you to make him stop.

97
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:42,862
Gee, I'd love to help Sabrina but I have midterms of my own.

98
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,361
This is important. I'll pay you.

99
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,863
Every night when I'm trying to study there's some new catastrophe.

100
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:53,451
I  am broke and Amelia's hotel room is seventy bucks a day.

101
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:55,360
Are you sure it's Caz?

102
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,345
Oh, this is so Caz, totally immature. Here.

103
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:01,294
I can give you a hundred now and four more when you prove that it's him.

104
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,160
And the sooner the better because I already have to reschedule my AP history test.

105
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:20,484
Veronica Mars. What do you want?

106
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:23,346
Caz, I'm kind of busy so let's play this at fast forward.

107
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:27,094
I ask you to stop harassing Sabrina Fuller. You deny it. I eventually catch you.

108
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,023
You're suspended, dropped from basketball and made the subject of a news blurb

109
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,967
that everyone chuckles at in the papers. So stop harassing Sabrina, okay?

110
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,164
Look,  I'm not harassing Sabrina.

111
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:37,068
Caz! Did you listen?

112
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:39,982
The flat tires, the escort ad, the midnight crank calls-

113
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:41,441
Wa-wa-wait. She said I did this?

114
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,898
We-we've had problems but no way.

115
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:47,022
I would leap off the roof of that school if she asked me, you know.

116
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:48,772
Very caring gesture but-

117
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:50,304
I swear it wasn't me.

118
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:53,458
Now, I'm late for the gym but when you catch whoever did this,

119
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:57,144
you tell me, okay, 'cause I will smash his face in. I mean, seriously.

120
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,764
Why is it that the Caz's of the world are forever in transit between romantic failure and the gym?

121
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:08,632
Sabrina says Caz strikes only at night. That gives me a couple hours

122
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,509
before I need to get over there. Time enough to prepare my case for Amelia,

123
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:17,077
prove to her that her father is allowing himself to be executed in order to make her wealthy.

124
00:07:23,962 --> 00:07:25,191
Mars Investigations.

125
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:27,444
- Is Keith Mars available? 
- No, he's in a meeting.

126
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:30,761
You want me to find a call girl for your husband?

127
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:33,459
Yes. He likes blondes.

128
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:38,006
Look, I don't know if you were looking for pimp in the phonebook and just stopped at PI-

129
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:40,014
I want her to take him to a motel

130
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:43,435
and when he's in a compromising position, you get the...

131
00:07:43,787 --> 00:07:46,085
- What's it called? The, um- 
- Money shot?

132
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:51,201
Exactly. Prenup violated. Settlement for me. Bonus for you.

133
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:55,168
Sounds sweet. But if we go by the letter of the law, it's entrapment.

134
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,208
Dad, Mr Wilson is asking about-

135
00:07:57,293 --> 00:08:01,128
The law? Look, if you don't want to do it, I'll take my business elsewhere.

136
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:05,636
Perhaps Mr Vincent Vanlowe isn't as interested in the letter of the law.

137
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:10,806
Yeah, well, just know if you go with Mr Vanlowe there's every chance you'll get the Vinnie classic.

138
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:11,902
And what does that mean?

139
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:15,597
That means, Vinnie goes to bust your husband, gets his proof then goes back to him

140
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:18,634
and says for double her money, I'll tell the wife you're a choir boy.

141
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:29,463
What is it with the Mars' family?

142
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,823
God, Veronica, and you really believe Lilly's murder was some sort of vast conspiracy?

143
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:38,177
- I don't know what you saw. 
- A file on Duncan.

144
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,830
There's a file on everyone.

145
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,580
Yeah. It's thorough. And I'm glad my alibi held up.

146
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,280
Out of the country. Two eye witnesses, it's airtight.

147
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:56,246
Hey, what do you think Lilly would make of you investigating all the people who loved her?

148
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,998
I loved Lilly.

149
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,112
Maybe if I didn't I'd be able to drop this.

150
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:08,176
Okay, I just came to give you this.

151
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:17,331
Hey, thanks, for, uh, you looking for my mother.

152
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:25,667
Your mom was always nice to me.

153
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,624
Way to think it through, Veronica. Ripping up Logan's check was a noble gesture

154
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:42,946
but who's going to pay for Amelia DeLongpre's motel room?

155
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:53,791
Is this movie pay-per-view?

156
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:55,608
I don't understand. These shoes.

157
00:09:57,165 --> 00:10:01,421
These shoes were photographed in Lilly's room a couple hours after the murder.

158
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:05,373
The same shoes were found two months later on your father's houseboat.

159
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,226
Someone had to plant them there.

160
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,011
And you're sure that it was the Kanes who framed him?

161
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:13,333
Who else had the money and influence to pull it off?

162
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,784
I just can't imagine someone murdering their own family.

163
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,032
All three of the Kanes falsified their alibis.

164
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:25,898
When I was really young, my dad…

165
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:30,077
he was a normal dad.

166
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:37,280
But when Jake Kane cheated him out of his streaming video patent, it just, it changed him.

167
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:41,535
He'd lock himself in his office for weeks, not even speak to me or my mom.

168
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:45,636
Said he was gonna create a program that would put Kane out of business

169
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:48,841
but of course, nothing ever came of that.

170
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:51,283
One day my mom brings him a cup of coffee and…

171
00:10:52,148 --> 00:10:54,001
she spills it all over his work.

172
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,639
He backhanded her.

173
00:10:58,349 --> 00:10:59,634
We left the next day.

174
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:01,867
Mom divorced him.

175
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:04,380
Can I ask you something?

176
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:05,594
Sure.

177
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:09,578
Why do you think the money's coming to me?

178
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:18,839
I think… it's his way of saying, you know, that he's sorry.

179
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,564
Hi. Uh, I'm looking for Sabrina?

180
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:45,198
Order, genus, species.

181
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:46,207
And the kingdoms are?

182
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,713
Fungi, plantae, animalia, uh, monera…

183
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,340
Oh, hello.

184
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:55,516
It's Veronica. I said that I would tutor her.

185
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:58,161
Just don't forget about your own studies.

186
00:11:58,229 --> 00:11:59,359
Don’t worry, mom.

187
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:02,806
Se mi trattiene la chiudo nella la cantina.

188
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:06,901
Ma potrebbe stappare il buon vino.

189
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:09,999
Meglio tentare per la soffita.

190
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:14,048
I’m late to meet your father. Lynn is sleeping so keep it down.

191
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:20,608
You forgot protista.

192
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:23,223
I didn't forget, you interrupted.

193
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:24,668
What do you have?

194
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:30,149
Caz Truman denies it. I put a tracker on his car just in case.

195
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:33,121
Otherwise, we just wait to see if something happens.

196
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:36,009
There is no if. Something happens every night.

197
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:38,266
Well, that's why I'm here.

198
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:44,600
Yukon's still in the garage.

199
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:00,606
Hello?

200
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,483
Yes,  this is Miss Sabrina.

201
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,129
Bad boy, well…

202
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:10,867
Mr Greeley of Encinitas.

203
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:15,116
Twenty grand on credit cards, two divorces and a repo'd Sebring.

204
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:16,903
You have been a bad boy.

205
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:18,936
Miss Sabrina commands you.

206
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:20,835
Put your pants back on and get a job.

207
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:25,709
Do you know anyone with a yellow truck?

208
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:26,892
No. Why?

209
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:31,357
Is that yours?

210
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:42,524
Hello, Truman.

211
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,716
Caz, it's over. Why can't you just act like a mature adult instead of-

212
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,666
Baby, it's not me. I'm innocent.

213
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:56,302
Caz, you were lurking. The innocent rarely lurk.

214
00:13:56,395 --> 00:13:58,238
No, I wasn't lurking.

215
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:01,950
The thought of somebody messing with you made me nuts.

216
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:04,464
I was watching the house figuring I could catch the guy,

217
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,576
be the hero, get you back.

218
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:09,665
What is with the junkie old truck?

219
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:14,197
It's the gardener's. So Sabrina, I would never hurt you.

220
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:17,001
You know, if you asked, I would jump off the roof.

221
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,896
Can I get you to stop that?

222
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:20,053
Ask him to jump.

223
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:25,087
The door? Who's knocking on my door at eleven o'clock?

224
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,288
Let's get this party started, whooo.

225
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:29,622
You're in the wrong place.

226
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,997
Have you consider that maybe you're in the wrong place?

227
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:39,449
Keep it rolling all night. 23 Emperor Court.

228
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:41,972
- Where did you get that? 
- Sultans of Acid.

229
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,331
The guy was handing them out. Said we'd all be rocking and rolling.

230
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:53,016
Sultans of Acid yielded nothing but hundreds of spaced-out weirdoes

231
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,840
who couldn't answer a simple question.

232
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:56,621
Complete dead end.

233
00:14:57,804 --> 00:14:59,437
- Who is it? 
- It's me.

234
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:05,299
I brought some brain food.

235
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,447
Snowballs!

236
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:11,049
Oh, I talked to my mom. Sorry I freaked out.

237
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:13,277
She was just visiting her sister in Squirrel Point.

238
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:14,843
She says she's gonna mail that stuff tomorrow.

239
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,626
Great.

240
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,424
Veronica? Could you arrange a visitation with my dad?

241
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:24,364
For the first time I can remember, I really want to talk to him.

242
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:30,158
Yeah. Sure, uh, it may take a few days.

243
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:33,220
Just long enough to get the proof of the Kane payoff.

244
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,861
Shouldn't you be getting ready for your Achiever Dinner?

245
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:40,531
Scholastic Excellence, I will.

246
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:41,729
Miss Mars.

247
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:44,626
Mr Vanlowe.

248
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:49,044
I, uh, hope you're not thinking of dying that hair because when you come work for me,

249
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:54,570
you'll find that straying husbands are most likely to chase skinny blondes.

250
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:59,021
No, I'm kidding, of course. They'll chase anything. But seriously, don't dye that hair.

251
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,847
No hair advice for me, Vinnie?

252
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:04,416
Actually Keith I was just coming by to say thanks.

253
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:07,386
You know, uh, once you set up shop here, I got a little nervous,

254
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:11,210
um, a former detective, sheriff, uh, law enforcement machine,

255
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:13,611
hitting the Neptune PI scene,

256
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:17,564
working the whole B-movie, back alley vibe.

257
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:19,228
Clients love that.

258
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:23,098
I thought I was toast but here we are sending each other referrals.

259
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:24,665
Referrals? Did I send you a-

260
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:26,001
Red-head, with the husband problem.

261
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:29,745
Ahh, right. I wasn't actually referring so much as warning.

262
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:35,023
I was thinking, uh, we might work together, you know, juggle some cases, maximise the market.

263
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:35,987
Actually, Vinnie, we're not-

264
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:39,017
Ah, you're on the fence, okay, okay, okay but I have ten cases,

265
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,760
five hundred a day, I can't handle them all.

266
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:46,513
I'll farm them to you for three, I'm talking no-brainers, free of major ethical issues.

267
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,447
Easy money. Win-win.

268
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:50,543
Just saying.

269
00:16:51,484 --> 00:16:52,431
Think it over.

270
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:01,648
Get ready for your dinner.

271
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:07,024
I've been dreading it for weeks. Two hours at the Kane estate

272
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,245
with the top five ranking juniors and seniors trying not to gag

273
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:13,239
as they talk about the scholarship they're offering in Lilly's name.

274
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:18,027
It's been a year and a half since I stood outside this door

275
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:20,520
and watched my best friend's body carried away.

276
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,407
A year and a half's worth of questions only I know

277
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,517
and only someone in this house can answer.

278
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,175
Veronica, I didn't, uh…

279
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:31,840
Welcome.

280
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,087
Thank you, Mr Kane.

281
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:37,939
Come in, the others are already here.

282
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:04,045
It's hard to be back knowing what I know now and not wonder.

283
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:08,095
Celeste Kane has plenty of reasons to hate me.

284
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,852
And before Lilly died I got the distinct impression she'd learned one of her mother's reasons.

285
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:14,701
Maybe Celeste over reacted.

286
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:17,982
Lilly, she cannot come back here, ever.

287
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:20,219
Chill out, Mommie dearest.

288
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,759
That's no way to treat your stepdaughter.

289
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:26,328
I think Duncan might have already slipped Veronica

290
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,810
a bit too much of the old Kane hospitality.

291
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:43,202
I am proud to announce an annual award in the name of our daughter.

292
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:46,783
Starting this year, Neptune High's Valedictorian

293
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:54,616
will receive a full-time scholarship to the university lucky enough to have him or her.

294
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:58,794
So, best of luck to this year's seniors. May the best scholar win.

295
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,184
And, for next year's seniors,

296
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:08,918
I only hope that this adds to your fantastic motivation,

297
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:15,593
although, uh, I might add that we'll be paying for one of this year's junior honourees either way.

298
00:19:19,603 --> 00:19:21,108
He doesn't look like a killer

299
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:25,019
but you don't get to run a Fortune 500 company without a killer instinct.

300
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:29,019
And  what if Lilly finally succeeded at getting her parents' attention.

301
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,378
You're blocking my sun.

302
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,356
Who the hell are you?

303
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:34,793
Me, I'm no one, I was just going.

304
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,565
You were having sex with my daughter?

305
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:37,502
Not right now.

306
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:39,135
You think you can make a fool out of me?

307
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:40,149
Daddy, stop it.

308
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:51,003
Breathe a word and I promise you, you'll take the fall.

309
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:55,601
Come on over here, let's chow down. It's rack of lamb tonight.

310
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:56,529
Veronica.

311
00:19:58,059 --> 00:19:59,344
Come on, dorkus.

312
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:16,978
My god, worse party ever. What are you doing at nerdfest.

313
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:20,506
I had to come back.

314
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:23,055
Something's wrong, they're hiding something.

315
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:28,385
Please. Veronica. They have their faults but they are hardly murderers.

316
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:31,114
Wow, you've got some imagination.

317
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,826
Then who did it?

318
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:35,794
You okay?

319
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,068
So, who are you hiding from?

320
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,816
- No, really, I was just… 
- Relax.

321
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,378
I come here sometimes too. To think about her.

322
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:58,429
At first I begged my parents to sell the house.

323
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:03,672
Couldn't even walk by this spot, imagining the last thoughts that went through her head.

324
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:08,516
But now, it's kind of nice.

325
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:10,928
Peaceful.

326
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,374
When I'm here, I feel like she's still with me.

327
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:21,507
Come on, inside.

328
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,418
We don't bite.

329
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:35,376
What's wrong, Sabrina?

330
00:21:36,524 --> 00:21:39,840
I… was just exhausted.

331
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,965
All of this crap.

332
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,052
I got an 86 on the AP Bio exam.

333
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:49,108
AP Bio is a killer, a "B" isn't-

334
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:53,701
I lost it, the top GPA, the Valedictorian spot.

335
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,866
Because of one test?

336
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:59,972
I had a hundredth of a point lead and now I'm a hundredth behind.

337
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,154
Why have you gotten him to stop?

338
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:05,097
Sabrina, it's not Caz, I'm sure.

339
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,309
Wait, who's in first place now?

340
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:11,753
Him.

341
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,360
Hamilton Cho?

342
00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:15,143
Yeah.

343
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:24,472
Since I'm checking on new GPA champ, Hamilton Cho,

344
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,585
I might as well expand my gastronomical horizons.

345
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:30,420
I'm actually a little hurt this is your first Cho's pizza, Veronica.

346
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:34,087
What can I say? I lack pizza imagination.

347
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,252
So, hear you got into Oxford. Congrats.

348
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:43,103
Yeah, sweet. If I can come up with about a billion dollars or so.

349
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:47,666
Well. I hear you've edged into the lead for Valedictorian now.

350
00:22:47,753 --> 00:22:52,258
If you don't blow it in the next nine weeks, that Kane scholarship will pay for Oxford entirely.

351
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:55,940
- So, Sabrina… 
- Ah, the teenage witch.

352
00:22:56,393 --> 00:22:59,227
- You don't like her. 
- Do you? Does anyone?

353
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:01,915
She's had it pretty tough this week.

354
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:05,054
Boo hoo. You know how many breaks she's had?

355
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:08,253
She got AP credit for a school sponsored trip to Rome.

356
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:10,379
Her mom is the School Board President.

357
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:12,212
I mean, how can I compete with that?

358
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:16,471
I work twenty hours a week, no tutors, it's just the way it is here.

359
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:18,986
Money talks, etcetera, etcetera.

360
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:22,969
You know what I'm talking about.

361
00:23:23,273 --> 00:23:25,150
Hamilton. This order's ready.

362
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:27,571
Gotta run.

363
00:23:28,754 --> 00:23:30,101
Pop, I'll be back in ten.

364
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:32,829
Of course I agree, Hamilton. The world is unfair.

365
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,118
That's why I don't feel good about putting a tracker on your car.

366
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:51,779
Can I help you?

367
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:54,912
Mr Mars.

368
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:56,936
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you knock.

369
00:23:57,595 --> 00:23:59,295
I must have been in the shower.

370
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,901
Well, come on in, I'll fix you a cup of coffee.

371
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:09,766
It's been a while.

372
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:11,297
It has.

373
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:14,123
What brings you to my door?

374
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,108
Looking for someone.

375
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,495
Her name is Amelia DeLongpre.

376
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:30,543
Geez. You mean the head of a corporate security team came to a little old PI like me?

377
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:31,644
I'm flattered.

378
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,589
I'm two fifty a day.

379
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:37,153
I had thought maybe you knew already where she was.

380
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:39,477
Company has some important information for her.

381
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:40,854
We thought perhaps…

382
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:43,465
she might even be staying with you.

383
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:45,232
In my two room apartment.

384
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:48,135
Well take a look around, Clarence.

385
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:50,814
God's honest truth, I don't know who that woman is

386
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,664
or why I'd have her stashed here, but knock yourself out.

387
00:24:56,446 --> 00:24:57,606
Are we done here, then?

388
00:25:01,427 --> 00:25:02,793
Thanks for your hospitality.

389
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:11,637
Guess who stopped by today?

390
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:14,898
If you say Josh Hartnett, I'm gonna be so bummed.

391
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:17,320
Clarence Wiedman.

392
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:21,099
He's the head of security for Kane Software.

393
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:25,020
And for an hour after he left I sat here wondering.

394
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:29,699
What did I stumble on that has them so rattled that they'd send over their top guy?

395
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:33,458
I wasn't sure what it was but I was proud.

396
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:36,069
Clearly I was making them nervous.

397
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:39,018
Then it occurred to me.

398
00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:41,204
I didn't stumble on anything.

399
00:25:41,696 --> 00:25:45,920
I haven't touched the case in months. Nope, I'm not scaring the Kanes.

400
00:25:47,318 --> 00:25:49,801
My seventeen year old daughter is.

401
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:54,102
I know who he is. He's looking for Abel Koontz's daughter.

402
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:58,249
Of course, she changed her name.

403
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:03,406
She's the one getting the payoff.

404
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:07,143
And you know where Amelia is.

405
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:12,053
Do you have any idea how dangerous it is, what you're doing? 

406
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:16,583
I'm protecting her so that the Kanes can't get to her and cover up the money trail.

407
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:18,493
Well who's going to protect you, Veronica?

408
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:21,894
Understand me. That family will do anything to make that evidence go away.

409
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,814
She's willing to help us, Dad.

410
00:26:23,906 --> 00:26:26,450
She's already agreed to turn over the phoney patent documents,

411
00:26:26,528 --> 00:26:29,006
that's as much of a smoking gun as we're gonna find.

412
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:33,792
That girl must really love her old man if she's trading three million bucks for three months of his life.

413
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:36,265
- You know about Abel- 
- Stomach cancer?

414
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:41,339
All right Veronica.

415
00:26:43,189 --> 00:26:45,129
New game, new rules.

416
00:26:47,115 --> 00:26:48,999
I told you a long time ago to drop this case-

417
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,965
- Dad, I won't- 
- I know. Just listen.

418
00:26:52,113 --> 00:26:55,291
You have to promise me that you'll be more careful.

419
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:58,640
That means no more surprise visits from Clarence Wiedman.

420
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,783
I just can't make myself more clear.

421
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:04,441
I'll promise.

422
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,393
All right.

423
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:13,171
I found a cell phone record showing that Jake Kane called Clarence

424
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:15,843
five minutes before he arrived home the night of the murder.

425
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,749
So when Jake's alibi went all to pieces and I started to question the coroner's time of death,

426
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:24,158
the core body temperature just didn't match the rest of the timeline.

427
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:30,943
You think Jake called Clarence Wiedman after he discovered Lilly's body?

428
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:34,828
To do what?

429
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,293
Whatever needed to be done.

430
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:46,384
Clarence Wiedman.

431
00:27:47,004 --> 00:27:48,638
Ex-army intelligence,

432
00:27:49,964 --> 00:27:51,258
ex-FBI,

433
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:54,326
ex-god knows what else.

434
00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:57,874
Probably a good man in a bad situation.

435
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:14,478
Clarence. I need your help.

436
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:21,104
Mr Kane, listen to me. I need you to go to the trunk and get the rest of it.

437
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,318
And then we need to decide which one of you found her.

438
00:28:24,682 --> 00:28:25,897
Now show me the body.

439
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:35,015
Hello.

440
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:37,903
Veronica? Now it's this car alarm.

441
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:40,940
It's been going off outside of my window for the last two hours.

442
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:44,779
We called the police twice. It just stops right before they get here.

443
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:48,942
Well, it can't be Hamilton. He's been at Cho's all night.

444
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:53,242
Veronica. I can't take this anymore. Are you gonna help me or what?

445
00:28:53,596 --> 00:28:56,847
Get out. Go find the car and take down the licence plate.

446
00:28:56,898 --> 00:28:58,260
I'll see what I can do tomorrow.

447
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:06,707
In the meantime, I need to find out when a certain ticking time bomb is set to go off.

448
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:13,323
I'd like to know when you plan on telling Duncan and everyone how I'm psycho

449
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,245
or, at least, unhealthily obsessed. I'd like to be prepared.

450
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:21,244
You know, something's been bothering me.

451
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:25,335
About Duncan having whatever he has, that weird kind of epilepsy. Are you sure?

452
00:29:25,626 --> 00:29:26,738
- About that? 
- Yeah.

453
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:28,289
Yeah.

454
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,758
I've know him since kindergarten, why didn't he ever mention it to me?

455
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:38,156
I don't think he or his parents wanted anyone to know.

456
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:41,120
I think they still want him to be president some day.

457
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:43,768
Does that mean that he has, like, fits or something?

458
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:45,237
Possibly.

459
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:48,739
Other times the attacks might manifest themselves as

460
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,743
hysterical laughter or uncontrollable crying.

461
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,428
Or a blind rage.

462
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,373
Does any of that sound familiar to you?

463
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:05,378
I'm only telling you, okay.

464
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:09,915
Last year when…

465
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:16,100
I was over at their place, I heard screaming from the next room.

466
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:19,142
I heard Duncan's voice and thought someone had broken into the house

467
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,138
and when I got there, I found him on the floor

468
00:30:23,514 --> 00:30:25,982
and he had his hands around his dad's throat.

469
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:28,901
And I tried to pull him off.

470
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:35,232
And all of a sudden he went limp and he was Duncan again.

471
00:30:36,473 --> 00:30:37,774
What did Jake say to you?

472
00:30:39,678 --> 00:30:40,549
Nothing.

473
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,964
We helped Duncan to his room and it was over.

474
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,322
I tried talking to Duncan the next day at school but

475
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:51,044
he acted like he didn't remember a thing.

476
00:30:53,697 --> 00:30:54,931
When Lilly died?

477
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:56,401
No.

478
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:02,155
It was the week you guys broke up.

479
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:05,857
It's weird, huh?

480
00:31:17,854 --> 00:31:22,436
Despite serious sleep deprivation, Sabrina remembered to get the plate on the offending car.

481
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:25,973
An '83 K-car registered to Debra Villareal

482
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,681
who's touring Europe as "Jasmine" in "Aladdin on Ice".

483
00:31:29,782 --> 00:31:32,804
So what's her K-car doing parked outside the Fuller residence?

484
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:38,246
I doubt it's coincidence that Debra Villareal was once married to Vinnie Vanlowe, Private Eye.

485
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:43,269
Hello?

486
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:47,473
Sabrina, hi. I need to borrow some of your spirit week stuff.

487
00:31:52,552 --> 00:31:55,321
I'm not an expert on the male mind so maybe someday

488
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:59,505
someone can tell me what it is about chrome, glass and fake black leather

489
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:01,625
that are supposed to represent masculinity.

490
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,161
Ah, can I help you?

491
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:08,860
Yes! You can help me by asking if Mr Vanlowe has a second to see Veronica Mars

492
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:12,854
and you can help Neptune High by buying cookies for our spirit week.

493
00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:15,976
Oh, Vinnie loves these mints. I'll take one.

494
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:18,557
If you buy two, you get a spirit pin.

495
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:22,141
Oh, I have to have a pin, here. That's ten.

496
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:25,597
Go Pirates.

497
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:30,648
Ma, I told you a million times, if you don't order extra mayo on the tuna it gets all cr- 

498
00:32:32,524 --> 00:32:33,848
Why Ms Mars.

499
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,873
So, uh, what can I do for you?

500
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:41,786
- Couple of things, actually. 
- Shoot.

501
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:50,506
First, my dad just wanted me to come by and say he is unable to take you up on your offer.

502
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:54,479
He says thanks anyway and in the spirit of mutual co-operation,

503
00:32:54,694 --> 00:32:56,681
he wanted to give you this.

504
00:32:58,391 --> 00:33:01,959
Mars Investigation address and phone right there on the pen.

505
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:03,408
Class.

506
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,807
So what's the number two thing?

507
00:33:06,977 --> 00:33:11,502
I was hoping maybe you could tell me who hired you to harass Sabrina Fuller.

508
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:12,650
Sabrina Fuller.

509
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:15,753
Doesn't ring a bell. I don't believe I know such a person.

510
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:17,146
See, I think that you do.

511
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,570
Either that or your ex-wife really hates academic achievers.

512
00:33:20,744 --> 00:33:22,163
My ex-wife, Brenda?

513
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:22,977
No.

514
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:24,507
Masako!

515
00:33:24,677 --> 00:33:25,516
Debra.

516
00:33:25,932 --> 00:33:28,338
Guess she's been having some trouble with her K-car?

517
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:33,452
Uh, well I don't know anything about that, I mean, I wish I can help you but I can't.

518
00:33:33,524 --> 00:33:38,236
As you can see, I'm in the middle of a job here, so if you don't mind.

519
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:43,477
Sure. Just trying to help a friend out at school. No big deal.

520
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,466
Well, tell your dad, thanks for the pen.

521
00:33:45,704 --> 00:33:49,006
Sure. And you-you've a little something on your face.

522
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:49,858
Potato chip?

523
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:56,216
That is not cool.

524
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,311
So what did you find out?

525
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:07,942
Nothing, but I sold two boxes of cookies.

526
00:34:09,288 --> 00:34:13,087
You found out nothing. So, what is the point of us even doing this?

527
00:34:13,163 --> 00:34:15,749
Why didn't you tell me you got thin mints? Come in here.

528
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,248
That's the point. Just wait.

529
00:34:18,617 --> 00:34:21,125
Yeah, uh-huh, cute.

530
00:34:21,715 --> 00:34:27,007
Hey, ma, whose that band I like, ooh, yeah, Hall and Oates. John Hall and Daryl Oates.

531
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:32,455
That one song. Private Eye, I'm watching you

532
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:37,575
and I see your every move. Yeah, Veronica Mars,

533
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:42,783
I'm watching you, Private Eye.

534
00:34:42,946 --> 00:34:44,494
I'm watching you.

535
00:34:45,444 --> 00:34:49,470
Hall and Oates, Veronica. They wrote the song and now you're living it.

536
00:34:49,732 --> 00:34:50,755
How's it feel?

537
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:55,400
Private Eyes, watching you,

538
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,680
watching your every move, baby.

539
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:02,588
Private eyes, Veronica Mars.

540
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,319
Oops.

541
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:13,068
Now what are we supposed to do?

542
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:15,950
Sabrina, give me a little more credit.

543
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:19,693
Vinnie, did you get that- What are you doing?

544
00:35:19,808 --> 00:35:22,342
Did you bring the mints? We need to get rid of that K-car.

545
00:35:22,408 --> 00:35:24,845
Call Gary and have him tow it. Get Jim on the horn.

546
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:27,139
You wanna pizza? You just ate.

547
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,517
Ma, it's j-it's business.

548
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,381
What?

549
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:32,388
Sabrina, I know who did it.

550
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:35,551
My son never had a fair chance.

551
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:39,561
I didn't give him the same advantages as the kids he has to compete with.

552
00:35:39,642 --> 00:35:42,627
You want us to believe getting a private eye

553
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,527
to harass my daughter is acceptable just because we happen to have money?

554
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:49,784
But my son didn't have anything to do with this.

555
00:35:50,372 --> 00:35:53,057
He's worked so hard and he deserves-

556
00:35:53,149 --> 00:35:56,087
All right, look. Well, it just seems like a mess.

557
00:35:56,182 --> 00:36:00,350
But, uh, under the circumstances, assuming that Hamilton and Sabrina

558
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:06,400
finish the year one-two, we are willing to split the scholarship this year.

559
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:09,327
I mean, if that's acceptable to the two of you.

560
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:17,085
No. The honour of Valedictorian belongs to my daughter.

561
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:18,759
And so does that scholarship.

562
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:20,306
Mrs Fuller, please.

563
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:23,248
There's one agreement I'm prepared to make.

564
00:36:23,822 --> 00:36:27,904
This young man will remove himself from the Valedictorian race

565
00:36:28,778 --> 00:36:30,293
and we won't press charges.

566
00:36:30,366 --> 00:36:33,156
Mrs Fuller, is that the only solution that you would consider?

567
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:36,284
- Can we- 
- Naw, I'll do it.

568
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,443
What the hell?

569
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:45,717
Hamilton, no.

570
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,828
Hamilton, this is ridiculous. They can't force you to do this.

571
00:36:50,386 --> 00:36:51,445
They just did.

572
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:52,813
Come on, Dad.

573
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:56,043
Hamilton?

574
00:36:58,148 --> 00:36:59,560
I'm so sorry.

575
00:37:00,057 --> 00:37:01,255
Ah, it's not your fault.

576
00:37:01,782 --> 00:37:02,903
What are you going to do now?

577
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:06,443
You know, work two jobs, take out loans. State school.

578
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:09,017
Twenty years from now, she'll be working for me.

579
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,331
And Oxford?

580
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,666
Proust is still Proust.

581
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,187
Even at UCLA.

582
00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:23,999
Life is fundamentally unfair.

583
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,362
It takes real talent to make unfair seem cool.

584
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:32,273
Hamilton Cho. Proof that kids love their dads, no matter how badly they screw up.

585
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:36,732
It's the exact kind of love I'm banking on from Amelia DeLongpre.

586
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:44,903
Excuse me.

587
00:37:45,283 --> 00:37:47,648
Listen, do you happen to have a cell phone on you?

588
00:37:47,822 --> 00:37:49,194
I gotta call Triple A.

589
00:37:49,277 --> 00:37:50,239
- Hello? 
- Veronica.

590
00:37:50,306 --> 00:37:52,057
- Hey, Amelia. 
- The papers came.

591
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:56,183
Oh, thank god. I'll be right by to make copies. How are you holding up?

592
00:37:56,562 --> 00:37:59,307
Tired of trying to concentrate on Plato and,

593
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:02,973
all I can think about is what I'm gonna say to my dad when I finally see him.

594
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,389
Oh, it's my boyfriend. See you soon.

595
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:08,215
Hey, sweetie.

596
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,479
Miss DeLongpre? Don't hang up.

597
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:12,179
My name is Clarence Wiedman.

598
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:15,230
The woman you're dealing with isn't who she says she is.

599
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:21,501
Dad, we've got it. Amelia has the settlement papers at her hotel.

600
00:38:21,558 --> 00:38:23,248
Good work, honey. Let's go.

601
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:45,330
As it turns out, I won't be needing your services, Keith.

602
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:46,192
Where is she?

603
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:47,384
Gone.

604
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,459
You took her?

605
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,702
She took herself.

606
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:53,686
Miss DeLongpre was particularly upset with you, Miss Mars,

607
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:56,431
for failing to mention her father's declining health.

608
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:57,562
Let's go, honey.

609
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,433
Where?

610
00:38:58,576 --> 00:39:01,182
Where would you go if you had your own Swiss bank account?

611
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:04,597
Thank you for bringing Amelia to Neptune, Miss Mars.

612
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,416
She just finalised her father's settlement with Kane Software.

613
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:20,332
What do you do when the best chance you've had at cracking the case,

614
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:26,132
packs up her suitcase and heads to Biarritz or St Tropez or wherever rich people disappear to?

615
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:29,757
Oh, hey honey, what are you doing on the floor in the corner?

616
00:39:29,844 --> 00:39:31,943
- Dad, I- 
- Well, don't sit on the floor.

617
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:33,674
Take the chair.

618
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:38,748
I changed the combination on this thing, you know.

619
00:39:41,723 --> 00:39:46,034
41-54-17.

620
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:51,333
Random numbers? Just like you said.

621
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:54,677
415 and 417. Flight numbers.

622
00:39:54,779 --> 00:39:56,622
Our honeymoon, your mom and I.

623
00:39:57,298 --> 00:39:59,376
I never can remember the random ones.

624
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,693
Obviously, Jake and Celeste lied about their alibis

625
00:40:09,797 --> 00:40:14,779
but what made you think they were involved in covering up Lilly's death.

626
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:19,920
When the call came in that Lilly had been found, I was the first one at the scene.

627
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:25,551
How long had you two been home before you discovered her body.

628
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:32,739
Five minutes, um, ten, maybe.

629
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:38,162
I knew the kids were home so I decided

630
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,330
to check for them out at the pool

631
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:46,235
and that's, um, that's when I found…

632
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:54,311
and that's when I, uh, that's when I found… oh.

633
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:01,406
And where was Duncan at that moment?

634
00:41:03,566 --> 00:41:05,478
He was-he was showering.

635
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:10,710
He, uh, beat us home but he hadn't gone out to the pool.

636
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:25,552
You doing some laundry?

637
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:32,378
The Kanes had two full-time housekeepers.

638
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:35,973
My guess, they hadn't done their own laundry in a very long time

639
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:39,290
so give me one good reason why they would start a load of laundry

640
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:41,891
the night they found their daughter bludgeoned to death.

641
00:41:42,214 --> 00:41:47,220
Honey, it was a soccer uniform I found in the dryer.

642
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:50,770
Duncan and Lilly were so different.

643
00:41:50,872 --> 00:41:54,225
They didn't always like each other, but they always loved each other.

644
00:41:54,302 --> 00:41:55,745
He never would have hurt her.

645
00:41:55,925 --> 00:42:00,313
But what if emotional turmoil, the same kind that drove him to attack his father,

646
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:03,211
turned Duncan into someone else entirely.

647
00:42:05,153 --> 00:42:06,708
You're blocking my sun.

648
