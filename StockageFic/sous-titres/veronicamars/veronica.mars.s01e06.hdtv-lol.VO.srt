1
00:00:00,246 --> 00:00:02,113
Previously on Veronica Mars…

2
00:00:02,181 --> 00:00:04,775
It's been a year since my best friend Lilly Kane was murdered.

3
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:08,416
The Neptune Sheriff's Department has apprehended Abel Koontz… Shoes and a backpack…

4
00:00:08,477 --> 00:00:12,190
The Lilly Kane murder file. Dad still hasn't given up on the case.

5
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:14,021
We all lost Lilly and we all miss her.

6
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,064
Duncan Kane. He used to be my boyfriend.

7
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:18,374
I just want to see him passionate about something.

8
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,360
And let's not forget Logan Echolls.

9
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:24,600
Every school has an obligatory psychotic jackass. He's ours.

10
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:28,450
You think you're this big outsider, push comes to shove, you're still one of them.

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,280
You still think like one of them.

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,070
Here folks is the house of Aaron Echolls.

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,030
Quite a show, huh?

14
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:45,767
Don't you people have lives?

15
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:49,145
You don't see me poking around your trailer park, do you?

16
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:50,755
Hey, uh, uh, are you the son?

17
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:55,265
I'm the guy telling you to get back on the bus and get out of my driveway.

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,285
Logan! Come back in the house, honey.

19
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:10,312
Hey, you guys are out early.

20
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:12,053
Here.

21
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,665
Hey Logan. Come here.

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,370
Get a few shots with my son, huh?

23
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:24,360
There you go.

24
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:25,938
Smile, Logan.

25
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,509
Don't forget these folks pay for all of this, huh?

26
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:33,956
Thanks, Dad.

27
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:37,833
You know I polled the rest of the soccer team? None of them want to see my junk.

28
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:39,501
Well, now you're covered.

29
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,772
Oh, you didn't tell me that elections were this week. You should run.

30
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:48,205
I think it would be a very impressive line on your college applications.

31
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:52,000
Please Dad. All they do is sell candy and argue about prom decorations.

32
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:53,407
Right, that's all they do now.

33
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:55,364
Until the reign of Kane.

34
00:01:56,542 --> 00:02:00,197
Dear god! May no one have just heard him say reign of Kane.

35
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:04,651
So, my dad wants to take me to the San Diego Zoo this weekend.

36
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:06,371
Aw, man, I love the zoo.

37
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:09,182
Everyone gets all excited about the monkey house.

38
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,046
I'm a big cat man myself.

39
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:13,790
My dad's gone a little nutty with all these father-daughter days.

40
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,531
Yeah, see me on the other hand,

41
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:17,743
would love to go to the zoo with my dad.

42
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:20,657
- Wallace, don't… 
- But he's dead, so.

43
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,948
Okay. I hate myself. Are you happy?

44
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,876
Yo! Man! Over here.

45
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,432
Keep the change.

46
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,293
You're not allowed delivery.

47
00:02:39,423 --> 00:02:41,633
And you're not allowed to breathe my air.

48
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:44,906
Go. Shoo. Return to Xanadu.

49
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:52,650
Wanda Varner just had her food delivered.

50
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:54,802
And that's wrong how?

51
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:57,354
She doesn't have any Pirate Points.

52
00:02:57,472 --> 00:03:00,874
Oh, I see. You're new.

53
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:02,665
I am.

54
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:06,260
Pirate points are earned by being a contributing member of the school.

55
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,363
You get them for being in student council, for sports…

56
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:09,993
Cheerleading?

57
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,447
Is a sport.

58
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:14,810
Oh, Mr Clemmons!

59
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:20,659
Mr Clemmons. Wanda Varner ordered in Chinese food.

60
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:28,677
Wanda, I know you know the rules.

61
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,334
If you'd like the privilege of having your lunch delivered,

62
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,705
why don't you get more involved here at Neptune.

63
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,278
In the meantime, I gonna have to confiscate your food.

64
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:47,723
- Oh, you little bitch! 
- Oh, really?

65
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,897
Wanda! Be so kind as to follow me to my office.

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,654
Who is that girl?

67
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:02,137
That? Is Wanda Varner.

68
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:06,222
Used to be in pep squad together.

69
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:08,091
You two seem less peppy.

70
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:15,910
Hmm, all out, huh?

71
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:24,282
Tough day?

72
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,856
That ain't the half of it.

73
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:30,246
See, this dame walks in and you should'a seen the getaway sticks on her.

74
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:32,463
Says something's hinky with her old man.

75
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:33,987
D'ya put the screws to him?

76
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,768
You ain't kidding. He sang like a canary.

77
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,282
Well, you're in luck, Philip Marlowe

78
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:43,051
because it's desert for dinner tonight and I've got a whole sundae thing set up here.

79
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:47,391
You know if Child Services finds out about this, they will take you away.

80
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,225
Well, that's a risk I'm willing to take.

81
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:52,697
Honey. Shouldn't we try something at the base of the food pyramid,

82
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:54,559
you know, fruits and vegetables?

83
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,096
What is that?

84
00:04:57,926 --> 00:04:59,785
A maraschino cherry?

85
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,764
The Lilly Kane murder case took an unexpected turn this morning

86
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:15,302
as convicted killer Abel Koontz fired his public appointed legal council.

87
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:18,420
Forfeiting further appeals, the defendant is scheduled to die

88
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:22,541
by lethal injection as early as next year… And, coming up-

89
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,191
Why did he do that?

90
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:27,876
Guess he's ready to die.

91
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:30,513
Well, what are you going to do about it? You don't believe he's guilty…

92
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:31,927
I hate to break it to you, honey.

93
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:34,466
But nobody in Neptune cares what I believe in.

94
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,185
They didn't care when I was Sheriff, they sure as hell don't care now.

95
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:39,693
This town's gonna have to find another conspiracy nut.

96
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,843
Check you out, Veronica Mars.

97
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:54,471
You're like a rocker chick now.

98
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:58,120
You and I? We'd have a lot of fun together… yeah…

99
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,886
if, um, you know, if I wasn't dead and stuff.

100
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:02,027
Why  are you here?

101
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:04,296
Don't you watch any horror movies?

102
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:10,895
My soul is doomed to walk the earth until justice has been served.

103
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:11,757
Really?

104
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:16,470
Yeah, that, and, as kind of a side project, I dispense fashion advice.

105
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:18,949
Did Koontz do it?

106
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,313
Wish I could tell ya.

107
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:23,475
Why would he have wanted to kill you?

108
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,916
Honestly. I was awesome, right?

109
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:29,691
I miss you, Lilly.

110
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:42,717
So  let's all get out there and cheer on our teams in the last game of the regular season.

111
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:46,858
Morning, Veronica. I was thinking maybe you'd be interested

112
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,197
in covering the election for the student newspaper.

113
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,185
Sure. I'll write it up this afternoon.

114
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,285
The election's tomorrow.

115
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:53,903
And I can already see the headline.

116
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:57,818
Brown-nosing, resume-packer wins in a landslide.

117
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:00,759
Maybe you wanna dig a little bit deeper.

118
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:01,768
I'll take it.

119
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:05,191
…This morning, we'll be hearing from our first hopeful for the office of President,

120
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:06,928
sophomore Wanda Varner.

121
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:11,593
I'm Wanda Varner and I'm running for the office of student council president.

122
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,480
Let's be honest. Student government doesn't do jack.

123
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:16,830
I'm here to promise you real change.

124
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:23,410
If elected, I promise to abolish the unfair and elitist Pirate Points programme for good.

125
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:26,268
God bless you and God bless America.

126
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:39,579
Hey dude. Can she do that?

127
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:43,286
Student council giveth, student council taketh away.

128
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:47,689
No, we're not giving up those points, man, you gotta run.

129
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,987
Actually, I don't.

130
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,390
Hey Wanda, check it out.

131
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:02,917
Killer. Thanks.

132
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:07,734
One of your campaign staff?

133
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:09,194
I'm all about grass roots.

134
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:11,375
How do you account for your sudden popularity?

135
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:15,057
Isn't it obvious? It's class warfare, the haves versus the have-nots.

136
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:17,416
You more than anyone at school should understand that.

137
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:20,144
But it's more quotable if you say it out loud.

138
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:24,144
Okay. The rich kids, they run things around here.

139
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,064
They're the minority and they're corrupt.

140
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:27,180
They get away with murder.

141
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,322
Hey, give 'em hell, Wanda!

142
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,011
You give 'em hell, Rodney!

143
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:34,380
Pirate Points is just another way they reward themselves for so swell.

144
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,330
They have all the power, we're the disenfranchised but only because we let ourselves be.

145
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,890
It's time to take action!

146
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,530
How was that? Was I quotable?

147
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,760
Yeah, I think I can find something there.

148
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,297
Hey! Hook me up with a beverage, huh?

149
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:09,278
And what goes with an icy, cold beverage?

150
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,222
A nice clean windshield.

151
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,604
No, man you don't have to do that.

152
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,504
The car was just professionally detailed.

153
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:18,646
Ah, they got a lot of nerve calling themselves professionals.

154
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:20,998
Look at that.

155
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:23,332
They just move the dirt around.

156
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,003
Man, A for effort but, uh, you're not getting paid for it.

157
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:29,184
I don't remember asking.

158
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:40,536
Hey, what about him?

159
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:43,403
Pretty well fed for a bum.

160
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:46,613
Hey, you army?

161
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:49,788
Hell, no. United States Marine Corps.

162
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,873
That's even better, huh.

163
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:54,625
What are you? About 240?

164
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:57,437
Uh, in my prime.

165
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:58,251
Yeah?

166
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:03,242
Hey, I'm, uh, I'm putting together a little amateur boxing night.

167
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,438
If you're interested.

168
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,115
What, you want me to fight?

169
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:12,582
No, man. I want you to win.

170
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:15,117
What you'd think that you'd just come in here and buy me like that?

171
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:16,197
Is that how it is?

172
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:18,527
Yeah, that's exactly how it is. I think we're on the same page.

173
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:19,741
Get out of my face.

174
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:22,515
Before I beat your ass down for free.

175
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,037
All right, you suit yourself.

176
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,819
Chhu-chhu. You have a nice day.

177
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:36,605
…And in conclusion, I promise to uphold the duties of presidency

178
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:39,464
to the utmost of my ability. Thank you.

179
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,936
Wanda's gonna blow this chick out of the water.

180
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:45,601
You can kiss your precious Pirate Points goodbye.

181
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,681
Duncan Kane.

182
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:48,909
A natural leader.

183
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:50,521
What?

184
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,233
Two time All League Soccer.

185
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:54,602
Editor of the Neptune Navigator.

186
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,126
Three point nine two four grade point average.

187
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:00,987
National Honour Society.

188
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:05,570
National Merit semi-finalist and all around, righteous dude.

189
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:07,874
Hi. I'm Aaron Echolls.

190
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:11,780
And I've known Duncan Kane for a long time. He's the real deal.

191
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,781
Duncan Kane for student body President.

192
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:15,861
That's my dad.

193
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:18,738
All right!

194
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:24,688
That's the last of the five candidates.

195
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,920
Good luck, Duncan.

196
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:35,159
Mark the letter of the corresponding candidate.

197
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:37,212
Only one bubble will be counted.

198
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:39,490
If none of the candidates receive a majority

199
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:43,085
the top two will be entered in a runoff election.

200
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,490
Please,  whatever you do, just don't vote for me.

201
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:48,930
Did you hear that folks? He's humble to boot.

202
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:51,235
God! This guy.

203
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:57,481
If Lilly's ghost is going to haunt me until justice has been served,

204
00:11:57,544 --> 00:11:59,376
then I better get my ass in gear.

205
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,626
Where to begin?

206
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:02,755
How about the obvious?

207
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:07,317
Abel Koontz was found with Lilly's backpack and shoes in his possession.

208
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:09,371
He gave a confession on the spot.

209
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:14,469
But Dad was convinced that the mystery led back to the most respected family in Neptune.

210
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:18,126
The three people that were at the scene of the crime before he arrived.

211
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:20,824
Jake Kane, beloved billionaire,

212
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:23,762
Celeste Kane, renowned philanthropist…

213
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:31,248
...and Duncan.

214
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:34,648
Each of the Kanes alibis was airtight.

215
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:38,221
That is, until a traffic ticket proved that Lilly was still alive

216
00:12:38,294 --> 00:12:40,971
hours after the coroner's official time of death.

217
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,432
I don't know what I'm looking for.

218
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,898
But if there are any clues as to who really killed Lilly,

219
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:52,046
then they're in Dad's safe.

220
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:01,385
Arrest record, evidence log, autopsy report.

221
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:04,011
How many times to I have to look at this stuff.

222
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:07,017
Until it starts making sense.

223
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:12,741
All right, all right! It's time for the main event.

224
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:23,432
Gentlemen! In the red corner hailing from Balfour Port is Mighty Mike.

225
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:31,470
And in the blue corner, the hometown hero…

226
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,344
What's your name?

227
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:35,264
Robbo Roth.

228
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:37,604
Robbo Roth!

229
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:45,459
All right, gentlemen, I want a clean fight. Go!

230
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:57,398
Where did this come from?

231
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:11,581
It's impossible!

232
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,875
- Hey. 
- Hey, Dad.

233
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,359
In a way, it's a little sad.

234
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,797
You know, the end of an era.

235
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:46,320
Wanda wins and no more Pirate Points.

236
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:48,230
No more lunch delivery.

237
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:52,434
Attention students. The results of the election have been tabulated.

238
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:56,095
There will be no runoff votes in any of the races.

239
00:14:56,506 --> 00:14:57,261
Thank god.

240
00:14:57,365 --> 00:15:01,210
The winner in the office of secretary, Bryan Gibson.

241
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:03,724
Vice President, Katie Keenan.

242
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:05,970
And it gives me great pleasure to announce,

243
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:12,049
the 2004-2005 SCA President, Duncan Kane.

244
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,454
That's how it's done!

245
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,301
That's a steaming crock, Clemmons.

246
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:26,365
There's no way Duncan Kane could have carried half the student body.

247
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:28,719
Now I've got a story.

248
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,787
Mrs Donaldson, did you get my message?

249
00:15:38,402 --> 00:15:40,054
About inspecting the ballots.

250
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:41,591
And?

251
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,049
My short answer? No.

252
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,346
My long answer would be a speech about being a gracious loser

253
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,071
and about how just because you don't like the outcome,

254
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,251
doesn't mean you can cry foul.

255
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:56,997
The Student Charter says it is possible to lodge a formal protest.

256
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,185
Which this is not.

257
00:15:58,354 --> 00:16:02,368
And if you had continued to read article 15 concerning student council elections;

258
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:04,735
you would know that once the votes have been certified,

259
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:09,501
a faculty sponsor must approve any request for a recount.

260
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,847
That's it? So I just need another teacher to rubberstamp this?

261
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,284
I think it's really cool that you're doing this.

262
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:18,947
Oh, I'm happy to help, Veronica.

263
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:23,385
I just find it difficult to believe that someone would try and tamper with the student council election.

264
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,153
Well, you're new.

265
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:28,665
No one will let me forget it.

266
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:32,960
All I'm saying is I admire your enthusiasm just don't let it get in the way of-

267
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,399
Fair and balanced, that's me.

268
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,635
As promised, one faculty sponsor.

269
00:16:41,905 --> 00:16:44,639
I'd like to speak with Ms Dent for a moment please.

270
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,197
I can't believe you'd let her rope you into this.

271
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:53,297
I'm sorry?

272
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:57,900
Look, Mallory. I've never heard of anything like this happening in a student election.

273
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:01,080
Is there really any harm in Veronica double checking the votes.

274
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,540
Well that's not the point.

275
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:04,982
She's manipulating you.

276
00:17:05,294 --> 00:17:09,185
And I'd like to give you the chance to reconsider.

277
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,579
I tell my students to be dogged. I tell them to follow hunches.

278
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:13,603
All great.

279
00:17:14,203 --> 00:17:16,942
Certainly not telling you how to teach your class.

280
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:20,578
But this is a student elections and, um,

281
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:24,381
I'm just suggesting that you let this go.

282
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:25,656
For your own good.

283
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:31,780
I've signed the form, the request is official.

284
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,317
We'll see those ballots now.

285
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:51,533
- What'd you get? 
- Duncan still wins with 743 votes.

286
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:54,093
How many times are we going to run it?

287
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,850
No sign of anyone erasing ballots. No ballots missing.

288
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:02,239
Hey. Student 43059.

289
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:04,912
Who the hell is candidate E and why did you vote for her?

290
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:06,775
You think I'm not voting for the sister?

291
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:11,276
And for what possible reason do you have my student ID number memorised?

292
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:16,047
You can toss those ballots in the recycle bin when you're done uncovering corruption.

293
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:22,882
What?

294
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:23,762
What is it?

295
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:28,544
Well if "Wanda rulez" why'd you vote for Duncan, you head case?

296
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:32,565
I wanna find out who this kid is and what art room he voted in.

297
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:35,161
Yeah, and I want a statue of myself in the main lobby,

298
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:37,571
holding a musket, staring down danger.

299
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,783
Since we're talking about stuff we want.

300
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,333
P lease?

301
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:43,691
How hard was that?

302
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:55,430
Kevin Carney. He's got art first period.

303
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:35,172
Well you saw the voting cards yourself. You certified the count.

304
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:37,001
There's nothing left to argue, it's over.

305
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:38,382
Someone cheated.

306
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,078
How?

307
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:41,531
There were two sets of ballot instructions.

308
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:43,815
That simply doesn't make any sense.

309
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,961
Yes, it does. It makes perfect sense.

310
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:50,880
The classes heavily populated with 09er kids got the candidates names in the correct order.

311
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:54,726
The classes that Wanda would have carried - band, autoshop, art -

312
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,549
got a list with the candidates names reversed.

313
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:59,867
When those students thought they were voting for Wanda,

314
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:02,144
they actually gave their votes to Duncan.

315
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,361
You don't really expect us to believe this.

316
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:06,912
We've invited the students from first period art.

317
00:20:06,982 --> 00:20:09,124
We could always ask them to review their ballots.

318
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:10,649
Hold on.

319
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:15,938
Veronica. Exactly who do you accuse of doing this?

320
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:18,125
I'm not accusing anybody.

321
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:21,760
Then again it wouldn't be hard to find out whose code was punched

322
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,121
into the copier that made the ballot instructions.

323
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:27,328
I had my student aide make them.

324
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,989
And that would be who?

325
00:20:32,304 --> 00:20:33,787
Madison Sinclair.

326
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,870
Well there you go.

327
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,078
Mystery solved.

328
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:42,855
Attention students.

329
00:20:43,448 --> 00:20:44,999
May I have your attention please?

330
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:51,057
I regret to inform you that there has been a mistake in tabulating the election results.

331
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:54,196
There will be a runoff election Thursday

332
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:57,897
between Wanda Varner and Duncan Kane.

333
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:02,203
Hi Madison. I heard you lost your student aide gig and your student council spot.

334
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,627
If I may be so bold as to make a recommendation,

335
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:09,709
on Fridays, ee-uh, Sloppy Joes are your best bet.

336
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,755
I've been waiting for a moment alone to take a closer look at the photo

337
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:21,143
of Lilly's bedroom on the night of her murder.

338
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:24,649
The last thing I need is Dad popping his head in and discovering

339
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,096
that I've been poaching from his safe.

340
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,765
All right, when do I get to do yours?

341
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,119
Finishing touches.

342
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,039
Duncan?

343
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,430
Oh, yeah, now that's just creepy.

344
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,161
Action News. This is Hank.

345
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:14,217
Hey. I'm a journalism student from Neptune High

346
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:17,084
and I'm doing a follow up story on Abel Koontz.

347
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:21,215
I'm wondering if you could send me a copy of the piece you did on Koontz a couple days ago.

348
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,342
You know your mother

349
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:38,476
and your mother's personal trainer don't need to know anything about this.

350
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:39,268
Agreed.

351
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:42,664
What do you say we, uh, stop on the way home,

352
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:46,201
knock out some, uh, campaign bumper stickers.

353
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,809
When you say we, you mean…

354
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:50,364
I mean, we go and talk to some of my graphics guys.

355
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:52,647
Oh, come on, Dunc.

356
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:55,525
Look what you already accomplished and you weren't even trying.

357
00:22:56,048 --> 00:23:00,307
Imagine what you'd be capable of if you just put your heart into it.

358
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:02,094
Cue inspirational music here.

359
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:04,551
I'm so tired of your cynicism.

360
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:07,834
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry, I mean I know you think that this election

361
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,286
is some sort of stepping stone on my way to the White House-

362
00:23:10,353 --> 00:23:14,987
Well I got news for ya. I'm not concerned about this election, I just want to see you engaged.

363
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:17,295
Enthusiastic about something.

364
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:24,345
Look. Your happiness. Is all I've ever wanted.

365
00:23:33,216 --> 00:23:38,901
What if I find happiness living in a grass hut, carving driftwood figurines for tourists?

366
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:42,138
I feel confident you have grander ambitions than that.

367
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:45,927
But, if you're, uh, happy and committed to driftwood carving,

368
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:48,395
be the best driftwood carver you can be.

369
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:51,032
After you've graduated from Stamford,

370
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:52,623
Law School,

371
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,949
suma cum laudi.

372
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:57,922
See that! You're already smiling.

373
00:24:23,014 --> 00:24:25,797
I think the opposing campaign just went negative.

374
00:24:26,728 --> 00:24:28,428
I'm gonna kill whoever did this!

375
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,624
They're just posters. You still own the message.

376
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:32,068
They're not just posters.

377
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,337
They spray painted "Narc" on the hood of my car.

378
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:39,708
You know they only chose the word "narc" because it would hit closest to home with your constituency.

379
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,331
I shouldn't find that comforting.

380
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:42,801
But I do.

381
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,640
Well, why don't you come over tonight and we'll make new posters.

382
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:48,903
And I'll get some puppy paint and an Avril Lavigne CD

383
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,977
and it'll be just like our pep squad days.

384
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:52,694
Awesome.

385
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:56,798
Okay, don't do that.

386
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:06,189
Bravo, Logan. It's a new low. And just when the critics were having some doubts.

387
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:11,872
Must be talking about your, uh, narc friend, W-W-W-Wanda.

388
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:16,376
Well isn't it time that you found another bad guy.

389
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:22,111
Look, I just don't… have time to be responsible

390
00:25:22,174 --> 00:25:24,826
for every little thing that goes wrong in your life.

391
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:37,251
So, was it your idea or did you just play it your usual way?

392
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:40,084
What's my usual way?

393
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,035
Oh, you know, Duncan. You don't initiate trouble.

394
00:25:44,348 --> 00:25:47,037
You don't initiate much of anything anymore.

395
00:25:47,738 --> 00:25:49,279
Don't stop there, Veronica.

396
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:50,798
Say it.

397
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:53,595
What's my usual way?

398
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:57,552
You stand idly by.

399
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,267
Gotta check out "The Smoking Gun" website.

400
00:26:06,804 --> 00:26:09,835
Excuse me, we're in the middle of a class here.

401
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:12,262
Dude, you're famous.

402
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:39,710
So, what's the story with you and Weevil?

403
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:40,806
Weevil?

404
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,356
There's no story. Why?

405
00:26:43,503 --> 00:26:47,678
No reason. Just thought you might have shared your friend Lilly's bad boy thing.

406
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,012
But I guess I was wrong.

407
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:51,272
Lilly had more of a boy thing.

408
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:54,401
Are you sure? Lilly and Weevil never, because I heard-

409
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,230
Never!

410
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,458
Okay.

411
00:26:57,472 --> 00:26:59,863
So. Is this one any good?

412
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,175
Umm, I, uh, I don't know, I haven't read it.

413
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:07,542
Yeah. Most of these college guys are pretty unreadable.

414
00:27:08,408 --> 00:27:12,992
So what's your first choice? Ivy? Baby Ivys? Seven Sisters? Liberal Arts? East Coast?

415
00:27:13,488 --> 00:27:16,191
It gives me a panic attack to just think about it.

416
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:18,813
Yeah. I really want to go to Williams.

417
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:21,644
Now all I have to do is rob a bank and ace the SATs.

418
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:23,779
I think we're in the same boat.

419
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:31,674
Hey, Dad.

420
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:35,371
What are you doing up?

421
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:37,906
I couldn't sleep.

422
00:27:39,656 --> 00:27:41,832
What with the phone ringing every five minutes.

423
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:46,214
"Access Hollywood", "Entertainment Tonight", "E".

424
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,415
Any guesses what they wanted to talk about?

425
00:27:51,524 --> 00:27:52,687
My charity work?

426
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:53,690
No.

427
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:55,523
My latest Christmas movie?

428
00:27:57,018 --> 00:27:57,617
No.

429
00:27:58,995 --> 00:28:02,031
They wanted to talk about my son's latest opus.

430
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,882
"Skid Row Boxing".

431
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,894
Look, Dad, I, uh… I didn't know what-

432
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:14,161
I have to say that your performance was really impressive.

433
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,130
The way you play the ungrateful son determined to humiliate his father was utterly impressive.

434
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:23,689
Do you have any idea what you just cost this family?

435
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:26,315
Of course you don't. You never had to work for anything in your life.

436
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:30,994
Well, tomorrow,

437
00:28:31,686 --> 00:28:32,643
after school,

438
00:28:33,985 --> 00:28:36,627
you're going to get your first lesson in public relations.

439
00:28:38,201 --> 00:28:39,186
Logan.

440
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:43,498
Don't you ever embarrass me again.

441
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:57,260
Vote for Wanda.

442
00:29:02,553 --> 00:29:04,802
Weevil. Put one on the back of your bike?

443
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:06,988
Naw. I'm not going to vote for that narc.

444
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:07,885
Come on, Weevil.

445
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:11,571
You know better than to believe everything you hear at this school, that's just dirty politics.

446
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:13,434
You might want to explain that to Felix.

447
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:18,140
Somehow the Sheriff found out that all the "Welcome to Neptune" signs are hanging up in his bedroom,

448
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:20,366
a week after he hooks up with your girl Wanda.

449
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,760
Now how did that happen, huh?

450
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:24,673
Now homeboy's got four weekends of highway clean up.

451
00:29:31,581 --> 00:29:32,446
Hey, superstar.

452
00:29:32,998 --> 00:29:33,711
Are you nervous?

453
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:37,346
I'm so embarrassed but yes.

454
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,404
Well, I think we should celebrate this weekend. Win or lose.

455
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:42,598
I heard about this rave out in the desert.

456
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:45,527
And we can make it if we leave directly after school tomorrow.

457
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,907
Bitchin'. I'll tell my mom I'm spending the night at your place.

458
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:53,105
Do we need any… provisions?

459
00:29:53,197 --> 00:29:57,114
Provisions? With a capital E, absolutely.

460
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:58,589
But I know a guy.

461
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:01,435
Oh, jealous. Wish I knew a guy.

462
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:07,581
Here you go, Ms Dent.

463
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:13,790
We will be voting simultaneously this morning in order to prevent any confusion.

464
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,448
By now everyone should have their scantron ballots.

465
00:30:16,734 --> 00:30:18,192
All right. Here goes.

466
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:22,141
If you'd like to vote for Duncan Kane, mark "A"…

467
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:27,209
…and if you'd like to vote for Wanda Varner, mark "B".

468
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,592
Let's see.

469
00:30:28,847 --> 00:30:33,733
On the one hand, we have the hot cold ex-boyfriend and heir to the status quo.

470
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:39,529
On the other, the potentially duplicitous new friend and champion to the disenfranchised.

471
00:30:40,598 --> 00:30:44,469
Wanna hang out? And I'll impress you with my diving skills.

472
00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:49,553
Oh, did you hear that Becky Lacey is trying out for mascot?

473
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,171
Really.

474
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:55,338
Table's ready.

475
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,357
You know what, man?

476
00:30:59,686 --> 00:31:00,750
You're fine where you are.

477
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:03,557
Dick, here, can find his own spot.

478
00:31:17,505 --> 00:31:18,430
Yeah.

479
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,379
I know I'm late Marty.

480
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,185
Look, is this the closest homeless shelter you could find?

481
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:26,218
No. Never mind.

482
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:27,734
Are the cameras ready.

483
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:29,003
Good.

484
00:31:31,047 --> 00:31:31,875
All right.

485
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,202
Now this is how this is gonna work.

486
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,551
They're gonna get a few shots of you volunteering at the soup kitchen,

487
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,633
then I'm gonna join you for an interview with the TV crews, you got it?

488
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,836
What do you want me to tell them?

489
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:45,490
What do you think, Logan?

490
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,760
That you're sorry.

491
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,228
That you're bone-headed.

492
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:53,712
And that ya screwed up.

493
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:55,842
I'll take care of the rest.

494
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:01,873
Vince! What's happening?

495
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:06,436
Yeah, I got the script. I've seen better writing on cereal boxes.

496
00:32:07,323 --> 00:32:11,781
Oh, big deal. The man hasn't made a watchable movie since the seventies.

497
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,610
Are they gonna meet my quote?

498
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,310
Hot damn!

499
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,290
Son! How do you argue with eight figures?

500
00:32:20,392 --> 00:32:22,856
Ya can't. Can't be done.

501
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:26,655
Okay. Have 'em to draw up the contract.

502
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:29,056
Hey. It's Don King.

503
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:35,834
Hey, you find some sucker who's willing to make a bitch outta hisself for cash?

504
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:44,943
All right.

505
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,341
You ready to do this?

506
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:52,809
Yeah.

507
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,256
Thank you.

508
00:33:14,413 --> 00:33:15,357
Hey, thanks a lot.

509
00:33:15,504 --> 00:33:17,641
Mr Echolls, we're ready for you anytime.

510
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:19,058
Catch you guys later.

511
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:20,313
Logan!

512
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:24,798
Excuse me!

513
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:31,393
Uh, I just wanted to say that my father was not an educated man.

514
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:34,680
He dropped out of school after the eighth grade so he could go to work

515
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:36,744
in the new automotive plant in Pontiac, Michigan.

516
00:33:37,414 --> 00:33:39,708
And he once told me something that I'll never forget.

517
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:46,574
He said son, a good heart is worth all the heads in the world put together.

518
00:33:48,397 --> 00:33:51,802
Now my son here will be the first one to admit that he wasn't using his head.

519
00:33:53,016 --> 00:33:56,149
But I promise each and every one of you,

520
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:57,536
that this boy,

521
00:33:59,027 --> 00:34:00,947
this boy has a great heart.

522
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:15,360
Um. I know now that, uh, that what I did was wrong.

523
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:17,521
I'm really sorry.

524
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,858
I, uh, I only hope that one day I can live up to my dad's good example.

525
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:28,785
I love you.

526
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,230
Okay, look, uh, I know that you didn't want to make a big deal out of this

527
00:34:40,065 --> 00:34:44,611
but I'm just so proud of him that I, I can't keep it a secret.

528
00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:51,724
Dad told me on the way over that he's donating half a million dollars to the Neptune foodbank.

529
00:34:52,343 --> 00:34:53,863
Way to go, Dad.

530
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:14,177
Hey Veronica. Deputy wants to inspect your locker.

531
00:36:15,617 --> 00:36:18,933
You'd think I'd quit being surprised at finding a knife in my back.

532
00:36:24,008 --> 00:36:25,446
Ah, Veronica Mars.

533
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:26,428
We meet again.

534
00:36:26,527 --> 00:36:27,759
The Sheriff's Department has asked me-

535
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:30,939
I could just give you my locker combination, save us all a lot of trouble.

536
00:36:45,651 --> 00:36:46,340
Nothing.

537
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:47,748
There's a couple of suckers.

538
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:50,739
In the bag if you want one.

539
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:57,348
This is Mrs Donaldson, the student council advisor.

540
00:36:57,471 --> 00:37:01,296
I'm pleased to announce that the winner of the student council presidency is…

541
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:03,892
Duncan Kane.

542
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,057
Wanda!

543
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:24,617
I guess we're not going to that rave in the desert

544
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:27,025
but I do have a pretty good idea of where you can stick these.

545
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:28,979
- You don't understand. 
- You're right. I don't.

546
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:30,570
Why don't you explain it to me.

547
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,503
I got busted last year for possession.

548
00:37:32,578 --> 00:37:35,216
This was the only way that they would keep it off my record.

549
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:37,817
I'd never get into Williams with a drug charge on my file.

550
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:41,431
So you were willing to wreck my future to save your own.

551
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,795
Veronica! This wasn't just about getting into college.

552
00:37:48,912 --> 00:37:51,308
If I would have won, I would have done what I promised.

553
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:54,191
We would have changed the way things work around here.

554
00:37:56,797 --> 00:37:57,693
You know what?

555
00:37:58,038 --> 00:37:59,189
No hard feelings.

556
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,460
I didn't vote for you.

557
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:11,250
Well, it's been a crazy week, uh, but I am proud to introduce

558
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:14,840
your new student body president, Duncan Kane.

559
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:21,569
Thank you Mrs Donaldson.

560
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:25,669
And now, my first act as President,

561
00:38:25,884 --> 00:38:29,321
I would like to make sure that no one loses a single Pirate Point.

562
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:37,394
But you know what? In addition to varsity sports,

563
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,291
I would also like to make sure that students in band, students who make honour role,

564
00:38:43,395 --> 00:38:46,686
students who perform in school plays, that write for the school newspaper…

565
00:38:48,823 --> 00:38:54,516
Even students who excel in vocational trades should be eligible to earn Pirate Points.

566
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:58,012
And they should share in the benefits.

567
00:38:59,528 --> 00:39:02,665
Okay. So what kind of candy should we sell this year.

568
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:22,886
Dad changed the combination.

569
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,344
He knows.

570
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:32,562
- Package for you. 
- Oh great.

571
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:37,027
Something from Action News?

572
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:42,675
Oh, uh, nothing, a tape for a journalism project.

573
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:48,497
Just to compare and contrast TV news footage with, uh, local print coverage.

574
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:04,451
I'm lying. You know I'm lying.

575
00:40:05,434 --> 00:40:08,889
I don't want things to be like this between us anymore.

576
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:09,826
Like what?

577
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:13,390
Like our own game of spy vs spy.

578
00:40:15,735 --> 00:40:17,255
You know I was in the safe.

579
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:20,911
And I know you're still investigating Lilly's murder.

580
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:22,207
I was. I'm not anymore.

581
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:25,064
Why not? Dad, we're running out of time.

582
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:28,817
I used to think that solving the case was the key to our happiness.

583
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:32,897
Solve the case and my reputation is restored.

584
00:40:33,072 --> 00:40:35,279
Solve the case and your mom comes home.

585
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:38,416
Solve the case and you go back to being a normal teenage girl.

586
00:40:38,545 --> 00:40:40,056
So let's do it, let's solve the case-

587
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:45,652
Wait, Veronica. What I believe in now is that we make the most out of what we have here and now.

588
00:40:45,724 --> 00:40:48,902
I believe in going to the zoo with the person I love the most.

589
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:53,982
This isn't a school project.

590
00:40:54,597 --> 00:40:57,264
It's the footage of Abel Koontz's arrest.

591
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,203
And I need to show you something.

592
00:41:01,436 --> 00:41:05,558
This is an enlargement of a crime scene photo taken the night of Lilly's murder.

593
00:41:15,078 --> 00:41:19,746
The defendant is scheduled to die by lethal injection as early as next year.

594
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:28,204
What are those shoes doing in Abel Koontz's possession?

595
00:41:30,007 --> 00:41:31,313
Good question.

596
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:38,162
