1
00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:01,927
Previously in
Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:01,928 --> 00:00:04,127
If it isn't my predecessor and mentor.

3
00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:07,524
Are you doing anything special to mark the
one year anniversary of Lilly Kane's murder?

4
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:10,291
Tell me again how you solved
the crime. An anonymous tip.

5
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:13,633
Did anybody show up to collect
the reward? Do'ya find that strange?

6
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:14,617
Damn it!

7
00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:17,436
Wow. That's really criminal of you.

8
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:18,936
- I'm Veronica, by the way.
- Mac.

9
00:00:19,424 --> 00:00:22,199
I know who's responsible for scaring Mom away from Neptune.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,547
Clarence Wiedman. The man who took
surveillance photos of me.

11
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:28,038
So if Jake Kane is my biological father,

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,329
that information is going
to be worth millions.


13
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:32,475
Good morning.

14
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:35,941
Or not.

15
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:41,151
You don't go to the oceanside bars that
the college kids hang out at, do you?

16
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:45,740
I prefer the biker bar by the train
station. I get more attention there.

17
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:47,594
I'm kidding.

18
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:49,324
Why would you ask me that?

19
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:52,659
Twenty year old co-ed washe
up dead on the beach.

20
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,013
Scary.

21
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:57,674
Wait. Wasn't this your case?

22
00:00:57,675 --> 00:00:59,987
I thought they caught this guy
in Oakland two years ago.

23
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:01,292
Well, apparently they didn't.

24
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:05,350
Everyone wanted to believe the Oakland
strangler committed the Neptune crimes too.

25
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:08,163
It never quite fit.

26
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:11,615
Oh, but it was so important for
the mayor and the Chamber of Commerce

27
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,331
to put that scare behind us.

28
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:18,318
People are really freaking out
about this E-String Strangler.

29
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:21,078
My mom is scared to drive home alone.

30
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:24,968
I told her this time she can be
happy she's not the guy's type.

31
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:27,619
My dad barely let me out
of the house this morning.

32
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,426
I hear you do detective stuff for people.

33
00:01:29,427 --> 00:01:32,561
- I do favours for friends.
- I can pay.

34
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,586
Sit down, friend.
What can I do for you?

35
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:39,698
I was hoping that you could
find some dirt on my parents.

36
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,822
Why Jackson Douglas, I do declare!

37
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:45,419
You want me to dig up dirt on your own parents.

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,570
I need leverage.

39
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:50,692
They're crazy strict. They grounded me
for two months for smoking up in my room.

40
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,015
Apparently you've never spent time in a black woman's house.

41
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:54,825
Be glad you're still walking.

42
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:58,169
Yeah, well, they act like
they were always perfect.

43
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,345
And every little thing I do
wrong is catalogued

44
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:01,960
so they can rub my nose in it later.

45
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:03,419
Sure you can handle the truth?

46
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,528
The '70s and '80s were not
pretty decades for people.

47
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:08,964
- We've all seen the pictures.
- I can handle it.

48
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,515
Now as for the small
matter of compensation.

49
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:19,717
I love my parents.

50
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,513
All right. Come to my party.
No need to bring gifts.

51
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:29,889
Happy birthday to me.

52
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:34,372
The rite of fall.

53
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:36,973
Madison Sinclair's birthday.

54
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:40,667
Best party of the year and
I can't go because I'm grounded.

55
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,638
- Her parents must looove her.
- They really loved her,

56
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,254
they would've gotten the real Beatles.

57
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:53,026
Veronica Mars.

58
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:57,257
Is your daddy here, or is he busy
peeking in people's windows?

59
00:02:57,258 --> 00:03:00,814
You stop dressing up like Little Bo Peep,
he'll stop peeking.

60
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:01,948
Your father?

61
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,301
Deputy Lamb is here.

62
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:14,234
He's got the mayor with him.

63
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,368
Show him in.

64
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:20,105
Yeah, sure. I'll just have Rod Serling
wait out here on the couch.

65
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:22,798
The detective will see you now.

66
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:26,853
- It's been a long time, Keith.
- I know.

67
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:27,996
Good to see ya.

68
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:31,450
- I wish it were under better circumstances.
- Sit down.

69
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,482
Can I get anybody anything?

70
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:40,080
Water? Coffee?

71
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:41,874
A banana?

72
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:45,296
- We're good.
- Okay.

73
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,083
Just leaving.

74
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,767
So how can I help you gentlemen.

75
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:54,488
<i>You know the situation...</i>

76
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:14,868
Thank you Keith. Appreciate it.

77
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,129
See you tomorrow, Lamb.

78
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,631
Um-hmm. Can't wait.

79
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:24,407
What was that about? What's tomorrow?

80
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:27,236
The day I go back to work
at the sheriff's department.

81
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:00,883
<i>Season 1 - Episode 11
Silence of the Lamb</i>

82
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:03,718
You're going back to work
at the sheriff's department?

83
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:07,004
It's temporary. I'm just there to work
on the E-String Strangler case.

84
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:08,868
And you're teaming up with Lamb?

85
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:12,910
It's a bitter pill, I know but they're
paying me my normal hourly.

86
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,525
And Lamb agreed to this?
His head didn't explode?

87
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:16,875
The mayor didn't give him a choice.

88
00:05:17,446 --> 00:05:20,700
I'm the closest thing they have to
an E-String Strangler authority

89
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,474
and it's a big priority for the mayor.

90
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:27,889
A killer preying on partying college girls
tends to kill the Spring Break business.

91
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:30,423
So this is all about tourist revenue.

92
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:34,001
- God bless America.
- Well, whatever their motive,

93
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,614
I'm glad to be involved.

94
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,136
Hey, if you're working
at the Sheriff's office,

95
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,119
you'll have access to the Lilly Kane files.

96
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,742
We can finally get our hands on
that Crime Stoppers Hotline recording,

97
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,517
find out who the anonymous source was,
the one who fingered Abel Koontz.

98
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:48,651
Veronica, that won't be on my agenda.

99
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,664
Here are the highlights.

100
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:55,970
Your dad was busted trying
to buy an eight ball

101
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:58,541
from an undercover cop at
an Eagles concert in '74,

102
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,969
your mom had five speeding tickets
and a collision on her record

103
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,591
before she graduated high school.

104
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:08,700
I don't care what they say about you,
Veronica Mars. You rock.

105
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,172
Yes, I do.
I also take cash.

106
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,336
I hear you can dig up dirt on parents.

107
00:06:16,957 --> 00:06:18,026
The first two victims,

108
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:22,887
Katherine Wills, Andrea Sims were found
in 2001 and 2002 respectively.

109
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:25,088
They had certain shared characteristics.

110
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:29,956
Both were undergrads on break, both
were attractive social girls, both had...

111
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:32,419
- Hard partiers.
- ... both had high levels of
alcohol in their blood

112
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,754
- and both were abducted on Friday nights.
- Technically,

113
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:37,130
early Saturday morning from midnight

114
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,091
- to closing time.
- The bodies were found in the bay.

115
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:43,182
A single nickel-plated guitar
string tied around their necks.

116
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:47,971
The latest victim, Amy Polk,
was killed with the exact same MO.

117
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:49,807
So he kills them with the guitar strings?

118
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,385
- Naw, that's just...
- It's his signature. His mark.

119
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:55,085
The girls are asphyxiated.

120
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:58,189
The strangler thing came from
the press, it's a misnomer.

121
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:04,182
There's evidence that these women
have been held for 48 hours in a
contained space, basically suffocated.

122
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:06,463
The murders are reminiscent
of the Hillside Strangler case.

123
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:08,998
Except the Hillside Strangler
actually did strangle the girls.

124
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,811
Party girls, like ours.

125
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:12,713
Picked up outside of bars.

126
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:14,513
- Killer leaves his mark.
- Okay.

127
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:17,199
Okay, except for the asphyxiation,
the imprisonment,

128
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,218
the body disposal,
these cases have a lot in common.

129
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:23,838
What do we know about the killer?

130
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,705
He hates women, he craves
attention, he's a luuser.

131
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:31,288
The weekend killings suggest
the guy has a traditional job.

132
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:34,468
Amy Polk was found with wrist bands
from local bars on her wrist

133
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:37,264
and smudged ink on her palm that looked
like it could be a phone number.

134
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:39,586
Lab boys in LA are trying to decipher it.

135
00:07:39,587 --> 00:07:41,779
Imagine the poor sucker
waiting for that phone call.

136
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,636
Your mom sued her parent for
emancipation when she was sixteen
and then moved to Hollywood.

137
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:49,139
According to the Internet Movie Database,

138
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,724
she went on to play such roles
as "Trucker's girlfriend",

139
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:56,266
"Screaming maid" and
"Bi-curious room mate".

140
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:03,189
Your mother was married
in 1985 for 36 days.

141
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,996
- Shut up.
- To a pro-skier she met on Spring Break.

142
00:08:06,997 --> 00:08:11,032
They drove to Vegas, did it drive-through
style and she had it annulled.

143
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:15,276
And she calls me boy crazy.
You just made my gear.

144
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:20,705
- Hey.
- Hi, Mac.

145
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,253
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

146
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:24,227
Come on in.

147
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,786
It's a spiffy new Beetle
you're driving these days.

148
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:31,073
Yeah.

149
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:35,134
Well, the purity test was
probably my finest hour

150
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:37,334
but that's nothing compared
to what this could be.

151
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:39,826
It's time to think global and act local.

152
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,361
Okay, you're exposing parental
secrets for fifty bucks a pop.

153
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:51,080
We create this website, double the fee,

154
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,572
we have no overhead because
I've already bought the domain name.

155
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:59,392
With your sleuth prowess
and my programming skills,

156
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:03,543
I don't think it's an exaggeration to say
that we would rule the entire known universe.

157
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,008
I can barely handle school
and my cases as it is.

158
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:09,605
Think about it.
This isn't just a college fund.

159
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:11,665
Potentially this is our retirement fund.

160
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,678
I will definitely think about it.

161
00:09:19,913 --> 00:09:22,844
There is just one more think, about my
folks that I was wondering about.

162
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:27,174
You PIs have access to search engines that
would take me weeks to hack into, so...

163
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:31,733
- I mean I have cash.
- No. Gotcha. Keep your money.

164
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:33,660
It's a professional courtesy.

165
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:37,759
It's not that they're bad parents.
They just... don't get me.

166
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:42,013
They're nachos and NASCAR
people and I'm more...

167
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:45,513
- Falafels and Fellini?
- Exactly.

168
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:48,478
Your last name's Mackenzie, right?

169
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:52,971
Um-hmm, Natalie and Sam,
9715 Colony Place.

170
00:09:56,321 --> 00:09:58,430
- Mom is Natalie Franklin?
- Yep.

171
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,765
Oh, you had a birthday a couple of days ago.

172
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,519
Yeah, one more year
until I can leave home.

173
00:10:05,227 --> 00:10:06,491
Okay.

174
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:12,797
Sam's had a few tickets,
tax audit, nothing strange.

175
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:16,384
...huh, except that.

176
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:17,385
What?

177
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:19,626
According to this,

178
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:24,523
they won a million dollar lawsuit against
Neptune Memorial Hospital in '92.

179
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:29,614
- No way. That's got to be a mistake.
- Hello? Sleuth prowess.

180
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:33,054
Come on, they hate lawyers and
they never even go near the hospital.

181
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,720
You want me to look into it?

182
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:36,938
Yeah, I do.

183
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,599
Neptune isn't short on millionaires

184
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,739
but I figure a judgement that big against
the local hospital might have made the papers.

185
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:46,097
It's beginning to look like I'm wrong.

186
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,194
Hold the phone!

187
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:55,748
I was expecting something like
"Woman Accidentally Receives Pig Heart"

188
00:10:55,749 --> 00:11:00,725
but no, I have to find out the one thing
that can completely wreck Mac's life.

189
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:05,833
How do you live a normal life once you
find out you were switched at birth.

190
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:10,294
Hello Cleveland.

191
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,048
- "Spinal Tap".
- What?

192
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:18,108
The movie "Spinal Tap".
You've never seen "Spinal Tap"?

193
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:19,198
No.

194
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:21,550
That explains a lot.

195
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,085
Is there someone that actually works here?

196
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,676
Dawg, look like you need help.

197
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:43,828
He's waiting for you to throw your panties.

198
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,905
Can we lose the noise?

199
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:51,429
Noise!

200
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,828
All I hear are sound waves
woven into melodic poetry.

201
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:57,934
Hey!

202
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:01,699
We can do this here or down
at the sheriff's department.

203
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:16,417
So what's up? You lookin' for
a band to play the policeman's ball?

204
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,605
We're looking for a murderer.

205
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:22,902
Found this guitar string tied
around the neck of his last victim.

206
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:24,384
Is there anything special about it?

207
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:30,154
This exact string?

208
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:35,166
This is a triple nickel antioxidant special
order string we get for just one customer.

209
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:39,343
- A guy we call Devil Dave.
- Do you know where we can
find this Devil Dave?

210
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:42,324
- Devil Daaaave?
- Huh?

211
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:46,799
- Did you kill anyone this week?
- Uh-uh.

212
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,051
Your basic guitar string?

213
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:52,951
Same as any other string.

214
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:58,270
Betcha the criminals in town are shakin'
in their boots knowin' you're on the case.

215
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:01,748
- Mental note: put in a security system.
- Right.

216
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:05,631
So ya, ya think the killer's
a guitar player?

217
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:06,943
That is brilliant.

218
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:13,112
I think guitar players are a little too
busy nailin' women to strangle 'em. Ooow!

219
00:13:13,113 --> 00:13:16,195
Even the wannabes and losers living in Neptune who don't realize

220
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,862
if they haven't made it by the time they turn
thirty it's because they're not going to?

221
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,080
They're too busy?

222
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:22,939
Nice art work. Yours?

223
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,953
Guitar players,
the heroes of our modern age.

224
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:30,886
Strappin' on a guitar.

225
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:34,050
Does it get rid of feelings of inadequacy?

226
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:35,896
Does strappin' on a gun?

227
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:54,059
- Hey.
- Got a minute?

228
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:00,347
Ho, ho, ho.

229
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:07,365
Ryan, open that door

230
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:10,035
and you'll know pain like you've never
known in your pathetic little life.

231
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,842
Enjoy the peace.
Lasts about seven minutes tops.

232
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:21,553
Whoa. Who's your curator?

233
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:23,724
You like it? It's my own little cave.

234
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:28,090
Whenever I run out of space,
my dad just builds me more shelves.

235
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:29,689
Knock, knock.

236
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:32,243
You must be Veronica.

237
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:36,463
I wasn't sure if you were a normal eater
or one of those freakball vegans, like Cindy.

238
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:40,109
Uh, more normal than freakball, thanks.

239
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,859
Okay, thanks Mom.

240
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:45,394
Okay.

241
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:50,494
Cindy?

242
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,246
It won out over Barbie.

243
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:57,505
So what did you find out?

244
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,335
Has to be pretty big for you
to come deliver it in person.

245
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:07,434
Suspense effectively built.

246
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:09,324
Hit me.

247
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,145
Dad always says, this is the job.

248
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:15,895
Telling people stuff they might
not want to know

249
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:18,148
or might be better off not knowing.

250
00:15:21,482 --> 00:15:23,568
It is big, like,

251
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:28,285
life-altering big, so you should really
think about if you want to hear it

252
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:32,193
or if you'd rather just forget it
and go on with your life.

253
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:37,320
- And may I suggest option B.
- I'm adopted, aren't I?

254
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:40,598
Go ahead and tell me,
it would explain a lot.

255
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:44,396
Well, yes and no, um,

256
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:48,244
the Mackenzies aren't
your biological parents.

257
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:50,275
So what does that mean.

258
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,863
You were sent home from the hospital
with the wrong family.

259
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,066
Oh my god.

260
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:00,888
And there's more.

261
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:02,460
More than that?

262
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:06,535
Another family was awarded
a million dollars at the same time.

263
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,737
Okay.

264
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,758
Um, another baby girl,
born the day after you were

265
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,213
and your biological parents took her home.

266
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:21,077
Another girl, born a day after me.

267
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:29,847
I was switched at birth
with Madison Sinclair?

268
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,216
You were bartending Friday night
at Body Shots when Amy Polk came in.

269
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:36,725
Recognise her?

270
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,417
Honestly, I can't tell them apart anymore.

271
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,725
They all have that same
sorority girl in heat look to me.

272
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:46,854
We suspect she was there with the man
who killed her and you remember him.

273
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:48,071
Gentlemen, I can't help you.

274
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:49,696
It was Friday night and
Friday night is ladies night.

275
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:52,091
Two for one shots.
It's wall to wall drunk bitches.

276
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:53,833
Do you mind toning down the language.

277
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,075
Ooops. Sorry.

278
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:01,994
Now that one, I would've noticed.

279
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:09,359
That's my daughter.

280
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:11,664
Wouldn't mind havin' her call me daddy.

281
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:17,339
Whoops! Sorry!

282
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:19,134
Sit down.

283
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:26,864
- Can I help you?
- You must be new.

284
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:29,066
I'm Keith Mars' daughter, Veronica.

285
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,376
Ah. Leo.

286
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:32,518
Did you just tell me your sign?

287
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,071
My name, actually, though
I am coincidentally enough a Leo.

288
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:37,823
I'm just bringing some food for my dad.

289
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,059
Ah well, you can put it
on his desk if you want,

290
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,855
unless it's gonna go bad or something,

291
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:44,190
then we have a mini-fridge,
I could put it in there.

292
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,888
I might just take you up on
that 'cause there's coleslaw.

293
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:48,263
No problem.

294
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,554
Word of caution.
You probably shouldn't trust me.

295
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:14,160
Oh yeah?

296
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,935
Every night at nine, the whole crew
goes out to dinner

297
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:19,338
leaving the rookie here
to answer the phones.

298
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:23,161
I usually wind up getting dinner
at a candy machine.

299
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:27,720
A pastrami sandwich could
prove to be very tempting.

300
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:31,837
- You looked in my bag.
- I told you, I'm a scoundrel.

301
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:35,066
A rogue deputy is among us.
No sandwich is safe.

302
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:37,940
I tell you what. If you promise
to come back and visit me,

303
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:41,345
- I will stay out of the fridge.
- Deal.

304
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:46,772
Oh my Deputy Leo. You might as well
leave me a key and a map.

305
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:51,241
What about the guys who hang at Body Shots?

306
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:52,736
Anyone suspicious?

307
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,339
Mostly loud-mouth frat boys.

308
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:59,165
You know who you should talk to?
The Worm.

309
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,166
The Worm?

310
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,343
Yeah, this guy who shoot
videotapes of all the girls,

311
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,196
then sells them to "Girls Gone Bad".

312
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,510
Where do we find the Worm?

313
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:12,930
Think he's got a girl in there?

314
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,144
I think he's got a video rental.

315
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:25,493
- Yeah, can I help you?
- Sheriff's department.

316
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:27,808
- We need to ask you a few questions.
- You recognise her?

317
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:29,470
No.

318
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:30,823
Are you sure?

319
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:34,377
'Cause we heard you were filming at
Body Shots the night she disappeared.

320
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:35,677
Take another look.

321
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:41,177
No, really, I don't know her.

322
00:19:42,494 --> 00:19:45,044
Listen, I've gotta get dressed for work,
so if that's everything...

323
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:46,461
Sure, no problem, thanks for your time.

324
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:47,881
- Right, yeah?
- Hey,

325
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,723
if you think of anything,
just give us a call.

326
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:59,976
I guess you didn't notice, the guitar
sitting out there in plain sight.

327
00:19:59,977 --> 00:20:01,354
- I saw it.
- So what does he need,

328
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:04,227
a shirt reading
"I'm the E-String Killer, arrest me"?
Let's go back.

329
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:06,903
He needed to look like
he's not going to soil himself.

330
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:08,636
If he gets any more freaked out,

331
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:11,221
he's going to destroy those tapes
before we get a warrant.

332
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:12,458
You should have consulted me first.

333
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:14,543
What did you want me to do,
consult you in pig-latin?

334
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:15,852
He was standing right there!

335
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:18,786
You don't make the decisions
around here. I am the Sheriff.

336
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:20,818
I noticed. Thank you.

337
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:28,415
Hey, did you get any sleep
last night because I...

338
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:32,225
Helping to keep America
beautiful by picking up the litter?

339
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:35,195
Wanna crash a party with me?

340
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:36,793
Bad idea, Mac.

341
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,717
- Bad, bad idea.
- It's my chance to see how the other half lives,

342
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:42,827
especially since I should
have been the other half.

343
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:46,968
So this is where the bourgie folks live?

344
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,975
Upper upper bourgie.

345
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:50,785
It'll be fine.

346
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,771
Hey, happy birthday.

347
00:20:58,204 --> 00:20:59,137
What are you doing here?

348
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:02,363
I came to celebrate your birth,
but these two just wanna hook up.

349
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:04,209
I mean, who invited you?

350
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,456
That would be Seth Russell, from History?

351
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:07,983
No, it was Adam Bunting.

352
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:10,251
Adam Bunting. Isn't that
the guy who looks like Fievel?

353
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:13,056
No, no, that's Adam Hamilton.
Nobody talks to him, he's poor.

354
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:14,543
He still looks like Feivel.

355
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:16,943
But... I didn't invite Adam!

356
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,665
I remember, it was Kevin Powell.

357
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,261
- Who?
- Kevin Powell.

358
00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:24,688
The last time I crashed an 09er party,
I got ridiculed,

359
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,842
roofied and woke up missing my underwear.

360
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:29,360
You can imagine how glad I am to be back.

361
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:32,103
Hey, hey. I hear you're working
some magic lately.

362
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:34,009
Uh, can you help me get
my parents off my back.

363
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,535
I'm gonna go find a bathroom.

364
00:21:36,777 --> 00:21:38,951
Uh, shop's closed right now, Bud.

365
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:42,884
All right, come see me
at school on Monday.

366
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:09,601
Hi.

367
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:12,288
Hi.

368
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,829
You didn't see me, huh.

369
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:17,846
I'm Lauren, I'm Madison's sister.

370
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:20,199
Hi Lauren.

371
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,715
- I'm Mac.
- That's a cool name.

372
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,825
Thanks.

373
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:25,816
So.

374
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,863
- What are you reading?
- "The Westing Game".

375
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:32,037
- It's really good.
- Yeah, it is.

376
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:33,555
I'll probably finish it tonight.

377
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:35,639
Madison says I have to stay in here.

378
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:38,650
What are you doing in my parent's library?

379
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:41,528
- She's read my book.
- No one's supposed to be here.

380
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:42,736
It's off limits.

381
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:43,876
There you are.

382
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:48,284
And you. I won't even start.

383
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:51,026
God, Madison,
they're here for your party.

384
00:22:51,027 --> 00:22:53,523
No, Lauren, they're crashing my party.

385
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:56,706
You need to leave. You don't belong here.

386
00:22:56,707 --> 00:22:59,899
- Well actually...
- We were just leaving, right Mac?

387
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,420
Happy Birthday, Madison.

388
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,832
Thanks for being such a gracious host.
Martha Stewart has nothing on you.

389
00:23:09,136 --> 00:23:12,145
I could tell Mac I know how she feels,
but the truth is, I don't.

390
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:14,375
When I had the opportunity
to learn my paternity,

391
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:17,458
I chose blissful ignorance with
a side of gnawing doubt.

392
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:20,205
Think she's even read
five books in that library?

393
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:24,776
She wouldn't know Monet's Water Lilies
unless Revlon named a nail polish after it.

394
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,664
I have a blood sister
I've never even heard of.

395
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,381
And Madison has a brother.

396
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:35,964
Why didn't they just trade us back?
We would have gotten over it eventually.

397
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:39,142
I suppose they got kind of
attached in those first four years.

398
00:23:39,143 --> 00:23:41,523
They should have figured it
out way before then.

399
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:45,564
At two I was spitting out corn dogs
and tuning the radio to NPR.

400
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:49,213
Did you ever find out what
happened to that million dollars?

401
00:23:50,276 --> 00:23:53,793
Still working on it, unless
you wanna just blow it off.

402
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:54,629
No.

403
00:23:56,032 --> 00:23:58,253
Keep checking. I've come this far.

404
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:00,633
See ya.

405
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:09,001
Okay, well, thanks for calling me back.

406
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,814
That was one of the
"Girls Gone Bad" producers.

407
00:24:13,815 --> 00:24:15,860
They've never even heard of Eddie LaRoche.

408
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:19,678
Ah, so this guy's been videotaping
girls for his own personal enjoyment.

409
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,742
Nice.

410
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,935
Told you I had a bad feeling about that guy.

411
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:25,010
- This the stuff from his apartment?
- Yeah.

412
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:28,503
Pervert's recorded 40 tapes-worth
of girls flashing their ta-tas.

413
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:30,229
Okay, well, we should split these up...

414
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,583
We'll split 'em up and we'll see
if any of the victims are on 'em.

415
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:33,417
Perfect.

416
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,795
Hey. Strings from Eddie's guitar match
the strings left on the victims.

417
00:24:43,726 --> 00:24:45,394
I know, I'm shameless.

418
00:24:45,395 --> 00:24:47,365
But every time I start to feel guilty,

419
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:50,845
I remind myself that Lilly would be
thinking about colleges right now

420
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:54,515
or what new CD played at maximum volume
would most annoy her mother.

421
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,063
And I remember my mission.

422
00:25:01,448 --> 00:25:02,401
Hungry?

423
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:05,066
So what made you decide to be a cop?

424
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,498
Oh, well the same old tired story.

425
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:10,395
I was sent here by the agency
to do a strip-o-gram for Inga.

426
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:15,432
An armed robbery call came in,
I figured I was in uniform anyway,
so what the hell.

427
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,601
So you're saying you just
kind of stumbled into it.

428
00:25:17,602 --> 00:25:21,156
Uh, what I'm trying to say is,
this uniform, it's... it's a tear-away.

429
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,407
Hello?

430
00:25:24,424 --> 00:25:25,674
Is anyone back there?

431
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,077
- Hi!
- Hi.

432
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:34,222
I need to talk to someone about the
noise level in my neighbourhood

433
00:25:34,223 --> 00:25:36,309
which is truly out of control!

434
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:39,614
I mean, you got motorcycle gangs, gunshots...

435
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:41,306
- Wha...
- ...heavy metal music?

436
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,846
It's gotten to the point where
I can't even sleep at night.

437
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:47,570
- Well, why don't...
- I'll bet that if my zip code ended in 0909,

438
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:50,384
you'd have a patrol car swinging
by the house every 10 minutes.

439
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:53,031
<i>"Good evening Mr. Weevil.
Is there anything we can do for you?"</i>

440
00:25:53,032 --> 00:25:55,794
<i>That kind of service.
But no, it's the barrio.</i>

441
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:57,878
<i>So you figure, hey,
they'll sort it out themselves.</i>

442
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,273
And don't get me started
on what this is doing to the property
values in my neighbourhood!

443
00:26:02,588 --> 00:26:05,612
<i>I have a good mind to run for
the city council and if I win,</i>

444
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:07,556
<i>I'll promise you this. Heads...</i>

445
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:08,555
...will roll.

446
00:26:09,392 --> 00:26:10,921
We could send a patrol car by....

447
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:13,743
I'm wondering if I'm better off
speaking with your supervisor.

448
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:16,319
Well, he won't be in until morning.

449
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,970
Well then you leave the sheriff a note:

450
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:21,668
he shouldn't expect Eli Navarro
Esquire's vote this year!

451
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,052
Sorry, couldn't get rid of him.

452
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:30,433
No problem.

453
00:26:36,716 --> 00:26:38,338
Seventeen?

454
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,546
You're seventeen?

455
00:26:40,547 --> 00:26:43,501
I don't see how my age
is relevant to this discussion.

456
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,807
Well then, you're not reading my mind.

457
00:26:45,808 --> 00:26:47,396
I'm afraid to ask.

458
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:49,940
- And how old are you?
- Twenty.

459
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:53,712
Yeah, I can read the wisdom in your eyes.

460
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,567
I've one line, that's it.
You wanna hear it?

461
00:26:56,568 --> 00:26:57,010
Sure.

462
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:00,324
My band's playing this weekend.
If you wanna come down,

463
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:01,906
I'll put you on the guest list.

464
00:27:02,427 --> 00:27:04,462
- And that line works?
- On occasion.

465
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:07,298
But the good thing about the line is,
it's a no-risk line.

466
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:09,693
You throw it out there. If she
shows up, hey, she's interested.

467
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,548
If she doesn't, you haven't
embarrassed yourself.

468
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:16,470
Of course, if the girl you're
chatting up can't get into the club...

469
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:19,076
then the whole thing's kinda useless.

470
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:21,940
A cop that rocks.

471
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:24,465
What will they think of next?

472
00:27:24,466 --> 00:27:26,890
I'm trying to cover all fantasy bases.

473
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:33,286
The Crime Stoppers Hotline CD
I snuck out of the evidence room

474
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:35,594
should have a recording
of every call on it.

475
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:40,432
What I wanna know? Who gift wrapped
Abel Koontz for Sheriff Lamb.

476
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,253
<i>There's been a suspicious vehicle
parked on my street for days</i>

477
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:47,135
<i>and I'm wondering if it's somehow
connected to the Lilly Kane murder...</i>

478
00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:50,240
<i>I think I saw the girl on the day of the
murder, at the gas station on main...</i>

479
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:54,387
<i>What's up? It was me. I killed her...</i>

480
00:27:54,388 --> 00:27:58,571
<i>- My neighbour? I can hear him...
- I have grave concerns about
a sheriff's department...</i>

481
00:27:58,572 --> 00:28:02,863
<i>- I would love to send them a card...
- The logical by-product of the evil
practices of Kane Software...</i>

482
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:04,380
<i>I know who killed the Kane girl.</i>

483
00:28:05,794 --> 00:28:07,418
<i>His name is Abel Koontz.</i>

484
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:10,270
<i>He lives in a houseboat on the marina.</i>

485
00:28:20,743 --> 00:28:23,558
Amy Polk is on this tape.
Let's bring this guy in.

486
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:26,750
As always, a day late and a dollar short.

487
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,294
I already got him sweating in interrogation.

488
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,189
She was on one of mine.

489
00:28:33,654 --> 00:28:36,607
- So how you wanna play this?
- I say we play to our strengths.

490
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:38,570
So I'm good cop?

491
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:43,329
Why don't you admit it, scumbag?

492
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:44,573
Say it.

493
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:46,487
I killed those girls.

494
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:48,589
I wanna go home.

495
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:52,164
Oh, I'm sure you do.

496
00:28:53,388 --> 00:28:56,855
But you still haven't told us
why two of the murdered girls

497
00:28:57,449 --> 00:29:00,711
ended up in your little
do-it-yourself porno tapes.

498
00:29:00,712 --> 00:29:04,322
Why'd you lie to us, Eddie? Why'd you
tell us you didn't know Amy Polk.

499
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:08,169
- There have been so many.
- Why'd you keep them alive 48 hours, huh?

500
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:15,322
Are you lonely Eddie, did you just
need someone to talk to. Huh?

501
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,332
If I tell you can I go home?

502
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:29,634
Start writing. We'll see.

503
00:29:30,189 --> 00:29:31,672
Don, can I talk to you a sec?

504
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:42,463
Everything we have on
this guy is circumstantial.

505
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:44,747
I mean, obviously he has
some mental issues.

506
00:29:44,748 --> 00:29:46,632
No judge is gonna allow his confession.

507
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:48,129
I'll take that chance.

508
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:50,115
I'm saying I'm not sure he's our guy.

509
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,866
What's the problem?
Too easy for you?

510
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:53,889
Let me ask you something.

511
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:56,136
Where did he keep those
girls for all that time?

512
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,494
It couldn't have been his apartment,
the walls are too thin.

513
00:29:58,495 --> 00:30:00,162
We know he doesn't have other property.

514
00:30:00,163 --> 00:30:03,179
I don't think we can eliminate the
possibility that it was someone else.

515
00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:04,949
Like who?

516
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:06,584
Jake Kane?

517
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:13,366
Ah, well lookie here.

518
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:15,184
He's writing.

519
00:30:15,637 --> 00:30:18,098
Keith, I'll handle it from here.

520
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:21,638
We'll send you a cheque.

521
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,251
What do you got for me, Eddie?

522
00:30:27,765 --> 00:30:28,973
Is it a page turner?

523
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:37,798
<i>- Hello?</i>

524
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,492
Mac. It's Veronica, hey.

525
00:30:39,846 --> 00:30:41,927
I just emailed you a sound file.

526
00:30:41,928 --> 00:30:45,181
The voice on it has been digitally altered.
Do you think you can strip it down?

527
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,119
<i>Maybe, I'll give it a shot.</i>

528
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,876
Thanks.

529
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:54,393
Also, I think I found out what happened
to the money from the lawsuit.

530
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:59,530
You know "Funtime Motors"?
They sell jet skis and four wheelers?

531
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:02,017
Yeah, sure. My dad's a salesman there.

532
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:03,227
<i>He used to own it.</i>

533
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:06,035
Your dad started that business in 1992.

534
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:11,703
He filed for bankruptcy in 1994
and it was bought out in early '95.

535
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:15,486
You still there?

536
00:31:15,902 --> 00:31:17,141
I'm okay, Veronica, really.

537
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:22,147
Mac, I know this is hard to hear but
you did have a choice in all this.

538
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:25,481
There's a reason this was kept a secret.

539
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:26,214
Yeah.

540
00:31:26,857 --> 00:31:29,762
I'm not gonna do anything stupid.
I just need time to think.

541
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:31,925
I'll talk to you later.

542
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:00,833
Hello.

543
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:02,860
Hi.

544
00:32:05,343 --> 00:32:06,544
I'm Cindy.

545
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:13,412
I think I left my purse in the library
when I was here for Madison's party.

546
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:15,315
You were...

547
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:18,617
Okay, well, come in.

548
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:30,313
Lauren,

549
00:32:31,152 --> 00:32:32,300
- this is...
- Hi, Mac.

550
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:35,925
- Hey. Finish your book, yet?
- Twenty pages left. Can't wait.

551
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:39,727
Mac thinks she might have left her purse
in the library. Would you go check?

552
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:41,376
It's leopard print.

553
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:48,058
So, how's school?

554
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,224
It's good.

555
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,306
I mean the actual school
part is good, anyway.

556
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:55,650
- What kind of college do you think you'll...
- Mom!

557
00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:58,986
Did you pick up the dry cleaning?
I can't find...

558
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:00,535
Oh, hi honey.

559
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:02,050
I guess you know Cindy.

560
00:33:02,738 --> 00:33:04,830
She thinks she might have
left something here.

561
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:07,782
You were here long
enough to leave something?

562
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:11,015
So, anybody want a snack?

563
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:14,706
No thanks. I'm not hungry.

564
00:33:15,991 --> 00:33:19,141
- Sure, if it's not too much trouble.
- No, no trouble at all.

565
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:21,270
I'm going upstairs.

566
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,122
Thank you.

567
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:35,249
- So I could make you a sandwich or...
- You know, I...

568
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,266
I should probably go.

569
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:40,303
It was nice to...

570
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:43,739
Are you sure?

571
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,682
Somebody help me, please?

572
00:33:53,994 --> 00:33:55,775
- What's the problem?
- My daughter Kelly.

573
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:58,235
She went off last night
with a group of girlfriends,

574
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,872
even though I warned her
not to go to those bars.

575
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:02,490
She didn't come home.

576
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:04,012
Ma'am, I'm sure she's all right.

577
00:34:04,013 --> 00:34:06,158
- What's going on here?
- Her daughter's missing.

578
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,262
The strangler's got her.
I know he does.

579
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:13,015
If you don't find her,
I will hold you responsible.

580
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:14,621
All of you.

581
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:26,083
What are you doing here?
I told you, you're out.

582
00:34:26,084 --> 00:34:28,771
Yeah, well, that was before I knew
there was another girl missing.

583
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:31,469
We got the test results back from
the writing on the victim's palm.

584
00:34:32,078 --> 00:34:34,089
They were able to put together
a seven digit number.

585
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,490
It belongs to Vic Sciaraffa.

586
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,750
The bartender from Body Shots.

587
00:34:38,132 --> 00:34:39,942
- Who's out in the field?
- Haymark and Jones.

588
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:41,983
- Send them to his apartment...
- Already did. He's not there

589
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:43,239
and his car isn't in the carport.

590
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:45,691
I want you to send out
an APB, notify the Feds.

591
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:47,933
We gotta move on this thing.
Okay, let's go.

592
00:34:49,157 --> 00:34:50,699
Veronica, hey, it's Dad.

593
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:53,098
I just need to know where you are right now.

594
00:34:53,815 --> 00:34:55,144
Veronica? It's me again.

595
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:57,530
Listen, I'm tracking your phone right now.

596
00:34:57,531 --> 00:34:59,416
Can you call me as soon as you get this?

597
00:35:34,693 --> 00:35:37,230
It's cool. It's cool.

598
00:35:38,897 --> 00:35:42,048
Dad, everyone.
Everyone, Dad.

599
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:44,708
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Ah, dude.

600
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:46,301
Are you okay, honey?

601
00:35:46,302 --> 00:35:48,797
Aside from never wanting
to show my face again.

602
00:35:50,587 --> 00:35:52,386
- What's going on?
- There's a new girl missing.

603
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:54,513
The killer might still be
on the loose and he's...

604
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:57,589
he might be a guy who doesn't
like me and does like you.

605
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:02,444
So you two know each other?

606
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:05,640
Did I forget to mention that?

607
00:36:15,078 --> 00:36:16,259
You do this yourself?

608
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,442
Yeah, we were getting a lot of
noise complaints from the neighbours.

609
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:24,934
Will you follow Veronica back
to the sheriff's department?

610
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:25,565
Yeah.

611
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:28,053
- You got your piece with you?
- Ah, yeah.

612
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:29,444
Okay, you go, come here.

613
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:36,905
<i>Deputy D'Amato and I are
checking out Evermore Guitars.</i>

614
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:38,915
<i>- It's probably nothing.
- Roger.</i>

615
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:43,078
Closed Saturday and Sunday.

616
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:47,233
Abducts the girl Friday, disposes
of the body Sunday night.

617
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:49,651
It's a theory at least.

618
00:36:50,026 --> 00:36:51,123
What do you wanna do?

619
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,707
Find a way in.

620
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,180
What is it?

621
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,404
Wrist band from Body Shots.

622
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:02,646
Hey, can you stay here?

623
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:04,814
Give me a signal if he shows up.

624
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,841
<i>Hello? Is someone out there?</i>

625
00:37:17,454 --> 00:37:19,990
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming for ya.

626
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:29,963
I'm with the sheriff's department.
Hang tight.

627
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:38,605
Are you okay?

628
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,415
Breathe.

629
00:37:53,158 --> 00:37:57,040
Stop. Now, or I will shoot you.

630
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:04,418
You know,

631
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:07,292
saving the life of a gal's dad,

632
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,112
smooth.

633
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:10,510
Hey.

634
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,839
- Is everything okay?
- Not really.

635
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,105
Sheriff just came and told me
I've been suspended for a week

636
00:38:19,106 --> 00:38:23,398
seeing as the evidence room was left
unlocked on my shift the other night.

637
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,926
Somebody must have snuck off
with the key when I wasn't looking.

638
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:28,527
You know anything about that?

639
00:38:34,595 --> 00:38:36,240
Can't say I wasn't warned.

640
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:41,938
Same old story.

641
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:44,874
Girl uses boy. Girl falls for boy.

642
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:47,021
Boy saves girl's dad's life.

643
00:38:47,022 --> 00:38:48,894
Girl gets what she deserves.

644
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:55,747
Yeah?

645
00:38:56,045 --> 00:38:57,332
It's me. Are you busy?

646
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:57,885
<i>No,</i>

647
00:38:58,526 --> 00:39:00,150
I'm suddenly very free.

648
00:39:00,616 --> 00:39:01,811
I decoded the message, I think,

649
00:39:01,812 --> 00:39:03,893
so do you wanna swing by
tomorrow morning and hear it?

650
00:39:04,184 --> 00:39:04,809
Sure.

651
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,895
<i>You gotta make it early though.</i>

652
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:07,586
I'm going camping with my family.

653
00:39:08,507 --> 00:39:09,339
Camping?

654
00:39:09,624 --> 00:39:11,325
It's a bi-annual rite of torture.

655
00:39:12,904 --> 00:39:14,890
I'll play this recording at a few different speeds.

656
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:16,803
- Tell me when you think it's right.
- Sounds good.

657
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:18,872
Oh, ah, honey. Did you remember a pillow?

658
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:20,743
- Yeah, I've packed it.
- Good.

659
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,060
So where are you guys headed?

660
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:25,940
Ah, Yosemite maybe.

661
00:39:26,478 --> 00:39:28,022
I never know 'til I get there.

662
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:30,398
Okay, here we go.

663
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:33,809
<i>The Kane girl. His name is Abel Koontz.</i>

664
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:36,849
- No, nothing yet.
- Let's try this.

665
00:39:37,237 --> 00:39:38,966
<i>I know who killed the Kane girl.</i>

666
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,720
Veronica, I gotta go soon.

667
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:43,734
I know. Can you just
try it one more time.

668
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,070
<i>His name is Abel Koontz.</i>

669
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,580
<i>He lives in a houseboat on the marina.</i>

670
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:50,570
Stop.

671
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:52,940
I know who it is.

672
00:39:55,953 --> 00:39:59,163
Ryan, if you don't want to be left,
I suggest you get into this camper.

673
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:04,059
Honey, you have everything you need, uh,

674
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,736
pocket knife, headlamp, latest
works of staggering genius?

675
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:09,932
- Yeah, Dad, it's all accounted for.
- All right.

676
00:40:45,411 --> 00:40:47,396
Cindy! What are you doing?

677
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:48,885
Come on, let's go.

678
00:40:49,312 --> 00:40:50,615
I'll be there in a minute, Mom.

679
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:13,997
So where are we going this year, anyway?

680
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:17,231
Come on. Let's hit the road.

681
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:20,314
I suppose this isn't my smartest move.

682
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:21,743
I don't care.

683
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:23,660
I want him to know what it feels like.

684
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:30,065
Hey boss.
Package came for you.

685
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:47,873
How'd this package arrive?

686
00:41:48,184 --> 00:41:48,977
Messenger.

687
00:41:49,394 --> 00:41:52,381
I wanna find out who paid
to have it sent here. Today.

688
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:56,033
You send target photos of me to my mom.

689
00:41:56,493 --> 00:41:58,358
You call in the Abel Koontz tip.

690
00:41:58,638 --> 00:42:00,412
Two words for you, Clarence Wiedman:

691
00:42:00,706 --> 00:42:01,747
game on.

692
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:05,333
