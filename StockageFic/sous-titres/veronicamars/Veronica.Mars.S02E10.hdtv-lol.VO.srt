1
00:00:00,227 --> 00:00:02,295
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:06,251
Dad, it's Aaron Echolls.
He did it.

3
00:00:06,252 --> 00:00:08,590
I have a video of Lilly in 
his bed on the day she died.

4
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:10,461
I hear you're back on 
the cheerleading squad.

5
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:13,113
I'm supposed to pay you or something, right?

6
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:13,894
Never mind.

7
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:19,453
Why is Meg e-mailing someone
at child-protection services?

8
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:22,086
She's been trying to help the kid,
but she doesn't have proof.

9
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:23,496
We were trying to help grace.

10
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:25,752
They had been abusing her.
They had her locked in the closet.

11
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:26,651
Get on the floor!

12
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,226
I found them in my daughter's room,
rifling through her things.

13
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:38,702
It's three hours until the 
start of Christmas break,

14
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:42,685
and despite what I'm sure are the sincere
efforts of the school's pastry chef,

15
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:45,281
my holiday spirit has yet to kindle.

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,537
There you are.

17
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:48,943
Here I am.

18
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:54,021
I didn't even see you this morning, and I kind
of hoped I could carry your books to class.

19
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:56,301
You okay?

20
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:58,170
I saw Meg.

21
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:01,005
What do you mean you...

22
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,630
Meg's pregnant.

23
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:07,096
I know.

24
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:10,046
You know?

25
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:13,237
There was a letter from her aunt.

26
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,562
I guess Meg had asked to live 
up there and raise the baby.

27
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:19,634
Oh, my god.
Duncan, how could you...

28
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,694
Last spring,
before we broke up.

29
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:26,078
Okay, stop. I was shown a diagram 
once. I know how it works.

30
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:28,843
But you knew,
and you didn't tell me?

31
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:30,035
This has nothing to do with us.

32
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:32,310
Oh, no. Nothing.

33
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:38,766
Your secret illegitimate child gestating in the womb of
your comatose ex-girlfriend affects neither you nor me.

34
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:42,350
I'm fine with it.

35
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,652
Hola, boyos.

36
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:47,765
Hope I'm not spoiling a tender moment here,

37
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:50,497
but I just wanted to make sure
you got your vaccinations

38
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:54,410
because the new year's bash of 
the century is just a scant week away.

39
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:55,638
Of the century?

40
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:57,527
Does Truman Capote know?

41
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:58,886
Of the millennium.

42
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,126
And Truman who?

43
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:03,101
I can't. I've got holidays
in Sun Valley with the parents.

44
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:07,117
Dude, seriously... snow, pine trees,
family... that's not holidays.

45
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:11,159
Party boat, crazy chinese pyro guy...
I'm feeling that.

46
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:12,192
Think about it.

47
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:14,291
Oh, and, Duncan,

48
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:17,339
if you're not coming 
'cause of... tension here,

49
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:19,713
there's a chance
an old flame might be there.

50
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:21,377
What do you mean?

51
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:23,891
Didn't you hear?
Meg... she woke up.

52
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:27,538
Probably gonna be partying in no time.
So... I'm just saying.

53
00:02:33,313 --> 00:02:34,194
I should go see her.

54
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:36,005
Got it covered.

55
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:39,992
My visitor's pass from 
when I picked up Abel Koontz's stuff.

56
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:43,314
All I need is a color copier and 
a laminator, and we're in business.

57
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:47,846
Don't worry.
I do this for all my boyfriends.

58
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:50,100
Veronica...

59
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:50,964
I know.

60
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:52,668
I'm amazing.

61
00:02:53,378 --> 00:02:55,526
I appreciate you getting 
down here so fast, Keith.

62
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:58,116
Sorry about that voice mail.
I'm sure I sounded crazed.

63
00:02:58,172 --> 00:03:00,002
I did detect a certain urgency.

64
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,059
Keith, I got a call from 
sheriff Lamb right before lunch.

65
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:08,361
The Aaron Echolls/Lilly Kane sex tapes have
been stolen from the evidence room.

66
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:11,057
All of them?
Originals and copies?

67
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:12,762
From separate safes,
no less.

68
00:03:13,478 --> 00:03:15,037
Was there a sign of break-in?

69
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:17,131
No, this pretty much
has to be an inside deal.

70
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:19,141
Only an employee would 
have that kind of access.

71
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:24,450
This is gonna put a huge 
dent in the prosecution's case.

72
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:26,600
It's not the kind of thing 
that's gonna stay secret long.

73
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:27,562
No, it isn'T.

74
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:29,731
And when it does come out,

75
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:34,150
Neptune is officially bozoville,
a national laughingstock.

76
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:36,331
I need you to get those tapes back.

77
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,333
Woody, I'm just a P.I.
I don't have a staff or access.

78
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:41,577
I'm not talking about
a private investigation, Keith.

79
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:45,597
I'm talking about an official 
independent inquest on behalf of the city.

80
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:49,025
I'm flattered, but am I really the guy you 
want, given my history with the department?

81
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:53,790
You're the right guy precisely because
of your history with the department.

82
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,292
Please, Keith.

83
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:57,692
What do you say?

84
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,277
I say it sounds awkward and uncomfortable.
But we need those tapes. How can I say no?

85
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,273
Thank you, pal.

86
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:27,368
Hi.

87
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:34,377
Surprise.

88
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,035
Meg...

89
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,155
what are we gonna do?

90
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:43,979
Duncan, I don't know.

91
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,679
Mom and dad want me to
put the baby up for adoption.

92
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:53,957
Have you ever heard of the 
Levi Stinson sanctuary house?

93
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,169
No.

94
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:56,298
It's horrible.

95
00:04:56,826 --> 00:05:02,604
Their adoption contracts are all about
religious indoctrination and tough-love discipline.

96
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:05,212
It's almost a license for abuse.

97
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,276
When I think of my child
brought up like that...

98
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:10,602
don't i have any say?

99
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,812
The sinner who knocked up their daughter?

100
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:15,452
They don't want you involved.
They want you gone.

101
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:20,214
Their lawyers are digging up all 
this stuff on your medical history...

102
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:23,478
your blackouts and violent outbursts.

103
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:28,103
All I want is to have my baby and 
move in with my aunt Chris in seattle.

104
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,047
I don't know how you got in here, 
but you need to leave.

105
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,712
Val, it's... it's okay.

106
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:34,599
We should go.

107
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:38,349
You should rest.

108
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:46,142
Veronica...

109
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:47,148
can you stay a second?

110
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:58,896
Veronica, I just hope you can 
forgive me for being such a...

111
00:05:58,914 --> 00:05:59,852
Meg, you don't have to...

112
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,914
it's just that I knew that I was pregnant,
and seeing you with duncan...

113
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:04,791
you don't have to say anything.

114
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:08,943
Is it too much to ask 
for just one small favor?

115
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,689
No.

116
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,918
If anything happens to me...

117
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:15,796
don't let them do it.

118
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:19,328
Don't let them send the baby away.

119
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:22,757
And no matter what, don't let them keep it.

120
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:26,389
You're late.

121
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,686
That's the idea.

122
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:31,365
Figured if I snuck in close
to the end of the day,

123
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:34,026
the chances of it getting
even worse are slim.

124
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:37,306
So, you would not 
characterize your day as good?

125
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,865
More along the lines of... bad.

126
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:45,404
How much would it help if 
I microwaved you some 2-day-old lasagna?

127
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,632
A... medium amount.

128
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:53,717
And how much would it help if
I went out and got some ice cream, too?

129
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:56,377
A... lot?

130
00:06:56,948 --> 00:06:58,992
Why would I need that much help?

131
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:01,173
With my sincere regrets.

132
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:06,627
Chocolate-chip mint or butter pecan?

133
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:08,459
Oh, crap.

134
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,698
Jury duty?

135
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,084
I'll get both.

136
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,172
A long time ago,

137
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:20,936
We used to be friends, but I

138
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:24,789
Haven't thought of you lately at all.

139
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:28,314
Come on, now, sugar!

140
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:30,626
Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!

141
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,280
Just remember me when

142
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:36,300
We used to be friends

143
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:38,596
A long time ago

144
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,916
We used to be friends

146
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,776
Jury duty on Christmas break.

147
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:54,773
No sing-alongs, no poignant messages 
of universal love and hope...

148
00:07:55,014 --> 00:07:58,751
just cellphones out, watches eyeballed,
jackets left on,

149
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:03,593
and a commitment to the sacred ideal
of drive-through express justice.

150
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,418
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

151
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:15,347
The sooner we get this over with,
the sooner we get back to our real lives.

152
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,366
First order of business, I believe,
is to elect a jury foreman.

153
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:21,732
Do I hear any nominations or volunteers?

154
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:27,068
All right, hearing no nominations,
I have a proposal.

155
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:32,041
This strikes me as a fairly 
open-and-shut case,

156
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:36,307
so, would anyone object to letting 
the young lady serve as our foreman?

157
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,800
Be a nice chance for her to learn about 
civic responsibility and the justice system.

158
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:43,997
Great!

159
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:46,863
All in favor of miss Mars as foreman,
raise your hands.

160
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:49,648
Absolutely.

161
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,762
Yeah, we've done a ton of upgrading on 
the security front since you were here.

162
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,935
For example,
no keys anymore.

163
00:09:00,694 --> 00:09:02,709
We're using magnetic cards 
like you get in hotels.

164
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:08,133
Reprogram them every couple days.
No worries about lost or copied keys.

165
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,465
Say, bud,
can you give me a spot?

166
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:12,624
A spot?

167
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:13,925
Yeah,
spot me up here.

168
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,041
Ahh, endorphin rush, man.

169
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:32,870
You know, Keith, you really should have done
 more to push fitness when you were here.

170
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:37,439
Yeah, I was gonna get to that,
but crime-fighting kept getting in the way.

171
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:40,179
Anyway,
you were saying?

172
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:42,986
Magnetic cards...
right.

173
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:48,892
And level-one clearance
for senior staff only.

174
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,309
There's no nighttime access 
without written permission... from me.

175
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,454
So, to paraphrase, you're telling me...

176
00:09:56,548 --> 00:10:01,775
the Neptune sheriff's department is a
locked-down, squared-away citadel of security?

177
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:03,826
That's a little flowery.

178
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:06,138
But you can pretty much catch my drift.

179
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:09,283
I run a tight ship,
Keith.

180
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:11,034
And you look good doing it.

181
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,285
That's why they elected me, Keith.

182
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:18,788
I'm gonna need unrestricted access
to your staff at all times.

183
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:21,365
Absolutely.
We're here to please.

184
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,286
Well, in that case, I'll need personal
info for everyone who works here...

185
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:27,817
personnel files, tax returns,
security access levels,

186
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:30,764
e-mail addresses, browser
histories... all that.

187
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,183
No problem, buddy.
Just say how high.

188
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:34,057
Oh, I will.

189
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:37,241
So the question is whether 
there's any need to deliberate at all.

190
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:44,223
Um, as Foreman, I don't see how
a quick review of the facts could hurt.

191
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:48,833
Briefly.
All right.

192
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:52,228
Our defendants are Robby 
McKinnon and Hunter Hayes...

193
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,580
both 21 years of age,
both from well-known Neptune families.

194
00:10:56,303 --> 00:11:01,616
They are charged with aggravated assault in a
november 5th beating of Anissa Vilapando, age 25.

195
00:11:02,724 --> 00:11:04,082
As the prosecution tells it,

196
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:08,349
Anissa missed her bus after getting off work
at the Elite Touch car wash in downtown Neptune

197
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:10,343
and decided to hitchhike.

198
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:12,857
She was picked up by McKinnon and Hayes.

199
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,437
On the way, Anissa and the boys 
smoked some marijuana.

200
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:18,462
Their weed?

201
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:19,783
Yes.

202
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:25,886
Then she says they asked her to join them in
a motel room so they could "party some more".

203
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:28,620
With ecstasy... also theirs.

204
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,993
They struck her as harmless,
so she accepted.

205
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:35,817
Once inside the room,
they allegedly asked her for sex.

206
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:40,553
Her statement says they got so aggressive,
she became frightened and tried to leave.

207
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:43,948
Hayes then supposedly pulled out 
a gun and forced her back inside,

208
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:45,785
where McKinnon punched and kicked her.

209
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:48,787
Hayes put the gun on the bedside table,

210
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:50,458
climbed on top of her.

211
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,041
Ms. Vilapando says she fought back,

212
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,096
managed to grab Hayes' gun,
and fired twice into the ceiling.

213
00:11:57,406 --> 00:12:01,335
The boys ran off, and the police picked them
up the next day based on her descriptions

214
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:03,612
and the video from 
the motel security camera.

215
00:12:04,205 --> 00:12:08,294
Ms. Vilapando also says, after the beating,
she staggered out to the second-floor balcony

216
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,087
and threw the gun over the railing.

217
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:13,955
This... gun was never found.

218
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:15,506
Noted.

219
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:17,673
So, the defense case...

220
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:23,981
The defendants both claim she is no victim but rather
a hooker who offered them a 3-way for 80 bucks.

221
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:27,570
But before they could get down to business,
a young african-american man

222
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:28,886
- apparently her pimp -

223
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:32,801
kicked the door in, fired two shots into 
the ceiling, and ordered them out.

224
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:36,428
The boys told police the pimp seemed
to feel Anissa owed him money.

225
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:39,261
They left the motel but assume
he was the one who beat her.

226
00:12:39,318 --> 00:12:42,212
I'd like to remind everyone
that this girl is a known criminal.

227
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,315
She was convicted of forgery at age 15,

228
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:49,600
and she's still on parole for being an armed
lookout during a liquor-store robbery.

229
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:50,351
Noted.

230
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:52,371
So, final facts...

231
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,096
After the attack, 
Anissa called an ex-boyfriend

232
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:57,053
named Ankwan Simmons.

233
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:01,367
He says she asked for his help, but when
the cops arrived, he was still on the line.

234
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,228
Neither of the defendants
had a criminal record.

235
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:06,237
Nor any guns registered to their names.

236
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:11,839
After the shots, the motel manager waited a 
few minutes and then walked toward the room.

237
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,320
He testifies that he saw a young black man
with a gun run across a parking lot

238
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,279
and leap over the 6-foot
fence surrounding the motel.

239
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:21,092
Boys got some serious ups, yo.

240
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:27,352
Now we get to the defense's ace in the hole.

241
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:31,623
Young masters McKinnon and Hayes have
a very credible witness on their side...

242
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:33,903
a mr. Carnell Myles,

243
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,297
who identifies himself as Anissa's pimp.

244
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,996
Mr. Myles turned himself in to
police after hearing that a man

245
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:42,974
fitting his description was 
spotted fleeing the crime scene.

246
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:46,161
His story matches 
the boys' version to a "T."

247
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:48,561
How'd I do?

248
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:54,473
So, are we ready for a vote?

249
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:57,070
I say we make this simple.

250
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:00,859
Jot down your vote on a
piece of paper, fold it up,

251
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:02,368
and stick it in the hat.

252
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:03,764
And there it is...

253
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:06,517
one quick lesson in civic
responsibility for me

254
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,474
and an only slightly shortened 
holiday for everyone.

255
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,611
Our resident alpha male 
was right about one thing...

256
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,611
the case does feel, thankfully,
pretty open-and-shut.

257
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:29,564
Our vote is 11 innocent, 1 guilty.

258
00:14:32,424 --> 00:14:34,753
I guess we'll all see each other
first thing in the morning.

259
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:37,466
Well, it's like I said.

260
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:41,592
These rooms are monitored closely in 
compliance with new security upgrades,

261
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,571
such as magnetic keys.

262
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:44,410
Magnetic keys,

263
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,731
senior staff only... right.

264
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,865
You ever lose a card?

265
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,815
So? If somebody found it,
it's no good.

266
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:53,463
We change the codes.

267
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,092
But you still need a card, right?

268
00:14:56,743 --> 00:15:00,634
Inga has the codes in her drawer.
She can just make a new card right there.

269
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:04,072
But only if you have,
uh... level-one...

270
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,046
level-one clearance...
senior staff only.

271
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:08,624
Got to hand it to you, Sacks.

272
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:10,825
You stay on message like nobody's business.

273
00:15:11,884 --> 00:15:16,123
If not for the little perspiration problem, you'd
make a great white house press secretary.

274
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:17,150
Yeah.

275
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:20,117
So, security's wonderfully tight,

276
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:22,335
and none of the senior staff 
took the tapes themselves.

277
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:30,178
I know we all have better things to do than pull
jury duty over the holidays, and I feel your pain.

278
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,295
Does your pain affect 200,000 stockholders?

279
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:36,860
I'm supposed to meet outsourcing
contractors in Bangalore.

280
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:38,948
Care to tell them why
their C.E.O. Couldn't show?

281
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:40,064
And while you're at it,

282
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:43,976
tell the sports fans of Neptune why the mind of
Madison Harwell is missing from the airwaves.

283
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:49,026
As a divorced mother of two taking 
unpaid leave from her crap waitress job,

284
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:51,904
could I please suggest we get on with it?

285
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:53,641
Right. We were...

286
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:59,258
I was just wondering if our holdout
voter would identify him or herself

287
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:03,694
as a courtesy to those 
whose lives you've put on hold.

288
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:10,975
No problem, big shot. I'm the one 
trashing your quarterly earnings.

289
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:15,696
I respect your honesty,
so I'll be straight with you, too.

290
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:18,723
Is the racial stuff affecting your vote?

291
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:20,580
Is it affecting yours?

292
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:22,937
Fine.

293
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:29,090
But can you give us one solid reason we should
see this girl's story as even remotely credible?

294
00:16:29,144 --> 00:16:30,784
Okay, here's one.

295
00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:36,066
A ho that works her ass off all day at 
a car wash before hitting the streets...

296
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,995
that's just something I never heard of.

297
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:46,960
Okay, let's discuss.

298
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:50,329
I'm not gonna insult 
your intelligence, Keith.

299
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:54,630
Don is a fine politician,
but as a lawman and administrator...

300
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,740
security around here is a joke.

301
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:01,043
That's odd. He told me security
here was quite impressive.

302
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:02,610
He thinks so.

303
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:04,649
He locks himself out pretty often.

304
00:17:06,264 --> 00:17:10,413
Listen, someone must have figured what those
tapes would be worth on the open market and...

305
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:14,679
What?

306
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,072
No, it's nothing.
I'm an idiot.

307
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:20,503
I've been so hung up on Aaron Echolls
and all this evidence tampering,

308
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:22,420
I never stopped to think 
what those tapes are worth.

309
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,309
Good celebrity porn is scarce these days.

310
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:31,740
Keith...

311
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:36,633
you mind giving my best to your daughter?

312
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:39,069
A little.

313
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:41,298
But I'll do it.

314
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:46,909
Dispatch.
Blankenship speaking.

315
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,777
Lloyd, Keith Mars here.

316
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,378
Got any more true-crime
semi-bestsellers for me?

317
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,704
Fortunately, no.

318
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:55,631
But what I do have 
needs to stay on background.

319
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:56,893
No problem, man.
What's up?

320
00:17:56,972 --> 00:18:01,300
The sex tapes of Echolls and Lilly kane have been
stolen from the balboa county sheriff's department.

321
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:02,832
Heard any buzz on that?

322
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:05,758
No. But we're not the target market.

323
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:07,736
Whoever's got them
is going straight to the tabs.

324
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:11,560
With whom you legitimate 
newsmen have no ties whatsoever?

325
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:16,392
Well, I do have a casual acquaintance
at the instigator.

326
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:18,004
You mind letting me know
if he knows anything?

327
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,084
It's a she.

328
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:20,611
And I'm happy to do it.

329
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:22,316
Well, thanks, Lloyd.

330
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:25,643
Oh. Hello.

331
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:29,385
Which one are you...
Blinky, Humpty, Zorro?

332
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:32,396
My name is Thumper,
not that you really care.

333
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,692
Oh, I care... deeply.

334
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,775
I guess you heard about our new 
cranberry-walnut crumb cake.

335
00:18:39,876 --> 00:18:42,311
It's true, it's crantastic.

336
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:46,557
I just dropped by 'cause me and some of 
the guys were curious about something.

337
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:48,098
And that would be?

338
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:54,165
We was just wondering, now that 
you're all up in there with the 09ers again...

339
00:18:55,245 --> 00:18:59,249
you gonna be letting those two little frat boys walk
for beating down a poor mexican chick from our hood?

340
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:02,095
Can't talk about this 
while the trial's still on.

341
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:04,032
Yeah, of course not.

342
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,583
Wouldn't want to prejudice you or nothing.

343
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,713
You take care, Veronica.

344
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:18,235
These are from the motel's 
parking-lot security cam.

345
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,950
It does support the motel manager's
story of a black guy fleeing with a gun.

346
00:19:26,954 --> 00:19:30,174
Then speaking of the motel, here's something
I didn't hear nobody talk about.

347
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:33,902
This motel manager says 12 minutes passed,

348
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:37,644
from when he heard shots to when he stuck
his head out and saw that pimp running off.

349
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:42,415
Why would a man who just beat
some poor gal and shot off a gun

350
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:45,703
stick around so long before getting away?

351
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:55,323
I adore what your designer's 
done with the men's room.

352
00:19:56,584 --> 00:20:01,616
That hefty bag over the busted 
urinal adds a delicious wabi-sabi feel.

353
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:05,949
That's don's thing. We went more
mid-century modern back in my day.

354
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,402
Anyway,
thanks for coming by.

355
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,033
I'm guessing by your blithe spirits 
that you have no idea what's up.

356
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:14,395
No.

357
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,084
But they request my presence 
here weekly, so...

358
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,110
Logan the tapes of your dad and Lilly 
have been stolen from the evidence room.

359
00:20:21,142 --> 00:20:23,698
I'm here to investigate how it 
happened and try to get them back.

360
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,441
What?!

361
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:26,931
Obviously, I need to know what, if anything,

362
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,801
your father might have said lately 
about the case or the evidence.

363
00:20:30,002 --> 00:20:30,851
Wait.

364
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:34,543
Wait. Now I'm totally confused.

365
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:37,053
That sounded a lot like 
a question you would ask a suspect...

366
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,380
an accomplice, say.

367
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:41,006
You did spend time with Aaron
before the tapes were stolen.

368
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:42,767
Yeah.

369
00:20:44,183 --> 00:20:45,180
Excuse me, Keith.

370
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:47,470
Lloyd Blankenship of 
the dispatch is on the phone.

371
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:48,316
Thanks.

372
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:50,731
Be right back.
Excuse me.

373
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,162
I just talked to that casual
acquaintance at the instigator.

374
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:57,521
They've been contacted about
the Aaron Echolls sex tapes.

375
00:20:58,134 --> 00:20:59,418
You know who else they approached?

376
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:01,899
Didn't know, but the bids
are coming in fast.

377
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:03,470
Dare I ask?

378
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,565
Current high ? Half a million.

379
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:09,165
Thanks, lloyd.
Keep me posted?

380
00:21:32,213 --> 00:21:33,582
Sorry about the interruption.

381
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:40,652
Now, I asked you whether you heard
anything unusual from your father.

382
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:42,945
Did he ever mention the tapes 
when you were locked up with him?

383
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:47,866
Can you seriously imagine me conspiring 
to save daddy dearest, Lilly's killer?

384
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:50,642
I'm just making sure I have 
every pertinent bit of information.

385
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:54,949
I'll tell you what, dude... if I hear
anything pertinent, I'll get back at you.

386
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,782
The name's not "dude. " It's "mr. Mars. "

387
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:02,925
Kids say the darndest things.

388
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,120
"Mommy, if you get fired, do I still 
get free leftover tater tots?"

389
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:12,590
Look, we all hate this, 
but until we all agree...

390
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:17,236
look, honey, my whole thing from the start
has been to take this job seriously,

391
00:22:17,274 --> 00:22:19,533
and I am satisfied that we have.

392
00:22:19,753 --> 00:22:24,466
If we vote again and nobody 
crosses over to my side,

393
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:26,470
I'll change my vote.

394
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:28,312
Fair enough?

395
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,335
Hands will do.

396
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:38,249
All right, all in favor 
of continued deliberation?

397
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:17,494
I'm sorry. I was looking for my apartment,

398
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:22,467
but I seem to have stumbled upon some 
sort of magical winter wonderland instead.

399
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:25,429
Why, perhaps this elf can help me.

400
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:30,055
I just thought we needed at least 
an hour of holiday. Grab a seat.

401
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:35,955
You know, elf, we might not be
the richest family in town,

402
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:39,445
but we can afford normal-size
birds once a year or so.

403
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:42,248
Game hens...
they were just so cute.

404
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,049
Plus, this way, we won't have 
to eat leftovers on new year's.

405
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:48,012
That's smart thinking.
Come on, what do they taste like?

406
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:48,658
I don't know.

407
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,441
Dense little turkeys?

408
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:56,727
thanks for doing all this, honey.

409
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:59,298
Thank the three energy drinks.

410
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:00,843
Merry Christmas, pops.

411
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,373
You're drinking wine now?

412
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:03,962
No.

413
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,365
God bless us, everyone.

414
00:24:09,975 --> 00:24:14,910
She's a very tiny bird in size,
but in taste, so big!

415
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:19,750
Backup can handle the dishes.

416
00:24:19,803 --> 00:24:24,019
Right now, how's about an early
peek at one of your Christmas presents?

417
00:24:24,787 --> 00:24:27,381
What about our strict
"Christmas morning only" rule?

418
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:32,703
This Christmas,
we make our own rules.

419
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:34,004
Follow me!

420
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:38,681
I'm so impressed you fit
a pony into my room.

421
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:41,056
Presents, presents,
presents!

422
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,819
Uh... yeah.

423
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:52,584
Isn't that the same computer
you got me two years ago?

424
00:24:52,785 --> 00:24:54,028
On the outside, yes.

425
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:58,116
But this old beast has
a new heart pulsing inside her.

426
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,106
I'm talking 512 gigawatts of ram,

427
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:04,026
an 80-something-or-other hard drive.

428
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:05,716
You don't know what you're saying, do you?

429
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:10,116
No, but your friend mac promised 
me that it's all very state-of-the-art.

430
00:25:12,658 --> 00:25:14,368
Thanks, dad.
You rock.

431
00:25:16,142 --> 00:25:17,566
Why don't you take it for a test-drive?

432
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:27,059
What's this? Two stories from 1999,
dated about 2 months apart.

433
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:30,106
And the man pictured
in both stories? Carnell Myles,

434
00:25:30,148 --> 00:25:34,159
the same guy who now identifies
himself as Anissa Vilapando's pimp.

435
00:25:34,787 --> 00:25:37,683
Is there anyone in town who
doesn't know which trial I'm on?

436
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:44,566
Maybe the fellas can help out 
a sports-impaired girl.

437
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:47,927
This Carnell Myles guy...
I keep thinking I've heard his name,

438
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:50,996
but he's not a musician or
an actor or anything I'd know.

439
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:52,697
Did he used to play something?

440
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,396
Damn. You know,
I think you're right.

441
00:25:54,897 --> 00:25:58,791
Matrix Myles... incredible 
cornerback at San Diego state.

442
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,239
He got drafted by the Bengals.

443
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:02,028
So, how did he end up a pimp?

444
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:04,399
First day at training camp,
he blew out his knee.

445
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,537
Miss Foreman...

446
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:09,794
any idea how this 
no-cartilage-having ex-jock

447
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:11,942
managed to leap over that wall?

448
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:17,783
Hey, Sacks.

449
00:26:20,684 --> 00:26:24,941
I'm not finding that list of the e-mail addresses
for everyone on staff that I asked you for.

450
00:26:25,562 --> 00:26:26,270
It's in the flap.

451
00:26:26,655 --> 00:26:28,446
The flap, right.
What flap?

452
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:29,772
The packet I gave you.

453
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:31,702
I put it in there.

454
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:34,173
Well, I see a flap,
but it's empty.

455
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:36,395
I put it in the flap.

456
00:26:39,107 --> 00:26:43,475
Okay. So, Robert McKinnon, the sports agent,
is Robby McKinnon's father.

457
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:44,663
What does that prove?

458
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:50,702
It proves diddly, but it begs some interesting questions
about how carnell myles got involved in all this.

459
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:55,826
Are you suggesting that Robert McKinnon paid
his former client to take the rap for his son?

460
00:26:56,102 --> 00:26:57,896
It happens. Trust me.

461
00:26:58,301 --> 00:27:01,352
What good would money do 
a man serving 20 years for assault?

462
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:08,023
20 years? Mi hijo, you got some funny ideas about how
judges deal with pimps who slap their hookers around.

463
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,489
Six months... maybe.

464
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:14,702
And is my theory really any crazier
than the other way of looking at it?

465
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,580
What other way?

466
00:27:15,774 --> 00:27:20,199
That a pimp tricking $80 hookers 
showed up out of the goodness of his heart

467
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,588
to save two rich white boys from doing time.

468
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:26,056
But there's still the gun.
Nothing ties it to the defendants.

469
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,789
We all saw it in the hands 
of the guy running from the motel.

470
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,480
The gun belonged to Anissa.

471
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:38,064
This should be good.

472
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,159
We know she has a firearms rap.

473
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:42,636
Parole in those cases 
forbids you to own a gun.

474
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,557
The boys attack her,
she pulls the gun, they flee.

475
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:48,595
But if she admits the gun is hers, 
it's prison for sure.

476
00:27:48,596 --> 00:27:50,846
She has to ditch the gun 
before the cops arrive,

477
00:27:51,423 --> 00:27:53,341
but she's too beat up to do it herself.

478
00:27:53,432 --> 00:27:56,540
So she gets her friend to do it... 
Ankwan Simmons.

479
00:27:56,671 --> 00:28:02,055
Whom she calls after the attack and who is seen
fleeing the scene 12 minutes later with a gun.

480
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:06,470
So, aside from the theory you just
yanked out of your... imagination,

481
00:28:07,577 --> 00:28:09,728
what ties the gun to ms. Vilapando?

482
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:12,087
Process of elimination.

483
00:28:12,777 --> 00:28:16,829
The guy running from the motel wasn't 
Carnell Myles, so it couldn't have been his.

484
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,915
If it belonged to the boys,
Anissa wouldn't have needed to hide it.

485
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:22,267
Their fingerprints would have
been on it, as well as hers.

486
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:23,501
But that still leaves...

487
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:26,414
Anissa and the antigravity 
guy we saw hopping the fence.

488
00:28:26,776 --> 00:28:29,846
So, unless that guy was
in the room the whole time,

489
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:32,735
which neither the defense nor
the prosecution has proposed,

490
00:28:33,437 --> 00:28:35,015
the gun is Anissa's.

491
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,994
Inga, can I...

492
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,242
what's this?

493
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,013
It's an anonymous e-mail I just got.

494
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:47,107
For an offer of $50,000 for the tapes.

495
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:49,942
Sacks, did you get an e-mail like this?

496
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:53,306
Uh... yeah. Just today.
We all got them.

497
00:28:55,352 --> 00:28:56,270
I told the sheriff.

498
00:28:56,826 --> 00:28:58,465
Get me another copy of that e-mail list.

499
00:29:18,608 --> 00:29:21,097
Not too shabby for a guy with a
surgically fused knee.

500
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,744
True, that.

501
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:25,793
Now, take another look at 
this photo of ankwan simmons.

502
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:30,908
From a distance, it'd be pretty
easy to mistake him for Carnell Myles.

503
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:33,616
So, are we ready for a vote?

504
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:37,072
All for acquittal,
raise your hands.

505
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,209
You want to miss more bowl games?

506
00:29:42,396 --> 00:29:43,753
Give me a break,
daddy warbucks.

507
00:29:43,953 --> 00:29:44,938
She laid out a good...

508
00:29:45,954 --> 00:29:48,433
Pardon me, miss Mars. The judge
would like to see you in her chambers.

509
00:29:48,865 --> 00:29:50,789
Here's something for 
our foreman to pass along.

510
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:55,297
I will never vote for conviction,
no matter what.

511
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:57,634
You tell the judge this jury's hung.

512
00:30:07,926 --> 00:30:09,721
That's "mr. Mars" to you.

513
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:20,060
What happened?

514
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:22,585
She asked me whether we were deadlocked.

515
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:23,980
I said no.

516
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,548
Then she said we're not going home
until we reach a verdict.

517
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:36,391
Okay. No problem.

518
00:30:45,107 --> 00:30:48,309
<i>playing: Ivy - Edge of the Ocean</i>

519
00:31:02,702 --> 00:31:06,922
<i>There's a place I dream about</i>

520
00:31:07,706 --> 00:31:11,862
<i>Where the sun never goes out</i>

521
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:16,749
<i>And the sky is deep and blue.</i>

522
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:21,683
<i>Won't you take me there with you.</i>

523
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:26,567
<i>Ohhh, we can begin again.</i>

524
00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:31,921
<i>Shed our skin, let the sun shine in.</i>

525
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:35,864
<i>At the edge of the ocean</i>

526
00:31:36,117 --> 00:31:39,961
<i>We can start over again.</i>

527
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:06,957
<i>There's a world I've always known</i>

528
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:12,009
<i>Somewhere far away from home</i>

529
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:16,991
<i>When I close my eyes I see</i>

530
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:20,869
for that experience,
you paid 50 grand?

531
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:26,924
<i>Ohhh, we can begin again.</i>

532
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:33,009
All that matters is that the world wide web
won't be hosting mpegs of my old man...

533
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:36,097
...Defiling the love of my life.

534
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:39,760
For a guy who says he hates his father,
you sure did him a huge favor.

535
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:43,130
Well I've seen the tapes. I could testify
against him as well as anyone else.

536
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:45,654
You can also go to jail.
This is a serious crime.

537
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:46,376
Yeah?

538
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:48,816
where's the evidence?

539
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,421
I believe those are the tapes right there.

540
00:32:52,752 --> 00:32:53,697
Those are blank.

541
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:55,522
Blank tapes made you cry?

542
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:03,930
Yeah. I thought I'd save 
the "Daria" marathon on them.

543
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:04,889
Right.

544
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:08,997
And most people have a tape degausser
just hanging around on their coffee table.

545
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:12,664
Well, at least tell me this...

546
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:17,109
how did you manage to buy those
tapes for 1/10 of their market price?

547
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:18,777
Why, sir...

548
00:33:20,523 --> 00:33:22,825
I've always depended upon 
the kindness of strangers.

549
00:33:23,678 --> 00:33:25,497
Oh, kindness at the sheriff's department.

550
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:28,014
I seriously doubt it.

551
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:33,479
I'm not questioning your integrity.

552
00:33:33,683 --> 00:33:37,548
I'm just asking you for a logical 
response to the points I've raised.

553
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,925
Logical? Look, barbie, I've had 
a bellyful of your snide little digs.

554
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,913
Here's my final word.

555
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:51,445
I'll never, ever send two boys from good families
to jail on the word of that mexican whore!

556
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:54,047
I think it's time to take a break.

557
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:56,083
Uh, yeah. Good idea.

558
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:04,803
Miss foreman, I'd like to change my vote.

559
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,038
What?

560
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:10,081
Did god just speak to you?

561
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:12,260
Sir, I think that's a bit out of line.

562
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,067
You're right.

563
00:34:14,311 --> 00:34:15,486
I apologize.

564
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:17,485
And you know what?

565
00:34:17,684 --> 00:34:19,766
I'm changing my vote, too.

566
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:25,156
Even lying hookers deserve
a little holiday cheer, don't they?

567
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:26,949
Are you serious?

568
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:27,813
Of course I'm serious.

569
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:32,618
Light the yule log, crank the
mannheim steamroller. It's Christmas.

570
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:36,453
Those boys will appeal, and they'll win.

571
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:40,302
I'll sleep with visions of sugarplums
trusting their fate in a jury

572
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,652
that doesn't kowtow to 
a high school cheerleader!

573
00:34:45,913 --> 00:34:47,284
Yay!

574
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:49,474
Let me take this moment to thank you.

575
00:34:49,932 --> 00:34:52,050
I learned a lot about civic responsibility.

576
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:57,297
Pardon me.

577
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,340
Veronica?

578
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:03,015
I just wanted to congratulate 
you on the superb job you did.

579
00:35:03,738 --> 00:35:06,306
Most impressive, especially
for someone your age.

580
00:35:06,435 --> 00:35:06,993
Thanks.

581
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:10,366
I don't know if you've 
made plans for college,

582
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:12,515
but I think you'd fit right in at Hearst.

583
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:15,388
Stay here in Neptune?

584
00:35:16,164 --> 00:35:17,940
Well, we won't be moving the university.

585
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:23,940
I'd really kind of planned on having my car packed
and running during graduation ceremonies,

586
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:26,129
just to kind of beat 
the rush out of Neptune.

587
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:29,184
Then there's the other thing.

588
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:30,553
What other thing?

589
00:35:32,026 --> 00:35:34,410
The tuition.
Hearst is a bit pricy.

590
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:37,875
We have some very generous 
scholarship and grant programs.

591
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:40,688
You're our kind of student.

592
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:42,453
I'd fight for you.

593
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:47,294
So, life goes on.

594
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:48,317
Another day of work,

595
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:49,747
carry-out meatloaf,

596
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:51,944
two lousy days of holiday left.

597
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,224
And a freshly vandalized car.

598
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,641
Socially speaking, looks like I'm
right back where I was a year ago.

599
00:35:59,893 --> 00:36:04,552
Somehow I don't think I'd be very welcome 
anymore at Dick's new year's eve bash.

600
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:10,898
Tax reports?

601
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:13,402
Did you change careers 
without consulting me?

602
00:36:13,663 --> 00:36:16,634
My dad, the accountant, seriously less cool.

603
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:20,796
Oh, hey, did you hear about our verdict?
We voted to convict.

604
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:23,801
It's making me real popular
with my classmates.

605
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,109
It's not always easy doing the right thing.

606
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:30,128
If that phrase isn't on 
the Mars family crest, it should be.

607
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:32,487
What's with the janitorial supplies?

608
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:36,189
Oh, just tidying up after
a billion or so starlings.

609
00:36:36,264 --> 00:36:38,841
They seem to be the official
courthouse mascots.

610
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,680
Veronica.

611
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:44,131
What can you tell me about 
deputy Leo, about his family?

612
00:36:48,018 --> 00:36:51,566
Deputy, can you step in here for a moment?
I need to speak with you.

613
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:55,249
What's up, Keith?

614
00:36:57,939 --> 00:36:59,208
Tell me about your little sister.

615
00:37:03,673 --> 00:37:04,353
Tina?

616
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,772
What can I say? She's a great kid.

617
00:37:07,503 --> 00:37:08,440
She's 10 years old.

618
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:12,375
She's totally nuts about the 49ers.

619
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,951
She challenges me to crazy eights 
every night. She always wins.

620
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,490
She's got Down syndrome, though.

621
00:37:22,692 --> 00:37:24,142
so learning's kind of a struggle.

622
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,519
Is that why you stole the tapes?

623
00:37:44,748 --> 00:37:45,686
Keith...

624
00:37:49,577 --> 00:37:50,674
I'm so sorry.

625
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:54,039
Tina's having a really 
rough time in public school.

626
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:56,163
She's getting picked on.
She's falling way behind.

627
00:37:57,412 --> 00:37:59,874
And I want to send her to private school,
where she can get special care.

628
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,004
That's rough, Leo.

629
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,372
But I still don't see how 
you can justify what you've done.

630
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:14,239
You've really damaged 
the case against Echolls.

631
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:17,662
You know, Keith, there are several people,
including Veronica,

632
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:20,897
who saw those tapes that
can testify what's on them.

633
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:24,793
And I hope you realize
I didn't do this to get rich.

634
00:38:26,312 --> 00:38:28,069
I could have made
a whole lot more if I wanted to.

635
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:30,147
Yeah, like half a million.

636
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:33,094
That must have been hard to pass up.

637
00:38:34,002 --> 00:38:35,533
No, actually, it was easy.

638
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:37,773
I nearly gave the tapes back,

639
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:39,759
thinking about them plastered 
all over the internet...

640
00:38:41,178 --> 00:38:43,739
until I saw Logan Echolls in the hallway,

641
00:38:43,798 --> 00:38:46,484
poring over a list of all 
the departmental e-mail addresses.

642
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:49,182
I got his message, and

643
00:38:49,764 --> 00:38:50,941
I knew it was him.

644
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:55,604
He made it clear that he 
just wanted them destroyed.

645
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:01,922
Well, you know I can't just 
let you slide on this one, Leo.

646
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,005
I know.

647
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:08,517
I'm not asking you to.

648
00:39:09,606 --> 00:39:12,686
"Although no single cause can
directly account for the theft,

649
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,698
the primary factor appears to be insufficient
oversight by the designated caretakers,

650
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:20,579
most notably deputy Leo D'Amato.

651
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,240
While it is my strong belief that
Logan Echolls obtained the tapes,

652
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,110
the evidence has undoubtedly been destroyed.

653
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:30,446
For this reason, 
a conviction seems unlikely. "

654
00:39:34,815 --> 00:39:35,594
Keith Mars.

655
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,002
No, that's all right.
I'm just kind of shocked.

656
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:46,310
Look, I really appreciate 
you giving me the heads-up.

657
00:39:48,348 --> 00:39:49,597
Yeah, I hope so, too.

658
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:51,309
Bye.

659
00:39:57,991 --> 00:39:59,435
Do you see the moving truck out front?

660
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:04,476
Ms. "Moana" Lisa and mr. Outside-voice
next door finally got the boot.

661
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:07,181
Two old acquaintances
that should be forgotten.

662
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,522
Honey, there's something I need to tell you.

663
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:12,403
I just got a call from the hospital.

664
00:40:13,468 --> 00:40:14,410
Meg died.

665
00:40:15,462 --> 00:40:18,786
A blood clot dislodged
and made its way to her heart.

666
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:23,188
The baby?

667
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,587
A girl... she survived.

668
00:40:43,084 --> 00:40:44,201
New year's eve.

669
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:47,415
Someone just needs to change
the name to "same old year's eve"

670
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:51,047
because that "new," implying 
all that hope and promise,

671
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:52,802
it's not fooling anyone.

672
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,606
Okay... okay, babe,
I'm hitting the bunkhouse.

673
00:40:57,315 --> 00:40:59,600
But, dad,
you're gonna miss the ball.

674
00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:03,105
I saw it the past 40 years or so.

675
00:41:03,425 --> 00:41:04,975
You know... it drops.

676
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:07,544
You'll see.
Good night.

677
00:41:11,523 --> 00:41:12,727
We've still got pizza coming.

678
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,347
It's all yours.
Knock yourself out.

679
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:15,921
Cash is on the tv.

680
00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:30,177
Happy new year.

681
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:39,904
<i>And to the traditional
strains of "auld lang syne",</i>

682
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:44,168
<i>the joyful throng in times square 
begins to count down the final seconds</i>

683
00:41:44,533 --> 00:41:45,682
<i>of the old year.</i>

684
00:41:46,157 --> 00:41:47,946
Okay, I'm a sucker.

685
00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:50,886
I'll give this new year thing
one last chance.

686
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:55,035
Happy new year !

687
00:41:55,036 --> 00:41:59,099
