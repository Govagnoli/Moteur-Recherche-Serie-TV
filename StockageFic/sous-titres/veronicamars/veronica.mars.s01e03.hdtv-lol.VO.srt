1
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:40,569
Sarah Kramer.

2
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,912
You are gay. The girl's a mannequin.

3
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:44,437
She's in my chem. class.

4
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:46,260
She smells good.

5
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:50,806
Yeah, she's cute in a Hillary Duff-meet with the galleria-Teen People kind of way.

6
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:52,209
She's not hot.

7
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:56,285
Her.

8
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:58,149
Who, Veronica Mars?

9
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:00,673
Yeah, she comes into the video store.

10
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:02,633
You do know her dad's a private detective.

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,590
- Seriously? 
- No, in a movie.

12
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,510
Yes, seriously. She works with him.

13
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,900
Eight and a half, that's my final offer.

14
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:14,322
Dude. She's that smoking and a private eye? That's gotta make her at least a nine.

15
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:16,688
Guess what I'm doing this weekend.

16
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:19,157
I'm guessing it involves auto-eroticism.

17
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:23,682
Close. I will be cruising the marina in my Dad's Saber 386...

18
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,442
That's a luxury sailboat.

19
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,632
You know, wind through my hair, Strokes blasting through the speakers,

20
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:34,434
and with any luck, a wide-eyed impressionable vixen by my side.

21
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:36,826
Impressionable? Me? Ha.

22
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:40,901
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I said impressionable. Not you.

23
00:01:41,428 --> 00:01:44,024
You know, you might wanna check your ego at the door, there, missy.

24
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:54,996
Thanks, man.

25
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:04,673
The weird thing about going to high school with your ex is they're inescapable.

26
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:07,146
Everywhere you turn, there they are.

27
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:26,003
Lazy day, huh? Lazy day.

28
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:28,205
You gonna get off that raft anytime soon?

29
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:33,708
- What? 
- Listen, I was thinking about next summer.

30
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:38,154
And my friend Ron Curtis, he's an advisor to Senator Rake in Washington.

31
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:41,666
He's got an internship that is opening in his office.

32
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:45,725
I think that you should write him a letter and you should express your interest in politics.

33
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:50,144
You could tell him about your campaign for the student government,

34
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:54,318
you could tell him about all these different things that you do surrounding government...

35
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:01,121
So I got a call from your guidance counselor today. She wants to see me.

36
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,134
Any idea what for?

37
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:04,593
Nope.

38
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:07,133
Have you been playing nice with the other children?

39
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:10,486
You know, Dad, I'm Old School. An eye for an eye.

40
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:12,661
That's actually Old Testament.

41
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:18,667
Come on, no help? You're not going to give me any idea what to expect?

42
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:20,092
Honestly, I haven't a clue.

43
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:21,801
Can I ask you a question?

44
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:29,307
What do you think Mom was doing at the Camelot Motel with Jake Kane two weeks ago?

45
00:03:30,997 --> 00:03:33,400
I told you to stay away from that case.

46
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:36,573
I just don't understand. She's only in Arizona. Why haven't you been looking--

47
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:38,146
Veronica, please.

48
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,074
How about those Padres?

49
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:52,378
I just want to see him passionate about something.

50
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,430
As long as it's something you're passionate about.

51
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,975
No. Anything.

52
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:02,173
He's not going to get into a good college without some defining interests.

53
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:04,682
I think we could be a little more patient, Jake.

54
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:06,996
We all lost Lilly, and we miss her.

55
00:04:07,242 --> 00:04:09,960
But that doesn't mean we stop living our lives.

56
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:13,054
Do we got more liquid soap?

57
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:15,009
Check underneath the sink.

58
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,773
I'm going to go to the library, okay, don't wait up.

59
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,041
Where are you going, sweetie?

60
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,424
Just over to Shelly's.

61
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,674
Okay, well please be back before eleven. School tomorrow.

62
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:43,662
Excellent recommendation as always. Thank you.

63
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:48,404
Kevin Spacey is so amazing. And you should check out Body Heat.

64
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:50,903
These are late.

65
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:55,685
Rent it if you wanna rent it, I'm just saying I'm not going to watch it.

66
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:58,844
There's only so many times a girl can watch "Slapshot", you know what I'm saying?

67
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:02,224
So is it true your dad's a PI?

68
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:03,754
That's what it says on the sign.

69
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:05,143
And you work with him?

70
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,263
Sometimes.

71
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:08,895
Can I talk to you about something?

72
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:10,196
Sure.

73
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:12,593
It's kind of private.

74
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,323
Find me at school tomorrow.

75
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:20,343
I got the Cowboys too, just in case we need a backup.

76
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,578
Duncan? This is me reminding you to take your pill.

77
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,689
Darling, there's absolutely no shame in taking anti-depressants.

78
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:42,100
I don't know anyone who hasn't needed them at some point in their lives.

79
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:46,839
I know it's been rough since your sister died, but you've only been on them for, what, six months?

80
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:48,340
Just give it a little more time.

81
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:54,458
Will you be home for dinner?

82
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:56,701
- Yeah, sure thing, Mom. 
- Good.

83
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,469
Hey. What's going on?

84
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:40,119
Let's go out.

85
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,277
Finally! The girl comes to her senses!

86
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,241
Hey, did you hook up with Shelly last night?

87
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:50,451
Uh, she's a talker. She's a talker.

88
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,912
Turns out she has conflicted feelings for her new stepmom

89
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,991
and the color scheme the woman's chosen for the family--

90
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:57,716
- Man, I hate it when they talk. 
- Yeah, I know.

91
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:03,892
Hey, have you noticed that the new kid in town has been all over your trailer-park ex?

92
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:05,744
Let it be, Logan.

93
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,063
Okay, nowhere man. You be the fool on the hill.

94
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:10,746
See if I care...

95
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:15,053
Dude, you don't look so hot.

96
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,757
You okay?

97
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:35,488
Never better.

98
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,142
Okay.

99
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:44,120
That girl is seriously whack.

100
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,950
-  I don't think I'm supposed to be in here. 
- You wanna talk?

101
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,965
Uh, yeah. Do you think you could help find someone for me?

102
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,019
- Who? 
- My father.

103
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:55,931
He ran out about ten years ago and I haven't heard from him since.

104
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,979
Sounds like a winner. Are you sure you wanna find him?

105
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:01,272
Well yeah.

106
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:07,192
Maybe. I just gotta know what happened to him, you know?

107
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:09,408
Why now? Why haven't you looked for him before?

108
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:16,539
Well, my mom got laid off two months ago and she's working these two really crappy jobs,

109
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:19,812
and I'm working too, and we barely get by.

110
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:21,229
What  can you tell me about him?

111
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,147
Well, I haven't seen him since I was about six or so.

112
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:26,673
Okay, can you get me a picture?

113
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:27,931
Mom destroyed them all.

114
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:29,264
Last known address?

115
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,965
I was born in L.A., so we lived there 'til I was about two.

116
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:35,371
Can you get your hands on his social security number?

117
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,574
Mmm, no.

118
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:37,527
Date of birth?

119
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,922
Alright, the name. Can we manage that?

120
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:42,270
It's John...

121
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:43,994
Smith.

122
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:48,299
- Mr. Mars. Hi. Thank you for coming in. 
- Ms. James, yeah.

123
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:51,608
- I was a little surprised by your call. 
- Oh, I don't want you to worry.

124
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,196
Veronica's an excellent student.

125
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,000
I think she's amazing. She's got a great mind.

126
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:57,915
So why exactly am I here?

127
00:09:58,643 --> 00:10:04,853
Uh, well we've noticed a dramatic change in her over the last year.

128
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,696
She's late a lot, she has attitude with certain teachers,

129
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:16,114
she falls asleep in class, and socially, she seems to be a bit isolated.

130
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:20,245
Yeah, yeah she's gone through a rough year.

131
00:10:20,388 --> 00:10:23,235
I know. I know how close she was with Lilly Kane.

132
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:26,214
I'd say Veronica's doing pretty well given the circumstances.

133
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:28,630
Where are you going with all this?

134
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,250
Look, if you find this difficult, and many single fathers with daughters do,

135
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:34,576
I would be more than happy to talk to her.

136
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:38,641
No. No, I can handle it. Thank you for the heads-up.

137
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:39,741
Anytime.

138
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:47,683
A life coach?

139
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:51,774
Didn't we just have a discussion about our son's lack of focus?

140
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:57,011
No, no, no, you're right. Let's get him an astrologist, too. Maybe a past life consultant.

141
00:10:57,077 --> 00:11:01,128
And throw in a Pilates coach if yours can free up some time.

142
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,534
Raise your glasses everyone, I'd like to make a toast.

143
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:08,947
To Molly.

144
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,770
Molly. Who's Molly?

145
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,280
Our old dog. The lab.

146
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,470
Yes. Sweet old Molly, God rest her soul, but boy, could that dog catch a Frisbee!

147
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:22,243
Huh, if only she had the good sense not to whiz in our flower beds, she'd still be with us!

148
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,815
Duncan, honey, it's been six years. When are you going to let this go?

149
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,514
I'm sure she was placed in a very happy home.

150
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:33,691
To Molly. The best friend a boy could have.

151
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:40,998
You going to study hall later?

152
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:43,502
No, dude, I can't. I'm going to hook up with Veronica Mars.

153
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:45,586
Yeah, and I'm going parasailing with Halle Berry.

154
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:47,844
No, I'm serious. She's working this case for me.

155
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:49,401
She's going to find my missing dad.

156
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,593
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't your dad die like seven years ago?

157
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:57,464
Well, then I guess it's going to take her a long time to find him.

158
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:09,506
Hello, you've reached the administration office of the Stanford Summer Program.

159
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:13,218
No one's here to take your call right now, but leave us a message and we'll call you back.

160
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,283
Sorry.

161
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:18,662
- Keith Mars. 
- Hi, sir. Wallace Fennel.

162
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:20,649
Wallace is a friend of mine.

163
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,423
Take that, high school guidance counselor!

164
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:26,352
Ah. Hello, Wallace. Now, what's going on here?

165
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,076
Helping a kid at school locate his deadbeat dad,

166
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:31,906
the somewhat inconveniently named John Smith.

167
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:35,307
But I've narrowed the field down to 440 John Smiths,

168
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:39,393
so I'm sending each of them a letter addressed to his son, congratulating him on a scholarship.

169
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:42,336
And I figure if our John Smith has any conscience at all,

170
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,684
he'll see the name of his son, open the letter, and call to say he's got the wrong address.

171
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,331
Part of me is proud...

172
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:52,280
and let's just leave it at that.

173
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,236
Oh, I used one of the dedicated phone lines, I hope that's alright.

174
00:12:57,313 --> 00:12:59,252
We're going to trace all the calls that come in.

175
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:01,304
So how did she rope you into this?

176
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:04,317
She promised me all the answer keys to...

177
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:06,322
She just promised to be my friend.

178
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,395
I'd've held out for a better offer.

179
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:12,897
I'll be in my office.

180
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:18,028
Hey, would you do me a favor?

181
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:21,126
Why did all the hair on the back of my neck just stick up?

182
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:22,493
It's not that big of a deal.

183
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:27,521
It's just, the next time you're in the administrations office, could you borrow my permanent file?

184
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:30,295
I wanna see what that counselor is telling Dad.

185
00:13:30,494 --> 00:13:32,727
Oh yeah, no big deal. I can get expelled for that.

186
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:37,714
Morning, Darling.

187
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:43,530
Your pill's on the counter. Don't forget.

188
00:13:43,962 --> 00:13:45,497
Great. Thanks.

189
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,276
Sofia.

190
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:00,621
You called your geometry teacher a jackass?

191
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,130
That was totally taken out of context, let me see it.

192
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:07,196
Ah, ah. Hold up, Grabby. I'm discovering a whole new side of you.

193
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:11,834
Damn, Ms. Applebaum loved her some Veronica Mars.

194
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:17,743
"Veronica Mars is a complete angel, and a joy to have in class every day."

195
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:20,646
Mrs. Applebaum? That file goes to the second grade?

196
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:22,582
Kindergarten.

197
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,787
Ooh, sweet. You wrote your teacher a poem.

198
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,356
Okay, yes, I was a kiss-ass. You've outed me. Now can I see it?

199
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:39,949
- So, uh, any leads yet? 
- We should know something by next week.

200
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:41,833
Oh,  hey I got something for you.

201
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:46,897
I just burned a few songs for you. It has the new 311 on there.

202
00:14:47,097 --> 00:14:47,998
Thanks.

203
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:51,183
You know, I just thought if you were on a stakeout or something,

204
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,185
you might need something to get you through the night.

205
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,999
Yeah, okay. Later.

206
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:01,843
- He brought you a mix tape. 
- Shut up.

207
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:04,304
Hey, do me a favor.

208
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:07,474
- Please be kidding. 
- Get me his file.

209
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:12,892
Then we get the idea to make it onto America's Funniest Home Videos with this fake shark plan.

210
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,747
Oh my God, I remember that. That was you?

211
00:15:15,943 --> 00:15:21,094
The plan was to cut off the dorsel fin, nail it to a board, strap the board to my back,

212
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:22,938
and have me swim around the public beach.

213
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,239
And Duncan's going to stand on the shore and videotape the mob scene.

214
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,725
But it never happens.

215
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,749
I'm swimming out there for like fifteen minutes, no one even notices.

216
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:35,057
- You guys were idiots. 
- Yes, yes we were.

217
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:38,834
Finally, the life guard, he spots me.

218
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,217
The clod pulls out a rofle. Okay, lucky for me, Duncan spots him.

219
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,119
He goes sprinting toward the lifeguard tower. He was bawling his eyes out, I might add.

220
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:51,486
So he's running, he's shouting, "No, no! Don't shoot! That's my friend! That's my friend!"

221
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,204
He saved my life.

222
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:57,442
That's one way of looking at it.

223
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:02,525
I'm kinda tired of this song.

224
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:09,309
I would've expected sex, had that worked.

225
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:11,869
Had that worked, you would've gotten it.

226
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:14,342
Try it again.

227
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:18,760
Check?

228
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,490
Let me see your phone.

229
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:29,134
What are you doing?

230
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,621
It is now Booty Call enabled.

231
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,939
In case I need a little late night action?

232
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:39,984
Action. Investment advice. Whatever.

233
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:46,803
- So... 
- I should really get home.

234
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:50,690
I'd invite you over but it's a school night and my dad owns a handgun.

235
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,984
He says he can look into a guy's eyes and tell his true intentions, which I know sounds like a myth, but I--

236
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:02,102
Aah, okay, then.

237
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,404
And a good night to you.

238
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:51,413
How was your date?

239
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,487
Oh, you know.

240
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:56,917
Lousy conversation, but the sex was fantastic.

241
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:58,193
That's not funny.

242
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:02,171
I don't know. I'm pretty sure it was.

243
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:11,402
Brain? Check.

244
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:13,318
Dead sexy? Check.

245
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,376
Devilish charm? Check.

246
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:17,490
Formidable scrabble opponent?

247
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,844
Who cares.

248
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:24,964
What's wrong with you, Veronica?

249
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,111
What are you waiting for?

250
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:41,682
Veronica...

251
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,010
What did you just call me?

252
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:56,648
Justin's permanent file.

253
00:18:58,232 --> 00:18:59,863
You might wanna take a look at that.

254
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:02,278
Why? Is it gonna self destruct in five seconds?

255
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,177
I need to talk to Justin.

256
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:14,942
Alone.

257
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,592
See you guys.

258
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,806
Explain this.

259
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:27,152
- My evaluation from first grade? 
- Yeah. Read it to me.

260
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:32,023
"Justin shows talent in his finger-painting and other arts and crafts projects."

261
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:32,974
Further down.

262
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:37,869
"For the past several months, Justin has been moody and withdrawn.

263
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:42,170
This behavior is not surprising in light of... his father's recent death.

264
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:44,463
Oops.

265
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:47,837
Everything you told me was a lie, Justin. You wasted my time.

266
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:52,374
That drives me crazy. And you owe me $150 in postage.

267
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:58,708
Excuse me, are you Justin Smith?

268
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,202
Yeah.

269
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:01,688
This came for you.

270
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:03,049
Thanks.

271
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:11,847
It's the scholarship letter that you sent out.

272
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:13,833
And there's a note.

273
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:20,172
It's from my father.

274
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:36,616
Someone to see you.

275
00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:38,292
Describe this someone.

276
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:43,068
White male. Pint-size. Desperate. Not having a good day.

277
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:49,608
Hey.

278
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:53,574
So, I bicycled all the way over here.

279
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:55,827
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

280
00:20:55,936 --> 00:20:57,363
You could've save it 'til tomorrow.

281
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:02,514
So, I showed my Mom the letter. She got all mad.

282
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,098
- Made me promise not to try to find my dad. 
- So he really is alive?

283
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:10,148
My mom actually said I was better off this way, thinking he was dead.

284
00:21:10,322 --> 00:21:11,419
Maybe you were.

285
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:15,464
I have a dad somewhere out there in the world.

286
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,484
How can I not try to find out what happened to him?

287
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:22,078
It would kill me.

288
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:26,569
Let me see the letter again.

289
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,199
The letter Justin received from his dad bore a San Diego postmark.

290
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:40,582
Of the 440 John Smiths out there, only three were in San Diego.

291
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,357
Come in.

292
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:46,613
Hi.

293
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:51,901
- I couldn't help but overhear. 
- Yeah, sorry.

294
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:53,618
No, it's not that.

295
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:59,511
It's just that I never want you to think your mom's the villain in all this.

296
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,587
- Isn't she? 
- No, it's not that simple.

297
00:22:03,064 --> 00:22:04,089
Yeah, it is.

298
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:09,039
The hero is the one that stays. And the villain is the one that splits.

299
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:13,658
I don't think that's a healthy perspective.

300
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:17,819
It's  healthier than me pining away every day praying she'll come home.

301
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,881
The truth was, I'd figured out exactly where my mother was staying.

302
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,274
But I wasn't about to tell him that.

303
00:22:45,586 --> 00:22:46,416
Wait up!

304
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:49,186
Don't run, Veronica. People might think that you're desperate.

305
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:51,627
That would be a step up, reputation-wise.

306
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:56,937
I guess that all depends on who you're asking.

307
00:23:02,565 --> 00:23:04,069
Go Pirates!

308
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:10,691
Hey, I thought your boy-toy Troy was going to join us for Happy Hour this afternoon.

309
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:14,862
You don't suppose he got way laid by Veronica, do you?

310
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:25,892
Ohh, Grasshopper to slow for Kung-Fu Master.

311
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:31,246
If you can take the flask out of my hand, then you will be the new master.

312
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,678
Wait, wait, wait, guys. Check it out, guys.

313
00:23:37,995 --> 00:23:40,807
Six guys. Bleachers.

314
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:43,360
Jump in when you're feeling this, okay?

315
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:48,409
"Summer lovin', had me a blast..."

316
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:50,596
- What has gotten into you, man? 
- Hey, check it out!

317
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:01,905
Crazy guy!

318
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,518
I think I might have given you the wrong impression.

319
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:14,399
I had a really great time, I just--

320
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,102
It's just that you need more, and you know, you get to fill in the blank here:

321
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:22,964
a) time, b) space, c)--

322
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:45,852
You okay, man? What was that, a triple klutz?

323
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,763
He needs to go to the hospital.

324
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,133
Hey, Duncan, open your mouth! This'll help.

325
00:24:57,422 --> 00:24:58,276
Come on...

326
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:04,422
Death-defying stunts? Gushing head wound?

327
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,527
You are the man, brother.

328
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,869
And, I almost stuck the landing.

329
00:25:12,818 --> 00:25:14,007
You sure you don't want some help?

330
00:25:14,314 --> 00:25:15,691
No, thanks I got it.

331
00:25:16,285 --> 00:25:19,382
Put your seatbelt on. Hold the towel tighter!

332
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:44,947
Remember how things used to be?

333
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:48,176
You mean between us? Or before Lilly died?

334
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:50,860
Or two weeks ago before your friend took an interest in me?

335
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,513
- Veronica? 
- Not really, no.

336
00:26:04,178 --> 00:26:06,066
Do you want your girlfriend to stay in here with you?

337
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,461
- Oh, I'm not his girlfriend. 
- Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

338
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,621
Well, here you are.

339
00:26:14,085 --> 00:26:15,846
Veronica, we meet again.

340
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:17,494
What are the odds.

341
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,394
Veronica brought me in.

342
00:26:20,889 --> 00:26:22,016
Thank you, Veronica.

343
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:24,861
I think I can handle it from here.

344
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:27,843
Okay, I have stuff to do anyways.

345
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,007
Jeez. Off a bleacher?

346
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:42,045
Well, everything is fine.

347
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:46,944
There's no fractures, and nothing that a few stitches won't fix.

348
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:49,563
I still don't understand how this happened, Duncan.

349
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,120
What possessed you to jump off a set of bleachers?

350
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:55,203
Dad?

351
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:58,286
Can I talk with Dr. Levine for a minute?

352
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:00,561
By myself?

353
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:06,924
Yeah. Fine.

354
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:15,658
Of the 440 John Smiths out there, only three were in San Diego.

355
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:18,669
My mission: find and photograph them.

356
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:21,941
Of course, Justin hadn't seen his father since he was six.

357
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:24,286
There was no guarantee he could I.D. him.

358
00:27:24,348 --> 00:27:26,651
Hey, are you sure you don't have any pictures of your dad?

359
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,260
Nah, I don't think so.

360
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:32,304
My mom cut him out of all of them. But, um, I could take a look.

361
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,363
Excuse me?

362
00:27:33,978 --> 00:27:35,615
Um, can I call you back?

363
00:27:35,694 --> 00:27:37,435
Yeah, just bring me whatever you have.

364
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:38,387
Bye.

365
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:43,410
Last time I was in, you mentioned Body Heat. Do you have that on DVD?

366
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:46,344
Looks like I'd have to special order it.

367
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:47,541
Alright, sounds good.

368
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:52,610
Ultimately, it is your decision and you should do what's right for you.

369
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:54,611
But I have to warn you,

370
00:27:55,893 --> 00:27:59,859
going cold turkey off anti-depressants can have some serious side effects.

371
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:03,786
- You're likely to feel nauseous. 
- Yeah, plenty of that.

372
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:08,758
It's also possible that you'll suffer from hallucinations and particularly vivid dreams.

373
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:12,947
And this can go on for weeks. Some people find that unnerving.

374
00:28:13,931 --> 00:28:15,113
It's worth it.

375
00:28:16,474 --> 00:28:17,504
- Hey. 
- Hi.

376
00:28:17,692 --> 00:28:19,757
Thanks for making the time to see me.

377
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:30,187
I owe you an apology. I was abrupt and defensive the other day.

378
00:28:30,914 --> 00:28:36,591
Well, on a defensive parent scale of one to ten, I'd say three. So don't worry about it.

379
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:41,753
And you were right. I think, I think Veronica does need someone to talk to

380
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:48,337
and I'm afraid that in this case I'm, I'm not equipped to be that person.

381
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:50,621
- I would be happy to talk to her. 
- Thank you.

382
00:28:50,738 --> 00:28:51,572
Yeah.

383
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,438
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, would you mind? 
- Sure, yeah.

384
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:58,050
Can you hang on? I'm going to take this.

385
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:03,354
Oh! Um, hi. Can I call you right back? Fine.

386
00:29:03,513 --> 00:29:04,736
I got it.

387
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:07,763
Oh, gee, thank you so much. I'm a coffee addict.

388
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:14,055
Thanks again.

389
00:29:14,982 --> 00:29:15,751
Sure.

390
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:22,190
Sheriff Mars?

391
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:25,375
You always had my vote.

392
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:36,374
I picked up all the John Smiths at the addresses and followed them until I got good shots.

393
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:40,430
Here's the first one. He's a veterinarian and married,

394
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,854
and there's a swing set in the back, so I'm guessing he's got kids.

395
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:46,111
No, it's definitely not him.

396
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:47,520
Okay.

397
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:52,000
John Smith number two. He's single and he coaches basketball.

398
00:29:52,118 --> 00:29:53,480
No, it's not him either.

399
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:56,547
Mom always turns off the radio when they play "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man"

400
00:29:56,603 --> 00:30:00,941
because it reminds her of Dad. And these guys' eyes are green. It's not him.

401
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:03,956
Finally, John Smith number three.

402
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,695
Yeah, that could be him.

403
00:30:11,123 --> 00:30:13,488
Do you have any pictures without the sunglasses?

404
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,251
He had them on the whole time.

405
00:30:15,644 --> 00:30:17,533
So, what does this guy do?

406
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,926
I followed him from the junk yard to the pawn shop to the race track.

407
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:22,854
Sweet.

408
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:25,115
My best guess would be petty criminal.

409
00:30:26,985 --> 00:30:30,380
Well, can we go back there?

410
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,857
I mean, I know if I could see him up close I could I.D. him.

411
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:33,871
I don't think so.

412
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:35,690
Come on, one way or the other, I'd know.

413
00:30:35,976 --> 00:30:37,154
Give the kid a break.

414
00:30:39,995 --> 00:30:42,381
Alright, fine. Meet me at my car after school,

415
00:30:42,443 --> 00:30:45,345
but remember, I'm the one in charge and you'll do as I say.

416
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,864
You should have seen her before charm school.

417
00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:48,862
I promise.

418
00:30:49,118 --> 00:30:52,585
Wait, I brought you the best pictures I have of Dad.

419
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,501
In this one, you can actually see his hand.

420
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,602
Wow, your mom really hated him, didn't she?

421
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:00,531
- Yeah. 
- Cool cars.

422
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:04,945
Mom says he was obsessed with them. Hey, what did John Smith 3 drive?

423
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:06,957
Sebring convertible.

424
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,372
Alright, I'll see you guys after school.

425
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:17,766
That's him, right in front of the Honda.

426
00:31:18,012 --> 00:31:18,918
There he goes.

427
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:21,821
- You're gonna lose him. 
- I'm not gonna lose him.

428
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:37,657
Lay low. Try not to look too conspicuous.

429
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:45,566
Hey!

430
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:52,571
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hey!

431
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:59,448
- You need something, bro? 
- No. I'm sorry.

432
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,829
I just thought you were somebody else.

433
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:11,802
It's not him. Dang.

434
00:32:15,822 --> 00:32:16,815
What are you doing?

435
00:32:17,557 --> 00:32:18,843
Let me see the letter again.

436
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:28,064
It's the exact same handwriting.

437
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,043
Yo, Bro. How could you watch this crap? It could not be more boring.

438
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,315
Oh, what the hell?

439
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,221
- Lilly? 
- Yeah, what? You forgot about me already?

440
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:54,944
Wh-what are you--

441
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:57,698
You know, it makes absolutely no sense.

442
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,844
My disappearance.

443
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:04,381
Murder. Whatever. How it supposedly went down.

444
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:06,096
So bogus, right?

445
00:33:07,823 --> 00:33:11,134
Hey, here's the thing. The truth is gonna come out.

446
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,001
What are you talking about?

447
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:15,890
Clue in, Donut.

448
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:20,441
It doesn't add up! You know that, deep down inside. I wish you'd just admit it to yourself.

449
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:23,766
Break out of your stupor. Wake up!

450
00:34:03,856 --> 00:34:04,725
What's this?

451
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:07,869
It's a taser and it's dangerous! Put it back.

452
00:34:10,557 --> 00:34:13,384
- I'm coming with you. 
- No. I need you to stay in the car.

453
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:24,995
Hmm. A classic car perhaps?

454
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:52,040
A Hyundai Sonata? I don't think it qualifies as a classic.

455
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,344
What the hell are you doing?

456
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:57,068
Stay right there. I'm calling the police.

457
00:34:57,149 --> 00:34:59,924
You're not going to do that. I followed you and I know what you do.

458
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:02,207
What I do?

459
00:35:02,924 --> 00:35:04,282
I'm a parole officer.

460
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,644
What?

461
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,163
Why would you be following me?

462
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:11,777
I'm a friend of your son's. He just wants to see you.

463
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:14,020
I don't have a son. Don't move.

464
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:17,147
Are you trying to tell me you're not John Smith?

465
00:35:38,509 --> 00:35:39,630
Justin.

466
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:48,625
Dad?

467
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:58,298
Oh my God.

468
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,283
You're a woman.

469
00:36:03,142 --> 00:36:04,620
I don't believe this.

470
00:36:05,441 --> 00:36:06,899
This is hard, I know.

471
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,247
I wish I could've found a way to tell you.

472
00:36:10,396 --> 00:36:14,328
Did you also know I thought you were dead since I was eleven?

473
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:16,331
No.

474
00:36:18,086 --> 00:36:21,317
I'm not surprised. Your mother threatened she would say that.

475
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:24,129
And your little visits to the video store?

476
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:26,233
What's that all about, huh?

477
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,484
I wanted to see you. Can you understand that?

478
00:36:30,017 --> 00:36:32,721
I wanted to see for myself that you were alright.

479
00:36:33,687 --> 00:36:36,837
Well, I'm not, actually. Okay? I'm not.

480
00:36:37,768 --> 00:36:42,637
Turns out my Mom's a liar. And my father is a circus freak.

481
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:44,696
Justin, maybe we should go.

482
00:36:45,116 --> 00:36:50,635
This is something I had to do. This is who I am.

483
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:53,907
Come on, Veronica. Let's get out of here.

484
00:36:58,336 --> 00:37:00,337
It was nice meeting everyone.

485
00:37:10,204 --> 00:37:11,929
Ninety miles.

486
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:16,374
What's ninety miles?

487
00:37:17,923 --> 00:37:23,548
It's the distance your dad travels every week to see you for a few seconds.

488
00:37:30,894 --> 00:37:36,147
Look, my Mom's been missing too, and honestly, I would give anything

489
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,649
to feel that she cared about me enough to do that.

490
00:37:49,024 --> 00:37:52,163
She wasn't going to find me. I was going to have to find her.

491
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:56,570
I've decided to drive to Arizona after school.

492
00:37:56,669 --> 00:37:59,265
If the roads are clear, I can make it there in four hours.

493
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:09,551
Tragedy blows through your life like a tornado, uprooting everything. Creating chaos.

494
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:12,879
You wait for the dust to settle and then you choose.

495
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:35,167
You can live in the wreckage and pretend it's still the mansion you remember.

496
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:45,422
Hey. How's your head?

497
00:38:47,573 --> 00:38:48,790
It's better.

498
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:55,672
Or you can crawl from the rubble and slowly rebuild.

499
00:38:56,148 --> 00:38:59,886
- Hey! I didn't know you came here. 
- Yeah, I just discovered this place.

500
00:38:59,982 --> 00:39:00,988
Yeah, me too.

501
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:03,685
So how've we missed each other?

502
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,663
Hey Justin, did you special order Body Heat for someone?

503
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:12,235
Because after disaster strikes, the important thing is that you move on.

504
00:39:12,332 --> 00:39:13,169
Right.

505
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:16,546
Hello?

506
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:20,760
Julia? It's Justin.

507
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,452
Hey, listen, that copy of Body Heat you wanted came in.

508
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,769
No, that's fine. Yeah, I work here every Saturday.

509
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:34,303
That's great. Okay.

510
00:39:34,887 --> 00:39:35,940
I'll see you then.

511
00:39:36,798 --> 00:39:38,045
Bye.

512
00:39:42,961 --> 00:39:46,823
But if you're like me, you just keep chasing the storm.

513
00:39:56,838 --> 00:39:57,552
Mom?

514
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:00,353
Mom?

515
00:40:02,892 --> 00:40:03,682
Mom?

516
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:06,411
Can I help you?

517
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:10,905
I'm looking for Lianne Mars.

518
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,248
Veronica?

519
00:40:13,655 --> 00:40:15,980
Oh! I'm Adrianna.

520
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:21,218
A college friend of your Mom's. I feel like I know you, your mother talks about you all the time.

521
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:22,200
Where is she?

522
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:23,799
She left a couple weeks ago.

523
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,359
Well... did she say where she was going?

524
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:30,249
No.

525
00:40:31,643 --> 00:40:32,989
Don't lie to me!

526
00:40:34,055 --> 00:40:35,394
I need to know.

527
00:40:36,178 --> 00:40:37,366
Where is she?

528
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:41,806
She thought your father might come looking for her and she knows I'm no good at keeping secrets.

529
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:44,556
Doesn't she care about me?

530
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:47,669
You're all she cares about.

531
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:54,063
Mark me down as skeptical.

532
00:41:01,455 --> 00:41:06,095
The problem with chasing the storm is that it wears you down. Breaks your spirit.

533
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:11,107
Even the experts agree. A girl needs closure.

534
00:41:28,426 --> 00:41:31,414
Hi. I'm outside your house.

535
00:41:52,786 --> 00:41:54,347
It's about time.

536
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:07,536
