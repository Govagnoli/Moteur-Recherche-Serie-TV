1
00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:02,346
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,352
I've walked right into the River Stix,

3
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:06,453
home base for
the fighting Fitzpatricks.

4
00:00:06,454 --> 00:00:08,636
I have information about
that mexican kid who got killed.

5
00:00:08,637 --> 00:00:11,005
Your dad is in deep
to the Fitzpatrick family.

6
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:14,627
Toying with a sweet little girl's
heart just to screw with her dad?

7
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:17,125
Jackie and I borrowed one
of Terrence's cars tonight.

8
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:18,845
I was digging around 
where he keeps them,

9
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:21,056
and I found some sort of explosive.

10
00:00:21,057 --> 00:00:21,994
Is that c-4?

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,312
You'll have to wait 
for the press conference.

12
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,513
- Flat?
- Just as god made me.

13
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:27,337
I'm Troy, by the way.

14
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:28,228
I'm Veronica.

15
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:30,698
I'm just glad we weren't dating

16
00:00:30,772 --> 00:00:32,015
when you were kicked out
of those two schools

17
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:33,801
for drug possession and trafficking.

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,561
County supervisor's office?

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,974
Well read, Dick.

20
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:41,480
You're making great strides.

21
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,451
So, good news...

22
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:47,042
you are no longer writing about
the use of mythic archetype

23
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:49,415
in "portrait of the artist
as a young man. "

24
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:50,220
All right.

25
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:54,113
You are all instead entering our mayor,
Woody Goodman's,

26
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:56,261
county-wide essay contest

27
00:00:56,705 --> 00:01:00,160
on the subject of... freedom.

28
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,986
The winner gets a week's internship
as Woody's apprentice,

29
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:08,963
which means an opportunity
to learn about civic affairs,

30
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:12,360
a plum entry on your
college applications, and...

31
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:13,961
this might interest you, Dick...

32
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:17,681
a chance to stand beside
Woody Goodman on tv

33
00:01:17,682 --> 00:01:22,407
and push the plunger for
the demolition of old shark stadium.

34
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:24,892
Nuke the stadium.

35
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:27,103
Damn. Now I totally wish
I could write good.

36
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:31,165
So, you should be able 
to write quite an essay on freedom.

37
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:34,114
How does it feel
to have your case dismissed?

38
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:37,192
Freedom feels liberating.

39
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,488
So, you've got your title.

40
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:43,065
And did Hannah understand why
you wouldn't be seeing her anymore?

41
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,413
You didn't tell her,
did you?

42
00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:48,160
You owe her an explanation.

43
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:50,100
What exactly am I supposed to say?

44
00:01:54,273 --> 00:01:56,125
Man, you believe it about Logan?

45
00:01:56,206 --> 00:01:57,266
That guy's like a cat.

46
00:01:57,338 --> 00:01:59,275
You mean useless and selfish?

47
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:01,171
I mean like nine lives.

48
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:03,118
I just wish I knew how he does it.

49
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,707
That's funny. I do know how
he does it, and I wish I didn'T.

50
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:06,862
What you got?

51
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:08,206
The pamphlet?

52
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:10,020
From the Hearst packet
that we both got,

53
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:13,735
in the envelope that
we both got that you didn't open.

54
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:15,120
Oh, that.

55
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:17,958
You know the average S.A.T.
Score for a Hearst freshman?

56
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:19,139
1280.

57
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,603
And you got an 1140,
so you're doomed,

58
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:24,745
and we can kiss this
"get to know Hearst" weekend goodbye.

59
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:26,054
Not so fast.

60
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:27,680
Now, if you average
in my points, assists,

61
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,718
and free-throw percentage,
it all balances out.

62
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,313
Now, that coach says it's down to me
and one other guy for that scholarship,

63
00:02:32,314 --> 00:02:33,720
so we are going.

64
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:36,606
Come on. You'll like it.
It's a good school.

65
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:39,227
And if it were in, say, Maine,
I'd be excited.

66
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:41,192
But it's in Neptune,
so I'm not excited.

67
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:46,524
I'll go, but just to skip school,
which excites me.

68
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:52,109
Don't leave me hanging.

69
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,531
Okay, forget five.
Give me two.

70
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:58,927
Where have you been all day?

71
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,272
I wanted to congratulate you on
the big news, but I couldn't find you.

72
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,108
I ended up telling the janitor that
your locker was mine and I forgot my

73
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,770
combination so he'd open it up and
I could leave you a little surprise.

74
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:12,408
But I made it before I heard
they dropped the charges,

75
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,357
so keep that in mind.

76
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,149
You lied to a janitor?

77
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:17,614
I've resigned myself 
to burning in hell.

78
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:21,166
You know, all the girls
on track are jealous of me.

79
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:24,777
I'm sure they could burn in hell, too,
if they'd just put in the effort.

80
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:26,151
No.

81
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,573
They're jealous because 
after the meet on sunday

82
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:29,881
they're going to Rusty's Ranch

83
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:32,961
and I'm going sailing 
with this totally hot senior.

84
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:34,890
We can't see each other anymore.

85
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:36,885
What?

86
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:42,064
So, what...

87
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,752
is this some kind of weird joke
that's going over my head?

88
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:48,047
I mean, 
you're a really sweet girl, but...

89
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:49,085
but what?

90
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:51,447
But I'm not a sweet guy.

91
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:00,077
If this is really some kind of joke,

92
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:02,352
please tell me the punch line soon.

93
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:07,308
'Cause I could really use
a laugh about now.

94
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:11,162
Hey, is this the tour?

95
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:12,885
All right,
everyone gather 'round.

96
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,839
Welcome to the little slice of liberal
arts paradise known as Hearst college.

97
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:19,824
My name is Dean.
I'm going to be your tour guide.

98
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:22,395
So, as you know,
this is going to be a three-day tour,

99
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:25,135
and it's important that 
we all get to know each other.

100
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:27,149
So right now we're going to play 
a little "get to know you" game,

101
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,688
so everyone... everyone pair up.

102
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:33,623
Oh, make sure it's someone 
that you don't already know.

103
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,691
Sorry, I don't know her.

104
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:43,435
And so, it turns out college
is very much like high school.

105
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,277
Ok so, we're gonna play a game 
called "two truths and a lie. "

106
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:47,165
Does everyone have a buddy?

107
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:53,466
All alone?

108
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:55,067
It's all right.
I prefer it.

109
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:57,056
Lie... see, that's how the game works.

110
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:58,847
You have to tell your partner
two facts and one lie,

111
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:00,957
and they have to guess
which one is the lie, all right?

112
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:03,068
Okay, so, go ahead.

113
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:06,220
Okay, I'm Veronica,

114
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:07,895
I'm from Neptune,

115
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:12,518
and I once shot a man 
in Reno just to watch him die.

116
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,610
How'd that go?

117
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,084
It was a bit of a letdown.

118
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:17,434
Well, I don't believe 
that you're from Neptune.

119
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:18,557
Wrong.

120
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:20,063
Is that the end?

121
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:22,374
Um, okay.
Well, my name is Dean.

122
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,891
I'm from Wheaton,
Illinois,

123
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:25,957
my father owns a Ford dealership,

124
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,225
and I also shot a man in Reno,
but it was not to watch him die.

125
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:31,028
It was for other issues.

126
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:33,542
Your father doesn't sell Fords.

127
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:35,411
That's right... Toyotas.
How did you know?

128
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:36,522
It's all in the eyes.

129
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:39,884
Yeah. Oh well I guess I'll have to
watch out for you next year.

130
00:05:39,885 --> 00:05:41,705
Oh, I won't be attending.

131
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:44,238
Enough lies. I think I've got you
a new partner.

132
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,216
Are you with the tour?

133
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:46,003
Yeah, that's right.

134
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:48,644
Okay, come meet potential
new classmate Veronica.

135
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:50,543
Veronica, meet...

136
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:53,689
Troy Vandergraff.

137
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,464
Do you two know each other?

138
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:57,157
'Cause you're not supposed 
to be with someone you know.

139
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:59,883
Nope,
I don't know him at all.

140
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:06,922
<i>A long time ago,</i>

141
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:09,751
<i>We used to be friends, but I</i>

142
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:13,421
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

143
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:16,797
<i>Come on, now, sugar!</i>

144
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,490
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

145
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,863
<i>Just remember me when</i>

146
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:25,167
<i>We used to be friends</i>

147
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:27,512
<i>A long time ago</i>

148
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,031
<i>We used to be friends</i>

149
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:34,659
<i>Veronica Mars 2x16
The Rapes of Graff</i>

150
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:41,851
Uh, so, this is weird.

151
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:44,591
Um, how you been,
Veronica?

152
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:47,982
Lie... I don't believe you're 
really interested. Next statement?

153
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:51,359
Okay, I can understand that
after what I did, but I'm sorry.

154
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,102
I don't think you understand
the rules of this game.

155
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,877
You only get one lie.

156
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:57,680
Okay, uh, let me start over.

157
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:00,128
Three statements, one false.

158
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,731
Um, my name's Troy.

159
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:07,654
I was a bad boy when we dated,
but after a year of private school,

160
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:11,658
therapy, quitting drugs, and dumping
my loose-cannon ex-girlfriend,

161
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,370
I've changed into 
a more-or-less good boy.

162
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:19,954
And I communicate telepathically
with all denizens of the sea.

163
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:25,315
Right. So, how long before 
I catch you talking to a manatee?

164
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:29,243
And you have changed not at all.

165
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,008
You know me...
same old, same old.

166
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,849
All right, everyone,
follow me, please.

167
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,582
We're gonna get the tour started,
so come this way. Stay in a group.

168
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,599
I'm not lying to you, Veronica.
I just want you to know that.

169
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,009
Do I care?

170
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,237
Really, Troy, you're just
water under the bridge...

171
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:52,100
duplicitous, evil water.

172
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:11,234
Dude! So, we hanging this weekend,

173
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:14,027
or that chick still have your sac
locked up in her easy-bake oven?

174
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,244
Actually,
I am now a free man.

175
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:18,489
The way we should be, man.

176
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,488
We?

177
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:21,763
What happened to Madison?

178
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:22,766
Bailed.

179
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,069
According to her friend,
she met someone more mature.

180
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:26,586
Where, at legoland?

181
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:27,822
Whatever, man.

182
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:31,415
Maturity's one of the two most
overrated things on the planet.

183
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,508
The other being?

184
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:33,526
Chicks.

185
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:35,585
Oh, so, this worked out great for you.

186
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:37,433
Dude, why do you think
I'm in such a good mood?

187
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:40,827
Screw it. This weekend, you and me
are partying like Ozzy.

188
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:45,461
So, it seems Hearst college
pretty much has it all.

189
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,802
Campus combining modern facilities with
the best traditions of learning...

190
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:49,626
check.

191
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:52,473
No, heidegger is fine if you're a nazi.

192
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:56,703
A student body composed of diverse,
interesting, smart people... check.

193
00:08:56,755 --> 00:09:01,164
And drunken doofuses who corner you
to tally your points... check.

194
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,255
[Clearlake - "I Hate It That I Got What I Wanted"]
So, you're blond... 30 points...

195
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:06,514
<listen to it online!>
-and a natural, too... another 20.

196
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:09,448
You are supercute...
50 points.

197
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,994
And you're kind of,
like, sassy.

198
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:13,351
So, sassy is good?

199
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:17,005
More like a degree-of-difficulty
thing... 30 points.

200
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:20,249
And you're a profro...
80 points.

201
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,480
So, if someone were
to have sex with me,

202
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,825
they'd walk away with 210 points?

203
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:30,123
That's high.
You should be psyched.

204
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,823
I am... inside.

205
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,083
So, what do you think then...

206
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:37,067
about us getting busy?

207
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:38,473
Can I have your beer?

208
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:39,305
Sure.

209
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,310
Damn!

210
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:45,565
Grow a sense of humor,
you crazy bitch!

211
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:48,565
I would if something funny
would ever happen.

212
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:50,204
Tell me how you like it.

213
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,769
It's fun, but it's getting kind of old.

214
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,709
You do that again...

215
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,909
Hey!
You'll what?

216
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,304
Let her go or I'll make sure
you regret it.

217
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:00,747
What?

218
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,418
I think the implication is clear.

219
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,448
You're gonna let her go
on your own initiative.

220
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,384
Or do I have to...

221
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,449
"Initiative. "

222
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:17,167
As much as I appreciate
that display of chivalry,

223
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:18,507
I had it covered.

224
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:22,262
Yeah, well, maybe I wanted to 
demonstrate that i really have changed.

225
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:26,570
So you're no longer evil.
You're stupid. Congratulations.

226
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:29,696
That guy is such a tool.
Can I get you a beer or something?

227
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,501
Uh, how about if I get you one?

228
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:36,980
So, chivalry isn't dead.
It just can't fight. Yeah, let's go.

229
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:38,413
Smooth.

230
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:40,478
Hey, some things I can't change.

231

<song available online, see appendixes></i>

232
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:47,848
I'm gonna like it here.

233
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,502
How you doing?

234
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:52,224
You weirded out Troy's here?

235
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,699
Nah, water under the bridge.

236
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:57,907
Hey, my profros.
It's a fun party, huh?

237
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,139
Not bad.

238
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:02,194
I actually talked to a cute girl
about kierkegaard.

239
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:05,157
Made me wish I knew
something about kierkegaard.

240
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:07,457
Yeah, isn't that cool?

241
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,147
I mean, in high school, parties are just guys
getting drunk and scamming on chicks,

242
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,407
but here you have 
intellectual conversations.

243
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,142
Like I saw you talking to that guy...
what'd you talk about?

244
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,384
Jane Austen,

245
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,405
but he dissed "pride and prejudice,"
so I had to throw a beer on him.

246
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:26,201
I'm kind of colleged-out.

247
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:28,443
Yeah, all right. Well,
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

248
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,133
Go, Hearst!

249
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,649
There goes your water.

250
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:54,655
I mean, your body is slammin'!
That's like 50 points right there.

251
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:56,324
And this might sound like
a weird question,

252
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:58,204
but you're not an orphan, are you?

253
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:07,031
Yeah, 12th floor,
just got off the elevator.

254
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,736
Got the key card,
but it took some smooth talking.

255
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:12,731
I don't see why you couldn't 
just open the door.

256
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:18,854
It's a funny story,
actually.

257
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:23,846
Just please don't judge me.
You can laugh privately later.

258
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:26,400
I don't suppose you have a key?

259
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:32,538
So...

260
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,439
...Can I ask you a question?

261
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,807
Well, she said her name was Daphne.

262
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,423
No, no, no.

263
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:41,243
How did you call me?

264
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:44,898
Acrobatically.
I might have pulled a hamstring.

265
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,342
Okay, then,
next question.

266
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:58,881
Last night was the convention
of the south coast ob-gyn society,

267
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:02,348
the most-sued medical specialty, so

268
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:07,054
I make it a point to swing by every
year and spread my card around.

269
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:09,208
And you met a hell of a lady doc?

270
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:10,700
Hell of a lady, yes.

271
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:12,239
Doctor?

272
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,534
We met at the bar.

273
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:19,511
I was extremely charming, and an hour
later, I'm invited up to her room.

274
00:13:19,786 --> 00:13:22,599
Champagne is ordered.
One thing leads to another.

275
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:26,071
Why don't you think she was an ob-gyn?

276
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:30,808
Well, one, she appeared to know
less about medicine than I do.

277
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:35,332
And two, she seems 
to have stolen my briefcase.

278
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:40,990
Thanks.

279
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,740
Dad, the phone is ringing!

280
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:48,228
Loudly.

281
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:56,885
Veronica, it's Troy.
If you're there, please pick up, okay ?

282
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:58,514
Please pick up.

283
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,275
Troy,
how was your evening?

284
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:06,448
You're where?

285
00:14:13,157 --> 00:14:14,634
What are you doing here?

286
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:17,943
The usual... hair and blood samples,
cheek swab.

287
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:24,127
Remember that girl from 
the party last night... Stacy?

288
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:27,905
Well, I guess she got date-raped.

289
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:29,167
Actually, no.

290
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:31,924
When they use roofies
to knock them out,

291
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:33,985
then shave their head afterward,

292
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:35,469
we drop the "date" part.

293
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:42,069
Don't look at me like that, Veronica.

294
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,665
I swear to god,
I didn't do it.

295
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:49,361
You got to help me.

296
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:54,990
God Veronica, roofie and rape
someone, shave their head?

297
00:14:54,991 --> 00:14:56,234
How sick in the head do you think I am?

298
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:59,274
I don't really know much about
the inside of your head, do I?

299
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:03,414
Why do they think you did it?

300
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:06,762
I was the last thing that Stacy
remembered before she passed out.

301
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,213
Everyone saw us go upstairs together.

302
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:12,423
There's hair and fibers of mine on her.

303
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:15,680
And when they tested 
my clothes from last night...

304
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:18,267
What did they find?

305
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:20,716
That they'd just been washed.

306
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:26,343
You did laundry at 3:00 in the morning?

307
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:30,638
Why would the cops be 
suspicious of that? God, Troy.

308
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,648
Look... yes, we went upstairs 
and fooled around, strictly pg-13.

309
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,429
Then she pukes all over me.

310
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,844
But, being the chivalrous
guy I now am...

311
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:44,295
I cleaned up, I took off her shoes,
I tucked her in,

312
00:15:44,648 --> 00:15:47,400
and then I went to wash my only change
of clothes at the all-night laundry.

313
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:48,613
That is the truth. I swear.

314
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:52,033
If I decide you're guilty,

315
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,642
I'll help hold the hammer while
they nail you to the wall.

316
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:59,381
Do you remember anything
else about last night?

317
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,960
Anyone hanging around her?

318
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,065
I remember getting the stink eye from
this guy who was hitting on her earlier.

319
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,131
What guy?

320
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:08,654
Long, dark hair,

321
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,425
blue sweatshirt with, like, a pi sign.

322
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:17,152
So, "Daphne" registered under
a false name and credit card.

323
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,792
Dead end there, so I got the elevator
security tape from last night.

324
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:25,611
You must be on good terms with 
the Neptune grand security people.

325
00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:28,388
When my daughter 
dated a billionaire's kid

326
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:30,065
living alone in the president's suite,

327
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,711
me and the security guys
got pretty tight.

328
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:37,635
So, what was in the briefcase 
that anyone might want to swipe?

329
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,315
Just case files...

330
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,580
a drunken assault,
a lewd conduct,

331
00:16:43,155 --> 00:16:44,953
a fraud, a divorce...

332
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,870
Aha!

333
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,823
Hello, Daphne.

334
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:51,284
5:53, she checks in.

335
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:53,800
You actually believed 
she was a gynecologist?

336
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:59,106
So, other than the files,
it's an address book,

337
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:01,272
receipts, some keys,

338
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:06,094
I believe a copy of Elle magazine,
but I forget why...

339
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:08,387
Oh, and the murder case files.

340
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,133
Logan Echolls?
Which ones?

341
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:11,209
Everything.

342
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:14,362
What wasn't in the briefcase
is in their storage locker,

343
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:16,577
which is one of the keys.

344
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:19,637
But that case was dismissed,
so it's...

345
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:21,687
At 10:15,
you're on your way up.

346
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:26,133
My god, Cliff,
you're like a wild animal.

347
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,424
Is that what the kids 
call motorboating?

348
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:31,007
I have a zest for life.
So sue me.

349
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:34,179
Look.

350
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:35,889
Lamb?

351
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,499
It appears Lamb has 
a bit of a zest for life himself.

352
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:41,872
2:11,
there's your briefcase.

353
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:45,938
Lamb appears to know your gynecologist.

354
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,107
Don't mind me.
Just keep doing whatever that is.

355
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:50,372
Uh, just work.

356
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,575
I thought you had that Hearst thing.

357
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:53,724
On my way.

358
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:55,658
I just need an address.

359
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,074
Oh, my god.

360
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:05,541
I know her.

361
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:08,089
She goes to my school.

362
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:11,217
Her name is Madison Sinclair.

363
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:27,966
Nice.

364
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,560
A little more vomit and a dead donkey,

365
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:33,530
and you've got a cover spread 
in modern squalor magazine.

366
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:39,418
And doesn't it make sense this is
the home of mr. Points himself,

367
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:45,416
Andrew Barndale, and of our pi sig
brother of the long dark hair,

368
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:46,752
Gordon Peters.

369
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:48,046
Hi.

370
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,401
Uh... Chip.

371
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,945
Sorry, brothers only past 
the entryway without invitation.

372
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:55,300
Hi, Chip.

373
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,140
Is Gordon here, Gordon Peters?

374
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:58,578
You might check the hospital.

375
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,629
The hospital?

376
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,845
Had to have his stomach
pumped last night.

377
00:19:01,846 --> 00:19:04,683
18 shots of jager...
not a good idea.

378
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:06,474
- Who knew?
- Kind of a wuss, huh?

379
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:07,925
Legacy?

380
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:09,961
Well, it's only gonna get worse for
Gordon when he gets back here.

381
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,848
You can leave a message 
for him on the board if you want.

382
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:19,933
So, any english lit or humanities
geeks with us here?

383
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:24,191
Oh is that you? English 
or maybe double with pre-med?

384
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,133
Anyway, if that's you, ...

385
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:27,442
So did you find?

386
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:30,307
The pi sig who was hitting on Stacy

387
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:32,982
spent the night in the hospital
getting his stomach pumped.

388
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:34,017
I double-checked.

389
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,942
So, what are you doing over here?

390
00:19:38,665 --> 00:19:41,615
Looks like Dean's got a great story
about the front of that building.

391
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,274
I kind of bailed on the tour.
I got tired of the looks, you know?

392
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:50,942
So, you figured creepy skulking
was a better use of your time?

393
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,983
That won't make you seem guilty.

394
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:58,233
See? Looks.

395
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:02,121
If you can't give me 
anything more to go on,

396
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:03,720
you might need to get used to it.

397
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,212
My name and number.

398
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,746
I left my name and number 
on her message board. I mean...

399
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:13,498
Would I do that if I just raped her
and shaved off all her hair?

400
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:18,570
So, I could go check and your name
and number would be there?

401
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:22,249
Maybe you could just believe me.

402
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:25,589
I'll check.

403
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:29,369
Dude, you know what
I'm gonna do to you?

404
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:30,332
No.

405
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:31,823
First I'm gonna kick your ass,

406
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:34,345
then I'm gonna grab your head
and yank out your spine.

407
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:35,928
What do you think about that?

408
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:37,189
Is that okay?

409
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,289
Okay.

410
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,874
Boom! Oh!

411
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:43,116
Look, look... I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.

412
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,513
Yoink!

413
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:46,552
Say hello to your spine.

414
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:49,098
"It's me, your spine. "

415
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:52,562
What?

416
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:56,233
I'm just imagining what Ozzy would think
of your concept of partying like Ozzy.

417
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,462
You want to snort a line of ants?

418
00:20:58,704 --> 00:20:59,675
I'm in.

419
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:02,549
Come on, we're free men
who reject the rule of women.

420
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:04,783
Get into the spirit.

421
00:21:04,784 --> 00:21:09,149
I mean, exhibit "A," exhibit "B".

422
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,803
My suspicion is you're afraid
to embrace your true nature.

423
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:13,565
Which is?

424
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:15,117
We are lone wolves, dude,

425
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,768
high-plains drifters,

426
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,075
life takers and heartbreakers.

427
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:20,762
Who play video games all day.

428
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,609
Who don't give a damn about 
what other people say

429
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,035
'cause they don't give a rat's ass.

430
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:32,677
Dude, you got cake.

431
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,182
What the hell, man?

432
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:41,303
What is this?

433
00:21:42,993 --> 00:21:44,831
It's nothing.
It's a file. It's a joke.

434
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:50,566
But you're right...
life takers and heartbreakers.

435
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:53,511
To not giving the ass of a rat.

436
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,949
Would Troy actually lie about
his name and number?

437
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,943
Despite my deep reserves of ill will,

438
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:06,119
do I really believe
he could be that horrible?

439
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,342
So, it's half there,
and he's only half-horrible.

440
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:13,156
Do you need something?

441
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,069
Uh, no, I was just...

442
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:20,877
Um...

443
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,943
I'm Veronica.

444
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:28,605
I was at the party last night.

445
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:31,051
That was, like,
the best party ever, right?

446
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,025
How was your rape?

447
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:38,570
So, what, are you dropping off
some pamphlets or something?

448
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,045
No.

449
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:44,154
Um, a pamphlet's not gonna cover it.

450
00:22:46,046 --> 00:22:48,081
It's just gonna suck.

451
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:51,366
And then it'll suck less.

452
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:54,702
I'm sorry to bother you.

453
00:22:55,432 --> 00:22:57,453
Did they catch the guy from the party?

454
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:03,578
It was kind of complicated.

455
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:06,772
I don't really know what happened.

456
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:08,883
I think they're just trying to
get all the facts straight.

457
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:10,461
The facts are straight.

458
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:13,251
I know who it was.

459
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:16,819
I just want some biblical justice.

460
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:18,872
He shaved my head.

461
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:25,401
What's that?

462
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:27,045
I don't know.
It was here.

463
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:36,466
Oh, god, that is just...

464
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:37,943
That's not my hair.

465
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:38,864
It's not yours?

466
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:40,489
Stacy, are you okay?

467
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:45,277
Did you see who delivered that box?

468
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:47,282
What is she doing here?

469
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:48,773
Nothing.
She was at the party.

470
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:51,039
Yeah I know,
she was there with him, Stacy.

471
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,212
What?

472
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:56,384
She's trying to help him
get off the hook.

473
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:06,220
So, if someone sent Stacy a box
of hair that wasn't hers,

474
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:08,067
there's a chance
she's not the only victim

475
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:10,586
and there's another girl at
Hearst forced to wear a wig.

476
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:13,927
And so, I will now clinch
that Emmy nomination.

477
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:17,251
Hi, I'm looking for someone.

478
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:20,946
She would have come in for a wig
during the past couple of months.

479
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:24,407
Can you narrow it down, hon?

480
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:25,180
We get a lot of...

481
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:28,613
her head would have
been completely shaved.

482
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:31,012
Oh, chemo.

483
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,529
She decided to give up on treatment
and run away from home.

484
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:39,922
There was a girl a month ago.

485
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,017
Do you have a name?

486
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,147
You don't know her name?

487
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:50,160
Because we don't just give out custom-

488
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:52,234
ma'am, she's run away.

489
00:24:52,655 --> 00:24:54,474
She's scared,
and she's alone.

490
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:57,672
We don't even want to know
how she's making her money.

491
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:00,764
She's given up on life.

492
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,732
And she thinks she's
sparing us the pain,

493
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:09,238
but not knowing where she is
or what name she's using

494
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:12,691
or whether she's safe... it's torture.

495
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:17,704
Please, ma'am,
she's my sister.

496
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,710
I'm sorry.

497
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:23,420
This girl was hawaiian.

498
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:28,003
Oh.

499
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:36,203
Oh, hey.

500
00:25:36,678 --> 00:25:40,553
Um, you know, the tour
doesn't start until noon.

501
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:44,900
If I wanted to find a hawaiian girl,
where would I start?

502
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:46,174
In Hawaii?

503
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,798
I'm sorry,
I don't understand...

504
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:49,514
hawaiian students at Hearst.

505
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:50,916
Oh,
the pacific-islander kids.

506
00:25:52,064 --> 00:25:55,862
Well, some of them have a lunch-group
thing at the student union on weekends.

507
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,623
Thanks.

508
00:26:07,795 --> 00:26:09,551
- Dean?
- Yeah ?

509
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:12,679
What does this mean... "CL"?

510
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:14,869
Oh, that's a score.

511
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,209
It's 150 in roman numerals.

512
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,648
It's a pi sig thing.

513
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:21,862
They have, like, a contest 
for scoring girls or something.

514
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,956
50 points for a blond,

515
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,754
30 points for sassy.

516
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:28,281
Yeah, I don't know if you get points
for being sassy, but, yeah.

517
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:31,547
The rumor is that they have a board in 
the basement that they keep score on.

518
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,122
If the pledges don't score high
enough, they're punished.

519
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:36,447
Punished?

520
00:26:36,448 --> 00:26:37,677
They shave your head.

521
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:40,783
The contest ended at midnight.
It's stupid anyway, you know.

522
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,063
Good old pi sigs.
Thanks, Dean.

523
00:26:46,306 --> 00:26:47,037
Sure.

524
00:26:51,885 --> 00:26:54,447
Don, do you have time for a question?

525
00:26:57,591 --> 00:26:58,653
For the two of you...

526
00:26:59,357 --> 00:27:00,543
always.

527
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:02,571
We're just looking for
a little help here.

528
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:05,193
Do you know this woman?

529
00:27:06,113 --> 00:27:08,205
No. We got to do this again sometime.

530
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:09,315
You sure?

531
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:18,410
You got me.

532
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:21,642
I rode an elevator with her,
she asked the time, and I tell her.

533
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,837
Uh, sheriff,

534
00:27:24,524 --> 00:27:27,405
just a couple more shots?

535
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:35,596
I want to emphasize this should
not be construed as coercion.

536
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:37,440
We're just showing you a picture.

537
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,310
That's Madison Sinclair, who I believe
takes world history with my daughter.

538
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:46,135
So, what?
This is blackmail?

539
00:27:46,191 --> 00:27:47,592
She's 18. That's legal.

540
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:50,971
Sounds like a swell campaign 
slogan for the next election.

541
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:01,865
We just want to know
who this first woman is.

542
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,393
She's an escort.

543
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:06,870
I've busted her a few times.

544
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:09,691
She hires out as "Sugar Jones. "

545
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:11,368
Great.
Thanks, Don.

546
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:12,288
Mm.

547
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,500
I'd vote for you.

548
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:18,927
So, you get that scholarship,
you got to join.

549
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:20,443
When I got here, I was like,

550
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:21,704
"I totally want to be a pi. "

551
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,785
Uh, yeah. Once when I was little,
I wanted to be ice cream.

552
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,788
Dude!

553
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,644
Pi sig sig... you're hilarious.
You'll totally fit in.

554
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,330
That's members-only down there.

555
00:28:30,392 --> 00:28:32,226
The kitchen is through here.

556
00:29:03,615 --> 00:29:06,899
"C" in roman numerals is 100,
so the big question is...

557
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,573
did any of these delightful people

558
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:11,531
score the three "C"s I saw 
circled on Stacy's door?

559
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:24,853
And someone with the handle
"bird dog" says he scored me?

560
00:29:24,854 --> 00:29:28,283
That is wrong both factually
and ontologically.

561
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,240
There... 300 points.

562
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:32,737
And the hero of the hour?

563
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:34,727
Of course his name is "ice man. "

564
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:37,337
Hey! You can't be down here!

565
00:29:37,896 --> 00:29:40,710
-Ice! Hey, ice man!
-Yo.

566
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:42,226
There's some chick in the sanctum.

567
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:45,222
What the hell are you doing here?

568
00:29:45,274 --> 00:29:46,625
This is off-limits!

569
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,781
Ok, clear it out. Pronto, okay?

570
00:29:51,782 --> 00:29:53,717
300 points?

571
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:55,142
Nice work.

572
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,089
This is our business.
I don't have to apologize...

573
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,583
for being a rapist?

574
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:00,543
Nice.

575
00:30:00,781 --> 00:30:02,502
I admire a principled stand.

576
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:03,838
What are you talking about?

577
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,384
I'm talking about 300 points,

578
00:30:06,385 --> 00:30:08,987
exactly the score you goons
wrote on Stacy's door

579
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,551
the night she war
roofied and raped.

580
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:13,794
But the jury will understand.

581
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:15,740
After all,
you had to do it,

582
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:20,129
or your frat brothers would shave off 
your awesome Ryan Seacrest hairdo.

583
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:22,271
I didn't get those 300 points
for Stacy wells.

584
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:23,551
Yeah, he nailed the dean's wife.

585
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:27,506
Zip it, Gordo.
Look, no one here ever touched Stacy.

586
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,514
You're Gordon?

587
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,145
What happened to the rock-star locks?

588
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:34,416
You mean pi sigs
don't give points for rape?

589
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:38,131
Stacy's gonna hate hearing that
no good came out of friday night.

590
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:40,096
I don't give a flying
nun what she thinks.

591
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:42,230
She's a total tease.

592
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,141
She was coming onto me all night,

593
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,821
and then she blew me off for some
other dude who called her bluff.

594
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,706
Boohoo.

595
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:54,168
Bird Dog, do you want
to show this young lady out?

596
00:30:54,524 --> 00:30:56,076
Thanks,
I know the way.

597
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:59,416
Oh, and you might want
to get your clippers

598
00:31:00,531 --> 00:31:03,523
because unless
being electrocuted counts,

599
00:31:03,524 --> 00:31:07,732
Bird Dog here never
scored these 240 points.

600
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:10,961
It was 210.

601
00:31:11,432 --> 00:31:13,322
You under-counted the sassy.

602
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:21,270
And this looks like it must be
the pacific-islander lunch group.

603
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:23,668
Now, who might be wearing a wig?

604
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,984
I think I'll follow a hunch.

605
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:29,837
Excuse me.

606
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:32,551
Hi, I'm working on a play 
for the theater department,

607
00:31:32,552 --> 00:31:34,598
and I need to find a place
that does custom wigs.

608
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,940
Did you get yours recently,
and did you get it around here?

609
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:38,292
My what? Wig?

610
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,543
This is my hair.

611
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,735
Oh...

612
00:31:42,294 --> 00:31:43,106
I th-

613
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,148
I'm sorry.
I thought...

614
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:47,834
thanks, anyway.

615
00:31:47,835 --> 00:31:51,011
Great, a dead end,
and embarrassing to boot.

616
00:31:51,473 --> 00:31:53,153
Um, excuse me.

617
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:55,445
Y- you might try tori's.

618
00:31:56,203 --> 00:31:57,258
On pacific?

619
00:31:57,804 --> 00:31:59,093
Thanks.

620
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:10,615
Hi, can I talk to you for a second?

621
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:15,972
It's about a girl who was raped and
had her head shaved the other night.

622
00:32:19,219 --> 00:32:20,920
Oh, miss Wells.

623
00:32:20,921 --> 00:32:21,931
Hey, dean Harlow.

624
00:32:21,932 --> 00:32:25,077
I got a message from someone saying
you had some information for me,

625
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:26,871
like about that guy.

626
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:30,009
I'm still waiting to hear
from the sheriff.

627
00:32:30,111 --> 00:32:31,531
I haven't heard anything.

628
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:33,570
I left the message.

629
00:32:34,817 --> 00:32:37,403
And...
I do have information.

630
00:32:37,404 --> 00:32:40,330
Troy's being drawn and quartered,
and I get to kick the pieces?

631
00:32:40,331 --> 00:32:42,160
- No.
- Then I'm not interested.

632
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:43,715
Stacy, it wasn't Troy.

633
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:47,544
He didn't rape you, and he didn't
leave the box of hair.

634
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:49,440
Because good old Troy's a decent,

635
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:53,099
stand-up guy simply not capable 
of doing something so horrible, right?

636
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,258
Because it happened to me, too...

637
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:01,432
a month ago.

638
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:05,471
Whoever did this to you did
the same thing to Dawn,

639
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:07,548
when Troy was on the other
side of the country.

640
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:12,488
I'm not saying it wasn't horrible
or you don't deserve justice.

641
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:14,842
I'm just saying someone else did it,

642
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:16,616
and that someone is still out there.

643
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:19,017
The same thing?

644
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,531
Did he send you a box with...

645
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:23,433
No.

646
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:27,533
That was a nasty little gift from
a pi sig named Gordon Peters.

647
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:30,286
He was bitter because
you didn't fall for his charm,

648
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:34,904
and not scoring with the ladies
meant getting his head shaved.

649
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,498
I think you'll find that hair is his.

650
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:41,088
And since you're the dean
of student affairs,

651
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:42,599
I thought you might be interested.

652
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,197
These are some student affairs going on
in the basement of the pi sig house.

653
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:50,977
Don't think you want that getting
into the Hearst brochure.

654
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:55,300
Well, that's it. That's the last
you're gonna see of me.

655
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:58,675
The final event now is doughnuts
with the dean in Michael hall,

656
00:33:58,676 --> 00:33:59,441
and if I've done my job,

657
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:01,115
you don't have to ask me where that is.

658
00:34:01,411 --> 00:34:03,377
So, I hope to see you guys next year.

659
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,139
I hope so, too.

660
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:10,985
Admit it.
Hearst ain't half-bad.

661
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:12,711
It is.

662
00:34:12,978 --> 00:34:15,431
That means half of it might be good.

663
00:34:16,231 --> 00:34:17,280
You talking about me again?

664
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:21,251
So, they dropped the charges.

665
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,761
Thanks, Veronica, really.
I'm not sure that I deserve it, but...

666
00:34:27,363 --> 00:34:28,596
you're a real friend.

667
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:33,685
How about we just call me an
acquaintance with reservations?

668
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:36,704
Right.

669
00:34:37,757 --> 00:34:40,328
Then, until next time...
go, Hearst!

670
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,236
That's right.

671
00:34:43,003 --> 00:34:45,446
Hey, did you guys
hear about the pi sigs?

672
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:46,586
Nope.

673
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:48,235
They got a semester of probation.

674
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,225
If it's double-secret probation,
there's a serious leak.

675
00:34:52,294 --> 00:34:54,612
No mixers,
no parties, no sports.

676
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:56,285
And it was your photo that nailed them.

677
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:57,583
You don't mess around,
do you?

678
00:34:58,207 --> 00:34:59,357
That's Veronica Mars...

679
00:34:59,857 --> 00:35:02,669
making friends and influencing
people wherever she goes.

680
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:05,407
See, if you come here next year,
you've already got enemies.

681
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:07,204
Just feel right at home.

682
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,224
See you.

683
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:18,455
I heard you wanted to see me.

684
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:21,109
I did. I thought you might
want your hair back.

685
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,968
Uh, I don't want that.

686
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,209
Fair enough.

687
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,918
Oh, my god.

688
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:31,827
What... are you crazy?
What are you doing?

689
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:33,759
What are...

690
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:47,636
Your dad dropped his testimony
so I'd quit seeing you.

691
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:53,532
I figured.

692
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:56,026
So, did you ask me out so he'd do it?

693
00:35:57,025 --> 00:35:57,793
Yes.

694
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,264
And you want me to forgive you?

695
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:08,366
Yes.

696
00:36:23,008 --> 00:36:24,058
You're back early.

697
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:27,357
Yeah, I ditched the goodbye hugging.
Can you believe it?

698
00:36:27,441 --> 00:36:29,004
You? Miss hug?

699
00:36:30,553 --> 00:36:32,095
So, you must be tired.

700
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:33,312
Why don't you lie in your...

701
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:41,383
Is Keith here?

702
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:45,155
Dad?

703
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:46,786
Your hooker's here.

704
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:48,658
Escort, honey.

705
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:53,483
So, why don't you go to your room
and do your blog...

706
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:54,847
whatever you kids do.

707
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,152
Sorry about that.

708
00:37:02,922 --> 00:37:06,061
So... what do you got in mind?

709
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:08,947
A few questions to start off.

710
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:15,864
The briefcase... tell us why
you took it and where it went.

711
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:23,968
Well, I got the call.

712
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:25,168
I show up.

713
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,815
The guy offers me triple rate if
I pick him up and swipe his briefcase.

714
00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:30,954
So, who's the guy?

715
00:37:31,537 --> 00:37:32,902
Let me see. You know,

716
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:36,565
I think I've got his birth certificate
in here somewhere.

717
00:37:36,946 --> 00:37:38,683
No.
He didn't say.

718
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:40,584
What happened to my briefcase?

719
00:37:40,585 --> 00:37:42,446
I gave it to him in the garage.
I split.

720
00:37:43,132 --> 00:37:45,367
What he did with it,
I have no idea.

721
00:37:47,379 --> 00:37:49,841
So, is that it?

722
00:37:50,204 --> 00:37:53,321
I guess so.
But, hey, nice work.

723
00:37:53,392 --> 00:37:56,298
I really thought...
it was all real.

724
00:37:56,785 --> 00:37:58,465
Just the welts, honey.

725
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:09,532
<i>[Tegan and Sara - "I know, I know, I know"]
Hundreds of miles yeah, you cry like a baby</i>

726
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:11,856
<i><song available online, see appendixes>

727
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,569

00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:16,723

00:38:17,284 --> 00:38:18,633
<i>I'm still your love</i>

730
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:25,995
<i>back from the last place

731
00:38:25,996 --> 00:38:30,267
<i>you laugh with me, shout, scream now

732
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:33,035
<i>I know, I know, I know,</i>

733
00:38:33,731 --> 00:38:35,404
<i>you're still my love</i>

734
00:38:38,606 --> 00:38:42,363

735
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:46,788

736

00:38:54,754 --> 00:38:57,721

00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,963
<i>it's just this day</i>

740
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:04,034
Enough!

741
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:06,519
Dad, what are you doing here?

742
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:07,537
Just get dressed.

743
00:39:08,272 --> 00:39:09,784
- Get dressed!
- I am.

744
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:12,840
I told you to stay away from her.

745
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,244
You're lucky I don't kill you.

746
00:39:15,297 --> 00:39:18,228
- Dad, he -
- Hannah, get your things.

747
00:39:18,229 --> 00:39:19,625
Don't speak to her like that.

748
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:20,970
We had a deal.

749
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,791
Yes, "had. " Now we don't.

750
00:39:23,006 --> 00:39:25,349
There's nothing you can do 
that'll stop me from seeing her.

751
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,137
You want to bet?

752
00:39:29,382 --> 00:39:30,314
Let's go.

753
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:42,036
So you know, if you go to Hearst,

754
00:39:42,037 --> 00:39:44,682
you can come home and 
do your laundry on weekends,

755
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:46,353
and we can talk about Nietzsche,

756
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:49,913
the French revolution,
boys, whatever.

757
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:54,348
I told you, dad.
I am going far, far away.

758
00:39:55,507 --> 00:39:56,551
It's a deal breaker.

759
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:59,737
Hearst is 10 whole exits.

760
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:12,823
What do you know
about plastic explosives?

761
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:15,121
That's what I like -
a good segue.

762
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:19,160
I mean, where you get them,
what they're used for.

763
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:20,765
Well, if you're licensed,

764
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:23,913
legitimate uses include construction,

765
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:25,535
mining, demolition.

766
00:40:28,048 --> 00:40:29,379
Demolition.

767
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,613
"Dear mr. Fennel,
it is with great pleasure" -

768
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:33,978
you got the scholarship.

769
00:40:33,979 --> 00:40:34,844
Two times.

770
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:37,409
Hearst college, baby,
here I come!

771
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:39,719
I am so over this place already.

772
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,932
Right there with you.

773
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:44,502
Hey, did Hannah miss school today?

774
00:40:45,624 --> 00:40:46,624
You didn't hear?

775
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:48,257
No.

776
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:51,951
Her parents sent her
to boarding school in Vermont.

777
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,220
She's gone.

778
00:41:00,305 --> 00:41:02,783
So, the contest winner
gets to push that thing -

779
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:05,518
you know, that thing like
Bugs Bunny always pushes...

780
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:07,026
and the stadium explodes?

781
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:08,573
A plunger, right.

782
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:11,466
But if we did our work right,
the stadium implodes.

783
00:41:11,538 --> 00:41:12,655
Cool.

784
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:13,799
Using dynamite?

785
00:41:13,953 --> 00:41:16,098
Some, but C-4 mostly.

786
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,133
What's C-4?

787
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:24,254
Not much to look at,
actually, but it does the job.

788
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:28,471
And it's the exact same stuff
I saw in the airplane hangar.

789
00:41:28,592 --> 00:41:31,785
Danny! I told you to take
that crate to section 11!

790
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:37,053
One more question -

791
00:41:37,054 --> 00:41:40,189
is it just a coincidence
that Danny Boyd works here

792
00:41:40,228 --> 00:41:42,149
or do I now have to
add the Fitzpatricks

793
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,651
to the list of people who could
have framed Terrence Cook

794
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:47,127
or even crashed the bus?

795
00:41:47,128 --> 00:41:50,572
