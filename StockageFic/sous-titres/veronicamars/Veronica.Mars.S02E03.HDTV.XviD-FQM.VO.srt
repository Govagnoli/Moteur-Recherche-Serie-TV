1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,473
Previously on "Veronica Mars"

2
00:00:02,524 --> 00:00:04,494
It just went straight of the cliff.

3
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:05,832
They're all dead.

4
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:09,553
I wonder what else the bus drivers bought,

5
00:00:09,604 --> 00:00:11,577
What if it was nodoz or red bull?

6
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:14,003
Veronica, you can't try to make sense out of this.

7
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:15,833
I don't even know what I'm looking for,

8
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:17,923
skid marks the sheriff's department missed

9
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:19,576
or purposefully overlooked?

10
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:21,859
There's nothing here to help anyone.

11
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,360
Who was that kissing you?

12
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:24,555
That was jackie.

13
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:25,325
Oh.

14
00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:26,515
Hold it.

15
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:29,225
Someone's home.

16
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:30,020
Hi.

17
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:32,049
Why is Logan's truck in the driveway?

18
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,062
I'd rather your friends not show up whenever they want.

19
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:38,090
I'm running for supervisor because I care about this town.

20
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,526
I want you to run for sheriff.

21
00:00:39,577 --> 00:00:40,900
I told him I'm running.

22
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:42,183
I feel safer already.

23
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:45,885
Hey, check this out.

24
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:50,156
Senior year.

25
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:54,557
College applications due in three months, scholarship applications in six.

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,375
Since most of my extracurricular activities cannot be divulged under state law,

27
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:03,534
my guidance counselor strongly suggested I indulge in a little résumé-packing.

28
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:10,003
So as of now, Veronica Mars is a future business leader of america.

29
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:11,782
Okay.

30
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:16,729
I'd like to begin our local profile series by introducing the C.E.O.

31
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,736
Of casablancas enterprises, Mr. H. Richard casablancas.

32
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:30,101
Uh, sure you're not looking for the future bootlickers of america?

33
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:33,557
So, what am I doing in Neptune high's own little billionaire boys club

34
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:36,479
instead of joining french club or model united nations?

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,317
I blame my billionaire boyfriend, Duncan Kane.

36
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:41,333
So, who are we exploiting now?

37
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:42,922
The workers.

38
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:45,649
Excellent.

39
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,054
And now I've lost my appetite.

40
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,146
Good afternoon.

41
00:01:57,348 --> 00:02:00,668
I'm here to talk to you kids about the real estate business.

42
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:05,582
Now, there's nothing wrong with stocks or bonds or pork bellies or whatever else,

43
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:09,116
but when I put my money into something, I like to see what I'm getting.

44
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,793
Kick the tires, if you will.

45
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:14,066
Of course, most people can't just plop down

46
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:17,179
$137 million for an office building in downtown tokyo.

47
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:22,254
That's where real estate investment trusts, or reits, come in.

48
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:24,411
A single $50 share in my company...

49
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:26,303
$52.16, to be precise.

50
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,098
Very good.

51
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,566
...Allows your average joe to pool his resources

52
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,014
with other investors and own a piece of that tower...

53
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:34,163
and these condos...

54
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,095
and this hotel.

55
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,505
But forget the eye candy.

56
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:43,413
Here's a chart of our market capitalization versus earnings over the last two years.

57
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:45,678
Now, how's that look?

58
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:49,094
It looks like it's always looked --

59
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:52,793
the rich get richer, and everybody else hopes for scholarships.

60
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:54,920
Hey, Veronica?

61
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:55,878
Hey, beave --

62
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:57,897
I mean, Cassidy.

63
00:02:58,517 --> 00:03:02,769
I think it's cool that you joined fbla, you being a girl and all.

64
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:04,512
And a poor one at that.

65
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:06,642
Can I talk to you for a sec?

66
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:08,017
You are talking to me.

67
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:09,631
About my dad...

68
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,434
I'm worried, you know?

69
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:14,047
Seemed to me he was doing fine for himself.

70
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:15,990
Look, it's not money, okay?

71
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,778
Well, it is -- it is money, but it's my stepmom.

72
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,968
She's a gold digger, and it's obvious to everyone else except my dad.

73
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:26,122
All she does is spend his money.

74
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,166
Unfortunately,

75
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:31,160
there are no laws against exploiting rich and horny middle-aged men.

76
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:32,507
Yeah?

77
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:36,060
The prenup doesn't allow her to cheat on him, either.

78
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,625
I found a condom wrapper in the couch.

79
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:41,851
Hardly a smoking gun given your brother's proclivities.

80
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:43,093
Look, it's just a hunch,

81
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:46,573
but I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to back it up with hard proof.

82
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:47,926
Define "lot."

83
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:52,834
$500 for a picture of kendall violating her prenup.

84
00:03:53,886 --> 00:03:54,910
$1,000.

85
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,722
Okay.

86
00:03:59,802 --> 00:04:00,908
It's her schedule.

87
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:02,594
Good luck.

88
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:06,014
Well.

89
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:09,275
I just might be a future business leader of america yet.

90
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:12,994
"10:00 --
brunch with the girls.

91
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,280
"12:00 -- pilates class with lorenzo.

92
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:20,481
"And 3:00 -- spa reservation for a shiatsu massage, organic enzyme facial" --

93
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:24,076
and, I'm willing to wager, a sunshine colonic.

94
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:28,523
Maybe I should consider a career as a Neptune trophy wife.

95
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:32,161
Sheriff wants to ask you some questions.

96
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:33,707
My answer was final.

97
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:35,713
I will not go to prom with him.

98
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:37,976
Now.

99
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:40,991
Deputy sacks, take me away.

100
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:56,946
So, I guess you know why you're here.

101
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,137
You want to tell me about it?

102
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:01,725
Okay.

103
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:05,818
I confess.

104
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:07,324
God, you're good.

105
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:09,228
I have no idea why I'm here.

106
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:13,590
But I'm sure my dad was interested to know why you hauled his daughter in

107
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:17,247
and subjected her to the crime-busting stare for no apparent reason.

108
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,665
He didn't need to know that you were here.

109
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:22,300
You're 18 now, kiddo.

110
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:23,767
You're an adult.

111
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:25,100
That makes one of us.

112
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:28,332
Are you gonna tell me why I'm here, or should I just sit back

113
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:32,026
and enjoy your impression of a mildly constipated david caruso?

114
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:35,556
What can you tell me about your relationship with this man?

115
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,021
Ah, yes.

116
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,966
I remember that summer.

117
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:43,487
He was a roadie for whitesnake.

118
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:45,659
I was singing backup for boyz ii men.

119
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,440
They said it would never work, but --

120
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:49,874
I'm glad that you find this amusing.

121
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:53,152
Mr. David "curly" moran.

122
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:55,901
You've never seen him before in your life?

123
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:04,520
Somewhere those million chimps with their million typewriters

124
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:06,666
must have finally written "king lear,"

125
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,686
because sheriff lamb is actually right about something.

126
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,434
I have seen this man before.

127
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:19,588
Thanks.

128
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:23,213
So you have.

129
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:24,380
I thought so.

130
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,059
Missing an earring?

131
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:32,401
I' m not exactly a diamonds kind of girl.

132
00:06:32,452 --> 00:06:34,067
It was found outside the road hog --

133
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:35,640
biker bar up the P.C.H.

134
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:37,873
Last place curly here was seen.

135
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,111
Again, what does this have to do with me?

136
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:42,573
It seems that curly had your name on him.

137
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:43,299
On him?

138
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:50,173
His body washed up on the beach.

139
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,991
Beaten to death.

140
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,439
Amusing, huh?

141
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:06,597
<i>A long time ago,</i>

142
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:09,618
<i>we used to be friends but I</i>

143
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:13,381
<i>haven't thought of you lately at all</i>

144
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,687
<i>come on, now, sugar</i>

145
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:19,296
<i>bring it on, bring it on, yeah</i>

146
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:22,234
<i>just remember me when</i>

147
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:25,059
<i>we used to be friends</i>

148
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:27,124
<i>a long time ago</i>

149
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:29,528
<i>we used to be friends</i>

150
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:34,964
Saison 2 - Episode 3 
<i>"Cheatty, cheatty, bang, bang"
</i>

151
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:40,745
so, he was serious about wanting you to run.

152
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,598
Why not?
I'm a good candidate.

153
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,925
I've been sheriff before.

154
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,061
I know where the office is.

155
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:48,486
I look great in a hat.

156
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:51,574
And I am a local celebrity, you know,

157
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:57,228
with a book currently hovering at number 97 on the new york times best seller list.

158
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,163
97?

159
00:07:59,214 --> 00:07:59,889
Mm-hmm.

160
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:02,097
So, is that good or bad?

161
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:05,315
Well, as we say in the book biz, it's sort of okayish.

162
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:10,086
But they believe in it, so I'll probably be flogging it

163
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:13,123
until someone famouser than Aaron Echolls murders someone.

164
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:19,090
Speaking of which, I've got a signing this weekend,

165
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:21,631
and how do you feel about a romantic getaway?

166
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:23,434
Chicago.

167
00:08:24,064 --> 00:08:26,815
You, me, and chi-town, the windy city --

168
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:30,864
a city with broad shoulders where the fog comes on little cat feet.

169
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:32,021
What do you think?

170
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,897
This business about the little cat feet sounds intriguing.

171
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,144
Oh, it gets better.

172
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:39,929
They're putting me up at the rossmore hotel,

173
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,590
and there's a nightclub at the top with this great jazz place.

174
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:43,957
How great would that --

175
00:08:45,987 --> 00:08:47,781
what?
I thought you liked jazz.

176
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:49,905
Is it Kenny G?

177
00:08:49,956 --> 00:08:51,238
He ruined it for you?

178
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:53,133
No.

179
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,106
It's very perfect.

180
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:04,957
Ugh. Child in the room.
Hands at your sides, please.

181
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:06,793
Hey, honey.

182
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,006
Just in time for steak.

183
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:09,381
I had a bite.
Thanks.

184
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:11,580
You okay, sweetie?

185
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:13,341
I'm super.
Thanks for asking.

186
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:15,738
That's what I like to hear.

187
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,532
I know, and that's why you're not gonna hear about the dead man

188
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,041
with my name on his hand

189
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:23,556
because I like being able to leave the house without an armed escort.

190
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:25,703
Okay. Feel free to make out now.

191
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:31,722
Don't they make a cute couple?

192
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:35,957
Kendall lacey casablancas --

193
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,700
née lacey shiflit.

194
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:42,970
Just another arizona state dropout

195
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,544
turned featured music video background dancer

196
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:48,961
turned laker girl living off a $10,000-a-year salary,

197
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:50,306
a purseful of credit cards,

198
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,457
and a string of baller boyfriends...

199
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:58,101
until a twice-divorced white knight swept her away to bimbo paradise.

200
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,581
And for a "true hollywood story" without the happy ending, david "curly" moran --

201
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:07,751
onetime stuntman who crashed his career in the '80s.

202
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:11,494
Just remember, kids, crystal meth and precision driving don't mix.

203
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:14,926
Between the 3-year stint at san quentin for assault

204
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:19,379
and washing up on the beach with my name on his hand, curly made his living at...

205
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:22,087
symbolic motor car company.

206
00:10:23,882 --> 00:10:28,292
A compelling life story, to be sure, but what does any of it have to do with me?

207
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:31,976
And why would this man have my name magic-markered across his hand?

208
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:34,254
Did I get really drunk at a biker bar?

209
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:38,757
So, what's up, kiddo?

210
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:40,040
None of your beeswax.

211
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:42,914
All right.

212
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:44,026
I'll show you.

213
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:48,533
But you're gonna have to answer a couple of my questions first.

214
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:50,922
Sit down, king kong.

215
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:59,358
So, now that you've filed the official divorce papers from mom,

216
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:03,581
are you taking Wallace's mom to chicago to propose to her?

217
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:06,835
Don't think I won't rifle through your luggage for that ring.

218
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:09,016
- There is no ring.
- Promise bracelet?

219
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:11,560
Pre-engagement pendant?
Earrings?

220
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:15,637
Anything that according to the hip-hop cognoscente can be qualified as bling?

221
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:18,374
Can't a guy take his special lady friend on a romantic --

222
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:19,054
no.

223
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:22,083
Veronica, I promise --

224
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:26,627
as soon as alicia and I know what the next step is, you'll know what it is, okay?

225
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:27,505
Okay.

226
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:31,198
Then I have something to admit.

227
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:36,834
I...

228
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:40,083
love unicorns.

229
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:44,418
What, dad?
Girls are crazy about unicorns.

230
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:45,952
Aw!

231
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:51,357
Another thing girls love are Jimmy choos, dolce & gabbana,

232
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:55,624
and convertibles that cost more than the gross national product of sri lanka.

233
00:11:57,578 --> 00:12:01,300
If she's a gold digger, she's doing a pretty bad job of hiding it.

234
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,597
But it sure makes my job easier.

235
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:05,881
Tailing young Mrs. Kendall is about as hard as

236
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:08,443
following malibu barbie to the beach house.

237
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:24,679
So far, kendall was only guilty of violating her atkins diet.

238
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,567
Now we're talking.

239
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,894
Ah, the inevitable.

240
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:02,407
Sorry, elder Dick.

241
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,389
Looks like your too-good-to-be-true bride is too good to be true.

242
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,034
Hope you like cheap hotels, hot stuff.

243
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:12,497
'Cause that's all you'll be able to afford when this is over.

244
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:15,299
What are you looking at?

245
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:18,006
Just...tawdriness.

246
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:24,088
What are you looking at now?

247
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:25,718
The opposite of tawdriness.

248
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:27,966
Wallace and his pudding cup.

249
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:30,369
Yeah, mom seems to forget I'm not 5 anymore.

250
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,828
Well, who can blame her?

251
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:33,779
Wallace and his --

252
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:38,265
and his new pal, the h ot, bitchy transfer from new york.

253
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,654
I guess he really isn't 5 anymore.

254
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:41,412
What?

255
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:43,010
You met jackie, right?

256
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:45,385
I didn't realize you were lunch buddies.

257
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:47,834
I'm going for lunch buddies with privileges.

258
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:48,850
Help a brother out.

259
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:51,827
If you want to play in her league, hide your pudding.

260
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,890
Hey, I like her, okay?

261
00:13:57,344 --> 00:13:58,241
Retract claws.

262
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,480
Claws? What claws?

263
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:02,017
Hey, Wallace.

264
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:03,432
Hey, jackie.

265
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:05,212
- You guys met.
- Yes,

266
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:10,084
she requested I step outside my job description at java the hut the other day.

267
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:11,687
I'm sorry about that.

268
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:14,760
I forgot to leave the new york attitude in new york.

269
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:16,434
So, how you doing?

270
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:17,236
Awful.

271
00:14:17,443 --> 00:14:19,360
No matter how many schools I get kicked out of,

272
00:14:19,411 --> 00:14:21,389
I can't seem to escape this thing.

273
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:25,740
600 pages of pasty white chicks catfighting

274
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,650
over some stick-up-his-butt dude's "prospects."

275
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,023
Hey, I got the cliffsnotes --

276
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:31,151
only 80 pages.

277
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:33,418
You could borrow it sometime if you want.

278
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:37,995
Even one page of this pre-victorian corset crap puts me to sleep.

279
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:40,929
Why can't we read burroughs or something?

280
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:43,499
All right, brother, prepare to be helped out.

281
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:47,041
Uh, Duncan and I were gonna rent the bbc series of it.

282
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,646
We can fast-forward through the corsets and the bitching.

283
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:51,843
And colin firth is in it.

284
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:53,394
Do you guys want to join?

285
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:54,281
Hot damn.

286
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:55,614
Colin firth is in it.

287
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,206
Yeah. Sure.

288
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,282
Someone will be right with you.

289
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:07,843
Table one.

290
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:08,594
Sure.

291
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,431
I guess that hunch was a good hunch.

292
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:34,655
Damn, that's cold.
She's doing it at one of my dad's own properties.

293
00:15:39,174 --> 00:15:40,280
This isn't enough.

294
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:42,773
They could be doing anything behind that door.

295
00:15:42,824 --> 00:15:44,487
Oh, you sweet, simple boy.

296
00:15:44,538 --> 00:15:46,986
I'm serious --
there's no clause in the prenup against

297
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:49,435
her swapping gym bags with some cheese ball.

298
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:50,536
What would she --

299
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:55,746
god, she's probably stealing from my dad, too.

300
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:57,080
All right, easy, chief.

301
00:15:57,131 --> 00:15:58,708
I'll get you the money shot.

302
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,184
First I need $100.

303
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:01,173
What for?

304
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:02,158
Expenses.

305
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:04,876
Can you load kendall's music onto that?

306
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:28,017
If curly moran worked here,

307
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:31,908
I can pretty much assume he wasn't interested in me because of my car.

308
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:38,984
And I don't suppose he left a bunch of helpful clues just lying around.

309
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:40,486
That your car?

310
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:43,077
'Cause we don't service those here.

311
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,871
No, actually, I called earlier.

312
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:47,018
Curly's niece.

313
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,450
Maybe he mentioned me --

314
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:49,665
Veronica Mars?

315
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:50,535
No.

316
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:52,721
But you're just in time.

317
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,806
We were about to trash this stuff.

318
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,051
You can take it if you want it.

319
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:00,531
So he never said anything about Veronica Mars?

320
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:03,565
Curly didn't say much as a general rule.

321
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:04,431
Sorry, kid.

322
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:08,646
Not a particularly sentimental bunch here at the garage.

323
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:09,970
So, no information,

324
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:13,713
but I am now the proud owner of an oil-filter-themed nude calendar.

325
00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:16,128
Curly with bimbo...

326
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,626
curly with sports star...

327
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:25,703
and what's this?

328
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:29,305
It looks as though curly and I have a friend in common.

329
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,800
Maybe it's a coincidence --

330
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:40,036
an ex-con shows up with my name on his hand

331
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:43,138
when I'm the key witness in his benefactor's murder trial.

332
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:44,683
And maybe it's another coincidence

333
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:48,517
that curly moran was following me that day on the cliff, but I doubt it.

334
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,334
Hey.

335
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:50,791
What's on your mind?

336
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:51,875
Just...

337
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,733
fine european automobiles.

338
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:58,196
Since when have you thought about fine european automobiles?

339
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:01,423
Ever since I became a future business leader of america.

340
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:11,494
Congratulations, fblaers.

341
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:14,868
You are now worth exactly $1 million.

342
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:16,989
What? You mean I've lost money?

343
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,278
Heads will roll.

344
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:21,161
I assume that you have all heard about my stock market game.

345
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:23,191
In fact, I think many of you have played before.

346
00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:24,694
Over the course of the school year,

347
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:27,581
each club member will control a virtual portfolio.

348
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:30,667
Now, you may invest your money any way you see fit...

349
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:32,341
as long as it's legal.

350
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:34,933
Dude, dog racing is totally legal.

351
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:37,983
But hardly lucrative, from your performance last year.

352
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,191
The student with the most valuable holdings at the closing bell on june 1st

353
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:45,796
will claim a prize more valuable than money

354
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:51,455
a small, shiny plaque with his or her name on it and all attendant bragging rights.

355
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:54,776
All right.

356
00:18:54,776 --> 00:18:58,989
For those of you shooting for warren buffett status, there is a cash prize --

357
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,980
oooh! --

358
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:04,348
For the student who can beat the snp average.

359
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:05,455
Standard & poor's?

360
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,933
Samuel nelson pope --

361
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:07,740
yours truly.

362
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:09,334
Wow.

363
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,921
Well, what'd you invest in, Mr. Pope?

364
00:19:12,537 --> 00:19:13,643
Well, take a look.

365
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:15,786
I haven't made too many changes since last year.

366
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:17,983
I tend to be more conservative than my students,

367
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:20,991
primarily because I use this model for my own 401(k).

368
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:22,364
How much real money did you make?

369
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:25,784
Precisely enough to retire in exactly nine months.

370
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:29,691
Dad's pulling in 35% returns?

371
00:19:30,014 --> 00:19:32,202
Dude, I'm the one that's retiring.

372
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:33,448
I'll alert the dog track.

373
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:35,829
As for myself, at the end of this year,

374
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,511
I'll hang up my stock market spurs,

375
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:41,157
buy some cozy t-bills, and literally sail off into the sunset.

376
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,110
Cool.

377
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:43,780
Is that a swan 40?

378
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,024
Yeah, nice, huh?

379
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:46,799
From 1971.

380
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:50,719
I would've retired earlier, but the restoration's been tricky.

381
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,614
We had to reseal the hull twice.

382
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:55,170
Couldn't plug her right the first time, huh?

383
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,061
Well, I can tell you one thing --

384
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:13,037
whoever it is you're fighting over, she won't be very impressed by this.

385
00:20:13,448 --> 00:20:14,252
You're done.

386
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:17,264
I believe the principal is waiting for you.

387
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:20,804
I'll be back for you.

388
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:25,182
Actually, I disagree with nurse ratched.

389
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,757
I think Veronica would've been quite impressed.

390
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:29,756
Probably a little turned on, too.

391
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:32,524
Careful, Logan. You're exposing your soft underbelly.

392
00:20:32,575 --> 00:20:35,283
My underbelly is rock-hard.
It can go all night.

393
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:37,337
You lost her.
I didn't steal her.

394
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:38,704
The hell with Veronica!

395
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:40,970
She's in the rearview mirror.

396
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:42,612
Where were you this summer, man?

397
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:43,263
What do you mean?

398
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:45,403
There was this little situation.

399
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,119
I was accused of murder.

400
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:50,487
I am the eye of a storm, and I never heard from you.

401
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:52,655
It is a war out there, and you're on the sidelines?

402
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:54,470
Do you remember when you used to have my back?

403
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,315
Wait, I do remember this summer.

404
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:57,609
I was dealing with this thing.

405
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,293
What was it?

406
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:00,101
Oh, yeah, I remember now.

407
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:02,072
Your dad murdered my sister.

408
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,132
The principal is waiting, young man.

409
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:09,951
I hate him, too, you know.

410
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:17,527
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,562
Does that sting?

412
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,871
Veronica, it's no big deal.

413
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:27,498
Just what guys do sometimes.

414
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:31,127
I don't think colin firth gets into pointless fisticuffs.

415
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,019
A pistol duel, maybe, but --

416
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,214
I realize I'm not a 19th-century british woman,

417
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,622
but I just don't get that colin firth thing.

418
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,065
I think it's less him they're after and more the mansion with the matching swans.

419
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:45,365
No, it's him.

420
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:46,936
Last year, I dated this actor.

421
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:48,419
Big mistake, by the way.

422
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:52,190
But he did this play in london, and he was at the after party.

423
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:56,935
I'm no 19th-century british woman, either, But if Mr. Darcy would've asked,

424
00:21:56,986 --> 00:21:58,738
he would not have needed swans.

425
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:00,438
And so it's gone all night --

426
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:02,246
how jackie met colin firth,

427
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:05,073
how jackie got herself thrown out of st. Paul's prep

428
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,837
for "borrowing" the dean's car,

429
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:08,620
how jackie got bored with manhattan

430
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:11,136
and flew to paris with her boyfriend for her birthday.

431
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:13,934
...Get a guy who knows how to wear a saddle suit...

432
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:17,259
how can jackie stand the nonstop excitement of being herself?

433
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,055
So?

434
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,644
She's cool, huh?

435
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:24,007
Is there such a thing as too cool?

436
00:22:24,689 --> 00:22:25,753
What do you mean?

437
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:27,023
I mean...

438
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:32,595
are you sure there's not a more "you" kind of girl at Neptune?

439
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:35,186
So, what -- you think she's out of my league?

440
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:37,875
You think I'm too small-time for a girl like that?

441
00:22:37,926 --> 00:22:39,833
Wallace, no, that's not what I mean.

442
00:22:39,884 --> 00:22:40,969
Then what did you mean?

443
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,662
What did you mean, Veronica?

444
00:22:42,915 --> 00:22:46,893
I mean, I think you're out of her league.

445
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:51,092
But if you want to slum it a bit, maybe I'll help her out with you.

446
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:53,509
I used to have an in with Wallace Fennel.

447
00:22:53,744 --> 00:22:54,998
I could put in a good word.

448
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:56,071
What's going on?

449
00:22:57,473 --> 00:23:00,307
I thought only girls went to the bathroom together.

450
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:02,970
Just a little personal-grooming chat.

451
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:06,667
Wallace wanted to know what hairstyles drive girls crazy.

452
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,542
Personally, I'm a sucker for the wild look.

453
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:10,504
Rrroar!

454
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:12,614
Hey, you're missing it.

455
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:14,719
Some guy just touched lizzie's glove.

456
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,912
Retract claws, Veronica.

457
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:22,194
God, that's only half of it?

458
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:24,047
I should've just read the book.

459
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:26,564
Thanks so much, you guys.

460
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:27,414
That was fun.

461
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:29,628
Sure. Great meeting you officially.

462
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:30,848
Thanks, Veronica.

463
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:32,330
I'll see you at school.

464
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:34,370
We should get together friday and finish it.

465
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:37,078
I hear there's a bitchin' chase scene at the end.

466
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:38,637
I can't.
I got to work.

467
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:39,743
I'm busy, too.

468
00:23:40,124 --> 00:23:41,574
We'll find another night.

469
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:44,817
I can hardly wait.

470
00:23:46,604 --> 00:23:48,716
I'll see if I can clear my calendar.

471
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:51,029
She's cool.

472
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,914
Oh, yeah -- way cool.

473
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:03,319
Kendall casablancas is one of the most energetic trophy wives I've ever seen.

474
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,773
In and out of every high-end store in town

475
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:08,960
without standing still long enough to let me make my move.

476
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:13,569
Not standing still, but this is probably the best chance I'm going to get.

477
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,679
Hi.

478
00:24:21,431 --> 00:24:22,918
I'm really sorry to bug you.

479
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:24,827
I noticed we have the same ipod.

480
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:25,778
Wow.

481
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:27,313
What are the odds?

482
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:31,323
Can I help you with something before my heart goes out of the red zone?

483
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:33,325
Totally. This will just take a second.

484
00:24:33,376 --> 00:24:36,010
Um, I think my player is acting funky,

485
00:24:36,061 --> 00:24:38,829
and I'm not sure if it's my player or my headphones.

486
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,393
And I don't want to borrow my boyfriend's headphones because he has,

487
00:24:41,444 --> 00:24:44,985
like, major earwax and that would be totally gross.

488
00:24:45,036 --> 00:24:46,525
So, could I...

489
00:24:46,576 --> 00:24:47,384
borrow mine?

490
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:48,326
Yeah.

491
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:49,539
All right.

492
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,230
Just, you know, make it quick.

493
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,511
My ass needs some major work here, okay?

494
00:25:00,518 --> 00:25:02,438
Well, the headphones aren't broken.

495
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:05,803
I love this song.

496
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:09,401
I love how it keeps my heart rate in the red zone.

497
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:11,994
What else do you have on here?

498
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:14,305
Oh.

499
00:25:15,738 --> 00:25:16,658
Sorry.

500
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:20,713
Well, I guess mine's busted.

501
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:26,948
And your ass looks totally awesome, by the way.

502
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,867
Huh.

503
00:25:32,354 --> 00:25:35,414
You've got to admire a girl who sticks to her schedule.

504
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:36,329
Lunch...

505
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:37,717
bag switch...

506
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:42,941
followed by illicit sex at one of her husband's numerous hotels.

507
00:25:46,885 --> 00:25:47,485
Bingo.

508
00:25:53,546 --> 00:25:54,778
Hey, leave a message.

509
00:25:54,837 --> 00:25:56,371
Hey, beaver, it's veronic--

510
00:25:56,947 --> 00:25:58,684
sorry -- Cassidy.

511
00:25:59,096 --> 00:25:59,946
It worked.

512
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:03,199
Steal it back and meet me before closing tonight.

513
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:04,123
See ya.

514
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:17,570
Sandpiper?

515
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:32,572
I don't know what's going on with this hotel,

516
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:35,864
but it's pretty clear someone somehow is getting screwed.

517
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:43,509
Kendall's special someone went straight from the motel to the bank,

518
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,102
kendall's gym bag in hand.

519
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:47,468
Next stop, a strange one --

520
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,084
the county courthouse.

521
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:53,660
Any chance this gigolo is turning himself in to the sheriff?

522
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:08,924
What kind of business does he have with the assessor?

523
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:12,125
And is our assessor's name actually jack montana?

524
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:16,739
I need t o know that man's name.Where did he go?

525
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,894
Are you looking for someone?

526
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:22,215
The guy hit my car in the parking lot, and I need his name.

527
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,243
I'm sorry.

528
00:27:23,294 --> 00:27:24,209
You must be mistaken.

529
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,349
Lady, my dad will kill me.

530
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,168
I can assure you there is no one in Mr. Montana's office except Mr. Montana.

531
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:32,181
Dark hair?

532
00:27:32,994 --> 00:27:34,418
This tall?

533
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,932
Mr. Montana.

534
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:47,544
What can you tell me about real estate fraud?

535
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:52,848
Well, provided your interest is purely academic, there's really not a lot to say.

536
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:54,647
Not to say it doesn't exist,

537
00:27:54,698 --> 00:27:56,623
but it's pretty tough to fleece people

538
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,584
since generally they don't buy properties sight unseen.

539
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:02,866
Except in the case of a reit.

540
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:06,164
True. But there's still multiple safeguards in place.

541
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:07,779
A local assessor, for instance,

542
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,605
makes sure that all properties are sold for fair market value.

543
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:13,415
So, even if you bribed the assessor,

544
00:28:13,544 --> 00:28:16,516
you'd have to find a really unsuspecting buyer?

545
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:20,040
I suppose you could borrow against an inflated property

546
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:24,042
to buy more property and then inflate its value and so forth and so on.

547
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:26,131
Like building a house of cards.

548
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:28,462
Yeah. I suppose it might work...

549
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,676
until somebody sneezes.

550
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:33,093
Sell your casablancas stock.

551
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:34,291
What?

552
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:37,413
Mr. Casablancas is artificially driving up his company's value.

553
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:38,127
How do you --

554
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:44,955
I have seen the fabulous sandpiper hotel, and there's nothing fabulous about it.

555
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:48,234
And it's not worth nearly $60 million.

556
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:49,458
This has to be a mistake.

557
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:51,211
It's not a mistake.
I've checked.

558
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,720
This isn't the only one.

559
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:55,307
And the buyers in the most recent sales?

560
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:58,403
Shell companies controlled by casablancas enterprises.

561
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:02,020
It is a house of cards, and someone's gonna sneeze on it -- me.

562
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:04,325
Mr. Pope, dump your stock.

563
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,134
You don't dump it, Veronica.

564
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:07,073
You sell it...

565
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:08,476
to somebody else.

566
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:13,351
I'd just be sticking some other sucker with the consequences.

567
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:18,564
I don't think I can live with that.

568
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:22,533
Then I guess you won't be taking an early retirement.

569
00:29:41,264 --> 00:29:44,106
So, what do you think the kids are doing right now?

570
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:50,018
As long as they're not in jail or setting anything on fire, I kind of don't care.

571
00:29:53,394 --> 00:29:54,844
I am running for sheriff.

572
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,815
It would look bad if Veronica got arrested.

573
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:02,905
Do you really want it back --

574
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:05,628
sheriff, all the politics?

575
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,440
Yeah, I do.

576
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,071
I like being that guy.

577
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:14,560
I'd love to have underlings and deputies other than my daughter.

578
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:19,701
She's really no good at wrestling hopped-up meth heads into the back of the car.

579
00:30:21,272 --> 00:30:23,510
How do you think she's gonna handle it?

580
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,555
Are you kidding?

581
00:30:26,196 --> 00:30:28,728
Veronica's the one who talked me into running.

582
00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:30,464
Wow.

583
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:31,600
Mmm-hmm.

584
00:30:31,651 --> 00:30:32,539
Like I said...

585
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,352
you got my vote.

586
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,082
Oh, I'm counting on it.

587
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:53,334
You want to get out of here?

588
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:54,382
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

589
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,442
Cheri?

590
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:01,834
Hey.

591
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:02,927
Cher?

592
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:13,952
Hey! Cher!

593
00:31:21,514 --> 00:31:22,620
You know that guy?

594
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:23,947
No.

595
00:31:24,989 --> 00:31:26,007
Cher.

596
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,788
You get that a lot?

597
00:31:28,642 --> 00:31:30,137
More than you think.

598
00:31:32,116 --> 00:31:34,572
Do you know how to make a mini-bar martini?

599
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:35,787
Are you kidding?

600
00:31:35,971 --> 00:31:37,593
I invented the damn things.

601
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:48,990
I need a name from you.

602
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,795
A white guy, black woman --

603
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:52,188
staying on the third floor.

604
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:56,171
I'm sorry, sir, but we don't give out names of guests staying at the --

605
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:58,150
just find the name.

606
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:05,173
<i>I sigh for jeanie with the light brown hair</i>

609
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:25,893
Lars, everyone.

610
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:27,218
And now courtney.

611
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:29,786
Courtney, you want to come up here?

612
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,124
Nice one.

613
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:35,785
Jeanie, strapping young lad.

614
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:37,510
Young love.

615
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:38,560
So beautiful.

616
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:44,516
But, you know, even young love has a dark side, so let's not lose perspective.

617
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:53,502
<i>Love hurts</i>

ta-da.

632
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:41,985
Nice work with the camera, by the way.

633
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:43,796
I couldn't even find the lens.

634
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:45,206
That's the idea.

635
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,599
This might take a little while.

636
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:51,804
2,000 pictures?

637
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:53,900
One every 15 seconds.

638
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,719
My dad is gonna kill that guy.

639
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:09,665
There's something I need to tell you about your dad.

640
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:11,585
Hey, Veronica, you got customers.

641
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,281
Okay.
I'll be right back.

642
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,560
How do I break this to you, kid?

643
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:19,612
You hired me to protect your old man from a gold-digging wife,

644
00:34:19,663 --> 00:34:21,823
and I wind up proving they're both gold-digging

645
00:34:21,874 --> 00:34:24,248
casablancas enterprises investors for millions.

646
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:27,734
I get the distinct feeling that "sorry" won't cut it.

647
00:34:30,796 --> 00:34:32,020
Oh. Hey, Veronica.

648
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,475
Hey, jackie...

649
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:35,922
and random dude.

650
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,974
Dave, this is Veronica, the girl I was a total biatch to.

651
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:42,806
We'll just take that table over there.

652
00:34:42,857 --> 00:34:43,865
You look pretty busy.

653
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:44,596
Yeah.

654
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,353
You look pretty busy yourself.

655
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:50,953
Too busy for Wallace and definitely too busy for me.

656
00:34:52,278 --> 00:34:54,881
<i>I know it isn't true</i>

657
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:58,094

662
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:22,765
where's your brother?

663
00:35:22,962 --> 00:35:24,290
He didn't come to school today.

664
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:25,531
Have you seen Logan?

665
00:35:26,521 --> 00:35:28,927
No, he didn't come to school today, either.

666
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:32,750
I thought it was just a coincidence, but now that I think about it...

667
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:39,503
Wallace: Hey, Veronica.

668
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,326
So, you in?

669
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:42,096
We're doing it.

670
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:43,930
And what is "it"?

671
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:44,994
P&p, baby --

672
00:35:45,045 --> 00:35:48,241
"pride and prejudice." Second half is going down tomorrow night.

673
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:50,420
I hear there's a bitchin' chase scene at the end.

674
00:35:50,471 --> 00:35:51,244
Really?

675
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,096
And you're not...busy?

676
00:35:53,357 --> 00:35:54,735
No, I'm totally free.

677
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,268
So, great. It's on.

678
00:35:56,663 --> 00:35:59,673
I can't wait. Lizzie gettin' busy with colin fizz-irth.

679
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:01,336
So, you coming?

680
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,074
I just have to check something.

681
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:03,811
All right.

682
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:13,088
Oh, sweet son of man.

683
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:14,738
Saved by the bell.

684
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:20,250
Veronica.

685
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,049
Is my little boy cheating on me?

686
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,810
It's just someone from school.

687
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:27,775
Ooh, a schoolgirl.

688
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:28,543
Yeah.

689
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,224
Should we invite her over?

690
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:33,441
I got a boy toy. A girl toy might spice things up.

691
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,999
I can handle the spice department.

692
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,943
Thank you very much.

693
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,302
- Oh, really?
- Really.

694
00:36:38,694 --> 00:36:40,934
This is Logan with today's inspirational message.

695
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:42,886
"To love and win is the best thing.

696
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:46,660
To love and lose, the next best." William M. Thackeray.

697
00:37:55,397 --> 00:37:57,291
I love what you've done with the place.

698
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:58,005
Yeah.

699
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:01,068
Well, now you know what you were missing.

700
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:03,448
Is your girlfriend still here?

701
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:04,358
Girlfriend?

702
00:38:04,997 --> 00:38:07,302
Girlfriend? You have to be a little more specific.

703
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:08,445
Let me clarify.

704
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:10,952
The one whose husband is gonna break you in half

705
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:14,107
when he finds out that his son's old cub scout camporee buddy

706
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,776
is secretly plowing his wife.

707
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:19,203
That one is less a girlfriend and more A...

708
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:21,591
playmate, kind of.

709
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:23,903
I hope you're scared on the inside, Logan.

710
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:25,953
What if I had been Mr. Casablancas?

711
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:28,212
What would you have done then, huh?

712
00:38:28,263 --> 00:38:32,243
Just standing here in your towel and your room still reeking of bimbo?

713
00:38:32,294 --> 00:38:35,430
I would've had some explaining to do.

714
00:38:35,595 --> 00:38:36,861
What a cliché.

715
00:38:38,022 --> 00:38:40,539
Poor little rich boy with a death wish.

716
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:44,550
And I used to think that it was bad luck that landed you in danger --

717
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:48,050
the knife fight on the bridge and the drive-by on your car.

718
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:51,582
But, no, now I see you actually enjoy it, don't you, Logan?

719
00:38:51,861 --> 00:38:53,460
Then I guess I should feel grateful

720
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:56,871
for having such a devoted ex-girlfriend looking after me.

721
00:38:57,738 --> 00:38:59,528
My very own guardian angel.

722
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:00,997
Don't flatter yourself.

723
00:39:01,097 --> 00:39:04,042
I came here so I won't have to feel responsible.

724
00:39:04,147 --> 00:39:06,261
Yeah, responsible for what?

725
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,206
For taking pictures of you and kendall playing house.

726
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:10,943
Don't take it the wrong way, Logan.

727
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:11,779
It was a job --

728
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,792
nothing more.

729
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:16,109
And so you storm out in a burst of professionalism.

730
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:19,363
I suggest you start locking your doors.

731
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:25,637
Oh, my god.

732
00:39:26,052 --> 00:39:30,228
I must have walked down this hall a hundred times during my summer with Logan.

733
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:32,898
What was it Aaron wrote to curly on that picture?

734
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:35,567
"All these years, still on 'the long haul'"?

735
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:37,534
"The long haul"...

736
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,243
that's not some kind of macho expression -- it's a movie.

737
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:45,386
The 1982 thriller that introduced a young action star named Aaron Echolls,

738
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:49,540
featuring a signature stunt where a truck is sent veering over a bridge,

739
00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:53,844
a stunt supervised and performed by david "curly" moran.

740
00:39:54,843 --> 00:39:59,111
If this is what you call storming out, I'm not sure you understand the concept.

741
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:02,614
Where the hell did these come from?

742
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:03,473
I'm sorry, dad.

743
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:06,416
I couldn't let her do this to you any longer, so...

744
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:09,244
so I hired someone.

745
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:10,654
A private investigator?

746
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:11,340
Yeah.

747
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:15,555
Oh, son.

748
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:23,049
W-what are you gonna do?

749
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:30,274
Mr. Casablancas?

750
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,215
Some gentlemen from the S.E.C.

751
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:33,506
Are here to see you.

752
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:37,652
Shred it. Shred everything.

753
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:38,667
Shred everything.

754
00:40:38,756 --> 00:40:40,934
Empty your files and start shredding right now.

755
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:42,429
Start shredding.
Start now.

756
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,157
Open your desks.

757
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,924
Get all the papers out.
Do it right now. Do it.

758
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:39,653
Hey. Did you hear about Dick's dad all over the news?

759
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,825
It was me.

760
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:42,815
What?

761
00:41:43,223 --> 00:41:44,623
Veronica, what are you --

762
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:45,791
the bus crash.

763
00:41:46,386 --> 00:41:47,692
It was meant for me.

764
00:41:49,414 --> 00:41:51,095
They all died because of me.

765
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:03,077
