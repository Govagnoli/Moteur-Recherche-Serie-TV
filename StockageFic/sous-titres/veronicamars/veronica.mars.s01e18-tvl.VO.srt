1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:02,131
Previously on Veronica Mars…

2
00:00:02,243 --> 00:00:04,460
I can do this. I can kick this on my own.

3
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:07,947
There is nothing twelve weeks in here can do that I can't do myself.

4
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:09,521
I want you to come home.

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,209
I miss you.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,476
God, Veronica.

7
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:15,899
I don't know what you saw.

8
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:17,138
A file on Duncan.

9
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:20,619
Obviously Jake and Celeste lied about their alibis.

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,603
What made you think they were involved in covering up Lilly's death?

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,280
Doing some laundry?

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,700
Honey, it was a soccer uniform I found in the dryer.

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,430
Any chance I'm ever gonna get to see the inside of your apartment?

14
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:56,056
And what, exactly, are you hoping to see?

15
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:58,452
Our good china, the screening room?

16
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:02,711
Wanted to get a really good long look at your bedroom ceiling.

17
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:05,322
Wow! College girls must be easy.

18
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:08,671
This is my 'A' material. They swoon.

19
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:11,467
My dad's home. I saw his car outside.

20
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,203
But he's cool with us, right?

21
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:19,255
Like, has he made a couple of remarks about the 29 month age difference? He has.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,592
On the other hand, he likes the fact that you carry a gun.

23
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,542
Not so much that he's okay to sleepover but,

24
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:27,360
yeah, he likes you.

25
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:32,317
I'll call ya tomorrow.

26
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:34,758
- Later, deputy. 
- Later.

27
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:45,254
Ah, the pretend-to-be-digging-in-the-fridge- rather-than-spying-on-your-daughter ploy.

28
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:46,354
Bravo.

29
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:48,434
Veronica, we need to talk.

30
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,322
He's a fine gentleman, pa.

31
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:53,154
He'll come up with the dowry to marry me, just you wait.

32
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,525
But seriously, folks. Sit down.

33
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,448
I know how uncomfortable you are with the idea of me dating

34
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,541
and I've done everything in my power to respect that, but…

35
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:06,820
your mom's been gone for over a year now.

36
00:02:06,897 --> 00:02:08,652
- You met someone? 
- I have.

37
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:12,887
But I didn't want to say anything until I was sure I had feelings for this person.

38
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,314
Alicia and I talked about it and-

39
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:16,922
What? Who? Alicia?

40
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:18,632
Wallace's mom?

41
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:19,532
Say what?

42
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:22,559
Well, from your reaction I'd say your heard me just fine.

43
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:09,371
On the bright side, if our parents get hitched,

44
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:11,741
we could have bunk beds and stay up all night talking.

45
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:12,909
You're truly sick.

46
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:16,124
I've always wanted a little brother I could dress up like a little doll.

47
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:16,851
Yeah?

48
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:19,242
See how that works out for you.

49
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,941
Dear Seventeen Magazine.

50
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:41,274
How can I tell if the super cute boy in my class likes me?

51
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:42,702
No. Scratch that.

52
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:44,167
Dear Seventeen.

53
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:48,130
How can I tell if the super cute boy in my class killed his own sister?

54
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,883
Come on, buckaroos. We're burning daylight here.

55
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:57,653
So a new edition of the "Navigator" comes out tomorrow and we're still short on articles.

56
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,307
Let's do something fun.

57
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,768
How about something on oxycontin replacing ecstasy

58
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,397
as the drug of choice for high school students.

59
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:07,166
I'm sure your parents don't want to read about drugs at the school

60
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:09,046
where they sent their precious little ones.

61
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:11,211
I'm sorry. I thought the newspaper was for the students.

62
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:14,673
Where's your Pirate Pride, y'all, lots of good stuff happens here.

63
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:18,630
Did you know that Madame Rousseau's been teaching French here for forty years now?

64
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:20,909
Maybe someone could do an in-depth profile.

65
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:23,315
A loving tribute to a sadistic crone.

66
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:27,032
The janitors work so hard and no one even pays attention to them.

67
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:29,229
Maybe we could do something on them?

68
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,078
Maybe.

69
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:34,389
Oh, what is with these fire drills? This is the third one this week.

70
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:37,993
Maybe we should do a story on oxycontin use in the administration office.

71
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:42,120
Okay, Pirates. Single file. Straight line.

72
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:46,446
Heads up, chests out, big smiles. Ready? Okay.

73
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:53,789
You know what? There's a good story for you, the fire drills.

74
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:57,517
A fire drill story! Someone alert the Pulitzer Committee.

75
00:04:57,737 --> 00:04:59,688
You'll find a way to make it interesting.

76
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,004
I believe in you.

77
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:03,738
Not exactly Ms Dent, is she?

78
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,793
Not even close.

79
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,421
She was overly peppy as my pep squad advisor, as a journalism teacher, she's a nightmare.

80
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,755
Lots of stories about bake sales and blue ribbons.

81
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:15,068
Why, oh, why did Ms Dent let herself get knocked up?

82
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:17,981
So what's the skinny on the fire drills, Mr C?

83
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,266
Faulty hotplate in the faculty lounge?

84
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:22,088
Gremlin gumming up the works?

85
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:26,742
No, we're simply following the district-wide policy for mid-semester fire drills.

86
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:29,025
We've let ourselves get a bit behind.

87
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:30,371
Really?

88
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:32,988
Because if memory serves, it was like one or two a year.

89
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:34,622
There have been three this week alone.

90
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:38,590
I'm sorry there's not a more entertaining explanation.

91
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:41,194
It's just district policy.

92
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:45,441
Now if you'll excuse me, I have some paperwork to catch up on.

93
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:51,794
How's the story coming?

94
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:54,215
I'm blowing the lid off the fire safety policy.

95
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:57,565
Hey, do you know how I can find out what the official district mandate is?

96
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,458
Have you spoken to Miss Roush?

97
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:03,012
She's the Assistant Superintendent; she's definitely your source.

98
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:06,533
Um, I think I've got her number. Here.

99
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,958
- May I? 
- Of course.

100
00:06:16,857 --> 00:06:19,709
- Ellen Roush. 
- Miss Roush, this is Veronica Mars.

101
00:06:19,765 --> 00:06:23,539
I'm doing an article for the "Navigator", the school paper at Neptune High.

102
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,993
How can I help you?

103
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:26,405
I just wanted to clarify something.

104
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:30,129
How many fire drills does the district mandate each semester?

105
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,487
Just one is our policy.

106
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:41,694
Something wrong, Corny?

107
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:44,407
Yeah, I came to get something out of my locker

108
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:46,630
but I can't remember what it was.

109
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:50,833
Hey I was thinking of busting out of here.

110
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:53,198
Maybe go to White Castle.

111
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:54,565
Wanna come with?

112
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:56,742
There's no White Castle in Neptune.

113
00:06:56,921 --> 00:06:58,591
It's kind of an expression.

114
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:01,319
What's wrong?

115
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,404
Oh, crap!

116
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:12,594
Here. Okay, well, I'll check that door.

117
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:23,126
How's she holding up?

118
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:33,749
Excuse me, Mr Clemmons? That's Ellen Roush from the district office.

119
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,937
Hello.

120
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:44,373
Van, I received a call from a very pushy student of yours who's doing a newspaper story.

121
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:46,779
Yes, I know the girl that you're talking about.

122
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,326
She should never have called you.

123
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:51,481
Well, she did and she has quite a fresh attitude.

124
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:54,963
Yes. I spend half my waking hours trying to keep her out of my hair.

125
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:59,386
Mr Clemmons, she gave me the impression that you've been exceeding your fire drill limits.

126
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:03,194
No, uh, look, I've been trying to keep this under my hat

127
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:06,338
but we have had a series of bomb threats

128
00:08:06,426 --> 00:08:08,586
and as a precautionary measure,

129
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:11,003
I brought in the bomb squad.

130
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:15,033
Well that's very disturbing news, Mr Clemmons.

131
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,444
Please let us know if there's anything we can do.

132
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,384
You're positive about this, Veronica.

133
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,626
Mr Clemmons confirmed it. It's accurate.

134
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,209
But is it responsible?

135
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:36,239
This is exactly what newspapers are supposed to do.

136
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:40,233
Then what are we waiting for?

137
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:41,585
We're burning daylight here.

138
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:45,820
It's crazy. Are you kidding me, I mean, is this supposed to be real?

139
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:48,834
- Dude, it's right on the front page. 
- Are you staying? - Are you kidding me?

140
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:51,327
I'm going home. I'd rather not be here when the school blows up.

141
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:52,691
I'm going with you.

142
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:58,292
You won't believe how insane the administration office is.

143
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,500
Phones ringing off the hook. Parents going off on Clemmons.

144
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,230
He wants to see you in his office, by the way.

145
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,460
He does? I'm beginning to think he has a crush on me.

146
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:08,778
Let me be clear as I explain something.

147
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:12,279
The Neptune "Navigator" is not the "Washington Post".

148
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:14,957
You don't have carte blanche to print whatever you choose.

149
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:17,493
- Was story inaccurate? 
- That's not the issue.

150
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,156
- It's not? 
- No, it's not.

151
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:25,382
Our very real duty to protect the student body trumps your non-existent right to a free student press.

152
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:28,880
But Mr Clemmons, isn't a newspaper supposed to be-

153
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:32,751
And what exactly is your journalism background, Ms Stafford?

154
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:36,853
I was on my high school year book staff.

155
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:41,148
Then what do you say we play to our strengths and stick to pictures of smiling kids

156
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:44,885
engaged in the multitude of enriching activities that Neptune has to offer.

157
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:46,825
And Veronica,

158
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:52,524
who was this highly placed source in the administration that confirmed your story?

159
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:55,391
Um, that would be you.

160
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:56,922
I most certainly was not.

161
00:09:57,398 --> 00:10:00,219
Mr Clemmons, the fresh girl gave me the impression

162
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:03,005
you had been exceeding your fire drill limits.

163
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:07,075
Where are the threats coming from anyway, a student?

164
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:10,193
Veronica, I did not invite you in here for a follow up interview.

165
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:11,791
This is a disciplinary meeting.

166
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:14,223
You should feel lucky that you're not suspended.

167
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,106
Maybe you'd be doing me a favour.

168
00:10:17,203 --> 00:10:21,032
And Ms Stafford. You need to use better judgement in the future.

169
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:24,904
No more stories on this subject. Am I understood?

170
00:10:25,032 --> 00:10:25,836
Completely.

171
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:30,710
I may have made a mistake in allowing a pep squad advisor

172
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:33,316
to substitute for a journalism teacher.

173
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,385
Who would like to compare the character of the three Karamazov brothers?

174
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:45,328
I'd like to hear from someone who hasn't spoken today. Ben?

175
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:50,780
I didn't read it. I thought maybe I'd wait for the mini-series.

176
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:54,083
I don't know where you expect to end up in life with your attitude, Ben.

177
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:56,633
Well, I wouldn't worry about it Mrs Murphy.

178
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,291
It doesn't matter.

179
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,153
In the end we all wind up in the same place.

180
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:02,910
Six feet under.

181
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:16,272
"And that doesn't include your plan. Your plan murdered him, you know."

182
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,991
"It was an accident. We're all sorry about it.

183
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:20,632
You have to think of all the good…"

184
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:21,838
What's happening?

185
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,767
They're still watching a movie. He has his arm around her.

186
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,412
Uh, he's not… groping her or anything, is he?

187
00:11:28,643 --> 00:11:33,099
No, but earlier I saw him cutting a hole in the bottom of his popcorn bucket.

188
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:35,366
That's not funny.

189
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:37,680
Yeah, well my dad's not a groper.

190
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:41,735
Do you think they're serious? What does your dad say?

191
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:45,949
That's the good thing. We don't have to worry. It won't last long. It can't.

192
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:47,080
What does that mean?

193
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:48,504
My mom's in rehab.

194
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:50,745
When she gets cleaned up, she's coming home.

195
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:53,910
And where does my mom fit into that plan?

196
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,058
So, I guess she's just a placeholder then?

197
00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:03,522
Somebody to keep your dad from being lonely until the woman

198
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:05,636
who dumped him decides she's ready to come back?

199
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:08,773
What do you expect me to say, Wallace? This is my family.

200
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:11,058
Two minutes ago, you didn't want them dating either.

201
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:15,210
Yeah, I probably wish Mom would've found a guy who wasn't my best friend's dad,

202
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:18,246
but… Mom hasn't found a decent guy since my dad died

203
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:20,991
and if she's just gonna get burned, I need to tell her right now.

204
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:21,958
You can't.

205
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,300
Why not.

206
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,930
Wallace, wait, do me a favour and just wait a few weeks.

207
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:31,595
I gotta say, Veronica. I'm getting a little tired of doing you favours.

208
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:35,326
"You always said that what happened to one of us happened to us all."

209
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,453
"Get away from me."

210
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,171
- She's like the, the private witness. 
- I don't know.

211
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,774
Hey, we need to get going.

212
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,498
Honey, we're still watching the movie.

213
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:44,854
It's getting kind of late.

214
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,399
Okay.

215
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,881
Did you and Veronica have a fight?

216
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:54,932
No.

217
00:12:57,538 --> 00:13:00,088
I know this is uncomfortable for you.

218
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:03,012
But I'm counting on you to be mature about this.

219
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:04,839
I am.

220
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:07,691
I'm just looking out for you.

221
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:10,918
Well, you don't have to, 'cause I'm a big girl.

222
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,451
Yeah, I do. There's something you need to know.

223
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:14,132
Wallace.

224
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,474
- Just listen. 
- I don't want to hear it.

225
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,277
- Well you need to hear it. 
- No, I don't.

226
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:21,408
What I need is for you to see how happy I am.

227
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:28,418
This is the first time that I actually feel at home in this town.

228
00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:32,555
Keith is a very good man and that is all I need to know right now.

229
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:35,038
Let me have this.

230
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:36,928
Please.

231
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:44,270
Wait, how can you even have an opinion on Ubuntu if you haven't tried it?

232
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:49,339
Two six kernel, Live CD, they even had GNOME 2.O the day Warty Warthog came out.

233
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,940
I'm sorry. I'm perfectly content with OS X.

234
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:56,297
I have all the awk/grep-ance that I want without any need for that pitiful font de-uglification.

235
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:59,502
But the fonts are de-uglified and it's free.

236
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,631
You know, fine, you know, live in the dark ages.

237
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:03,987
I know what I like and I like what I know.

238
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,557
Hey, that iPod Mini is something else, isn't it?

239
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:10,152
- Hi, Veronica. 
- Hey. I'm sorry to interrupt.

240
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:13,612
Mac, would you mind taking a look at my computer? I can't get it to boot up.

241
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:17,100
Sure, um, could I take it with me though, I gotta boogie.

242
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:19,630
Yeah, everything important is password protected.

243
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:22,988
Like I really care who you have a crush on.

244
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,590
Hey, Veronica, can I talk to you about something.

245
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:26,961
Yeah, sure.

246
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:28,887
I have some information for you.

247
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:30,996
Confidential information.

248
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,166
My favourite kind.

249
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:36,141
It's about your story, about the bomb threats.

250
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:36,647
Yeah?

251
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:40,780
Well, it got me thinking. The other day I was riding my bike to school

252
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:45,496
and I passed by this vacant lot and I saw Norris and that new kid, Ben.

253
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:48,526
They were throwing tennis balls at stray cats.

254
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:51,585
Uncool, but… I don't get it.

255
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:54,702
The tennis balls were exploding.

256
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:03,370
Hey, last night, you said something.

257
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:05,341
Am I really your best friend?

258
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,337
Who else you seen around?

259
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,670
Quit smiling at me.

260
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:19,473
Hey, what do you think of this new kid, Ben? Heard anything?

261
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:22,505
You're unbelievable.

262
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:23,968
Why? What makes you say that?

263
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:25,984
'Cause you want me to go get his file, don't you?

264
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,539
You're so predictable.

265
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:33,829
It's for the greater good, Wallace. Doesn't he look like total bomb threat material?

266
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:37,272
I'd check out his friend.

267
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:39,646
Clemmons made him turn his shirt inside out.

268
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,761
Why? What'd it say?

269
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,455
"Kill 'em all. Let God sort 'em out."

270
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:06,402
Forty six hours, fifteen minutes… until what?

271
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:24,297
Veronica's sitting by herself.

272
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:26,319
No, Meg.

273
00:16:26,412 --> 00:16:27,625
Come on, be nice.

274
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:33,258
- Hey, you mind if we… 
- Yeah, sit.

275
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:36,355
Carlita, Biff, Rocco, make some room.

276
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:38,315
Imaginary friends.

277
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,786
So the whole school is talking about your article.

278
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,502
You think the threats are real?

279
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:46,800
Let's hope not.

280
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:50,287
Ice cold fries, anyone?

281
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:51,982
No, thanks.

282
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:59,410
So, are you working on any interesting cases with your father?

283
00:16:59,482 --> 00:17:02,468
Well, that Maltese Falcon is still eluding us, but

284
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:06,221
I'm not allowed to talk about the cases. A confidentiality thing.

285
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,910
Duh. Course.

286
00:17:15,862 --> 00:17:17,653
You know, there is one case that's sort of interesting.

287
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,805
I'll just leave out the names.

288
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:23,414
Successful entertainment attorney, divorced his wife,

289
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,314
owed her like half a million dollars in alimony and child support money,

290
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:30,023
literally erased himself off the face of the earth.

291
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:31,452
How do you go about doing that?

292
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:34,873
First, you get your hands on all the cash you can. Using cash is key.

293
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:37,392
Ditch your cell phone for a pre-paid jobber,

294
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:42,593
move around in a rental car paid for with a debit/credit card and a fake driver's license,

295
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:44,995
cross over the border if possible.

296
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:48,061
If you're really adventurous, you buy an old passport off eBay

297
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:50,079
and do an extreme makeover on it.

298
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:51,604
Excuse me.

299
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:56,633
Ah, the shop talk buzz kill.

300
00:17:57,037 --> 00:17:59,971
It's not you. He's been acting weird all day.

301
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:02,962
Well, I'll catch you later.

302
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,729
Ben and Norris. Is it possible these two are just biding their time,

303
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:13,943
waiting for the moment they can blow the school sky high?

304
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:18,310
Norris earned his reputation as a thug and bully back in junior high.

305
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:40,215
But, I have seen another side.

306
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:17,370
So let's check in, see where his head space is these days.

307
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:22,987
Hi.

308
00:19:24,472 --> 00:19:26,721
I'm doing a poll for the Neptune "Navigator".

309
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:29,018
Wow, how vital.

310
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:30,720
What's the question?

311
00:19:30,862 --> 00:19:32,935
Okay. World War III starts tomorrow.

312
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:35,833
You can share your bomb shelter with three other people. Who would they be?

313
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:38,620
You know what? I actually think I'd be a casualty of war

314
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:41,128
so I don't think the question really applies to me.

315
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,234
Bruce Lee,

316
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:43,795
Joe Strummer,

317
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:45,321
Sam Kinison.

318
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,127
They're all dead.

319
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:53,190
Okay, other.

320
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:56,032
You could have sat with me.

321
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,372
I thought you were making a point.

322
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:00,000
I wasn't.

323
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:02,084
There's no school file on Ben.

324
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:03,574
Strange.

325
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:06,252
Maybe he's too new.

326
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:08,121
I got you Norris's file.

327
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:09,370
You're saintly.

328
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,758
I get the top bunk.

329
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:17,383
Suspended for violent behaviour a bunch in middle school but that's what I thought.

330
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:19,504
But nothing since high school.

331
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:21,443
Maybe he's trying to keep his record clean.

332
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:22,820
'Cause he's planning something big.

333
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:24,269
That's scary.

334
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:28,540
Hey, Wallace, thanks.

335
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:31,724
For what it's worth, you're my best friend too.

336
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:34,878
I'm glad you found your mom and got her some help.

337
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:36,202
Should have told you that sooner.

338
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:38,053
I should have told you that sooner.

339
00:21:00,254 --> 00:21:05,798
That was either a really poor warm welcome or an excellent cold shoulder.

340
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:10,494
Logan told me you've been carrying on your own investigation of Lilly's murder.

341
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:15,398
That you have files of everyone in your computer.

342
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:20,217
That's true.

343
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:24,369
Is there a file on me?

344
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:29,555
There's a file on everyone who was connected with Lilly.

345
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:32,577
What does mine say?

346
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:43,839
It says that you have Type IV epilepsy, that you have mood swings,

347
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,831
violent outbursts, that you're taking medication.

348
00:21:47,163 --> 00:21:48,443
How do you know that?

349
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:50,332
Doesn't matter.

350
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,626
It does matter.

351
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:55,611
You've been prying into my private life. If I wanted you or anyone else

352
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:57,141
to know about that, I would have told them.

353
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,026
Who the hell do you think you are?

354
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,540
I am Lilly's best friend.

355
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:04,904
- Lilly is dead, her killer is in jail. 
- Abel Koontz didn't kill Lilly.

356
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:07,500
- He confessed. 
- He was paid to confess.

357
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:12,881
Oh my god. I mean, do you even hear yourself? Who would pay?

358
00:22:17,852 --> 00:22:20,639
Us. Of course.

359
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:24,806
You think someone in my family paid him. Now why would they do that, Veronica?

360
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:27,386
- I don't know. 
- To protect… me?

361
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:31,103
Do you remember what happened that day?

362
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,058
You think I killed Lilly.

363
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:49,541
How could you think that, even for a second?

364
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,308
Duncan, calm down.

365
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:53,416
What, do you think I'm gonna have another episode and kill you too?

366
00:23:10,152 --> 00:23:11,142
All you talk about is guns.

367
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:12,888
All you're talking about here is death,

368
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,161
heavy metal music and bombs and stuff like that.

369
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:16,661
It's no big deal. Just relax.

370
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:19,799
But I can't keep hanging out with you if you're gonna keep doing that.

371
00:23:19,873 --> 00:23:20,589
Fine.

372
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,053
Fine.

373
00:23:22,144 --> 00:23:22,938
Fine.

374
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:33,460
A girl must prioritise. Wallowing in the grief of betraying an ex-boyfriend

375
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:36,742
or following the guy most likely to blow up Neptune High.

376
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:47,131
Hell, give me a stick of gum to chew and I'll do all three at once.

377
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:57,996
The Camelot Motel, premium accommodations

378
00:23:58,052 --> 00:24:00,980
for adulterers and rent by the half-hour hookers.

379
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:04,867
Now it appears to be the destination of choice for teen Kazinski.

380
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:49,375
Oh my god.

381
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,426
- Yeah? 
- Hey, it's Logan.

382
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,699
Hey, uh, just a-a heads up for you.

383
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:01,105
Duncan knows about your files.

384
00:25:01,264 --> 00:25:02,831
He knows because you told him.

385
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:06,025
Well, yeah, I mean, what was I supposed to do? He's my best friend.

386
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:08,171
Yeah, well, he took my head off.

387
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:09,533
You would have loved it.

388
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:11,510
Have you talked to him since school let out?

389
00:25:15,288 --> 00:25:17,285
Oh my god, what do you think you're doing?

390
00:25:17,454 --> 00:25:18,815
Let's go for a ride.

391
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:28,959
Make a left at the next stop.

392
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,219
Where are we going?

393
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:33,100
Well, you should know. You must have followed me there.

394
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:34,437
The Camelot?

395
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,333
Yep.

396
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:41,083
I'll say this, Veronica. You're a pesky one. You're screwing everything up.

397
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:43,986
Listen, I really think you're making a mistake, I don't know anything.

398
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:47,171
Quiet. I need to think for a minute.

399
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,052
My dad's a private detective. If I don't check with him after school, he freaks.

400
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:53,260
There will be people looking for me, armed people.

401
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:54,677
I wanna show you something.

402
00:25:54,744 --> 00:25:57,719
Why can't we do it someplace public. Frappacino anyone, my treat?

403
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,846
I know you think you're being a hero, but a lot of people might die 'cause of you.

404
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:06,139
Logan, stop.

405
00:26:08,897 --> 00:26:10,170
He's a federal agent.

406
00:26:21,438 --> 00:26:23,400
You're undercover at Neptune High?

407
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:26,586
Is it all right if he goes outside?

408
00:26:27,465 --> 00:26:28,540
I'd like to talk to you.

409
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:31,448
Dream on, Jump Street. I'm not leaving you alone with her.

410
00:26:32,443 --> 00:26:35,843
Logan, he's the real thing. Just give us a minute, all right.

411
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:41,729
Fine. Don't close the door all the way.

412
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:43,502
Yeah, I'll be right out here.

413
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,100
So why Neptune?

414
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:57,909
Well, part of my job at the ATF is monitoring internet traffic.

415
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:02,317
Norris kept a website that was… troubling.

416
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:07,263
We discovered countless emails he'd sent to other students, lots of red-flag words.

417
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:08,318
Red-flag words?

418
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:11,651
Retribution, bomb, arsenal, gun show,

419
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:15,221
fertilizer, Waco, Columbine.

420
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:18,626
We think that he's the leader of scores of likeminded misfits

421
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:20,714
who are waiting for his signal to attack.

422
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,583
Is this signal a countdown clock?

423
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:25,976
If he's such a threat, why haven't you brought him in yet?

424
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,004
Having too much fun smarting off to teachers, cat killing, kidnapping.

425
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,056
Cat killing?

426
00:27:31,164 --> 00:27:32,270
I hear things.

427
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:35,725
If there's been any cat killing, Norris has acted solo.

428
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:38,352
It makes sense though.

429
00:27:38,548 --> 00:27:42,869
Sociopaths normally get their start taking out their aggression on animals.

430
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:44,277
Why don't you just pick him up?

431
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:47,969
Oh, I will bust him.

432
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:49,734
Be sure of that.

433
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:54,773
I've got more arrests on my record than any ATF agent my age, ever.

434
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:56,683
Failure's not an option.

435
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,087
Wow.

436
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:02,009
Problem. If we pick him up now, we can hold him for 48 hours,

437
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:05,213
then we either have to charge him or release him.

438
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,674
Now I either need evidence that he's hoarding banned weapons

439
00:28:08,752 --> 00:28:12,974
or I need to get my hands on the list of the names of the people he's been corresponding with.

440
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:14,889
Why are you telling me all this?

441
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,383
I need your help.

442
00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:19,850
I need you to get close to him.

443
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:21,146
Isn't that your job?

444
00:28:21,238 --> 00:28:22,605
I pushed him too hard.

445
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:23,804
Spooked him.

446
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:27,223
Now I'm screwed if I don't get him off the streets by tomorrow.

447
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,969
I've been to his house but I haven't been in his bedroom or the garage.

448
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:35,528
And how do you expect me to swing an invitation to his bedroom and/or his garage?

449
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:37,965
Easy. He likes you.

450
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:39,256
He likes me?

451
00:28:39,522 --> 00:28:41,079
"Likes me" likes me?

452
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:44,131
Yeah, he's mentioned it on more than an few occasions.

453
00:28:45,384 --> 00:28:47,715
Veronica, your school needs your help.

454
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:50,146
Your government needs your help.

455
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:51,688
If you need an in,

456
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,979
he loves talking about his ancient weapon collection.

457
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,920
You okay.

458
00:30:26,716 --> 00:30:30,069
Thanks for doing this, Norris. My dad's really been struggling with this case.

459
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,339
It's no problem at all.

460
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,918
I brought some pictures of the stolen weapons if that helps.

461
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:37,375
My parents are a little nosy.

462
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:43,269
It's probably more effective than the "Mind Your Own Beeswax" sign I have on my door.

463
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:45,671
Although it does have a picture of an angry kitty on it.

464
00:30:54,732 --> 00:30:58,568
So, this is my weapon collection.

465
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:02,561
You must feel really safe at night, when the dragons come.

466
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,208
Uh, here are the pictures.

467
00:31:08,664 --> 00:31:12,039
Do you, uh, wanna sit down?

468
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:14,475
Are you kidding? I wanna look at these weapons.

469
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:17,368
They're so pointy.

470
00:31:21,561 --> 00:31:23,251
This one's very "Braveheart".

471
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:27,941
That's a replica of William Wallace's sword.

472
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:30,322
I've seen that movie like 50 times.

473
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,929
Anything you recognise?

474
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,745
Yeah, the Tachi Sword.

475
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:36,517
I'll write down the price.

476
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:37,747
Is that wireless?

477
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:40,506
Yeah. My dad's a programmer over at Kane Software,

478
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:42,411
so we get all the latest technology.

479
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:45,519
We were one of the first household in the country to have Wi-Fi.

480
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,698
I have a replica of this.

481
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:54,012
It's, uh, it was right over there but I think it-I think it fell.

482
00:31:54,094 --> 00:31:55,124
I'll look for it.

483
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:59,635
Now if I were a pipe bomb, where would I be?

484
00:32:03,316 --> 00:32:05,517
Great! I'm his type.

485
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:11,021
Ah, actually, don't even worry, I'll find it later.

486
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,520
Maybe he keeps his arsenal in the garage.

487
00:32:13,694 --> 00:32:17,861
So how do I get into the garage without playing dungeon with this whack job?

488
00:32:17,924 --> 00:32:20,049
Uh, you ever throw one?

489
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:21,503
Can't say that I have.

490
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:24,441
I got a target in the garage if you wanna try it.

491
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:26,177
Huh. That was easy.

492
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,384
I think it, it happens.

493
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,311
Detention? Me?

494
00:32:32,443 --> 00:32:33,893
I think not, Mr Clemmons.

495
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:38,158
Try filling out that form left handed.

496
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:40,841
How come these are rubber?

497
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:43,313
Um, they're just for practice.

498
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:45,530
Uh, next time, I'll let you try a real one.

499
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:48,423
Am I crazy or is bomb boy flirting with me?

500
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:51,425
No question about it, the Japanese have the coolest weapons.

501
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,785
Shall I just put these in here?

502
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:55,438
No, you can just hand them back to me.

503
00:32:59,171 --> 00:33:03,942
My dad said that if I keep my grades up, I can tour Japan this summer.

504
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:09,681
You know there's a Kurasawa retrospective over at the Paragon this weekend.

505
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:12,672
You think, maybe you'd like to go?

506
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:19,399
It's cool. It can just be like… a friends thing.

507
00:33:20,962 --> 00:33:23,307
Okay, I came up empty on the weapons search but

508
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:25,995
there's one place I can check for his address book.

509
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:30,280
If I can access the Clayton family wireless system from out here, I'm gold.

510
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:37,115
Excellent.

511
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:41,898
Hello?

512
00:33:41,974 --> 00:33:44,893
Hey, Mac, it's me. I need you to walk me through something.

513
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:46,885
What did you ever do before you met me?

514
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:50,418
Ever see the first ten minutes of "2001: A Space Odyssey"?

515
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,820
It was a lot like that.

516
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,645
Monkeys clubbing each other-

517
00:33:55,707 --> 00:33:57,201
No, I… I got it.

518
00:33:57,356 --> 00:34:00,304
Mac, if you were planning the Apocalypse on Friday,

519
00:34:00,402 --> 00:34:03,121
would you ask someone out on a date for that weekend?

520
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,689
Me? That's the only way I'd ask someone out.

521
00:34:11,487 --> 00:34:12,255
Veronica?

522
00:34:15,327 --> 00:34:16,940
Earth to Mars.

523
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:20,990
Dude, where'd you go?

524
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:26,622
Norris, pick up, pick up, pick up. It's Veronica.

525
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:34,690
Okay. If you get this, call me before tomorrow.

526
00:34:51,244 --> 00:34:53,164
Hey. I got your message late.

527
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,777
Listen, something's up.

528
00:34:54,853 --> 00:34:58,391
Ben isn't who he says he is and he thinks you're behind the bomb threats.

529
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:03,441
Don't move. Put your hands where I can see 'em. Drop the keys.

530
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,594
This is crazy, you have the wrong guy. It's a joke. A hoax.

531
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,600
I have a warrant to search your vehicle.

532
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:09,865
Fine. Search away.

533
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:16,627
There you go.

534
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,840
A hoax, huh?

535
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,092
That's not my stuff, man.

536
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:23,209
Cuff him.

537
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:25,421
He's lying, that's not my stuff.

538
00:35:25,512 --> 00:35:26,592
- Hands behind your back. 
- I didn't do this.

539
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:28,871
- You set him up? 
- Step back, please.

540
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:31,000
People, this is a crime scene.

541
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:35,701
He's lying to you.

542
00:35:42,235 --> 00:35:44,411
Agent Ben used me. I know it.

543
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:47,503
Ten to one he planted the rifle and fertilizer in Norris's trunk

544
00:35:47,554 --> 00:35:49,802
while I was inside playing with throwing stars.

545
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,717
All I need to do is prove it.

546
00:35:56,975 --> 00:35:58,486
Gro-Time Fertilizer?

547
00:36:02,146 --> 00:36:04,097
- Hello. 
- Pete Kamiski please.

548
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:06,653
- Speaking. 
- Pete, it's Veronica Mars. Got a minute?

549
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,784
Yes, yeah.

550
00:36:08,274 --> 00:36:10,856
Tomorrow, we'll be publishing a story in the "Navigator"

551
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:15,106
that says you created false internet traffic through Norris Clayton's wireless internet

552
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:18,687
accessible to you because you reside within a hundred feet of the Clayton house.

553
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:19,443
What?

554
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:22,969
The story goes on to say that you created the Killemall dot net website

555
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:26,092
with its countdown clock and called in the bomb threats to the school

556
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:29,764
in order to implicate Norris even though there was never an actual bomb.

557
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:35,167
Additionally, you lied to this reporter about Norris and a young ATF agent killing stray cats.

558
00:36:35,223 --> 00:36:36,867
Would you care to comment on this story?

559
00:36:37,516 --> 00:36:39,364
Are you crazy?

560
00:36:39,857 --> 00:36:41,704
Do you think this is something I just do for kicks?

561
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:47,746
You did it because you were the frequent victim of Norris's bullying you in junior high.

562
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:50,915
He was expelled once for holding you down and letting a tarantula crawl

563
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:55,001
across your face in earth science and again for taking your lunch money.

564
00:36:57,685 --> 00:36:59,266
Pete, still there?

565
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:01,349
Every day.

566
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:02,405
Excuse me?

567
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:06,071
He took my lunch money every day before we got on the bus.

568
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:09,178
For two years I scrounged off my friend's plates.

569
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:11,979
I finally told my dad. You know what he said?

570
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:14,395
He said, "Be a man.

571
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:19,280
Just pop him in the mouth once, son, and he'll back off."

572
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:21,635
So I did.

573
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,504
I popped him.

574
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,611
Norris sent me to the hospital.

575
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,872
You wanna know what my dad said then?

576
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,478
What?

577
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,680
He said he'd wished he'd had a son.

578
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:40,516
Veronica?

579
00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:50,757
Meg, what's wrong?

580
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:55,945
You haven't seen Duncan tonight, have you?

581
00:37:56,236 --> 00:38:00,036
No. He never showed… which is weird.

582
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:01,479
He's missing.

583
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,341
His parents think he may have run away.

584
00:38:04,428 --> 00:38:05,089
What?

585
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:06,978
Why would they think that?

586
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:11,719
His mother says that yesterday he withdrew ten thousand in cash from the bank.

587
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:13,584
No one's seen him since.

588
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:15,727
That's… bizarre.

589
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,912
Yeah. I don't understand it, I mean, what would make him do that?

590
00:38:22,703 --> 00:38:24,705
So the ATF agent set him up?

591
00:38:24,796 --> 00:38:28,995
The photos show clearly that the same fertilizer bags I saw the agent purchase

592
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:32,738
where the ones found in Norris's car and the same with the rifle.

593
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,797
Well, I guess we have no choice but to print it, do we.

594
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:40,198
I was thinking about that.

595
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:44,873
Maybe I could take this story down to the city paper,

596
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:48,599
see if they'll publish it or maybe just put it on a website.

597
00:38:50,377 --> 00:38:51,826
What fun would that be?

598
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:01,051
In case you were wondering, Mr Clemmons? Not pleased.

599
00:39:01,226 --> 00:39:02,286
I've lost sleep over it.

600
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,641
Did you have to mention Norris's school records?

601
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:06,509
Someone could have put two and two together.

602
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,184
They will have to really speak sharply to me before I reveal my sources.

603
00:39:19,171 --> 00:39:21,952
Listen up everybody, I have an announcement.

604
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:28,755
I just heard that Norris Clayton is being released later today.

605
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:33,949
The charges have been dropped thanks to a certain high school newspaper's front page story.

606
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:39,047
And I'm sorry to report that today is my last day teaching at Neptune High.

607
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:42,606
It's been a real kick working with all of you.

608
00:39:43,988 --> 00:39:47,245
Now, I'd appreciate it if you could work independently.

609
00:39:47,337 --> 00:39:49,278
Your sub will arrive shortly.

610
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:03,172
Okay buckaroos, we're burning daylight in here.

611
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:05,215
We need stories. Who's got something?

612
00:40:05,313 --> 00:40:06,955
