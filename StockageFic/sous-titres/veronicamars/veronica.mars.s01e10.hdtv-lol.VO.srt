1
00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:02,435
Previously on Veronica Mars…

2
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,978
It's been a year since my best
friend Lilly Kane was murdered.

3
00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:07,817
Dad told Jake Kane, the most
powerful man in town

4
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:10,912
that he was sure that he was somehow
involved in his own daughter's death.

5
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:13,617
Duncan Kane.
He used to be my boyfriend.

6
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:17,943
And let's not forget Logan Echolls.
His dad makes twenty million a picture.

7
00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:21,704
Smile, Logan. Don't forget,
these folks pay for all of this, huh?

8
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:24,525
What the hell do you think
you're doing on our beach?

9
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,284
Am I supposed to apologise?

10
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:29,310
Am I supposed to shake
in my boots, Weevil?

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,819
- Maybe.
- Look around you, man.

12
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:32,661
- It ain't fifteen on four tonight.
- That's right.

13
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,473
All this time, I've been
thinking Mom bolted

14
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:37,082
because she couldn't
handle losing everything.

15
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,973
Maybe she just couldn't handle losing me.

16
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:42,062
Clarence Wiedman. The man who took
surveillance photos of me.

17
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:44,449
The ones with me framed in a gun sight.

18
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,173
<i>You've reached Clarence Wiedman,
Head of Security, Kane Software. </i>

19
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:50,693
And there it is. I know who's responsible
for scaring Mom away from Neptune.

20
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:54,399
Her former lover,
Dad's nemesis, Jake Kane.

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,557
<i>- It is okay, will you make it snow?
- Sure thing.</i>

22
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,367
<i>Don't get your hopes up.</i>

23
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:05,078
<i>- You'll never get anywhere with that one.
- We'll have to try.</i>

24
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,151
The downside to being an only child?

25
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:11,059
You know all the scary handmade
ornaments are yours.

26
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:13,412
Ooh, this concerns me.

27
00:01:19,589 --> 00:01:22,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You gotta put
another Padres ornament over there.

28
00:01:24,814 --> 00:01:25,287
What?

29
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,446
They should be spread out so it's even.

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,317
You know, there are some
people who think Christmas

31
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:32,830
is about the birth of Christ,
and not baseball.

32
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:35,549
Well, we're all entitled to
our own religions, Veronica.

33
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,993
So what do you want for Christmas.

34
00:01:36,994 --> 00:01:39,497
- Your love and respect.
- Seriously,

35
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:42,730
if you could have anything,
for Christmas, anything?

36
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:44,364
I want you to save your money.

37
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,954
Oh, it's our favourite part.

38
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:57,019
<i>I'm Mr Green Christmas, I'm Mr Sun…</i>

39
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:03,209
…I'm Mr Heat Blister, I'm Mr 101.

40
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:07,714
They call me Heat Miser.
Whatever I touch

41
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,481
- starts to melt in...
- You start singing, you stop drinking.

42
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:15,828
You know, you look pretty comfortable
with that thing in your mouth.

43
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,419
Savore Cubano.

44
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:20,359
You people can handroll
like nobody's business.

45
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:26,866
- Five hundred.
- Call.

46
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:31,780
Sean, isn't that ghetto brew beneath you?

47
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:32,922
It's the new me.

48
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:35,039
I am projecting a ghetto aesthetic.

49
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:36,951
Word.

50
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:40,724
Man, where were you when I was playing
the metrosexual in "Lonely Season"?

51
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:43,726
I was in high school, not getting paid
a quarter of a million dollars

52
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:46,182
to make out with Selma Blair, Connor.

53
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:47,381
Don't cry now.

54
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,515
All in.

55
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:03,471
Oh damn.

56
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:09,875
So let's see here. There are 42 cards
remaining and I can win with 40 of them.

57
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,099
I can win with an ace.
I can win with a Jack.

58
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:16,079
Will she be the ten and
give me the straight?

59
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,405
Or will I get the high
kicker out of my Jack.

60
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:20,849
Pins and needles.

61
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,691
- Just flip the card.
- Okay.

62
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:26,251
But the river's gonna get ya.

63
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,164
Boom.

64
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:39,962
I can't believe he beat you
with a pair of twos.

65
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:43,028
I'd like my five grand now.

66
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:45,375
Sean, the money box
so I can pay the pool boy.

67
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:00,890
No. No, no, no, no.

68
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:02,737
You guys aren't pulling
any of that with me.

69
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:04,599
Weevil, I'm not pulling anything.

70
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,204
Where's the money?

71
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,877
- Guys, where's the money?
- Where is it?

72
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:11,642
Did it fall out?

73
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:14,472
- How could it fall out?
- Maybe it was never in, huh?

74
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:17,643
You know, I rolled the money up
and put it in the box. You all saw me.

75
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:21,158
Well, I'm not leavin' here without my money.

76
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:25,612
Now...do I have to turn each of you
upside-down and shake you?

77
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:35,118
Did you guys call each other?

78
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:41,254
This isn't over.

79
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:46,317
I'll be collecting a grand from
each of you, one way or another.

80
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:51,304
You picked the wrong guy to rip off.

81
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:58,286
This is the worst game
of strip poker ever.

82
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:29,612
<i>Season 1 - Episode 10
An Echolls family Christmas</i>

83
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:31,206
Check it out.

84
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:33,399
You know this is for a baseball camp, right?

85
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,493
It's not like a hot guy catalogue.

86
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:37,606
Do they have a hot guy catalogue?

87
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:42,126
Attend a week long Padres fantasy camp
at their first class training site.

88
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:44,490
It's a perfect Christmas
present for my dad.

89
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,835
In a world where you can
afford three grand.

90
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,027
Oh, I am so sick of not having money.

91
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:51,665
I'd be the best rich person.
Seriously.

92
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,629
I'd be the perfect combination
of frivolous and sensible.

93
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,845
Money is so wasted on the wealthy.

94
00:05:57,352 --> 00:05:58,765
I want my laptop, now.

95
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:02,049
How does it feel to want?

96
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,784
I am not screwing around.

97
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,064
- I didn't take your money.
- Someone did.

98
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:08,482
Well, it wasn't me.

99
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,647
Let him go.

100
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:13,519
Lay off.

101
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,753
Someone stole your laptop?

102
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:24,143
There was this poker game
at Logan's last night.

103
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:26,650
Weevil won five grand and
someone stole the money.

104
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,711
This is his way of collecting.

105
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,474
You lie down with dogs,
you're gonna get fleas.

106
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:32,789
I didn't invite him.

107
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,883
I wasn't talking about Weevil.

108
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,756
Hey, this kinda concerns you.

109
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,122
- I don't see how.
- I keep a journal

110
00:06:40,123 --> 00:06:43,931
on my laptop for the past,
I don't know, three years.

111
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,332
There was a time when
you were kind of a feature.

112
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,664
A feature with a cleverly
disguised pseudonym?

113
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,459
Let's just say...I was prolific.

114
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:56,565
There are a million things Duncan
could have written about me

115
00:06:56,566 --> 00:07:00,702
that I'd sooner impale myself on a rusty
spike than have someone else read.

116
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,665
I must get that computer back.

117
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:09,775
Hey.

118
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,619
See, there you go with
that head-tilt thing.

119
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:15,974
You know, you think you're all badass

120
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:18,634
but whenever you need
something it's all, "hey".

121
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:22,870
Just be glad I don't flip my hair.
I'd own you.

122
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:25,300
So what can I do for you?

123
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,291
You can not get busted
stealing 09er stuff

124
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,964
and let me handle this poker thing?

125
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:31,854
Seriously.

126
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:33,010
Why risk it?

127
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:35,814
Give Duncan back his computer.
Let me handle this.

128
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:37,791
Could you, please, Veronica?

129
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:41,136
Protect me from the big, bad,
sweater vest-wearing rich boys?

130
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,742
I'm just trying to help.

131
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:48,521
In what alternate universe does
it look like I need your help, huh?

132
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:54,370
Of course, if I get my five grand,

133
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,270
some of those guys will
stop losing their stuff.

134
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:01,868
Why were you even there?

135
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:08,358
I hear about a five thousand dollar
card game played by idiots,

136
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:09,903
I'm interested.

137
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:16,551
If you're asking me to the prom again,
the answer is still no.

138
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:18,326
I heard you got a card game going on.

139
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,821
- I'd like in on it.
- Yeah? I'm sure you would

140
00:08:20,822 --> 00:08:23,049
- but I can't.
- A thousand dollar buy in, right?

141
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:26,310
I got the money so what's the problem?

142
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:28,543
Look, my only concern is
property values going down

143
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:31,450
if anyone sees you in my house
without a leaf blower or a skimmer.

144
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,999
You're concerned?

145
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:36,861
I'm the one who's gotta go up
into the hills, all by myself.

146
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:41,305
What if I run into a pack of you white
boys, on some clean, well-lit street?

147
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,734
I could be bored to death.

148
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:45,672
Fine.

149
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,587
It's a thousand dollars in ten crisp
one hundred dollar bills.

150
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:52,457
We don't take food stamps.

151
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:54,857
Ouch! You got me.

152
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,971
He though I was just some dumb Mexican
he could take for his cash.

153
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,041
Who do you think did it?

154
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:05,462
Did Logan do it?

155
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:10,225
Well, I know for a fact that nobody
left the house with the money.

156
00:09:10,226 --> 00:09:13,422
He could've hidden it anywhere
and he had an opportunity.

157
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:17,937
Sean won again?

158
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,960
Well, you miss a lot when you go
to the bathroom every five seconds.

159
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,821
Tip money for the guy who washes my Jag.

160
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:25,696
Dude, you don't even have a licence.

161
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:28,906
Dude, why does he need a licence
when he has a chauffeur?

162
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:33,062
Can it be considered an embarrassment
of riches if I'm not embarrassed?

163
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,730
Thoughts?

164
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,700
- Hot chick, poolside, bikini.
- Hi-yoo!

165
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:47,260
Dude, is that your mom?

166
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:49,305
Here's to you, Mrs Echolls.

167
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,419
And all of you are going to rot in hell.

168
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,928
I'll go to church every day
if this is her nightly skinny dip.

169
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,712
Please jump off the diving board,
please jump off the diving board.

170
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:58,324
Oh god, I love your mother.

171
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,504
Duncan was at the window?

172
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:10,739
- Everybody but Logan was.
- You're sure?

173
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,631
I wasn't taking notes, but yeah.

174
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:14,349
The money was in that house, somewhere.

175
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,778
I would've torn the place apart
if I didn't think he'd call the cops.

176
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:35,847
I don't have an appointment.
I was hoping you were available.

177
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,178
I am.

178
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,228
I'll clear that for you.

179
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:45,268
How are you, Lynn?

180
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:48,533
Honestly, I, uh, am a little freaked out.

181
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:53,106
My husband gets a lot of
disturbing letters from fans.

182
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:56,902
He's a very handsome man
and people get obsessed.

183
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:59,059
Everybody has
their cross to bear, huh?

184
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:01,012
Well, this one's different.

185
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:03,706
I found this on our breakfast
table in our house.

186
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:09,234
"Cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater,
had a wife and couldn't keep her."

187
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,426
Can you find her and keep her away from
us, I mean, obviously she's crazy.

188
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:13,823
Not necessarily a she.

189
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:16,950
Do you keep all the threatening letters?

190
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,060
I try to.

191
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:20,668
Aaron throws them out but
I thought we might need them.

192
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:22,442
I'd like to see them if I may.

193
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:25,202
Just to determine wether
this is the first letter.

194
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:27,593
Can I come by this afternoon?

195
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,687
Perfect.

196
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:36,370
I know this goes without saying but...

197
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:38,868
- discretion's paramount.
- Of course.

198
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:41,742
- It's been a long time, Keith.
- Well,

199
00:11:42,346 --> 00:11:44,813
our kids don't seem to hang out
together much anymore.

200
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:47,077
Logan's had a tough time
with Lilly's death.

201
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:49,858
Understandably, but so has Veronica.

202
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:56,944
Good news?

203
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,628
I might be able to get your laptop back.

204
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,793
So what is this, like a case?

205
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:04,934
Yeah, like the case of
the guy who's too lazy

206
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:07,264
to hand write his journal
like every normal person.

207
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,884
So, any details you can give me?

208
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:15,732
You're serious.

209
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:19,482
Were you a little surprised
that Weevil was even there?

210
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,521
As a matter of fact, I was.

211
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,000
Just want to let you know.

212
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:25,885
I am in fact, feeling lucky.

213
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:27,051
What's up, buddy?

214
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:30,647
Hello.

215
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:32,231
You're not Chester.

216
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,357
Hey, don't worry, okay.

217
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:38,475
There's no way in hell I'm letting
Weevil walk out of here with our money.

218
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:55,821
Do you think Logan invited Weevil
there to steal his money.

219
00:12:56,963 --> 00:12:58,565
Invited him there to steal his money?

220
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,765
No.

221
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,318
But?

222
00:13:04,924 --> 00:13:05,789
Nothing.

223
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:11,633
That's what he decides to steal?

224
00:13:12,263 --> 00:13:14,176
What's he going to do
with a Fabergé Egg?

225
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:17,573
Two words, man.
Huevos. Rancheros.

226
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:21,180
Hey, this is what I get
for trying to be nice.

227
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,430
Is that so?

228
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:28,473
You got something to say to me,
you say it.

229
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:30,194
Did you take the money?

230
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:35,371
You were so drunk, you wouldn't know

231
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:37,142
if Kris Kringle walked in
and took the money.

232
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:38,136
When did you get like this?

233
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:41,206
It's like you've been going over
to the dark side, bit by bit,

234
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:44,730
so slowly that I didn't notice when you
morphed into a full fledged jackass.

235
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:48,403
- Then I'm a jackass?
- Yeah.

236
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:50,559
And I'm over it.

237
00:13:51,776 --> 00:13:53,897
So what, are we breaking up now? Huh?

238
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:55,996
You want your best friend charm back?

239
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,979
I try to make each Christmas
as special as I can.

240
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:09,091
- Carlita, bald patch.
- Si, señora.

241
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:10,689
Well, I went through
the letters you gave me

242
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,092
and I'm fairly certain that the
stalker who left the letter inside

243
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:16,107
had sent six previous letters.

244
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:17,606
Is it bad?

245
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,881
I'm very concerned that this stalker
has escalated to home delivery.

246
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:25,089
I have 200 guests coming
here tomorrow night

247
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,510
and now I have to deal with this?

248
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:28,465
I recommend you cancel the party.

249
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,459
I've hired plenty of security.

250
00:14:32,564 --> 00:14:34,066
Well, what about these people?

251
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:37,873
You have ten people wandering freely
around your house right now.

252
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:41,230
- Do you even know them?
- Of course. They're the help.

253
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:44,607
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la…</i>

254
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:46,795
Keith.

255
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,441
Lynn didn't get you over here
about that letter, did she.

256
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,620
I get letters like that all the time.

257
00:14:52,621 --> 00:14:55,463
Well, I still thinks it's wise
to use extra caution.

258
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:58,631
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

259
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,525
Look, I'm sorry we bothered
you about this.

260
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:03,953
It's nothing. Trust me.

261
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:06,616
I mean that sort of thing
is perfectly normal.

262
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:13,298
Normal?

263
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:20,520
Oh, I was wondering if
you did pumpkin carving.

264
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:24,082
Yes, I'm aware that it's Christmas.

265
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:28,536
You know, I already have a
gingerbread house, but thank you.

266
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,397
Making a list and checking it twice.

267
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,571
Is there a side job I should know about?

268
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:37,278
Do we not live in California.

269
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,681
Isn't there produce available
365 days a year?

270
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:43,257
Well, at least now I know
what I'm getting you.

271
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:46,322
Hey, do you have a minute to run
by the Echolls house for me?

272
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:49,151
I need Lynn to sign a few papers.

273
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,031
Sure.

274
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:05,962
Come on.

275
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:10,535
I love the smell of testosterone
in the morning.

276
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,442
This is why I suggested attack dogs.

277
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:16,257
But no, my mother wanted an alpaca.

278
00:16:17,095 --> 00:16:19,244
My father sent me with
paperwork for your mom.

279
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,096
And you just wanted to say hi?

280
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,564
It's a good thing I didn't have
my slam book out.

281
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:27,139
I wanted to ask you about the game.

282
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:29,638
I've been meaning to ask you something.

283
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:32,971
Did your super-sleuth kit
come with a decoder ring?

284
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:36,481
Do you have a pen that writes
with invisible ink?

285
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:40,703
Never mind, don't care. Mush! Mush!

286
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,778
Hey, uh, wait. Hey!

287
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:49,777
Maybe you should talk to Connor.

288
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,000
Larkin? Like, Connor Larkin?

289
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,833
He's a mortal, believe me.

290
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:00,598
They just draw his abs on.

291
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:02,361
Is he doing another movie
with your father?

292
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,415
You know, I don't know
if it's so much a movie

293
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,431
as a fifty million dollar crap pile.

294
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:09,221
Why would Connor steal
the money? He's a zillionaire.

295
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:11,197
Well, everybody's got
their issues, right?

296
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:16,344
Plus, the guy's got
something against me.

297
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:20,777
So, what's Catherine Zeta-Jones like?

298
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:24,440
She likes to read to starving children
and bake home scones,

299
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,549
this according to "The Insider".

300
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,023
I only met her in passing.

301
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:30,634
It's not like your people,
they don't all know each other.

302
00:17:32,954 --> 00:17:34,167
Dude, what's up with that?

303
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:35,470
What?

304
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,552
That's like the tenth racist
thing you've said.

305
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:40,582
Oh my god! Does the soapbox
come with the SAG card?

306
00:17:43,702 --> 00:17:48,336
Or is it because Rosie Perez
thought you were a girl?

307
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:49,040
What?

308
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,726
Wait, wait. This I gotta hear.

309
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,535
When Logan was like ten,
he was madly in love with Rosie Perez.

310
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:57,762
You so don't know what
you're talking about, man.

311
00:17:57,763 --> 00:17:59,874
Aaron arranged for her
to come to his birthday party.

312
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,146
It was like this big moment.

313
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:05,202
She walks in with this
gift and she's like

314
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:07,530
"Happy birthday, little Lauren".

315
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:13,749
That's funny. Really hysterical.

316
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,109
Oh, dude, she got you a purse!

317
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,589
Connor, you really are like the son
Aaron Echolls never had.

318
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:26,204
So wait, wait. Do you
still have the purse?

319
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:34,173
So unless his Pavlovian response
to a downloaded ringtone is to urinate,

320
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:36,424
then he was up to something.

321
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,875
Or, his bladder's as small as his brain.

322
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:41,552
I would be more than happy
to question him.

323
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,562
I've a feeling he's not
the easiest person to get to,

324
00:18:44,563 --> 00:18:47,721
probably has a team of bodyguards
to protect him from girls like me.

325
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,712
I honestly don't get it.

326
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,215
Hey man. It's, uh, Logan Echolls.

327
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:57,548
Yeah. Hey, listen,
can you get, uh, my friend

328
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:02,080
a drive-on today to see Connor?

329
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:03,926
Yeah, Veronica Mars.

330
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:07,830
No, Veronica, 'V' as in 'virgin'.

331
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,870
Yeah.

332
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:14,570
- There you go.
- Look at you, all helpful.

333
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:18,815
Hey, your peskiness being unleashed
on Connor brings me joy.

334
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:23,389
Annoy, tiny blonde one.
Annoy like the wind!

335
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:31,599
Action!

336
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,281
All right, not bad, that's a cut.

337
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:44,128
Let's set it up to go again please.

338
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,406
I don't know if Connor's smile cost a million,

339
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:50,296
but his six-pack abs are worth at least double that. Damn.

340
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:54,249
I repeat, damn.

341
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,459
Too shiny?

342
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:57,755
Uh, no.

343
00:19:58,152 --> 00:20:00,212
My helicopter gets shot down mid-flight

344
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:03,269
so I'm supposed to be sweaty
but I don't want to be gross.

345
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:06,438
I think you're good.

346
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,311
So, uh, let me guess.

347
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:10,905
- You want to be an actress.
- No.

348
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:13,247
No, I'm just your standard issue fan.

349
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:16,604
Logan told me you were
at the poker game and…

350
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:18,443
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

351
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:21,211
I heard it got a little weird.
Someone stole all the money?

352
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:23,693
Yeah. And I feel sorry
for the kid who won, too.

353
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:24,869
He was pretty cool.

354
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:26,988
He was real, you know what I'm saying.

355
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,558
Any idea of who took it?

356
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:31,168
It could have been anyone.

357
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:35,462
As I understand it,

358
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:39,348
no one left the room and it wouldn't
have been possible for anyone

359
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:40,751
to walk out with cash on them.

360
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:41,965
You know what?

361
00:20:43,353 --> 00:20:45,371
There was one guy who left
the room with cash.

362
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:49,540
How can you play cards when you can't
even get your wallet out of your pocket.

363
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,120
And how does he keep winning hands?

364
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:55,744
At least I take out of my wallet
unlike some cheap ass people.

365
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:58,442
If I didn't know better, Duncan,
I'd think you were speaking ill of me.

366
00:20:58,443 --> 00:21:02,854
Dude, you get dropped off in a town car
and you can't even chip in for beer.

367
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:05,830
I happen to enjoy my
ghetto brew affectation.

368
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:09,660
- Quenching.
- You enjoy being a tightwad.

369
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:11,417
- Thanks for coming in.
- Thank you.

370
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:13,197
Wait, how much did you tip him?

371
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:15,943
Dude, I don't know, a couple bucks.

372
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:20,670
Dude, the bill was fifty,
that's like four percent.

373
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:22,154
Look who's got beer brains.

374
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,092
Here man.

375
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:27,723
It's a kindler, gentler Weevil.

376
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:31,111
It's Christmas, even for delivery guys.

377
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:33,872
Pa rum pum pum.

378
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:38,299
You know, really anyone could have
gotten his hands on the money box.

379
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,566
There were plenty of times.
Bathroom breaks, beer breakes…

380
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,890
Lynn Echolls' breaks.

381
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:45,983
Oh yeah, you heard about that one, huh?

382
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,768
Aw, it's my agent. Can you excuse me?

383
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:01,195
Wallace, are you still in
the attendance office?

384
00:22:02,476 --> 00:22:04,226
It's a small favour. Teeny.

385
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:07,305
Sean Friedrich's home address.

386
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:09,267
I want to send him a Christmas card.

387
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,151
Hey.

388
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:21,050
I was hoping we could have
a quick conversation in private.

389
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:24,135
Brian's cool. You can talk
freely in front of him.

390
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:28,989
Aaron, were you with
anyone last Halloween

391
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,002
that might be harbouring
some resentment or ill will?

392
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:34,514
No.

393
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:38,683
Ah, I was thinking that the, you know, the
Aaron'o'lantern had some significance.

394
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:40,758
A spurned lover, perhaps.

395
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:43,478
I'm faithful to my wife.

396
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,009
As a matter of fact I was
with Lynn last Halloween

397
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,921
at the Casablancas annual costume party.

398
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:50,016
I'm just making sure, you understand.

399
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:53,659
Well, I appreciate that.

400
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,038
Don't want to stir up any muck.

401
00:22:58,231 --> 00:22:59,749
Well, there's no muck to stir.

402
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,546
- Mr Friedrich?
- Good afternoon.

403
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:10,306
- Good afternoon. Is Sean home?
- He's not available.

404
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:13,461
- It will just be a minute.
- Sean is not permitted to receive
visitors at home.

405
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:14,339
<i>Mr Friedrich.</i>

406
00:23:21,422 --> 00:23:23,141
I spoke with Sadie Casablanca

407
00:23:23,142 --> 00:23:25,826
and she said you catered
her Halloween party last year.

408
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:27,014
I cater it every year.

409
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,976
Anything special about this party?

410
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:31,587
I really can't talk about
the events we do.

411
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:33,766
- It's in the contract.
- Is that so?

412
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:38,943
You should know. I was told you had the
bad taste to fire someone that night.

413
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:41,133
She did not say bad taste.

414
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:42,976
Like I had a choice.

415
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:46,311
Servers were restricted
to the first floor as always.

416
00:23:46,312 --> 00:23:49,882
But one server snuck off upstairs
to find an available bathroom.

417
00:23:49,883 --> 00:23:52,640
Aaron Echolls insisted
that the girl be fired.

418
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:55,007
Aaron wanted her fired

419
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:57,247
because she was on the second floor
of somebody else's house?

420
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,381
That and someone else's
wife was on top of him,

421
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,567
Wait. You're saying Aaron Echolls was

422
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,651
with another woman
the night of the Halloween party.

423
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,968
While his wife was downstairs
eating canapés.

424
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:36,234
Good morning.

425
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,712
Maybe in your world.

426
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,274
In mine, I am minus one Rolex.

427
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:44,312
The criminal element found its way
into my gym bag yesterday.

428
00:24:44,313 --> 00:24:46,070
Why can't we all just have nice things.

429
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:47,300
Who behaves this way?

430
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:50,340
Maybe you missed that eye for an eye
section in your Bible.

431
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:52,855
Okay, this isn't retribution,
it's thievery.

432
00:24:52,856 --> 00:24:54,263
Weevil didn't start this.

433
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,870
It's not his fault
someone stole the money.

434
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,276
Is that so?

435
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,791
This is ridiculous.

436
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:03,369
Yeah, I usually get six figures for this.

437
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,959
- What about you?
- I'm the one who got his money stolen.

438
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:08,858
I'm thinking…crabs?

439
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:11,265
I told your mother to clean up.

440
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:14,638
- Guys! Play nice, huh?
- I'm playing nice.

441
00:25:16,252 --> 00:25:17,022
Believe me.

442
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,289
Why would Weevil steal his own money?

443
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,084
You should really consider
another profession.

444
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,537
Perhaps he stole the money before
he knew he was going to win.

445
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:31,211
And before Mrs Echolls got wet and wild,
he was down to his last two chips.

446
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:33,337
I heard you weren't doing so hot either.

447
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:34,136
Yeah,

448
00:25:34,684 --> 00:25:37,157
but the difference is,
I don't need the money.

449
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:46,469
So I interviewed the caterer for
the Casablancas' Halloween party.

450
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:49,629
Do you mind getting
that for me? Thanks.

451
00:25:53,938 --> 00:25:57,433
Apparently, you were
caught in flagrante.

452
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:01,716
Yeah.

453
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:04,343
Yeah, my memory isn't
what it used to be either.

454
00:26:04,344 --> 00:26:06,750
- Listen, it didn't mean anything.
- What's it gonna mean?

455
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:10,094
- I love my wife.
- Aaron,

456
00:26:10,514 --> 00:26:13,938
my job is to track down a
potentially dangerous stalker.

457
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:16,768
Your affair is, well,
that's your affair.

458
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:21,277
So you're, you're not gonna tell Lynn.

459
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:25,469
If Lynn had hired me to find out if you
were cheating on her, I would tell her.

460
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,432
She hired me to protect you
and that's what I'm gonna do.

461
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:29,755
But I'm gonna need your help.

462
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:34,748
This is the guest list from the
Casablancas' Halloween party.

463
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:36,708
Circle the name of who you slept with.

464
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:50,064
Um, no, maybe I should clarify.

465
00:26:50,572 --> 00:26:52,935
Who you slept with at the Halloween party.

466
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,738
It was the night that
I had the hard cider.

467
00:27:14,312 --> 00:27:15,782
That would be Monica Hadwin.

468
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:19,011
Yeah, but she's not a stalker.

469
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,453
She's my agent's wife.

470
00:27:21,454 --> 00:27:22,528
I'm sure she's lovely.

471
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:28,069
Mrs Casablancas gave me
photos from the party.

472
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,628
If you could point out Monica,

473
00:27:32,629 --> 00:27:36,280
and, uh, Sharon and Deborah.

474
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,215
There they are.

475
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:51,054
These three women are invited
to your Christmas party.

476
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:54,894
Maybe that's not the best idea.

477
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:58,230
They're not stalkers.

478
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:01,359
They're just…needy.

479
00:28:04,914 --> 00:28:07,684
Tighter. I didn't lose five
pounds for my health.

480
00:28:08,158 --> 00:28:10,444
- So, Mrs Hadwin…
- Hadwin's my maiden name.

481
00:28:10,445 --> 00:28:11,992
I didn't want to be Monica Greenblatt.

482
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:13,902
If there's anything else
you could tell me,

483
00:28:13,903 --> 00:28:15,460
it would be helpful to the Echolls.

484
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:16,969
Well, what's there to tell?

485
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,556
Aaron's a sexy charming movie star with
an ass like an 18 year old wrestler.

486
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:21,610
He's psycho-bait.

487
00:28:21,912 --> 00:28:24,204
You know, can we go a couple of
inches higher? It's not a wake.

488
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:26,961
You know who you should
talk to is Deborah Daily.

489
00:28:26,962 --> 00:28:30,261
She's always hovering around Aaron,
sticking her fake boobs at him.

490
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,107
Okay, look. My life depends on
looking as hot as possible in this.

491
00:28:35,108 --> 00:28:36,372
You're gonna need to rally.

492
00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:39,035
Always with an audience.

493
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:41,267
He's the Echolls' private investigator.

494
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:43,611
- Aaron has a stalker.
- Oh.

495
00:28:44,546 --> 00:28:46,327
I'm providing him with the
low-down on the ladies

496
00:28:46,328 --> 00:28:48,316
that, uh, aim higher than tennis pro.

497
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:51,128
You'd think at least one part of
my day wouldn't involve Aaron.

498
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,755
Oh, before Aaron, his biggest client
was a day player on "Boy Meets World".

499
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:56,800
And before me,

500
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,008
you sat in your underwear
in a fish tank at the Standard.

501
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:06,929
Breathe, Veronica.

502
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,081
So what? Duncan's secret diary
is unaccounted for.

503
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:13,733
That doesn't mean the intimate details
of our strange and steamy relationship

504
00:29:13,734 --> 00:29:15,907
will become public domain
at Neptune High.

505
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:17,869
Things don't always turn
out for the worst.

506
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:21,354
After all, it's Christmas. Despite
what everyone else might think,

507
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:22,945
Santa knows I've been a good girl.

508
00:29:25,116 --> 00:29:26,872
You're gonna hurt yourself,
thinking that hard.

509
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:29,787
They say if you're caught in a stare
it means your mind needs a break.

510
00:29:31,074 --> 00:29:33,026
Like, that mind ever takes a break.

511
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:36,774
- So, how's the poker case coming?
- Oh, it's a Christmas miracle.

512
00:29:37,196 --> 00:29:39,406
I think I finally found a way
to send my dad to camp.

513
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:47,262
Will you guys kiss and make up already?

514
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:51,934
So, good news, bad news.

515
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:54,476
The good news is, I know
who stole the money.

516
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:58,788
The bad news is, I know
who stole the money.

517
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:00,350
Here's my brilliant idea.

518
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:03,639
Filled with holiday spirit,
Logan will host another game.

519
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,627
- Will I?
- I'm thinking tonight.

520
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,267
Mm, no, my mother's
Christmas party is tonight.

521
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:11,598
Mm, so no BYOB.
Here's how it will go down.

522
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:14,395
I'll tell you who did it and
you'll buy me into the game.

523
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:17,181
I'll just take the place of
whoever stole the money.

524
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:20,072
Unless you still might
think you want his around.

525
00:30:20,377 --> 00:30:23,521
You know, even if you keep talking,
it's not gonna happen.

526
00:30:24,182 --> 00:30:27,546
Oh. I thought you guys might
all want your stuff back.

527
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:28,563
Yeah.

528
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:33,748
If I get my five grand, some items
could magically reappear.

529
00:30:34,057 --> 00:30:35,115
And if you think about it,

530
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:38,761
anyone who doesn't see this as
a great offer is obviously the thief.

531
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,675
Kind of a no-brainer.

532
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:42,634
Do you even know how to play poker?

533
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:44,268
No.

534
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:49,157
But it must be really hard
if all you guys play.

535
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,363
Ho, ho... ho.

536
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:24,684
Allow me.

537
00:31:26,508 --> 00:31:28,387
You want a sodey-pop or somethin'?

538
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:32,467
You know, I think I want
something with a little more kick.

539
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:33,330
Hey, no.

540
00:31:35,857 --> 00:31:37,063
Damn, girl!

541
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:43,049
- Mmm. Iced tea?
- Yeah.

542
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,695
How very musical theatre of you.

543
00:31:47,212 --> 00:31:49,137
Duncan can't remember
the alphabet when he drinks

544
00:31:49,138 --> 00:31:51,855
let alone figure out
20% of the pizza bill.

545
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:55,383
No, he didn't play drunk
to steal your money,

546
00:31:55,384 --> 00:31:57,115
he played drunk to win your money.

547
00:31:57,597 --> 00:31:59,109
To no avail it seems.

548
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,536
Oh, and Connor isn't a drug addict.

549
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:05,128
I know…the constant bathroom visits.

550
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:07,916
He wasn't going for a fix.

551
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:10,400
He was going because of the Sun Tea.

552
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:13,760
It's that diuretic wrestlers down
when they need to make weight

553
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:18,359
or that actors use before their half
naked on the cover of "Vanity Fair".

554
00:32:20,002 --> 00:32:23,257
And then, there's bachelor
number three.

555
00:32:23,462 --> 00:32:24,423
And he's got it all.

556
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,250
Motive. Access.

557
00:32:28,857 --> 00:32:30,123
Looks like an evildoer,

558
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,037
smells like an evildoer,
but surprisingly...

559
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,431
not so much. Weevil cleared him.

560
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:40,379
He told me he searched the room

561
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,205
but didn't go through it
as much as he wanted.

562
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:45,133
When I saw it, it looked like
it had been raided by the FBI.

563
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:47,698
You had to tear the room apart looking for it.

564
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:51,068
So, two left.

565
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:54,086
The boy from the wrong
side of the tracks

566
00:32:54,087 --> 00:33:00,819
and the boy who lives in the most
expensive house in the 09er zip.

567
00:33:03,245 --> 00:33:05,798
So, do you want to hear how Sean did it?

568
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:09,233
Ah, he's a crafty little bugger.

569
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:12,549
Sean didn't bring the Big Mouth
Joes because he's cheap.

570
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,441
He knew he couldn't leave
with the money, so he didn't.

571
00:33:16,812 --> 00:33:18,897
What happens to garbage in the 09er zip?

572
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:22,440
He just waited for the recycling
to go out the next day

573
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:23,990
and did a little garbage picking.

574
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:26,417
Sean?

575
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,917
What? The guy has a chauffeur
drive him to school everyday.

576
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:32,352
- Why would he need to steal?
- Funny story.

577
00:33:32,975 --> 00:33:36,288
When I went to Sean's,
I couldn't help but wonder…

578
00:33:37,205 --> 00:33:39,713
what was his dad doing at home,
three in the afternoon,

579
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:41,828
dressed in a suit instead
of being at work?

580
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:43,139
<i>Mr Friedrich.</i>

581
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:45,514
Unless he was at work.

582
00:33:46,342 --> 00:33:48,458
I have to say, I was a bit miffed.

583
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,442
I was this close to being able
to say the butler did it.

584
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:54,472
But no, it was the butler's son.

585
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:56,705
That doesn't prove anything.

586
00:33:57,306 --> 00:34:00,667
Well, that proves that you're a liar
and the background check I ran on you

587
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:03,049
proves that you've got a bit
of a shoplifting problem.

588
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:04,993
You are really bad at it.

589
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:16,452
I can totally pay you. I have the
money, I can get it right now.

590
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:20,221
All right, why don't we take a walk

591
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,994
so we can discuss a few things, huh?

592
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:24,568
But you see I can pay you, see,

593
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:26,586
there really is no need
for physical violence.

594
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:31,217
Mind if I deal first?

595
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,355
It's this great winery,
just outside of Ojai.

596
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:52,766
Right, it's ninety miles but
you feel like you're a world away.

597
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:54,798
Oh, it sounds perfect.

598
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:56,125
Great.

599
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:58,669
So next fall we'll all go for the crush.

600
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,894
Oh, I'm so excited.

601
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:32,298
Make sure you stay right
here for nine o'clock.

602
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,508
I have a big holiday surprise
for everyone.

603
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,767
<i>Elite Catering. This is Martha.</i>

604
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,908
The girl you fired from
the Casablancas' party.

605
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:49,028
What was her position?

606
00:35:49,029 --> 00:35:50,428
<i>She was a le trancheur.</i>

607
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,613
What does a le trancheur do?

608
00:35:52,614 --> 00:35:54,373
<i>Uh, they're carvers, sir.</i>

609
00:35:54,374 --> 00:35:55,396
Carving.

610
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,017
Can you tell me what she looks like?

611
00:36:06,284 --> 00:36:08,007
A little impressed, aren't you?

612
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:10,426
You must be really unlucky in love.

613
00:36:11,622 --> 00:36:13,740
Okay. I say we take a little break.

614
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:17,242
Let the cosmos realign because
obviously something's up.

615
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:18,777
I can use something to eat.

616
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:28,198
Seriously, don't I just blend right in?

617
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:31,506
Come on. Where's Weevil?

618
00:36:32,455 --> 00:36:34,528
I think we both stand out a bit.

619
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:37,553
Yeah, right. You are a natural
at this. Look at you.

620
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:41,593
I'll be right back.

621
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:44,232
Will you hold this for a sec?

622
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:53,109
You're killing me.

623
00:37:00,836 --> 00:37:03,266
- So…I, uh, you know.
- Yeah.

624
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:09,383
- Sorry about the whole…
- I've been plenty of other things.

625
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:17,681
So, we're cool?

626
00:37:20,762 --> 00:37:21,451
Yeah.

627
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:25,320
Bartender.

628
00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:28,557
- Mars, Mars.
- Look, I'm not on the list.

629
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:31,372
If you could just tell Aaron
that Keith Mars is here.

630
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:33,141
- Not seeing you, sir.
- Will you listen to me,

631
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:34,483
this is an emergency.

632
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:45,507
I've got a question for you.

633
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,287
Hello, Veronica.

634
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:50,756
Does your Head of Security make it
a habit of taking photographs

635
00:37:50,757 --> 00:37:53,578
of high school students and drawing
bull's eyes over their faces

636
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:54,828
or am I special.

637
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:03,376
Clarence Wiedman took pictures of me.

638
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:04,686
Surveillance pictures.

639
00:38:04,687 --> 00:38:07,582
He drew a target over my face and
sent them to my mother. Why?

640
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:09,549
- You're not making any sense.
- Why?

641
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,128
- I have no idea what you're
talking about.
- Why would you want my mother out of town?

642
00:38:12,129 --> 00:38:14,206
- I didn't.
- Why didn't she tell me or my father

643
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:16,755
about the pictures instead of hiding
them in a safe deposit box?

644
00:38:16,756 --> 00:38:17,740
I don't know!

645
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:23,479
I don't believe you.

646
00:38:47,045 --> 00:38:49,123
- …that's a surprise, that's...
- What did you do?

647
00:38:49,475 --> 00:38:51,069
- What?
- What did you do?

648
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,215
Jake, I don't know
what you're talking about.

649
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:54,310
Don't lie to me Celeste.

650
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:57,994
- What did you do?
- Jake, stop it.

651
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,270
Get your coat, we're leaving.

652
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,278
Well, time for us to get a drink.

653
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:15,486
Everyone,

654
00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:19,726
if you could just follow
the Santas outside,

655
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:21,608
I have a special surprise for you.

656
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,512
Brr. I'm gonna grab my jacket.

657
00:39:40,808 --> 00:39:41,660
Okay.

658
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:48,283
Come on, you two,
you'll miss the surprise.

659
00:39:48,284 --> 00:39:50,843
And we know how much
she loves a surprise.

660
00:39:51,483 --> 00:39:52,592
You don't even care, do you?

661
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:53,812
I'm sorry?

662
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:56,513
You sleep with me, you say you love me.

663
00:39:57,163 --> 00:39:59,873
Lynn, I don't know who
this person is, I swear.

664
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:01,445
I don't know you.

665
00:40:03,257 --> 00:40:07,073
<i>Here we come a'wassailing
among the leaves so green.</i>

666
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:12,407
<i>Here we come a'wandering
so fair to be seen.</i>

667
00:40:13,638 --> 00:40:18,218
<i>Love and joy come to you
and to you your wassail too.</i>

668
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,883
<i>And god bless you…</i>

669
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,128
Somebody call an ambulance.

670
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:23,567
<i>…and send you a happy new year. </i>

671
00:40:23,568 --> 00:40:29,478
<i>And god send you a happy new year.</i>

672
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:34,418
What was I thinking?

673
00:40:34,694 --> 00:40:38,847
Christmas in Neptune is, was and
always will be about the trappings.

674
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:43,409
The lights and the tinsel they use to
cover up the sordidness, the corruption.

675
00:40:43,747 --> 00:40:46,915
No Veronica, there is no Santa Claus.
