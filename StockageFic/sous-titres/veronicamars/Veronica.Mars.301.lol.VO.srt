1
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:18,338
Here it is... First day of college.

2
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:19,707
What do you say, Veronica?

3
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:21,267
New school, fresh start...

4
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:24,334
How about you try not to piss
anyone off this time around?

5
00:00:29,043 --> 00:00:31,977
Welcome to college,
where it's okay to skip class.

6
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:34,986
Just not mine.

7
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:38,283
Skip class? I'm gonna
staple myself to the floor.

8
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:41,621
Before we dive in,
I've been asked to plug

9
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:43,829
the criminology department's
mentoring program.

10
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:46,372
We work with at-risk kids
here in Neptune.

11
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:49,797
Our philosophy is that it's better
to prevent crimes through intervention

12
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:51,322
than be forced to solve them later.

13
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,869
My teaching assistant, Timothy Foyle,

14
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:55,932
will take the names of those
who would like to volunteer.

15
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,262
Here's your reading list
for the semester.

16
00:00:59,035 --> 00:01:00,752
All should be available used
at the co-op.

17
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:02,733
What about your book, dr. Landry?

18
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:04,841
Profiling is an upper-level course.

19
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:06,592
Got to walk before we run.

20
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:10,982
All right, what do you say
we start off the semester

21
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:12,641
with a little bit of ridiculous fun?

22
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:16,430
Murder... on the Riverboat Queen.

23
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:18,810
If Tim hands you an envelope,

24
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,633
that makes you a passenger
and a witness

25
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:22,102
On the Riverboat Queen.

26
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:23,903
Go ahead, open your envelope.

27
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:26,372
It'll give you all the details you need to play
this role... Who you are, what you saw.

28
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,973
If you're the murderer,
you're given your cover story.

29
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:30,520
Now, if you're not given a card,

30
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,902
that makes you one of the pinkertons
brought on board to solve the case.

31
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,811
You can question any of the passengers.

32
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:41,103
The current record for solving the case
is 16 minutes,

33
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,491
courtesy of the amazing mr. Foyle.

34
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:46,253
All right, detectives.

35
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:48,482
You may begin questioning
your passengers...

36
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:51,250
now.

37
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:19,323
Yes?

38
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:21,633
Dr. Landry expects everyone
to participate.

39
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:24,410
Is it possible you ended up
in the wrong class?

40
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:27,621
Your academic advisor can get you
into something else, you know.

41
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:29,442
Elementary education, maybe.

42
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,083
I think it's okay to read
magazines over there.

43
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:33,372
They even cut them up sometimes,
make little collages.

44
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:36,140
I know who did it.

45
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:41,370
- Dr. Landry.
- What you got?

46
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,280
This girl says she's got it.

47
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:44,732
But she hasn't moved from her seat.

48
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:46,973
And you are?

49
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:48,672
Veronica Mars.

50
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:51,761
So, Veronica Mars,
who are you going to send to prison

51
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:53,653
for the rest of his natural-born days?

52
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:58,702
The blind... Yet not really blind...

53
00:02:58,808 --> 00:03:00,841
fiddle player, Rutherford Stiles.

54
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:07,203
Congratulations, Veronica.

55
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,351
All right, everybody, you can stop.

56
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:11,771
We have a winner
and a new record-holder.

57
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:13,012
Six minutes.

58
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:15,612
So, how'd you figure it out?

59
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:19,692
"Murder on the riverboat queen"
Was a murder mystery in a box game

60
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:21,780
made by Wigwam Toys in the late '80s.

61
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:24,560
Fans of the game set up
message boards online

62
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,351
that gave away details.

63
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:28,400
I just ignored all the spoiler alerts,

64
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,353
which I know is kind of
douchebaggy, but...

65
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:33,420
The game is set in the 1890s.
You can't use the internet.

66
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:35,483
Was that a rule?

67
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:36,600
It wasn't a rule.

68
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:39,151
And there are two
possible killers in the box.

69
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:41,531
You just took a 50/50 stab, didn't you?

70
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:45,152
Sorry, no. The other killer
is Countess McGee.

71
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:47,800
Dr. Landry just asked me who
I was going to send away

72
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:49,671
for the rest of HIS natural-born days.

73
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:52,081
That kind of sold me
on blind Rutherford.

74
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,360
There is one thing I can't figure out,
though.

75
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,910
What did you do for
the extra 10 minutes?

76
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:04,303
<i>A long time ago,</i>

77
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:07,111
<i>We used to be friends, but I...</i>

78
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,220
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

79
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,363
<i>Come on, now, sugar!</i>

80
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:16,833
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

81
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:20,362
<i>Just remember me when...</i>

82
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:22,701
<i>We used to be friends</i>

83
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:24,893
<i>A  long time ago</i>

84
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:27,101
<i>We used to be friends *</i>

85
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:30,983
<i>Veronica Mars 3x01
Welcome Wagon</i>

86
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,211
You a bounty hunter, boy?

87
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,682
I really shouldn't have pushed
for the Clint Eastwood marathon.

88
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:44,121
Now I've ruined you.

89
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:47,481
I didn't think it was possible
to make you more butch.

90
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:50,232
Stupid, stupid Logan.

91
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:54,962
Well, want to feel like a man?
Walk me to class?

92
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:56,590
Carry your books?

93
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:57,702
Why not?

94
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:01,550
Guess who I saw on campus today?

95
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:03,590
Some girl going wild?

96
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:06,531
As I understand it,
It happens all the time in college.

97
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:08,733
I'm on the verge of it right now.

98
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:10,681
No Dick, my B.F.F.

99
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:13,902
I thought he was crashing
with his dad in the caymans.

100
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:14,833
Nah, he's back.

101
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:16,251
You guys talk?

102
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:18,473
Yeah, but it was brief.

103
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:21,862
Shouted his name, flipped me off.
The bonds of friendship.

104
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:24,582
It was enough of a struggle
getting you into Hearst.

105
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:26,040
How do you think he managed it?

106
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:28,930
Well his mom remarried
Schwarzenegger's business manager.

107
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:30,303
- Ah...
- Yeah...

108
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:31,590
I'm sure a call from the governor

109
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:34,602
can get you into most colleges
in the state.

110
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:40,300
Hey, some people are saying
Dick's a mess,

111
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:45,083
you know, on account of his brother
Greg Louganis-ing off my roof.

112
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:47,632
It wasn't your fault Cassidy jumped.

113
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:49,880
Nothing's ever my fault.

114
00:06:15,285 --> 00:06:18,113
Vinnie... what brings you
to the good part

115
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,881
of the wrong side of the tracks?

116
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:23,513
Dollar signs, mi amigo.
The almighty buck.

117
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:27,423
I got a case that requires
a little double-detective duty.

118
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:30,473
Lucky Pierre owns a jewelry store

119
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,771
And suspects that
he's got an embezzler.

120
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:37,171
What do you say, huh?
Wonder twin powers, activate.

121
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:40,243
Can't, Vinnie... Got my own case,
And it's taking me out of town.

122
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,423
A hit? I understand
there's good money in that.

123
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:45,732
How does one break in?
Is there a union of some kind?

124
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:47,751
Put in a good word for me, would you?

125
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:52,270
You know, I thought about
getting myself a briefcase.

126
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:53,512
Not that I really need it.

127
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,803
You  know, everything I need,
I keep right up here.

128
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:59,700
Vinnie... I'm busy.

129
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:02,631
Okay, okay. If you want to be that guy.

130
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:10,331
Dad? Come here.

131
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:16,011
- You beckoned.
- Yeah. You'll never believe it.

132
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,052
A maid from our hotel in New York

133
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:20,780
found the flash card with
all our vacation pictures on it.

134
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,383
Hot dog!

135
00:07:23,998 --> 00:07:24,952
"Hot dog"?

136
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,800
It's an expression
of excitement and enthusiasm.

137
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,970
Joe and Frank Hardy and I used to say
"hot dog" all the time

138
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:32,250
while we were waiting for the carhop

139
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,150
to bring us our malteds
at the drive-in.

140
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:35,423
Drive-in?

141
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:37,121
- I hate you.
- You love me.

142
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,672
Yeah, but it's all instinct.

143
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:41,213
Okay, you'll notice
the first couple dozen photos

144
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:43,917
feature your daughter doing
the one-handed self portrait,

145
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:47,052
as her negligent father
showed up three days late.

146
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:49,879
But look. You finally make it.

147
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:52,761
Here we are in front of the "Spamalot".

148
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:57,423
Here we are in front
of the Empire State building.

149
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,232
That's the Chrysler building.

150
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:00,590
No, it isn't.

151
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,191
Veronica, there are
a few things in life

152
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:04,611
to which you will have to defer
to my age and experience,

153
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:08,113
and that, sweet child of mine,
is the Chrysler building.

154
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:11,762
Senility...
that comes with age, too, right?

155
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:14,690
I can't remember.

156
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:18,120
Oh, by the way, how was your first day?

157
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,950
How does it feel
being a college student?

158
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:22,151
Oh, it's exhausting.

159
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,342
I had one whole class today.

160
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:26,640
- Did you make any friends?
- Lord, no.

161
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:28,102
Enemies?

162
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:31,350
Yeah, well, it is a day
that ends in a "y".

163
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:34,710
Hey, you mess with the bull, okay?

164
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:39,600
Look, here you are stuffing cupcakes
in your face at Magnolia Bakery.

165
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:42,031
Say, you remember
I'm gonna be gone a few days,

166
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:44,172
That bail-jumper I've been tracking?

167
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:45,540
I'll hold down the fort.

168
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:49,453
Yeah, I'm afraid I put Backup
in charge while I'm away,

169
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,302
and he's been instructed
to maul your boyfriend

170
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,492
if he's here past midnight.

171
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:53,991
Backup's in charge?

172
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:56,561
What about the bitch he's been seeing?

173
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:04,851
- Hey.
- Hey.

174
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:06,662
You must be my roommate, Stosh?

175
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:08,391
Uh, call me "Piz".

176
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:11,570
But you're... Wallace?

177
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:14,002
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.

178
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:15,223
On my roommate-request form,

179
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:17,772
I specifically said I didn't want
a roommate who was...

180
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:19,860
you know...

181
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:24,250
What?

182
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:26,191
Better-looking than me.
I made it very clear.

183
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:29,911
Sorry, man.
Fairest of them all right here.

184
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:32,162
Took this side. I hope that's cool.

185
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:33,331
Yeah, no sweat.

186
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:35,843
I rarely wear clothes indoors.
I hope that's cool.

187
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:38,031
That's not cool at all.

188
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:41,020
You  got more stuff?

189
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:44,553
Mmh, just a carful of boxes
containing all my worldly possessions.

190
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:46,083
- Want some help?
- Yes!

191
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:47,640
Over here.

192
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:51,441
Yeah, this fine example of american
automotive engineering is mine.

193
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:56,720
Oh, my god.

194
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:58,292
Where's all your stuff?

195
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:02,632
It's all gone. Everything I own.
It was here five minutes ago.

196
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,020
Now it's gone.

197
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:07,180
I know someone.
She'll get your stuff back.

198
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,110
Count on it.

199
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:16,071
This girl, she's our age,
and she's a "detective"?

200
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:18,040
She also a cartoon?

201
00:10:18,196 --> 00:10:20,380
Look, she doesn't carry
a magnifying glass or anything.

202
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,700
Her dad's a P.I. Used to be sheriff.

203
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,171
Phew, she's picked up a few things.

204
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:25,662
Look, I appreciate the thought, man.

205
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:28,280
But I'll just let
the local police handle it.

206
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:29,512
Yeah, good luck with that.

207
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:36,051
Hi, I'm Veronica. Are you Piz?

208
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:37,640
Yes, I'm Piz.

209
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:44,113
Wallace? Are you in there somewhere?

210
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:45,540
Yeah, come in.

211
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,742
And you call yourself college men.

212
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:53,863
Where  are the posters with beer
and half-naked ladies?

213
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:56,203
It's behind the porn
and my shot-glass collection.

214
00:10:56,888 --> 00:11:00,122
So, looks like Piz is just gonna
let the sheriff handle things.

215
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:03,643
Actually, I'd love your help.

216
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:07,851
As to my fee, $500, payable in cash,
cashier's check,

217
00:11:07,857 --> 00:11:10,592
or a pre-agreed-upon exchange
of goods or services.

218
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:11,930
I could give you guitar lessons.

219
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:13,280
Pass.

220
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,510
On the bright side, if I don't get your
stuff back, you owe me nothing.

221
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:19,010
That's  the friend-of-a-friend rate.

222
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,441
Wait. I haven't even decided
if he's cool yet.

223
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:24,422
Act now. Time is running out
on this special offer.

224
00:11:26,715 --> 00:11:28,323
So, I pulled into the parking lot,

225
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:32,131
and there was this...
heavyset girl with a clipboard.

226
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:34,230
She had a Hearst sweatshirt and cap on.

227
00:11:34,316 --> 00:11:36,723
She checked my name off a list,
told me which dorm was mine,

228
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,913
And said she'd keep an eye on my stuff
while I went and found my room.

229
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:41,543
This girl, she look like a student?

230
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:43,483
Yeah, I guess.

231
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,991
Said she was part of
the Hearst welcome-wagon committee.

232
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:50,690
Wallace said you lost your clothes,
your computer, a guitar...

233
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:52,143
No, not just a guitar.

234
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,972
It was a 1967 gretsch astrojet red-top.

235
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:57,482
It's like the holy grail of guitars.

236
00:11:57,487 --> 00:12:00,040
Okay, I spent two summers mowing lawns
to earn enough to buy it.

237
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:01,700
This is it.

238
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:04,950
They stole your stuff
and covered your car with dirt?

239
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:07,040
You're not welcome here.

240
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,843
Doesn't look like
they jimmied their way in.

241
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:10,960
It wasn't locked.

242
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:12,822
College campus.

243
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:14,623
All your worldly possessions.

244
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,282
Where are you from, Brigadoon?

245
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:18,502
Portland, or, well,
just outside of Portland...

246
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:20,982
some suburb called Beaverton,
real salt-of-the-earth people.

247
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:23,022
Minivan in every driveway,
chicken in every pot.

248
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:24,730
Where they never ask
rhetorical questions.

249
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:28,381
The welcome-wagon girl
said she'd watch my car.

250
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,632
This is how you know you've gone
from high school to college...

251
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:32,472
The graffiti goes highbrow.

252
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,792
"Wash me" was so 2005.

253
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:37,441
Come on, Beaverton.
Let's go talk to your R.A.

254
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:43,911
All your stuff?

255
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:46,830
Frak. That blows.

256
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:49,263
Qu'est-ce que c'est? "Frak"?

257
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:52,041
No "Battlestar Galactica" fans
in the mix, I see?

258
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,103
"Frak" is the profanity of the future.

259
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:56,513
I'm trying not to swear.

260
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,593
That's very enlightened of you, moe.

261
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:02,080
So, what the frak is with this Hearst
welcome-wagon committee?

262
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,121
Well, first off, there's no such thing,

263
00:13:04,806 --> 00:13:07,073
So there's that. It doesn't exist.

264
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,082
Oolong, anyone?

265
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:14,513
Gonna miss me, Howard?

266
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:17,792
Not for long. We'll keep the lights on.

267
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:22,502
Ahh.

268
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:32,401
You my ride?

269
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:34,572
Get in. We need to move.

270
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:49,751
We're here to ask one question...

271
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:51,811
to the students of this university,

272
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,232
to the faculty of this university,

273
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:56,792
and to the dean of this university.

274
00:13:57,257 --> 00:13:59,440
How many women like me
have to be raped,

275
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:02,183
Have to end up like this,
their heads shaved,

276
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:05,253
before this administration
listens to our demands?

277
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:09,010
Two wasn't enough? Three wasn't enough?

278
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:13,580
They say they're taking steps.
Awesome. The dorm wings are same-sex.

279
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:14,700
Is that enough?

280
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,681
<i>No! No! No! No!</i>

281
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:17,990
We demand more.

282
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:20,052
Mandatory sensitivity training,

283
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:23,651
an official university
sexual-conduct code...

284
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:27,593
more security personnel, more outdoor
lighting, twice the sconces,

285
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:29,571
And most of all, dean O'Dell,

286
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:32,850
Shut down the fraternity houses!

287
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:42,013
Women.
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.

288
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:45,030
Why can't they just look pretty
And get their M.R.S. degrees?

289
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:47,903
How's tricks, kid?

290
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,282
Shrink asked if a lifetime
without a libido is such a bad thing.

291
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,901
I think she's given up on me.

292
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:55,232
You just need more time.

293
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:56,613
Irony of all ironies...

294
00:14:56,617 --> 00:14:58,621
Frozen-from-the-waist-down's
new roommate?

295
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,401
She's a one-woman red-light district.

296
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:01,513
Really?

297
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:04,421
Every night since orientation,
she's been with some new dude.

298
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:06,242
The phone rings every 10 minutes.

299
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:09,912
If college is a boy buffet,
she's got two full plates

300
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:12,642
and a purse full of boys
wrapped in napkins.

301
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:14,423
Yet the void won't fill.

302
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:17,781
<i>[Wreckx-N-Effect - "Rump Shaker"]
All I want to do is zoom-A
zoom zoom zoom in a boom boom</i>

303
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:18,813
<i>Just shake your rump</i>

304
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:22,343
<i>All I want to do is zoom-A
zoom zoom zoom in a boom boom</i>

305
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:23,822
<i>Just shake your rump</i>

306
00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:33,621
It's like we never left Neptune High.

307
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:44,163
You won't be needing this.

308
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:47,073
Ugh! Oh, god. Ugh.

309
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:50,863
It's exactly like
we never left Neptune High.

310
00:15:51,386 --> 00:15:52,700
Oh.

311
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,351
What you did for my Kendall...

312
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:09,323
You saved her life.
That's a tough lady to make disappear.

313
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:11,152
Tends to stand out.

314
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:14,043
All I did was get her out of town.

315
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:17,793
It was more than that...
New passport, house, atm card...

316
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,800
All with my little brother
hot on her heels.

317
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:21,053
Not safe yet.

318
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:24,581
Liam's still looking for her and
he'll be looking for you, too, Cormac.

319
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:28,380
He doesn't know I'm out yet.
All that good behavior.

320
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:30,413
Well that's what we got going for us.

321
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,572
As I understand it,
your brother believes

322
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,740
he's entitled to a cut
of Kendall's good fortune.

323
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:38,160
Yeah, Kendall agreed. The quarrel
was over the size of that cut.

324
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:40,020
My little brother got greedy.

325
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:42,283
That's always been
a problem for that kid.

326
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:44,843
That's why I'm gonna
spend the rest of my days

327
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:47,053
lying on some beach
with the woman I love,

328
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:51,593
And Liam will end up shivved
in some state penitentiary.

329
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:57,151
Whoof.

330
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:00,023
You should seriously
consider going pro in that.

331
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:02,051
What, and miss the college experience?

332
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,930
Don't go anywhere.

333
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:10,043
You're gonna get your brains spooned
out whether you like it or not.

334
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:13,882
But first, must have water.

335
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:18,010
Okay, Veronica.

336
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,120
Aren't you the girl
who laughed at those idiots

337
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:23,401
who tried to take their high-school
romances with them to college?

338
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:33,502
- Logan, no!
- Yep?

339
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:37,240
It's your dad.

340
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:39,142
I forwarded our calls.

341
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:40,901
We need to work on communication.

342
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:43,290
Hi, dad.

343
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:47,382
Nope. He's heading home right now,
as a matter of fact.

344
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,062
All right, honey.

345
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:51,372

346
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:53,012

347
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:55,493
and I'll be sure
to call unexpectedly again.

348
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:57,773
Love you, too.

When you got Kendall out of town,

351
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:08,943
she was carrying, what...
millions, right?

352
00:18:10,027 --> 00:18:11,633
I saw it. Didn't count it.

353
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:13,930
Kendall's always been
a good judge of character.

354
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:17,110
She knows who she can trust,
who she can't.

355
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:19,382
A lesser man
might have taken advantage.

356
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:21,293
I was well-compensated.

357
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,920
What'd you spend your fee on?

358
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:26,773
Bought back my daughter's love.

359
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:31,711
It's a cool ride. Graduation gift?

360
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:33,862
My dad stood me up
for my graduation trip.

361
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:36,251
Lucky for me,
he felt really bad about it.

362
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:37,901
Stood you up? That's harsh.

363
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:39,493
He had his reasons.

364
00:18:39,797 --> 00:18:42,490
Well, a Saturn for a Mars.

365
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:46,590
In Neptune. Yeah, the planets
really aligned for this one.

366
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:49,981
Now, move Uranus.
The mercury is rising.

367
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:53,783
Don't feel too bad.
Same outfit got four other victims.

368
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:55,601
At least,
that's how many we've heard about.

369
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,312
All of them in the span of 90 minutes.

370
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:01,180
Yeah, I guess that's comforting.
Somehow.

371
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:03,670
They must have had a truck or a van.

372
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:05,820
You mind giving me a list
of the other victims?

373
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:10,701
I don't know, Veronica.

377
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:23,312
The woman said she was part of
the Hearst welcome-wagon?

378
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:24,101
Yep.

379
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:25,430
Blond,  chubby?

380
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:26,512
Sounds like the one.

381
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:30,300
I've been keeping a journal,

382
00:19:30,307 --> 00:19:33,380
kind-of like a podcast/spoken-word
thing on my ipod,

383
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:37,040
And now some stranger,
some thief has it.

384
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,561
What if they're listening to it?

385
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,803
All the others who got ripped off
were freshmen.

386
00:19:40,897 --> 00:19:41,961
You're a junior?

387
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:44,652
Yeah. What, are you saying I'm dumb?

388
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:45,640
No.

389
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:48,170
It's just... You didn't know
there was no such thing

390
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:49,621
as the Hearst welcome-wagon?

391
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:51,260
I just remembered something...

392
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,822
I don't know who you are,
or why I'm talking to you.

395
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:17,011
Oh my god,
are you one of Mac's friends?

396
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:20,381
Well, come on in, sister!
Mac's friends are my friends.

397
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:22,843
- I'm Parker.
- Veronica.

398
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:27,160
So, I just love Mac. Like, love her.

399
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:30,543
Like I wish she was a bichon frise
I could carry in my purse.

400
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:32,013
I mean, how great is she?

401
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:33,581
She's pretty great.

402
00:20:33,888 --> 00:20:38,022
I was weirdly disappointed
because I had this idea

403
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:40,790
that I'd get this, like,
gangster-street chick

404
00:20:40,797 --> 00:20:43,383
Or some death-metal girl,

405
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:45,810

00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:50,481

instant sisterhood.

00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:58,643
Mac's watching "Top Model"
with you, huh?

411
00:20:58,925 --> 00:20:59,893
Mm-hmm.

412
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:03,403
Oh, yours or Mac's?

413
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:07,350

414
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,252
He should really love me,
don't you think?

415
00:21:09,356 --> 00:21:11,342
Depends... Have you had your shots?

416
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:13,083
Look at his eyes.

417
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:17,153
He's just so soulful
and like troubled and deep.

418
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:20,043
You just know he'd kick
ass in the backseat.

Of course there was.

487
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:31,671

I thought she was a heifer at first.

491
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:39,222
When she hopped in,
she pulled off her sweatshirt.

492

She had a slammin' bod.

00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:17,643
and the seller is just off campus.

519
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:31,562
- You here about the guitar?
- That's us.

520
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:36,681
I wasn't really looking for a guitar,

521
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:39,833
but I went to the flea market
yesterday, and I found this.

522
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:43,611
Girl was selling it for $500.
She had no idea what she had.

523
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:45,881
You won't find one of these
for under 5 grand.

524
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:48,742
But I'd be willing
to let it go for $4,000.

525
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:51,671
That's it. That's my stolen guitar.

526
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:54,411
- What?
- Go ahead, look in the pick tray.

527
00:26:54,806 --> 00:26:56,883
There'll be two milimeter picks
from Guitar Town in Portland.

528
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,531
Okay, yeah, so?

529
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:07,452
This girl who sold you the guitar,
can you describe her?

530
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:09,793
Blond, thin, pretty smokin' bod.

531
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:16,803
Donald Fagan, the current possessor
of Piz's guitar,

532
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:20,003
offered to sell it back to Piz
for the $500 he paid for it.

533
00:27:20,215 --> 00:27:22,970
A better plan I think,
is to make the thief pay for it.

534
00:27:26,465 --> 00:27:27,300
Smile.

535
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:29,341
Thanks.

536
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:30,981
Hey, wait a minute.

537
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,160
You guys are pathetic.

538
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:51,553
It's a white man's sport.

539
00:27:51,695 --> 00:27:53,560
Right, 'cause I was talking
about the hacky sack.

540
00:27:55,076 --> 00:27:57,751
Piz, is this the welcome-wagon girl?

541
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:02,423
Uh, hard to say. Maybe.

542
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:03,940
Add a few extra pounds.

543
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,440
Yeah, I'm trying to.

544
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:08,820
I don't think it's her.

545
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:14,992
It's not often
you get to see bikini babes

546
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:16,622
in their natural habitat.

547
00:28:17,297 --> 00:28:20,203
Such gentle yet elusive creatures.

548
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:25,360
Okay, you two have fun being gross.

549
00:28:25,367 --> 00:28:28,462
I'll just continue trying to find
your stuff on my own...

550
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:30,190
with no help.

551
00:28:30,955 --> 00:28:32,951
That's why you make the big money.

552
00:28:39,505 --> 00:28:40,490
No signal.

553
00:28:41,627 --> 00:28:43,410
And not one car for 10 minutes.

554
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:46,952
Highway turns back in a few miles.

555
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:49,982
Looks like if we just walk due east,

556
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:52,271
we'd see the town of granger
in three or four miles.

557
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,092
I don't think we want to do that.

558
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:56,261
You spent much time
in the desert, Keith?

559
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,453
No, can't say that I have.

560
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:03,422
First time I got busted,
judge gave me the option...

561
00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:05,343
two years in the army
or two years in huntsville.

562
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:07,072
I chose the army.

563
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:08,813
We did our training in west Texas

564
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:11,050
before they sent me
to Iraq for Desert Storm.

565
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:15,702
Between here and granger,
you got rattlesnakes,

566
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:18,380
coyote traps, scorpions,

567
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:20,942
hippies doing mushrooms,
all kinds of bad stuff.

568
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:24,131
You know, let's...
Let's just wait it out.

569
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:25,993
Someone will help us.

570
00:29:26,638 --> 00:29:30,402
I bided my time for five years.
What's a few more hours?

571
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:35,362
Is it her?

572
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:37,081
I'm 90% sure that's her.

573
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,092
But... look, you know what,
make it 80%.

574
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:41,270
80% sure.

575
00:29:44,138 --> 00:29:46,571
Hey, are you in
Landry's profiling class?

576
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:50,000
Last year. Man's tough.

577
00:29:50,237 --> 00:29:51,873
I have him for intro to criminology.

578
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:54,811
Did you do the mentoring thing?
Cause I'm thinking about it.

579
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:57,193
Best thing as an undergrad,
working with those kids.

580
00:29:57,346 --> 00:29:59,541
You can read about
street crime in a textbook,

581
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,550
but mentoring takes everything
out of the theoretical, really grounds.

582
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:03,663
You should sign up.

583
00:30:04,665 --> 00:30:07,020
Oh, my god.
You can settle a debate for me.

584
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:10,200
Is this on the Empire State building

585
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,491
or the Chrysler building?

586
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:14,271
That's actually
the Space Needle in Seattle.

587
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:18,012
I have to remember not to debate my dad
when it comes to architecture.

588
00:30:19,238 --> 00:30:20,240
Can I have a glass of water?

589
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:21,321
Sure.

590
00:30:23,766 --> 00:30:26,290
So, by the time you finish
your reading this weekend,

591
00:30:26,296 --> 00:30:28,692
you should be able to discuss
crime and social control

592
00:30:28,698 --> 00:30:31,610
in relation to biological
and psychological positivism.

593
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:33,461
See you tuesday.

594
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:42,201
Excuse me.

595
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:45,003
I was interested
in the mentoring program.

596
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:46,440
You're the guy to talk to, right?

597
00:30:48,108 --> 00:30:49,420
You can take your pick.

598
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:51,432
All of them have juvenile records.

599
00:30:51,438 --> 00:30:54,541
Most of the girls, it's shoplifting,
fighting, chronic truancy.

600
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:57,381
Wait, just because I'm a girl
means I have to mentor a girl?

601
00:30:57,806 --> 00:30:58,502
Yes.

602
00:30:58,777 --> 00:31:01,293
That's in case they get
their period or something, right?

603
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:03,252
You Tim?

604
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:04,232
Who are you?

605
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,240
Dr. Landry needs you back
in the lecture hall.

606
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,530
I'll wait.

607
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:35,042
Tow truck's here.

608
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:40,910
Wallace says you're
in his sociology class.

609
00:31:41,077 --> 00:31:42,991
Really? I haven't seen him.

610
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:45,821
Maybe because
you haven't shown up for class.

611
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,431
Well, that's certainly one possibility.

612
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:54,311
Here. A bonus birthday gift.

613
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:57,061
You got me a bow? A bow?!

614
00:31:57,497 --> 00:31:58,521
How did you guess?!

615
00:31:58,747 --> 00:32:00,081
Open it, smarty-pants.

616
00:32:05,248 --> 00:32:06,102
Your room key?

617
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:09,703
What if I drop in unexpectedly?

618
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:11,482
The other girls will have to...

619
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:14,700
I bet you know there's no one else.
I only want you.

620
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:20,623
You ought to know that by now.

621
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:24,492
What then, no quip?

622
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:28,411
Look.

623
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:32,142
It's your B.F.F., the town drunk.

624
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:35,581
Hi, my name's Dick. What's yours?

625
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,312
Deedee.

626
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,042
How long have we known
each other, Deedee?

627
00:32:40,806 --> 00:32:42,650
Eight seconds.

628
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,381
So, where's this going, Deedee?

629
00:32:45,818 --> 00:32:47,003
Is this thing we feel real?

630
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:49,191
Or are we just in it
for the torso butter?

631
00:32:50,856 --> 00:32:53,352
Truth is, I've been kicked out
of on-campus housing

632
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:57,003
and I know, timing's a little sooner
than we hoped for,

633
00:32:57,046 --> 00:32:59,582
but... what do you say
we move in together,

634
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:01,122
make our own love nest?

635
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,772
You should really walk away.

636
00:33:04,127 --> 00:33:05,611
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

637
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:08,061
I'll admit, the kid looks good
walking away.

638
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,571
It's all me, too.

639
00:33:09,658 --> 00:33:11,962
Ass like Marky Mark
and the entire funky bunch.

640
00:33:14,148 --> 00:33:15,092
Your bag?

641
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:34,370
What, do you want a hug or something?

642
00:33:38,357 --> 00:33:40,341
Does that sort of thing work
with college girls?

643
00:33:40,837 --> 00:33:43,261
'Cause I'll tell you up front,
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

644
00:33:43,637 --> 00:33:45,033
I'm gonna try to talk to him.

645
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,393
Nice shirt.

646
00:33:54,428 --> 00:33:56,213
- You wanted me to meet you here?
- Yeah.

647
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:03,543
- Is this the welcome-wagon girl?
- Yeah it's her.

648
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,821
The girl in the photo
is the welcome-wagon girl.

649
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:12,381
The guy is the ringleader.

650
00:34:12,498 --> 00:34:13,641
And you're sure that's her?

651
00:34:13,796 --> 00:34:14,632
That's her.

652
00:34:14,826 --> 00:34:16,323
His name is Donald Fagan,

653
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:19,693
and these three charming lads
are the kids he mentors...

654
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:21,741
Thieves, all of them.

655
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:28,513
Okay, so why would those kids
at the club talk to us

656
00:34:28,587 --> 00:34:29,862
if they knew they'd stolen my stuff?

657
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:32,793
So they could steer us
in the wrong direction?

658
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:35,420
Then they just repeated
the story to their mentor

659
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:36,791
so the stories would match.

660
00:34:37,788 --> 00:34:39,701
So you do realize there's not a lot
of college freshmen girls

661
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:43,251
who do this sort of thing...
You know, solve crimes.

662
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:44,280
There aren't?

663
00:34:44,288 --> 00:34:45,403
So, why do you do it?

664
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:50,270
- Cold, hard cash?
- Seriously.

665
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,151
Uh...

666
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:55,942
Wallace told me about your friend...
who was murdered.

667
00:34:58,905 --> 00:35:00,912
Because I'm good at it, maybe?
I don't know.

668
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:04,303
Wallace should stick
to analyzing himself.

669
00:35:07,327 --> 00:35:09,193
This is not right.
This is absolutely not right.

670
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:12,081
You want to know why I do it?

671
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:14,551
Here it comes. This is the good part.

672
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:16,430
And take my things from me and then...

673
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:23,090
I might actually get my stuff back.

674
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:24,943
I might actually get paid.

675
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:33,020
Boom goes the dynamite.

676
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:34,371
Heh.

677
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,420
So, is that guy from last night
your boyfriend?

678
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:54,332
There she is.

679
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:57,943
You ever have a woman
who loved you so much

680
00:35:58,026 --> 00:35:59,241
she'd do time for you?

681
00:36:02,987 --> 00:36:04,072
Baby!

682
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:06,000
Whoo!

683
00:36:08,276 --> 00:36:09,320
Whoa!

684
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:14,022
I figured out the knocking thing.

685
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,541
You could have waited in your room.

686
00:36:16,155 --> 00:36:17,752
Parker's in there with some guy.

687
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,700
Well, let's head out.

688
00:36:19,856 --> 00:36:21,701
The midnight movie waits for no man.

689
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:24,402
Our tickets are in there
stuck in the mirror...

690
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:26,582
above her suggestion box and tip jar.

691
00:36:27,906 --> 00:36:29,221
Well, frak.

692
00:36:30,476 --> 00:36:31,771
Give me your keys.

693
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:46,632
<i>You're listening to Clamp Flush
on KR FM, Hearst College radio.</i>

694
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,663
Don't mind me.

695
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:54,292
That's excellent cake, Kendall.

696
00:36:54,397 --> 00:36:56,523
Well, I'll tell Sara Lee you approve.

697
00:36:57,238 --> 00:36:59,600
We decided where
we're going to run off to, Keith.

698
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:00,531
Don't want to know.

699
00:37:00,538 --> 00:37:03,071
It's got sand and water.

700
00:37:03,116 --> 00:37:04,102
Stop.

701
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:08,520
But that reminds me, I've got
Cormac's travel documents in the car.

702
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:11,260
I'll just grab them and get out of
here, give you kids some private time.

703
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:14,362
Hurry, Keith. We might not be able
to contain ourselves.

704
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:44,952
Oh, no, Vinnie. Please tell me
you're not working for Liam.

705
00:38:03,837 --> 00:38:04,733
Kendall!

706
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:22,603
Awfully cold night, Keith.

707
00:38:29,035 --> 00:38:31,513
I'll come and pick up
your carcass in the morning.

708
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:36,320
Guess Kendall wasn't that great
a judge of character after all.

709
00:39:11,997 --> 00:39:13,350
I don't have anywhere else to go.

710
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:18,760
Hey, it's all right. You can stay here.

711
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,561
I messed up bad.

712
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:35,543
It's gonna be okay.

713
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,663
Come here.

714
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:47,991
You worked in a coffee shop.

715
00:39:47,996 --> 00:39:50,681
How can you not know an Irish coffee
has whiskey in it?

716
00:39:51,576 --> 00:39:52,523
At java the hut,

717
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:56,671
It meant a latte with a little shot
of Irish cream syrup.

718
00:39:56,935 --> 00:39:58,822
That explains
the first one you ordered.

719
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:00,843
They were magically delicious.

720
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:03,312
And they served me. Boo-yah!

721
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:07,390
Yeah. "Boo-yah"? You probably
shouldn't drive home.

722
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:08,441
I'm fine.

723
00:40:10,048 --> 00:40:11,263
Okay, maybe not.

724
00:40:14,008 --> 00:40:16,661
And we're dude-free. Couch is yours.
