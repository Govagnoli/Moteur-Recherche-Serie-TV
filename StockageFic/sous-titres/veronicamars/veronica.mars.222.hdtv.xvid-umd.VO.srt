1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,495
<i>Previously on "Veronica Mars"...</i>

2
00:00:01,496 --> 00:00:03,741
It just went straight off the cliff.
they're all dead.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:04,689
Woody's a pervert.

4
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:05,535
He's sick.

5
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:06,956
What he did to us is wrong.

6
00:00:06,957 --> 00:00:08,603
Two of the boys who died
in the bus crash

7
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:10,188
were on Woody's little-league team.

8
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:13,094
Most adults keep their hands
off of other people's children.

9
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:17,072
You'll be the guy who let a child
molester and a murderer get away!

10
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:18,143
Woody's gone.

11
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,430
He took his private plane.

12
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,593
My grandmother asked me
for one thing my whole life.

13
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,176
She wants to see me walk
across that stage at graduation.

14
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:27,559
It's Weevil! I'm telling you!
He set me up!

15
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,850
I got something on you.

16
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:31,858
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

17
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:32,889
I've got what?

18
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:33,492
Chlamydia.

19
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:35,200
Jackie left for France this morning.

20
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,645
I thought our story was epic.

21
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:38,316
I have to go.

22
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:39,825
I don't want to lose you from my life.

23
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:41,182
My stepmom -
she's a gold digger.

24
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:43,068
You're cash-strapped.
I can help.

25
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:45,558
But quid pro quo,
mrs. C.,

26
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:47,626
Quid pro quo.

27
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:49,885
We find the defendant not guilty.

28
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:55,570
See, this is how it is.

29
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,244
The innocent suffer,
the guilty go free,

30
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,042
and truth and fiction are
pretty much interchangeable.

31
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,537
Mr. Echolls, how do you feel
about your acquittal?

32
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:10,912
I feel... relieved to have my name
cleared of this... horrible crime.

33
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,852
There is neither a Santa Claus
nor an easter bunny,

34
00:01:16,853 --> 00:01:19,072
and there are no angels
watching over us.

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,515
Things just happen for no reason.

36
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,073
And nothing makes any sense.

37
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:29,942
We will not do this.

38
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:31,937
You can't let this stick in your head.

39
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:34,063
However wrong it turned out,
it's done.

40
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,393
We're people with lives,
and we will not obsess.

41
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:37,357
We move on.

42
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:40,403
Aaron Echolls will get
his justice in his own way.

43
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:42,145
You really believe that?

44
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:45,583
Yes. Now, come on.
We're running a business here.

45
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,521
Look alive.

46
00:02:06,674 --> 00:02:08,135
What happened to moving on?

47
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,455
Posted today.

48
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:15,105
Meg's dad offering 20 grand
for the capture of Woody Goodman.

49
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,235
Well, I'm sure someone will get him.

50
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:20,360
Didn't you say something about
"we have a business to run"?

51
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:23,230
Shouldn't you be out hunting him down
like the dog he is?

52
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:25,893
I also said something about us
being people with lives.

53
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:28,743
See, I have this kid who's gonna
graduate from high school.

54
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:30,018
I don't want to miss it.

55
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:32,297
This is Woody Goodman.

56
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:34,392
He blew up a bus and molested children.

57
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,077
Guess I'm just sentimental.

58
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:39,808
When the management
gives you free cake,

59
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:41,071
you're supposed to eat it.

60
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:45,421
I thought you were prepared
for Jackie going.

61
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:47,712
Never figured
it would go down like this.

62
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:49,568
She left you a note?

63
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:52,456
<i>"But I was afraid if I saw you,</i>

64
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:53,869
<i>I wouldn't be able to get on the plane.</i>

65
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:55,455
<i>I'll always... "</i>

66
00:02:55,894 --> 00:02:58,303
well, then it's just
a bunch of private stuff.

67
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,209
What can you do about that?

68
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,183
You could use a method time-tested
by women throughout the ages -

69
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:07,237
Gorge on cake.

70
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:10,727
I'll be right back.

71
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,005
Johnny Ludden.
Thanks for dropping by.

72
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:18,663
Sure. Free gelato
just to show up - why not?

73
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:22,088
Is this you on Woody's old team?

74
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:23,345
Yeah.

75
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:26,107
So, do I have to eat here,
or can I get the gelato in the carton?

76
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,815
Just a few more questions first.

77
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,035
Hey, honey.

78
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,254
Hey, dad.

79
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,826
Hello?

80
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,252
You've got a call...

81
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:46,039
from Vinnie Van Lowe.

82
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:47,817
So...

83
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:50,043
of course you know about the bounty
on this Goodman guy.

84
00:03:50,494 --> 00:03:51,881
I'm aware of it, yes.

85
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,747
20 g's?

86
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:55,024
That's big-boy money.

87
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:57,121
Gonna be a lot of top guys
out there for it.

88
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:58,637
I had a thought.

89
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:02,154
We team up.
Mars and Van Lowe.

90
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,378
Pool our resources.

91
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:04,871
Split the cash.

92
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:07,576
Sheriff got you on video
breaking into Woody's house.

93
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,163
But "Johnny Law" don't know what I got.

94
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:17,748
What do you got?

95
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:19,025
All his records -

96
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,913
tax, medical, corporate -
the whole enchilada.

97
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:24,912
We nail him, we split 60-40.
I'm the 60, by the way.

98
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:26,858
50-50...

99
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:28,860
if the stuff you got pans out,

100
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:31,159
and no action until
after my daughter's graduation.

101
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,662
I'm in jail.
I deserve 60.

102
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,675
I risk my life to bring
a fugitive to justice,

103
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:40,760
and you're giving me
world's tiniest violin.

104
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,581
Guess I'm just heartless.

105
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,548
He's got, like, 10 credit cards
in different corporate names.

106
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:47,445
We're gonna have
to put a trace on all of them.

107
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:50,869
And he has a pilot's license.
Seasonal allergies, bad arches.

108
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:52,723
And he had the clap.

109
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:55,068
Treated twice for chlamydia.

110
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:57,330
Didn't see that
in his campaign materials.

111
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:03,061
- Bingo. Heart arrhythmia.
- So that's our strategy -

112
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,624
just wait for him to drop dead?

113
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:06,627
He has to take a pill every day.

114
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,228
Is there any way you can find out
Gia Goodman's cellphone access code?

115
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:11,811
Gia's cell?

116
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:14,262
Woody's lawyer is also
an old college buddy of his.

117
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:15,678
If he'd call anyone, it would be him.

118
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:18,148
If we had Gia's code
and could forward her calls...

119
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:21,626
I guarantee you she hasn't changed it
from the factory default.

120
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,882
Then I have a plan.

121
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,499
Up and at 'em, honey.

122
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:39,876
Can you believe
the big day is finally here?

123
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,471
There she is.

124
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,172
The eyes are bright,
the tail is bushy.

125
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:56,908
Pancakes, mom?

126
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,864
Are you trying to give me
an early jump on the freshman 15?

127
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,242
Eat up.

128
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,740
You think the dining halls at San Diego
state are gonna feed you like this?

129
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:08,637
Mmm... I love pancakes!

130
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:15,169
What, a comment?

131
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,685
"Get a room"?
You just gagged in your mouth?

132
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,820
No.
It's nice.

133
00:06:24,678 --> 00:06:26,490
- Are you okay?
- All right.

134
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:29,730
So, how's the sheriff business?

135
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,063
Pretty sweet.

136
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:34,194
We got Otis
sleeping it off in cell one,

137
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:37,439
and Lamb has to wear the clete
the crime-fighting canine costume

138
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:39,629
to all the elementary schools
this week.

139
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:42,221
Listen, after the ceremony,

140
00:06:42,304 --> 00:06:45,149
don't run off with that boy
because we want to take pictures...

141
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:47,172
and lots of them.

142
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,730
And I can't wait.

143
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:50,980
Okay, then you should practice.

144
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,220
Say "cheese. "

145
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,643
Cheese!

146
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:01,112
They gave me the wrong cap and gown.

147
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:02,669
Yeah, how exactly can you tell?

148
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,670
It's got someone else's name on it?

149
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,670
Guess who's going commando?

150
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:08,358
Must we?

151
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,169
Does anyone know Wallace Fennel?

152
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,125
I do.
He was in my P.E. Class.

153
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:13,270
Awesome baller.

154
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:14,954
I think he works at sac-n-pac.

155
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,074
Awesome baller -

156
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:18,737
that doesn't really help me.
Can you point him out?

157
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:20,094
You didn't hear what happened to him?

158
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:22,668
Sac-n-pac got held up
when he was working.

159
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:24,855
The robber forced him
into the walk-in cooler.

160
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,020
He got frostbite.

161
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:28,917
Yeah. Dude lost three fingers.

162
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:31,002
Oh, my god, that's awful.

163
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:35,157
Sweetie, I love you,

164
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:37,524
but you have to be
the most gullible girl I've ever met.

165
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,410
I'm trusting. Sue me.

166
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:41,393
There he is.
That's Wallace.

167
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,346
Wallace?

168
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:48,062
Wallace.

169
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:49,388
- Wallace?
- Yeah?

170
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:51,588
I think I have your cap and gown.

171
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:54,984
- That must make you Veronica Mars?
- It does.

172
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,189
So, looking forward to
getting out of here?

173
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:01,122
I guess.

174
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,402
I don't know.

175
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:04,400
High school was a blast,

176
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:05,720
right?

177
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:07,865
Oh, you're one of those.

178
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:09,635
What's that supposed to mean?

179
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:11,275
Nothing.

180
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:12,829
Have a good life.

181
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:14,510
I'm sure you will.

182
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:22,290
Lilly?

183
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:24,327
Hey!

184
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,370
Tell me about everything.

185
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:28,448
Tell me about this new guy.

186
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:29,568
Tell me about Vassar.

187
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:30,815
The guy is gone.

188
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:34,020
We had a little disagreement
over fooling around with his ex.

189
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:35,806
- That bastard.
- Oh, no, no,

190
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,379
it was, um, it was me.

191
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,675
I kind of fooled around with his ex.

192
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,377
I mean, you'd think that guys
would dig that, right?

193
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:47,622
What? It's college.
It's expected.

194
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:49,446
You'll see.

195
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:51,690
God, it's so good to see you.

196
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:52,957
What is this?

197
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,341
A Lilly Kane memorial fountain?

198
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,504
Uh...

199
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,856
Do you smell bacon?

200
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:03,926
Graduation day!
Get up!

201
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:05,082
Lots to do!

202
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:06,648
I'm making breakfast.

214
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,252
Get ready.

215
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:52,302
Morning, mr. Lee.

216
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:54,138
Gia Goodman asked you
to call her on her cell.

217
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:55,549
It's all right.
I got the number.

218
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,221
Gia? Bill Lee.

219
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,475
Hey, so, I'm trying to get
a message to dad,

220
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,874
but he didn't leave us a forwarding...

221
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,231
It's just, we got a call
from dr. Hoover,

222
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:20,179
and I guess his heart pills
are 50 milli-something this time,

223
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:22,104
instead of 100,
so he has to take two.

224
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:23,541
It's really important.

225
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:24,713
Got it, Gia.

226
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,899
I'll see what I can do.
Take care, honey.

227
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:34,163
Quail Creek lodge?

228
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:37,160
I need to leave a message
for mr. Underhill, please.

229
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,527
Bingo.

230
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:52,809
After you talked to Woody's lawyer,

231
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,622
he immediately called a number
for Quail Creek lodge,

232
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,765
20 miles outside of Reno.

233
00:10:57,818 --> 00:10:59,947
It's a stocked hunting ranch.

234
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,857
Rich businessmen
shooting captive birds.

235
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,311
You think Woody's there?

236
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:05,997
I checked google earth.

237
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,275
Satellite photos show a landing strip

238
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:10,221
and a building big enough
to hold a plane.

239
00:11:10,843 --> 00:11:13,543
I'm on a flight to Reno leaving
an hour after graduation.

240
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:14,692
I don't know if I like the idea

241
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:17,476
of you running around a place full of
armed, drunk businessmen.

242
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:20,050
That's why I rarely go to Texas.

243
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:21,716
I'll be fine.

244
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,656
I'll call as soon as I have him.

245
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,278
John Enbram.

246
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:51,916
Wallace Fennel.

247
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,028
- Guess what?
- What?

248
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:07,895
Beaver got us a room
at the Neptune Grand for tonight.

249
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,529
Ooh-la-la!

250
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:10,924
Any advice?

251
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,408
Close your eyes and think of England?

252
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:15,312
Just relax.

253
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:34,011
- Phil Climmer.
- Yo Climmer!

254
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,308
Eli Navarro,

255
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:38,156
you're under arrest in connection
with the murder of Eduardo Orozco.

256
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,190
No, man.

257
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:42,255
You have the right to remain silent.
Not here.

258
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:44,666
- Anything you say...
- just give me 10 minutes, okay?

259
00:12:44,705 --> 00:12:45,893
You have the right to an attorney.

260
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:48,255
- If you cannot afford an -
- just let me graduate!

261
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:50,111
...One may be appointed for you.

262
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:51,469
Do you understand these rights?

263
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,197
Please don't do this, man.

264
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:58,855
Cuff him.
Let's get him out of here.

265
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:00,432
Hey, hey.

266
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:02,562
You want to do this the hard way, huh?

267
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,362
Let's go.

268
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,132
Cindy Mackenzie.

269
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:26,171
Scott Markham.

270
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,954
Veronica Mars.

271
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:34,401
Yes! Yes!

272
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:52,728
You were expecting some other reaction?

273
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:54,211
I -

274
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:57,529
I can't decide if my life is gonna be
easier or more difficult with you gone.

275
00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:00,503
Anything I should know in case
I get another one like you someday?

276
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,445
Don't keep all your passwords taped
on the bottom of your stapler.

277
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:07,094
And stay cool, mr. C.

278
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,000
For you on this momentous occasion.

279
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:22,404
A pony?!

280
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:27,707
New York?

281
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,842
We leave Tuesday.

282
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:32,345
Broadway? Soho? The Moma?

283
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,236
Yankee stadium, Shea stadium,
Madison Square garden.

284
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:37,694
Oh, thank you so much!

285
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:39,298
This is awesome!

286
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:41,509
Oh! Awesome.

287
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:42,929
Now go catch Woody.

288
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:44,942
I get creeped out just knowing
he's out there somewhere.

289
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:46,488
Alright. You have fun tonight.

290
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:47,677
That's the plan.

291
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,132
Put on your dancing shoes, Mars,

292
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:52,206
'cause tonight
we're gonna upchuck the boogie

293
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,066
to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.

294
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,788
- "Upchuck"?
- You heard me.

295
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:10,172
Veronica,

296
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:11,598
do you know about this?

297
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:14,060
I don't. What's wrong?

298
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:16,679
Wallace left this note for me
on my windshield.

299
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:18,638
He's booked himself a flight to Paris.

300
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,179
He's gonna try to track down Jackie.

301
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:35,458
Mommy! Mommy!

302
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,562
You're 10 minutes late.

303
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:41,770
Cut me some slack, ma.

304
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:43,731
I haven't even been back two days.

305
00:15:44,065 --> 00:15:44,862
Jackie,

306
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:46,333
you ain't in Neptune no more.

307
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:48,497
Terrence Cook fantasy camp is over.

308
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:49,898
This is real life.

309
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:54,323
Brooklyn Dan's?

310
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:57,349
Yeah. Hold on.

311
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,692
It's for you.

312
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,353
Hello?

313
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:08,989
What, no "Bonjour"?

314
00:16:09,488 --> 00:16:10,479
Veronica?

315
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,914
How did you know?

316
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:17,045
Well, first, 3.1 G.P.A.
doesn't scream the Sorbonne.

317
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,051
And the Java job -

318
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,268
you're a mighty
good service-industry worker

319
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:23,539
for the daughter of a model
living on the upper west side

320
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:24,858
who never held a job before.

321
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:26,473
I've known for a while.

322
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,306
Look, I might have lied about my life,

323
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,678
but I swear I never lied
to Wallace about how I felt.

324
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:32,767
Whatever you told him,

325
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,182
it really did the trick because
he just got on a plane to Paris.

326
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:40,286
But the good news is
he has a 4-hour layover at JFK,

327
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:43,266
so you can go tell him the truth
before he's forced to endure

328
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,206
several ugly days
of rude waiters for nothing.

329
00:16:53,422 --> 00:16:54,554
Hello, Logan.

330
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:58,329
What are you doing here?

331
00:16:58,545 --> 00:17:00,027
Well, I need a place to stay.

332
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:02,504
How are the suites?

333
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,680
Well, probably an improvement
over your previous digs.

334
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:07,803
Might be a little weird,
though.

335
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:09,604
I don't think
any of the other guests killed anyone.

336
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,304
You know...

337
00:17:13,343 --> 00:17:16,426
you should really make more of
an effort to be civil to me now, Logan.

338
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:19,770
Why? Because you beat a murder rap
and suddenly you're my father again?

339
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:21,831
No, Logan.

340
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:25,147
I never stopped being your father,
and I never will.

341
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,025
But I got the purse strings back.

342
00:17:29,394 --> 00:17:31,217
You're my dependent again,
son.

343
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:34,712
- Going down?
- No. Up.

344
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:44,484
<i>Marijuana?</i>

345
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:47,341
<i>Sure got ourselves in a heap
of trouble this time, cousin.</i>

346
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:49,535
<i>You got that right.
Boss is gonna throw the book at us.</i>

347
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,851
<i>Not to mention the federal government.</i>

348
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,185
<i>When we break our probation,</i>

349
00:17:52,229 --> 00:17:53,904
<i>we sure do a bang-up job of it.</i>

350
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:56,935
<i>We ought to be out of prison about
in time to collect social security.</i>

351
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,328
<i>It ain't funny, luke.</i>

352
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,301
<i>We got to get ourselves out of this.</i>

353
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:09,730
Ow!

354
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:18,225
Information?

355
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:22,806
Yeah, can you put me through
to the local sheriff's department?

356
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:23,984
Thanks.

357
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,442
So, you used me.

358
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:35,267
Someone blackmails you,

359
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,373
and you use me to set up
the whole girl-in-the-motel thing.

360
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,984
Incorporation dies,
and your special secrets stay hidden.

361
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:45,192
Keith,
I know how this must look.

362
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:48,228
If you're about to insist this is all
some big misunderstanding, Woody,

363
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:49,226
I kind of think you don't.

364
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,747
I didn't crash the bus.

365
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:52,965
I could never have hurt all those kids.

366
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:53,848
I don't know, Woody.

367
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:58,027
The welfare of children doesn't seem to
have been terribly high on your list.

368
00:18:58,308 --> 00:18:59,307
That's not how it was.

369
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:01,073
It wasn't that way at all.

370
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:03,749
Those boys -
if you knew their fathers,

371
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:05,786
how they ignored them,
mistreated them.

372
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:07,273
They needed someone.

373
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:09,777
I listened to them.
I cared about them.

374
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:11,694
Woody, just stop.

375
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:15,279
Mr. Mars, they're ready.

376
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:23,342
You caught him.

377
00:19:23,544 --> 00:19:25,595
Loading him onto his own plane
as we speak.

378
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:28,361
As soon as the pilot gets here,
we'll be homeward bound.

379
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:30,123
Did he confess to the crash?

380
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:33,148
Unfortunately, he insists
that he didn't do it,

381
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,441
so we're gonna need
a lot more evidence to nail him.

382
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,736
I'm still trying to find
that third kid from the tape.

383
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:41,195
I've got everyone
on the team identified except one guy.

384
00:19:41,365 --> 00:19:42,783
I think I know
where to find him, though.

385
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:44,300
The pilot just got here.

386
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,958
I'll be in late,
so don't wait up.

387
00:19:46,382 --> 00:19:47,544
See you in the morning, honey.

388
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:18,824
Derek Applegate.

389
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:21,609
Who are you,
and where do you live?

390
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,339
Oh, god.

391
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,969
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

392
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,931
It's Mac.
Leave a message.

393
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:53,588
Mac, it's Veronica.

394
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:54,907
You have to get away from Beaver.

395
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:57,033
Do whatever you have to do,
but get away from him.

396
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:58,052
He's dangerous.

397
00:20:58,456 --> 00:20:59,687
Call me when you hear this.

398
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,759
A listing for Hart Hanson?

399
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,105
Chug, chug, chug,

400
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:11,791
chug, chug, chug!

401
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:14,177
Oh!
That's what I'm talking about!

402
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,518
Feels good to be a man
from time to time, does it not?

403
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,635
- Yes.
- Enbom, get over here!

404
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:23,064
All I ask is that you don't follow
that performance with a belch.

405
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,186
Do you want to go check out the room?

406
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:27,830
It's liquid. It's courage.

407
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:29,236
It's liquid courage.

408
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:30,477
Yeah, well, there's, uh,

409
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:31,895
there's nothing up there
that I'm afraid of.

410
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:35,334
Did you hear?

411
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:36,870
Veronica's dad caught the mayor.

412
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:37,899
It's all over the news.

413
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:40,719
They're flying him out tonight
on Woody's plane.

414
00:21:40,748 --> 00:21:42,735
That sleezoid is gonna fry -

415
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:43,819
bzzzz!

416
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:04,244
Hey. Have you seen Beaver and Mac?

417
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:05,355
Yeah,
they were here earlier.

418
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,820
What's wrong?
I think Beaver -

419
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:10,926
- What?
- Where's your brother?

420
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,894
I think he took "Ghost World"
up to his room.

421
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:14,899
They're probably
up there making love...

422
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,833
or playing dungeons and dragons...

423
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:18,901
or both at the same time.

424
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:22,406
They're both, like,
12th-level dorks... just saying...

425
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,303
Don't worry about it.

426
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:31,119
I'm having a good time,
and we've got all night, okay?

427
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:34,843
We're cool here.

428
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,474
I'm just gonna hop in the shower,

429
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,247
and then we can head back down
to the party.

430
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,908
Can you tell me which room
Cassidy Casablancas is in?

431
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:48,108
I'm sorry.
We can't give out that information.

432
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:49,635
I can ring his room,
if you'd like.

433
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:50,745
Sure.

434
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:54,340
I'm sorry.
There's a "do not disturb" on the room.

435
00:23:38,947 --> 00:23:39,858
Damn it.

436
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,309
Hello, Veronica.

437
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:44,075
Well, don't look so surprised.

438
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,622
It's a small town.

439
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,882
Now that I'm no longer in jail,

440
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:50,650
we might just run
into each other from time to time.

441
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:53,659
I'll have to pay better attention
to where I'm going, then.

442
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:55,094
Well, it's a free country.

443
00:23:56,752 --> 00:23:58,942
Those founding fathers
were really onto something.

444
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,386
Freedom - ah! -

445
00:24:01,454 --> 00:24:02,676
It's pretty damn sweet.

446
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:04,969
I like it.

447
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:06,354
So did Lilly.

448
00:24:06,716 --> 00:24:08,163
Bummer you murdered her.

449
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:12,624
You know, I can see why the two
of you were such good friends.

450
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:14,647
You're so much alike.

451
00:24:15,326 --> 00:24:16,989
Not afraid to speak your minds.

452
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:19,237
You know,
that just might be the best part

453
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,114
about the day I smashed her head in
with an ashtray -

454
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:24,735
knowing that, once and for all,

455
00:24:25,473 --> 00:24:27,708
she would finally shut the hell up.

456
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,153
Ah. Well...

457
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:35,989
have a nice night, Veronica.

458
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,065
Mac?

459
00:24:48,677 --> 00:24:49,998
Hey, Veronica!

460
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:56,439
Where's Mac?

461
00:24:56,801 --> 00:24:58,050
A better place.

462
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:02,436
Unfortunately, she never got a chance
to read your message. Now...

463
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:04,208
throw me your bag.

464
00:25:05,942 --> 00:25:07,472
I said throw me your bag!

465
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,109
So, "Beaver's a killer"?

466
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:25,971
That's a pretty serious accusation.

467
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,577
What exactly do you think you know?

468
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:32,021
You played for Woody's little-league
team with Marcos and Peter.

469
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:34,391
He molested all three of you.

470
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,115
They wanted to come forward.

471
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:39,469
A couple of the Sharks
had to know about it.

472
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:40,795
They'll come forward.

473
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,826
Things like this don't stay secret.

474
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,257
Damn right.

475
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:46,581
Yeah, but I mean do you guys really
want people to know about it?

476
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:48,850
He's a pervert. He's sick.

477
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:50,239
And what he did to us is wrong.

478
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:53,878
Look, please don't drag me into this.

479
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:55,112
You're already in it.

480
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:57,028
You'll thank us later.

481
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:00,504
Peter and Marcos were going to spill.

482
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:02,233
That's why they had to die.

483
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:04,320
My guess?

484
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:07,111
You got the explosives
from Curly Moran.

485
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:10,689
I saw you with that sophomore
Hart Hanson last week.

486
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:13,527
Hart says you worked
on his war movies with him,

487
00:26:13,784 --> 00:26:15,761
that you were in charge
of blowing things up.

488
00:26:16,504 --> 00:26:18,151
He said you knew a guy
who taught you how to do it -

489
00:26:18,563 --> 00:26:19,694
your dad's mechanic,

490
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:22,365
former stunt coordinator
Curly Moran, right?

491
00:26:24,573 --> 00:26:25,554
Admit it, man,

492
00:26:25,873 --> 00:26:27,750
you're way happier in the limo
than sitting on the bus,

493
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,905
getting eye daggers
in the back from meg.

494
00:26:29,906 --> 00:26:32,420
I'd have been happier
if you hadn't had that chili dog.

495
00:26:42,863 --> 00:26:45,697
Curly told Weevil that he knew who blew
up the bus.

496
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,098
He figured it out,
didn't he?

497
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:49,188
That's why you needed him gone.

498
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,482
You know Cervando's been bragging
about hustling Liam Fitzpatrick,

499
00:26:53,118 --> 00:26:56,007
so you convinced the P.C.H.Ers
that Curly blew up the bus.

500
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,265
Yo!

501
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:05,151
- Come on, man, let's go!
- Come on, man!

502
00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:10,846
But you have to finish the job.

503
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:19,072
<i>Tell me.</i>

504
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:22,869
<i>Tell it's me by the clamor, now, baby!</i>

505
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:25,878
You wanted to focus any investigation
in a new direction.

506
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,902
You knew I was a key witness
in the Aaron Echolls trial,

507
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,281
so...

508
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:38,060
Convenient, wasn't it?

509
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:40,218
The road hog's cliffside location?

510
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:42,981
Easy to dump the body.

511
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:48,399
You didn't hire me to catch Kendall
cheating on your dad, did you?

512
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,949
You knew what he was up to,

513
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:52,614
and you wanted to punish him
for the way he treated you.

514
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:53,689
You used me to do it.

515
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:56,262
And you were marvelous.

516
00:27:57,131 --> 00:27:58,466
Now let me ask you something.

517
00:27:59,335 --> 00:28:00,978
How is it I got Chlamydia?

518
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:03,225
Woody was treated for it.

519
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,074
I ended up with it.

520
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:07,353
Shelly Pomroy's party, sophomore year.

521
00:28:07,823 --> 00:28:11,149
You said Dick pushed you into a room
with me after I'd been roofied,

522
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:13,849
but you didn't run out
like you said you did, did you?

523
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:15,351
Nope.

524
00:28:15,932 --> 00:28:17,738
You wanted to prove you were a man.

525
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,678
It helped that I was unconscious,
didn't it?

526
00:28:20,973 --> 00:28:23,932
Easy to imagine
whatever it is you needed to imagine.

527
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:27,983
You raped me!

528
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,606
And Dick still thinks I'm a virgin.

529
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,965
See, I know how to keep a secret.

530
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:36,003
That's what this is all about,
isn't it -

531
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:39,602
keeping your secret?
Well, it's over. It's out. I know.

532
00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:42,205
Yeah, but I have a pretty good feeling
that you won't be telling anybody.

533
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:44,165
I already did.

534
00:28:44,615 --> 00:28:46,156
I told my dad.
He knows.

535
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:48,245
That's, uh, that's too bad.

536
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:50,816
He's on Woody's plane with him, right?

537
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:51,740
Right now on his way back?

538
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:53,737
See, because I have
no more use for Woody.

539
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:56,216
You heard about the bomb
in Woody's car, right?

540
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:58,646
Yeah, 'cause there's one on his plane,

541
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:02,905
and all I have to do... is dial.

542
00:29:05,754 --> 00:29:06,586
Want to call your dad,

543
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:09,733
say goodbye before I press send,
go ahead. I'll give you a minute.

544
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,793
Cassidy,
no, you're not serious.

545
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:17,013
56... 55...

546
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:18,991
ticktock.

547
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:27,372
Pick up.

548
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:29,804
Please pick up.

549
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:33,607
Daddy.

550
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:41,805
Well.

551
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:48,048
What do you know?

552
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:11,205
Yeah, sorry about that.

553
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:16,974
I know this might be a bad time
to ask for a favor.

554
00:30:18,004 --> 00:30:22,922
How would you feel now that you've got
nothing left to live for about just

555
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:25,185
rolling yourself off?

556
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:28,663
I really don't want your DNA
all over my shirt.

557
00:30:32,217 --> 00:30:33,367
<i>In a minute, Kalee.</i>

558
00:30:33,575 --> 00:30:34,635
<i>Daddy's on the phone.</i>

559
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:37,350
<i>I'm gonna be in your neighborhood
with my daughter.</i>

560
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:39,119
<i>How about we, um, drop by?</i>

561
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,609
<i>That way our daughters can meet.</i>

562
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:44,304
<i>Uh... your -
well, my place is a mess.</i>

563
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:46,688
I sure like this thing.

564
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,751
Ever wonder what it feels like
to the people you actually taser?

565
00:30:52,135 --> 00:30:53,357
Let's give it a whirl.
What do you say?

566
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,178
You know what I was just thinking?

567
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,837
We're Neptune pirates, right?

568
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:00,658
This is like I'm making you
walk the plank.

569
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:03,508
Except instead of jabbing you
with a sword,

570
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:05,810
I'm sending 300,000 volts through you.

571
00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:07,693
Now jump.

572
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:10,348
Please don't!

573
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:15,060
You couldn't do this the easy way?

574
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:18,034
You know,
Aaron Echolls is staying here.

575
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,720
What do you want to bet
that I can get him convicted

576
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:21,595
for the death of this teenage girl?

577
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:22,574
No!

578
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,005
Logan, move away from him.

579
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:50,814
Veronica, don't.

580
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:53,717
He killed my father!

581
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,793
Give me the gun, Veronica.

582
00:31:58,278 --> 00:31:59,822
He killed everyone on the bus.

583
00:32:00,115 --> 00:32:01,401
He raped me!

584
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:05,863
You are not a killer,
Veronica.

585
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,701
Give me the gun.

586
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,301
You're not a killer,
Veronica.

587
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:16,425
Give me the gun.

588
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,982
Beaver, don't!

589
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:38,246
My name is Cassidy!

590
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,202
Cassidy, don't.

591
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,542
Why not?

592
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:45,920
<i>Layin' across a river</i>

593
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,899
That's what I thought.

594
00:32:48,212 --> 00:32:51,294
<i>See my friends</i>

595
00:32:53,491 --> 00:32:56,388
<i>See my friends</i>

596
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:02,242
<i>Layin' across a river </i>

597
00:33:04,305 --> 00:33:07,509
<i>She is gone</i>

598
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:08,932
Mac.

599
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:11,479
Mac!

600
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:16,410
<i>And now there's no one left</i>

601
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:21,533
<i>except my friends</i>

602
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:26,613
he took my clothes.

603
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,870
He took everything.

604
00:33:32,432 --> 00:33:33,153
Why?

605
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:41,246
<i>She just went</i>

606
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:47,027
Oh... my... god.

607
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,792
Have I told you
how much I love freedom?

608
00:33:59,492 --> 00:34:00,914
I like it, too.

609
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:03,880
And any more "freedoming" tonight,

610
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:06,563
and I'm gonna need a wheelchair.

611
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:08,283
Ahh.

612
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,722
Well, well, well.

613
00:34:42,931 --> 00:34:44,557
Who's that handsome fella?

614
00:35:13,255 --> 00:35:14,126
C.W.?

615
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:15,736
It's a done deal.

616
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,402
Hey, Wallace.

617
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:46,057
What are you doing here?

618
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,226
You heading to Paris?

619
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,920
What a coincidence.
Me too.

620
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,056
I'm not going to Paris.

621
00:35:54,438 --> 00:35:56,462
This is for the philly shuttle.

622
00:35:57,149 --> 00:35:59,522
Cheapest ticket I could get
to bypass security.

623
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:03,365
I need to tell you some things,
Wallace.

624
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:07,701
I never lived on the upper west side.

625
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:10,817
My mom isn't a model.

626
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:13,293
She's a waitress...

627
00:36:13,656 --> 00:36:16,481
who had a one-night stand
with Terrence 18 years ago.

628
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:21,467
I'm just another kid from Brooklyn
who got screwed up on drugs and

629
00:36:21,685 --> 00:36:23,376
booze and all the wrong friends, but...

630
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:24,945
by the time I was a sophomore -

631
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:26,902
your past really doesn't matter to me.

632
00:36:26,903 --> 00:36:29,026
I have a son, Wallace.

633
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:31,583
He's 2.

634
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:34,882
When he was born, my mom
contacted my dad and made a deal.

635
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:38,474
I'd go to California and try to start
over, and she'd raise my baby.

636
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,926
When my dad just dropped me
from his life,

637
00:36:41,052 --> 00:36:43,046
I realized
that I was being a hypocrite.

638
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,287
Here I was, torn up that...

639
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,433
I wasn't the center
of my dad's universe

640
00:36:48,484 --> 00:36:51,291
when my mom was raising my kid
3,000 miles away.

641
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:54,581
I can't be that person,
Wallace.

642
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:57,435
I had to come back.

643
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,361
And I have to stay.

644
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:09,093
And your life is in Neptune,

645
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,177
and you have to go.

646
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:23,948
- You're stinky.
- No you are stinky.

647
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:24,977
No, you're stinky.

648
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:26,403
He means stinky.

649
00:37:26,508 --> 00:37:28,286
Both stinky.
You're stinky!

650
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:29,641
Honk! Honk!

651
00:37:29,642 --> 00:37:31,962
Honey, do you smell that?

652
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:33,678
You know what that is?

653
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:35,589
I smell bacon.

654
00:37:36,726 --> 00:37:37,886
Dad?

655
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:47,573
Hey, I'm sorry.

656
00:37:49,031 --> 00:37:50,261
I'm sorry.

657
00:37:52,074 --> 00:37:53,930
I'm so sorry.

658
00:37:55,322 --> 00:37:57,188
Was that breakfast I smell?

659
00:37:58,259 --> 00:37:59,200
You're alive!

660
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:01,836
Oh, I thought you were dead!

661
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,014
I love you so much.

662
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,994
Oh, honey, what's wrong?
I don't understand.

663
00:38:07,427 --> 00:38:08,428
Woody's plane -

664
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:10,580
Cassidy Casablancas blew it up.

665
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:13,889
Oh, honey..

666
00:38:14,374 --> 00:38:15,522
I wasn't on the plane.

667
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,877
Lamb didn't want me arriving with
Woody getting met by the press,

668
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:21,038
so he had them take me off
the plane at the last minute.

669
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:22,901
I ran to the car.
I drove home.

670
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,441
I was a little surprised to find,

671
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,409
you know,
Logan on the couch,

672
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,447
but it was better than
finding him elsewhere, right?

673
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:37,968
What were you saying
about the Casablancas boy?

674
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:43,279
It's most likely
going to be ruled a suicide,

675
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:45,491
so insurance-wise,

676
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:46,863
that's going to be a wash.

677
00:38:47,655 --> 00:38:51,055
The cops found these in
Cassidy's room, however.

678
00:38:51,211 --> 00:38:52,369
Phoenix Land Trust.

679
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:53,863
It's all in your name.

680
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:55,942
- I assume the -
- Right.

681
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,772
Phoenix,
the real-estate thing.

682
00:38:57,773 --> 00:38:58,890
How am I doing these days?

683
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:01,631
$8 million and change.

684
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,797
Tell him I said,
"nice going. "

685
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:05,190
Him?

686
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,799
Betting against incorporation?

687
00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:09,257
Ballsy.

688
00:39:09,906 --> 00:39:12,045
Feels like a Richard Casablancas move
to me.

689
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:16,174
I can feel it already.

690
00:39:16,175 --> 00:39:18,533
The little-town blues are melting away.

691
00:39:19,178 --> 00:39:19,997
You all packed?

692
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,228
Vagabond shoes and all.

693
00:39:22,484 --> 00:39:23,633
And pepper spray -

694
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:26,079
for if we run into
that Trump character.

695
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:28,240
You sure you don't want to drive
with the old man?

696
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,378
Logan is giving me a ride.
We're supposed to "talk. "

697
00:39:31,407 --> 00:39:33,802
How'd he take, um, what happened?

698
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,268
Shrugs it off,
calls himself little orphan Annie,

699
00:39:37,765 --> 00:39:40,029
which I think means "badly. "

700
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:43,746
I should go out front.

701
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:45,099
I should get my autograph book.

702
00:39:45,832 --> 00:39:48,141
Carol Channing is still alive,
isn't she?

703
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,087
I'll see you at the gate.

704
00:39:55,204 --> 00:39:56,367
So?

705
00:40:08,276 --> 00:40:09,498
What are you doing here?

706
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,849
I'm not gonna see you for a whole week.
That's, like, months.

707
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:16,045
Yeah, but then I'll be back,
and everything will be fine.

<i>Swing from the ceiling</i>

709
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:21,879
You say that, but I don't know.

710
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:25,970
- I know. I can feel it.
- And you're never wrong? No?

711
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:28,405
Aw... young love.

712
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:30,760
No, no, hold that position.

713
00:40:30,918 --> 00:40:34,420
Norman Rockwell wants
to come in and paint you two.

714
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:37,316
Did he pin on his pin,
or was he too shy?

715
00:40:38,432 --> 00:40:39,388
Why are you here?

716
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:41,862
Yeah, I didn't know you could come out
during daylight hours.

717
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,037
I have a business proposition
for your father.

718
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:49,057
Okay, but I'm warning you.
He doesn't carry much cash.

719
00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:52,444
I need you to do something for me.

720
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:55,128
Well, I'll be back in a week,
and at that time, I will -

721
00:40:55,181 --> 00:40:56,736
I need it right now.

722
00:40:56,737 --> 00:40:59,614
Sorry, mrs. Casablancas,
but I'm meeting my daughter in an hour.

723
00:41:01,308 --> 00:41:03,053
I think you'll change your mind.

724
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:07,012
Oh.

725
00:41:07,013 --> 00:41:09,647
Like I said, it's important.
