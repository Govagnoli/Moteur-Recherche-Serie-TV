1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:02,203
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,446
Duncan Kane. He used to be my boyfriend.

3
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:07,154
Then one day, with no warning, he ended things.

4
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,916
Is Duncan my half-brother?

5
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:11,256
Meg, you're the last good person at this school.

6
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:12,950
You do have friends, Veronica.

7
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:14,491
Lilly Kane was my best friend.

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,006
Did you know that the head of security at Kane Software

9
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:19,812
was the one that made the tip call that got Abel Koontz arrested?

10
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:25,397
Veronica, I know you have a million questions but everything will make sense when the time is right.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,780
- Have you heard from your sister? 
- She sent a telegram.

12
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,790
I know you blame me for your mother's death.

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,530
They didn't find a body because she's not dead.

14
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:35,735
I guess I should be grateful that my mother didn't leave her car on a bridge.

15
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:38,085
- Logan, what are you doing here? 
- I want you to find my mother.

16
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:54,542
Your mom had fourteen credit cards in her name at the time of her disappearance.

17
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:57,151
This is the only one that's been active.

18
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:58,642
No-limit platinum card.

19
00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:00,197
Be my mom's weapon of choice.

20
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:04,720
This is also the only one that is still registered under her maiden name, Lester.

21
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:06,710
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

22
00:01:07,155 --> 00:01:08,734
Or maybe she's trying to hide, huh?

23
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,445
It's hard to know for sure.

24
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:15,738
There's only been one purchase so far, a rental car.

25
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:19,440
There was no surveillance tape from the point of sale but I ordered a copy

26
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:22,224
of the card holder's signature. It might take a couple of weeks.

27
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:23,177
What kind of car?

28
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:26,633
Benz. Red... convertible.

29
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,507
I'll let you know if she strikes again.

30
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,700
Hey, Veronica, uh...

31
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:50,917
Thanks for helping out with this.

32
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:54,553
I know what it's like.

33
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,930
Don't be stingy with the glitter. Remember.

34
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:13,517
It's an eighties dance.

35
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:18,412
You know, if I didn't know better,

36
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:23,096
I'd swear I just saw my best friend ask you to 'Total Eclipse of the Heart'.

37
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:24,637
No, no one's asked.

38
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:29,072
But I'm pining away by the phone waiting for that special boy to call.

39
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,115
You never know.

40
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:35,938
Come on, Duncan. You know as well as I do, my heart was totally eclipsed long ago.

41
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:39,916
I mean, sure, once upon a time that special boy did call

42
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:44,841
and the spring dance was the crowning moment of my fairy tale-esque teen girl life.

43
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:49,484
But now I know better. It felt like love but maybe it was just-

44
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:50,719
Veronica!

45
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:54,233
- Hey! 
- Hey. I really need to talk to you.

46
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:55,952
Sorry, girl emergency.

47
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:57,677
What's up?

48
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,637
I think I have a secret admirer.

49
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:03,708
Hello.

50
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:06,136
Hello.

51
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:09,843
Oh hi, nice breathing.

52
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,807
Yep, just keeps getting better and better.

53
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:17,450
Has your secret admirer been calling you all week and hanging up without speaking?

54
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:19,171
- No. 
- Hmm, lucky you.

55
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:20,851
So tell me about it.

56
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:26,177
On our way back from our last away game, I got this weird text message.

57
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:31,377
So I looked around and saw two guys on their cell phones.

58
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:36,262
Caz is always flirty with me but that guy would flirt with a trash can if it had boobs.

59
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,962
Then there was Martin.

60
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:41,900
He's sweet but a little moony, if you know what I mean.

61
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:45,939
Or it could be some maladjusted freshman

62
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:50,199
who likes to lurk outside your bedroom window with binoculars and a bag of pork rinds.

63
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:51,424
Come on, Veronica.

64
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:53,511
You gotta help me find out who it is.

65
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:55,942
This could turn out to be my soul mate.

66
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,089
When I've had my fill of soul mates, glitter and puppy love,

67
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,889
I always find a private detective's office a refreshing change of pace.

68
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:08,191
Here's my assistant now.

69
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:17,729
I'm swamped with this insurance fraud thing but we could use this fee.

70
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,654
Can you take her information, charge her a straight 75?

71
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,828
Shouldn't take more than a half hour online.

72
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:23,981
- Sure. 
- Thanks.

73
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:30,356
Nothing soothes the nausea, headache and occasional dizziness of a romance overdose

74
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:34,492
like a glimpse of the aftermath. 
The custody battles, the affairs

75
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:38,956
and what I'm guessing is a trophy wife looking for her golden parachute.

76
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:42,120
She'll take your info and I'll get right on it.

77
00:04:43,393 --> 00:04:45,455
So, how can I help you... Miss...

78
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,788
Lenova, Cat-ta-rina Lenova.

79
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:51,604
I made mistake. Involving love.

80
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:56,216
I didn't know what a good thing I had and I lost him.

81
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,225
You must help me find him.

82
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:04,951
He was my soul mate.

83
00:05:40,998 --> 00:05:42,042
Ah, zat's Tom.

84
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:47,110
Two years ago I came here from Brask 
in Russia to meet zis man.

85
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:50,690
Like a mail order bride thing?

86
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:53,541
Not mail anymore. Internet.

87
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:59,279
We exchange message and, uh, 
I came to Chicago as his fiancé.

88
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:01,610
That's a brave move.

89
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:03,407
Not if you've seen Brask.

90
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:07,456
All the boys there, as zey say, 
are beautiful, like a princess.

91
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:09,715
Maybe I am expecting a prince.

92
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,167
When I meet Tom, I am disappointed; 
he's not what I imagine.

93
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:20,579
In his picture he was not, um, how you say...

94
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,082
- Bald. 
- Yes.

95
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:30,701
Before we are married I had zee cold feet, so I leave him after some time here,

96
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,389
alone, I realise I made mistake.

97
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:36,970
He is good man and he is gone.

98
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:40,778
I look it but, but with him changing his name...

99
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:42,172
Why would he change his name?

100
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:44,854
He  does plays in Chicago.

101
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:48,679
He always talk about come to California, be an actor.

102
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,273
What's wrong with Tom?

103
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:53,563
Oh, his last name, ah, c-r-u-z.

104
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:56,850
I guess it's too much like zat actor, you know... Tom...

105
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:59,241
Cruise. Yes, I see the problem.

106
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:02,390
Ah, what makes you think he's here?

107
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:07,491
Za last I hear from him, 
several months back iz zis postcard.

108
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:13,219
"Catherine, Thank you for the good days, but I need to move on. I won't be in touch again."

109
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,996
Postmarked Neptune, California.

110
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,418
All  right, well this shouldn't be too hard.

111
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,393
Ah, $75 and Mr Mars should have something for you in a couple of days.

112
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,305
How hard can it be to find an actor named Tom Cruz?

113
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:28,527
Tom Cruise?

114
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:31,232
Not as good a private eye as I thought.

115
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,906
No. C-R-U-...

116
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:35,271
Never mind.

117
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:37,380
Okay.

118
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:39,776
I'm hanging out.

119
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,733
Hey, you're on the basketball team, right?

120
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:46,422
You obviously haven't seen us play.

121
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:48,747
I am the basketball team.

122
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,105
Can you do something for me?

123
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,166
You just stopped hanging out again.

124
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,096
It's a favour for Meg.

125
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:58,086
She's got this secret admirer; he's been text messaging her.

126
00:07:58,173 --> 00:07:59,897
You know Caz and Martin on the team?

127
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:03,753
How 'bout you sneak a peek at their cell phones and see if they dial Meg's number?

128
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:06,677
What is it with you girls and your girly-girl drama?

129
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,007
What are you now? A love detective?

130
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,035
Wallace,

131
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:14,086
if you do this for me, we'll be best friends forever.

132
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:16,846
Come on, don't you want us to be BFF?

133
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:19,876
All right, all right.

134
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,444
But the next time we hang out, you gotta actually hang out.

135
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:35,319
Secret admirer strikes again and the plot thickens.

136
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:36,896
He wants me to go to the dance.

137
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:41,120
I'm dying to know who it is.

138
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:44,182
Purple faced monkey orchid.

139
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:49,004
Native to the King Leopold range in the Australian outback. My deduction?

140
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,705
Your secret admirer is an aboriginal tribesman

141
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,060
who shops at Manny's Flower Hut.

142
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:01,381
What are you doing?

143
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:06,525
In the detective business, we call this a clue.

144
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,930
What about the text messages?

145
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,150
I've got my best man on it.

146
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,190
Ah, Meg, Meg.

147
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:22,996
I'm actually, uh, throwing a rage at my house tomorrow night and it should be pretty kick-ass.

148
00:09:25,294 --> 00:09:28,798
Hey dude! What the hell are you doing?

149
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:38,530
Miss Lenova, Mr Mars was unable to find any trace of Tom. I'm really sorry.

150
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:40,999
Iz zere nothing more he can do?

151
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:46,426
Well, he's done all the routine searches, um, you could hire him full time,

152
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,975
it's $250 a day, plus expenses.

153
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,883
I pay, whatever it takes.

154
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,444
Mr Mars is the best in the business.

155
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,249
So can you tell me anything else about him?

156
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:01,729
He just... zis wonderful man.

157
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:07,335
He not the most handsome or rich but he's sweet and...

158
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:11,693
and kind and... oh he make me laugh.

159
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,406
I actually meant, um,

160
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,082
like his hobbies or interests, details like that, other than acting.

161
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:24,672
He like da, um, hockies.

162
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:29,307
Um, he play guitar but not very well.

163
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:34,064
Um, he like-he like detective movies.

164
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,928
Uhh, Chinese food, like that?

165
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:38,963
Like that.

166
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:41,343
Please.

167
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:46,985
Ask Mr Mars to work as fast as he can.

168
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:51,209
I'm sure he'll come through.

169
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:56,099
Hi, I'm looking to place a casting notice

170
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:59,540
and I need this filled as soon as possible.

171
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:05,009
I'm looking for an ordinary guy type, medium height and build,

172
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:08,603
dark hair and a little thin on top

173
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:12,940
and he must be able to play hockey and play the guitar.

174
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:14,935
Right.

175
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,007
And here's the fax number you can send those headshots.

176
00:11:31,063 --> 00:11:32,288
About this secret mission.

177
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,071
What'cha got?

178
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:35,258
A reputation as a jock-sniffer.

179
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,576
You can be your own FF.

180
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:38,723
I'm retired.

181
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:40,582
What's all this?

182
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:43,552
Casting call for Tom Cruz with a zee.

183
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,020
Apparently, he has changed his name.

184
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:49,461
Damn, this dog is a freak show.

185
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,369
He oughta be in show biz.

186
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:57,395
You think that's some kind of rare breed or something?

187
00:11:57,474 --> 00:12:01,425
That or a drunk dingo had a three-way with an ocelot and a porcupine.

188
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:02,991
Hold that thought.

189
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:07,216
Hello, no-limit platinum card.

190
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:09,541
How many cases you working on here, Rockford?

191
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,027
Twelve hundred bucks?

192
00:12:15,972 --> 00:12:18,378
This is Logan with today's inspirational greeting:

193
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,081
the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams -

194
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,205
Eleanor Roosevelt. Leave a message.

195
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,182
Hey. Call me when you get this.

196
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:28,619
There's been another charge on your mom's credit card...

197
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:30,922
at the Sunset Regent.

198
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,442
I know I'm late. Sorry, honey.

199
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:50,194
So I talked to this guy on the phone. Let me handle it, he's a bit prickly.

200
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:55,658
May  I help you?

201
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:56,799
You may.

202
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,610
My fiancé and I are looking for a honeymoon suite.

203
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:03,281
Oh, how wonderful. 
These are our more affordable packages.

204
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:07,470
The rooms run $350 for a courtyard and $450 for poolside.

205
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:09,773
On the weekends of course, it's a two night minimum.

206
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,893
Of course. Here's a little bit more what I had in mind.

207
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,106
Wow, sugarpuss, you've certainly been a busy little bee.

208
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:22,262
Ah, she's a keeper.

209
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:27,556
Um, these are our luxury suites.

210
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:30,023
Ooh. Nope.

211
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:31,563
No.

212
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,394
Uh, ick.

213
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:36,741
Well, how much is this one?

214
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:39,008
Ah, yes. Our Princess Suite.

215
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:43,285
Twelve hundred a night. It has a hot tub, 360 degree view

216
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:45,695
and, um, private elevator access.

217
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:47,184
- Ah, yummy... 
- Yeah.

218
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:48,368
Let's take a look, hon.

219
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,492
I apologise but the suite's currently occupied.

220
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,754
Like literally occupied, because we could just poke our heads in.

221
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:56,744
Um. I'm sorry but our guest has insisted on her privacy.

222
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:00,406
Could we maybe just call up to the room?

223
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:01,588
Oh, I'm afraid that's not possible.

224
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,894
I assure you we will afford you the same privacy, should you choose to stay with us.

225
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,994
All right, stay put. I gonna go talk to the maintenance guys.

226
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:18,019
No, I think I can handle it from here.

227
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:22,371
No, I can get them to unlock the service elevator and we can just-

228
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:23,876
Naw, I've got a better idea.

229
00:14:24,234 --> 00:14:25,355
I'll just sit right here.

230
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:27,419
Until my mother walks out of that elevator.

231
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:31,064
As a plan, a bit low concept for my taste,

232
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:36,717
but Logan seems primed for a stake-out and I've got a pair of elusive Romeos to track down.

233
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,092
Yeah, I-I believe I do recognise my handiwork...

234
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:44,330
You maybe... remember who bought it?

235
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:49,634
Yeah, yeah. Unusual order. Most kids order straight up, like roses and baby's breath.

236
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:51,074
No damn imagination.

237
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:53,748
But this kid, he, you know, he's thinking outside the box, you know.

238
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,701
I-I mean, what he looked like.

239
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:01,657
Ah, yeah, right. He's not a bad looking kid. Kinda medium sized, you know.

240
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,627
He's got that look, you know, that...

241
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:06,639
look, you know.

242
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,604
What look?

243
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,605
You know, kinda that, duh, high school kid look.

244
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:16,751
Okay. Uh, thanks a bunch, Manny.

245
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:17,575
Yeah.

246
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:21,492
Mexican hairless.

247
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:24,108
What's the point of having a dog if it's bald?

248
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:26,929
What are you gonna pet?

249
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:28,271
Skin?

250
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,723
Stay on task, Wallace.

251
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:34,953
Mars Investigations.

252
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:35,962
Hey, honey.

253
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:40,851
Why did I just get a voicemail from this Russian woman asking how I'm doing with her case?

254
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,464
I thought you dealt with that.

255
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,430
My plate is full with this insurance fraud thing.

256
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:45,884
Uh, I'm still dealing.

257
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,782
Turns out it was a little more complicated.

258
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:50,676
Veronica. Don't waste your time on this.

259
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,794
If the computer search didn't do it then just tell her we're too busy.

260
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:56,970
She agreed to the daily rate and we can always use the money.

261
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,530
I mean, wouldn't it be cool to have glasses in the kitchen that didn't have the Hamburglar on them?

262
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:02,611
Forget about the money.

263
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:06,513
I just thought it would be nice if, instead of breaking people up,

264
00:16:06,578 --> 00:16:08,356
we brought them together for once.

265
00:16:08,438 --> 00:16:10,967
Honey, we're private investigators, not the frigging Love Boat.

266
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:14,023
Dad, I'm almost there, I just need to track down...

267
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:15,903
Steve!

268
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:17,449
Steve? That's our guy?

269
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:19,102
No, Steve's a dog.

270
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:21,790
It's a Catahoula Leopard dog.

271
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:24,571
Who the hell names a dog Steve?

272
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:26,004
Tom Cruz?

273
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:30,945
Don't forget. You're a high school girl.

274
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:33,290
Do some high school girl things now and then.

275
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:37,975
Relax, Dad. I'm cutting pictures of Ashton out of Teen People as we speak.

276
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:38,941
You better be.

277
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:41,042
Gotta run sweetie.

278
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:02,679
Exotic Animals Hospital.

279
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:06,100
Hi. I'm calling about a Catahoula Leopard dog named Steve.

280
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:08,178
- Uh, nope, not here. 
- Sorry.

281
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:16,806
Pet Hospital.

282
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:20,303
Hi, I'm calling about a Catahoula Leopard dog named Steve.

283
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:23,461
- Brought in last week? 
- Yes! Right.

284
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:27,696
Uh, I met Steve on a dog beach a while back and, well,

285
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:30,912
I have a Leopard dog, Lulu and I was looking to breed her

286
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:33,379
and it seemed like she and Steve has some real chemistry.

287
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:37,168
Ah, I know you probably wouldn't give me the owner's name and number but

288
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:40,030
I was wondering if you might call him and see if he would talk to me?

289
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:42,994
- My name is Veronica, you can reach me at- 
- We've got caller ID.

290
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:46,440
Caller ID. How do we ever get by? Thanks.

291
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:57,653
Hey Meg, it's Veronica.

292
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,267
Would you mind leaving a little early for the party so I can make a stop.

293
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:02,784
No, nothing major.

294
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:06,311
Okay, I gotta run. I'll see ya.

295
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:09,972
- Hello? 
- Sorry, the dog's owner said no.

296
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,948
Oh, I see.

297
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:15,041
Well, it was a long shot anyway.

298
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:15,875
Thanks.

299
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:17,902
This'll just take a minute.

300
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:20,237
I  still don't understand what we're even doing here.

301
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,993
Ah-ha. It all seems clear now.

302
00:18:29,197 --> 00:18:30,575
This is just business.

303
00:18:33,264 --> 00:18:34,364
Miss Mars.

304
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:36,458
You have something else to confess?

305
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,950
I'm just here for a little favour.

306
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,382
What is that?

307
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,260
Oh, we have the sketch artist up from San Diego.

308
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,648
Figured I'd test him out. He's not bad.

309
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,412
I don't have horns.

310
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,859
Yeah, I guess not.

311
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:54,496
Memory really plays tricks on people.

312
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,221
Hey, Veronica.

313
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:57,244
Hey Karl.

314
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,645
Long time, no see. What do ya think?

315
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:03,143
Um, it's great. I finally feel wanted.

316
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:05,565
Right. Say hi to your dad for me.

317
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,328
I'm just here for a little favour.

318
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:11,172
You guys can get phone records, right?

319
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:12,974
We can get anything. We're cops.

320
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:16,200
Pine Veterinary Clinic?

321
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,247
I need to know what numbers they called between four and four ten today.

322
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,473
I don't know, Veronica.

323
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,999
Leo, there is a long and proud history of mutual back scratching

324
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,191
between cops and private dicks.

325
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:31,453
So when do you scratch my back?

326
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:35,860
Well maybe I'll see you tonight when you and Sacks bust this party we're going to.

327
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,898
I'm looking forward to it.

328
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:42,439
My, Veronica, he totally wants to serve and protect you.

329
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:44,672
Please Meg. We're looking for your man tonight.

330
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,527
Okay, the game is afoot.

331
00:19:50,428 --> 00:19:51,251
Nice house.

332
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:52,443
Oh, you like?

333
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:55,998
Your folks must be really laid back.

334
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:58,067
Oh, these aren't actually my parents.

335
00:19:58,225 --> 00:20:00,037
This isn't my house house.

336
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,176
It's one of the model homes in my old man's cheesy new sub-division.

337
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:06,627
But would you girls like a drink?

338
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:11,737
- Umm, I'm fine. 
- Yeah, you are super-fine.

339
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,286
A soda?

340
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,887
You know, I think we're fresh out but, um...

341
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,776
So did you get a chance to go to the game last night?

342
00:20:25,945 --> 00:20:26,902
I was cheering.

343
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:29,253
On the sidelines.

344
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,055
Because I am cool.

345
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:38,571
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally spaced.

346
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,281
Hey, remember when I jammed it over that Long Beach party guard?

347
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:45,001
Knocked his wreck-specs off!

348
00:20:50,122 --> 00:20:50,879
Sorry.

349
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,172
You won't find anything in those cupboards, it's a fake house.

350
00:21:03,382 --> 00:21:04,325
Uh, right.

351
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:07,744
So I see you got Caz's little game recap, huh.

352
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,757
Yeah, like all over me.

353
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,156
Oh, no, no, no. I don't want to ruin your sweater.

354
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:15,804
No, it's not mine, it's Caz's. Go crazy.

355
00:21:15,952 --> 00:21:17,815
Hey Martin, can I borrow your cell phone?

356
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,101
Sure.

357
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:28,081
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

358
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,003
Hey.

359
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:31,077
Do you know what's going on with Logan?

360
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:32,312
What do you mean?

361
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:34,723
Well, he's camped out in a hotel lobby in LA.

362
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:36,494
How do you know that?

363
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:37,790
I just talked to him.

364
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:38,793
He's still there?

365
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,098
Uh, I'll take care of it.

366
00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:43,131
Martin.

367
00:21:48,702 --> 00:21:49,438
There you are.

368
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:50,733
Did you find out anything?

369
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:52,233
I'm totally confused.

370
00:21:52,842 --> 00:21:57,107
Okay. Granted, I would look good on Caz's arm

371
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,718
but do you have anything available in sensitive or charming.

372
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,745
- I can check in the back. 
- Good.

373
00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:06,605
I'm so sorry Meg, I have to run. Can you find a ride home?

374
00:22:07,183 --> 00:22:08,193
Yeah, I'll be fine.

375
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,837
No, you'll be super-fine.

376
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,754
I'm sorry. But the lobby's reserved for hotel guests only.

377
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:36,143
So book me a room, Jeeves.

378
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:40,956
Bring me a room service menu while you're at it.

379
00:22:57,815 --> 00:22:59,684
You know you can't sit here forever.

380
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:02,342
What do you say we smoke her out.

381
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:09,725
I'd like to report my card lost.

382
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:11,767
My name is Lynn Lester.

383
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:29,709
That's her.

384
00:23:35,843 --> 00:23:37,020
Oh, hey, Logan.

385
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:39,703
Did you just call me Mom?

386
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:41,356
You okay, brother?

387
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,835
You know Mom's gone, right?

388
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:47,643
Wow. You're supposed to be in Australia.

389
00:23:47,823 --> 00:23:49,595
Yeah, well that didn't work out.

390
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:52,225
Veronica, hey!

391
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,737
Hello, Trina.

392
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:55,908
So, is the whole brat pack here?

393
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:58,325
What is this, like, like, prom night.

394
00:23:58,432 --> 00:24:01,427
You guys get a room here for some after-party.

395
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:07,127
Oh, hey. Oh. I've been kinda outta the loop lately.

396
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,574
- Are you two- 
- Stop! You shut up.

397
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:13,024
You're wearing Mom's clothes, you're wearing Mom's hat.

398
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:15,072
She was your mom, my step-mom.

399
00:24:15,176 --> 00:24:17,638
The lady who liked to parade though the house in a string bikini,

400
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:19,316
whenever I had a boy over.

401
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:21,508
Yeah, well to be fair when didn't you have a boy over.

402
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:22,603
Oh, you...

403
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,166
Dad could've used you there.

404
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:28,015
So now you're worried about Dad's welfare.

405
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,285
Isn't he the big bad wolf?

406
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:33,433
Cigarette burns and broken noses.

407
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,182
Oh, the stories you used to tell.

408
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,153
Wow, we should get together and do this more often.

409
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:40,883
Yeah, well, you're in luck. I'm heading home now.

410
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:43,504
I guess some accountant finally cancelled Mom's cards.

411
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:47,226
But if you're coming home, who will play Dead Hooker Number Two on CSI this week.

412
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:49,377
How will you get your attention fix?

413
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,490
Maybe I can be the ring girl at one of your bum fights.

414
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:53,442
You know what?

415
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:56,069
Shall we get going, Logan?

416
00:24:56,335 --> 00:24:59,289
Veronica, look at you. All grown up.

417
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:01,430
Hey, we should hang out when I'm in town.

418
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:03,114
Okay. Yeah.

419
00:25:04,113 --> 00:25:06,191
Logan, come on. Let's go.

420
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,400
See ya guys. Drive safe.

421
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:34,494
She's gone. She's gone.

422
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:41,432
Yep, I got some pictures.

423
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:45,042
Mr Neckbrace with a former lawyer, Joe Allen,

424
00:25:45,098 --> 00:25:48,406
who was disbarred last year for repping a fake accident ring.

425
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:55,421
Hey, you got any other guys working this case, maybe drives a silver Chevy?

426
00:25:55,502 --> 00:25:57,069
I keep seeing it behind me.

427
00:25:57,242 --> 00:25:58,846
No, no, no, it's nothing.

428
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,275
So I'll send the pictures when I get back.

429
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:04,708
Okay. Bye.

430
00:26:16,552 --> 00:26:17,866
- Good morning sir. 
- Hey.

431
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,940
Thank you.

432
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:25,562
Here you are sir.

433
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:26,583
The wrong place I guess.

434
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:29,930
You know which hotel has the medical supplies convention?

435
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:36,198
Anyway. I'll just take the keys... one right there. Thanks. Have a good day.

436
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,109
You too, sir.

437
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,089
Hey, it's Keith Mars.

438
00:27:44,508 --> 00:27:46,360
I got a name check to run.

439
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:50,026
Yevgeni Sukarenko, all right?

440
00:27:51,123 --> 00:27:52,453
Thanks for doing this, Karl.

441
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:53,472
Yeah, no problem.

442
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,167
Is this the guy?

443
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,554
This is Manny.

444
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,011
Manny, this is Karl.

445
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:03,558
He's gonna help you with your... recall problems.

446
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:04,878
Yeah, good luck.

447
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:06,908
Don't worry, Manny, I'm a professional.

448
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:08,848
Right.

449
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:12,166
- I'll fax the results to your place. 
- I owe you one.

450
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:21,863
Well if it isn't my local policeman.

451
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:23,159
You got a pen handy?

452
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:24,648
Always. What do ya got?

453
00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:29,284
Three outgoing calls between Pine Veterinary between four and four ten.

454
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:34,792
I got a Fred Ellis, John Frampton and a Carla Stern.

455
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:37,689
You're a prince, Leo.

456
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:39,067
Yeah, I'm writing that down.

457
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,839
I'll talk to ya later.

458
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:46,384
So it seems that saying about people resembling their pets is true.

459
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:50,899
Fred Ellis was as old and droopy as his Basset Hound and single mother, Carla Stern

460
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:54,193
was a dead ringer for her Pomeranian. Two strikes.

461
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:58,682
So it all comes down to John Frampton bearing a slight resemblance to his...

462
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:01,167
Catahoula Leopard Dog.

463
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:20,775
Catherine? It's Veronica in Mr Mars' office. It's good news. He found Tom.

464
00:29:20,856 --> 00:29:24,302
Veronica, thank you. It's a miracle.

465
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,264
You have a pen?

466
00:29:25,358 --> 00:29:26,673
Of course, please.

467
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:28,511
So the address is-

468
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:31,092
Dad, what are you doing?

469
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:35,701
This isn't Catherine Lenova.

470
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:37,928
It's Yellana Sukarenko.

471
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,148
Yevgeni and Sergei Sukarenko, 
Russian mob from Chicago.

472
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,610
Anthony Thomas Cruz worked for their father.

473
00:29:47,774 --> 00:29:49,991
Turned State's evidence and put him away.

474
00:29:50,394 --> 00:29:52,837
He's not a long lost love, Veronica.

475
00:29:53,098 --> 00:29:55,346
He's in the witness protection programme.

476
00:30:11,804 --> 00:30:12,841
Just like we said.

477
00:30:17,689 --> 00:30:20,435
Mars Investi- Catherine.

478
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,625
I'm sorry, I got excited and dropped the phone.

479
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,412
You still have your pen?

480
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:29,097
Okay, the address is

481
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:32,584
124 Driftwood Terrace.

482
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:34,944
Right.

483
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:36,644
Of course.

484
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:38,622
It's no problem.

485
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:40,843
Buh-bye.

486
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:44,550
It's good work, honey.

487
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,426
- So, what's gonna happen? 
- Don't worry.

488
00:30:48,906 --> 00:30:50,448
I'll take care of it from here.

489
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:29,518
Do svidaniya, Mr Cruz.

490
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,447
Oh! Prevet!

491
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:35,336
Put down your guns, now.

492
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:38,024
Get your hands on your head, get your hands on your head.

493
00:31:40,456 --> 00:31:41,587
Prevet?

494
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,032
It's Russian for hi. I looked it up.

495
00:31:46,836 --> 00:31:49,895
- Hey! 
- Meg, I am so sorry.

496
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:50,813
What for?

497
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:57,863
I told you I was gonna find your secret admirer before the dance and I haven't come through, I...

498
00:31:57,962 --> 00:31:59,758
it's just been a million other things I've been working on...

499
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:02,299
Forget it, forget it. I don't even care anymore.

500
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:05,544
Oh, here.

501
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,511
You can have it. It's the flowers he sent me.

502
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:12,134
Supposed to be our signal tonight or something.

503
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:13,710
Thought you were excited about it.

504
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:19,133
Truth is, I'm not sure I wanna go out with Caz.

505
00:32:19,316 --> 00:32:21,318
And Martin's nice but not...

506
00:32:21,493 --> 00:32:23,151
I just don't want to hurt his feelings.

507
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:27,185
How come you're all dolled up.

508
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:29,961
Now who says I need a date to go to the dance.

509
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:31,584
Oh. Right.

510
00:32:32,362 --> 00:32:34,451
You... go girl.

511
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:37,149
I'm taking you.

512
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:46,053
Okay.

513
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:52,117
Well, what do you think?

514
00:32:53,217 --> 00:32:56,334
I look like Manilla Whore Barbie.

515
00:33:00,421 --> 00:33:02,131
No, no. Where are you going?

516
00:33:02,254 --> 00:33:04,987
- Don't you dare run away on me. 
- Just business.

517
00:33:09,661 --> 00:33:12,503
Come on, lover boy. Show us your face.

518
00:33:20,652 --> 00:33:21,601
What is it?

519
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:22,492
Nothing.

520
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:25,171
Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late.

521
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,644
Wow. Eighties fashion.

522
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:55,020
Grody to the max.

523
00:33:55,236 --> 00:33:56,357
Don't spaz.

524
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:58,747
Aren't you totally stoked to go to this thing.

525
00:33:58,824 --> 00:33:59,638
Oh, for sure.

526
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:03,684
I just didn't know the dance would be such a major couple-o-rama.

527
00:34:04,088 --> 00:34:06,039
What happened to all the girl power?

528
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:08,461
The we-don't-need-dates resolve.

529
00:34:08,578 --> 00:34:09,985
Reality has set in.

530
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,874
Forgive me, gal pal.

531
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,619
I'm weak.

532
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:27,625
What are you doing?

533
00:34:28,215 --> 00:34:29,494
You'll thank me later.

534
00:34:32,423 --> 00:34:33,340
Where are you going?

535
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:35,520
My work here is done.

536
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,624
But you'll miss your big surprise.

537
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:39,463
I'll live.

538
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:57,341
Would you care to dance?

539
00:35:04,223 --> 00:35:09,364
Between getting fooled by the Russian bride and finding out that Duncan has the hots for Meg,

540
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,742
I've had my fill of surprises tonight.

541
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:31,031
J Geils was right. Love stinks.

542
00:35:31,124 --> 00:35:34,820
You can dress it up with sequins and shoulder pads but one way or another

543
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:37,343
you're just gonna end up alone at the spring dance

544
00:35:37,389 --> 00:35:39,654
strapped into uncomfortable underwear.

545
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:50,949
What's wrong, Veronica?

546
00:36:01,553 --> 00:36:05,399
Are you ready for a... a total eclipse of the heart?

547
00:36:22,826 --> 00:36:24,126
You look beautiful.

548
00:36:55,555 --> 00:36:57,704
I love the eighties.

549
00:36:57,797 --> 00:37:00,304
Heads up. Risky business at 12:00

550
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,659
Come on everyone. Let's wang chung tonight.

551
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:07,836
What, everybody wang chung tonight.

552
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:12,234
Wang chung or I'll kick your ass. Everybody!

553
00:37:12,424 --> 00:37:13,659
Don't touch me, dude.

554
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Every class has one.

555
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:22,465
I cannot escape Tom Cruise.

556
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:27,323
Come on Logan, just give me your keys. Leo, can you follow us in your car?

557
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,276
No. No! No. No.

558
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:34,977
'Cause tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999.

559
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,236
Hey, who's this dude.

560
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:41,428
As I have told you now three times, this is the friendly officer of the law

561
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:45,514
who is going to overlook your underage public drunkenness.

562
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:47,932
Crockett or Tubbs?

563
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:50,733
Logan, when did you stop wearing pants?

564
00:37:52,514 --> 00:37:53,866
What are you doing here?

565
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:58,218
My first night back home and I get the call, come get Logan, he's wasted.

566
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,750
It's like I never left.

567
00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:01,562
Is that Kajagoogoo?

568
00:38:01,637 --> 00:38:05,284
There's no point you going in there, Trina. Entertainment Tonight is not covering it.

569
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:06,108
Bummer.

570
00:38:06,523 --> 00:38:09,630
Well I guess I'll just drag your sorry little self home.

571
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:13,798
As long as you let me puke in your car.

572
00:38:13,926 --> 00:38:16,312
Of course, just like old times.

573
00:38:20,245 --> 00:38:22,006
A promising young man.

574
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,989
Thanks for showing up tonight.

575
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:29,375
I assume I have Meg to thank for getting you here.

576
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:32,876
She called but I came because I wanted to see you.

577
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:37,806
You wanna go back?

578
00:38:38,488 --> 00:38:42,604
Ah, no, here's not so bad.

579
00:38:48,533 --> 00:38:49,881
Are you going to kiss me?

580
00:38:50,232 --> 00:38:51,380
I was thinking about it.

581
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:04,825
Cool.

582
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:13,549
Hello?

583
00:39:16,507 --> 00:39:17,697
Your other boyfriend.

584
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,768
No someone keeps crank calling me.

585
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:24,594
- Star 69 them. 
- I do but it just rings and rings.

586
00:39:27,383 --> 00:39:30,973
I am a deputy sheriff, allow me.

587
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,499
I hear you're bothering my girl...

588
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,013
Who is this? Why do you keep calling me?

589
00:39:38,191 --> 00:39:39,503
This is a pay phone.

590
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:42,099
You must be talking about that blonde lady.

591
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:43,543
Blonde lady?

592
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:46,984
A pay phone where?

593
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,112
Sage Brush Cantina, Barstow.

594
00:39:52,652 --> 00:39:54,423
Uh, raincheck?

595
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:58,595
What?

596
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:41,557
Mom!

597
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:46,437
Veronica.

598
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:50,699
Oh, my god, no. No, please.

599
00:40:50,804 --> 00:40:52,546
- I'm gonna get you out of here. 
- No!

600
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:56,519
No. I can't be seen with you. They are gonna hurt you.

601
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,430
Mom, I know who's doing it. I know who's blackmailing us. You're safe now.

602
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:10,153
Veronica.

603
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:11,847
