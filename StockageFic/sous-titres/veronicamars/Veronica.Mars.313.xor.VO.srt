1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,186
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:02,187 --> 00:00:05,211
Cyrus... we need to talk.

3
00:00:05,212 --> 00:00:07,261
I've been very generous over the years.

4
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:09,890
I'm a widow with two
children to take care of.

5
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:11,722
I didn't kill Cyrus, Keith.

6
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:12,998
I've got a little conundrum.

7
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:14,851
Nish says she egged the dean's Volvo

8
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:16,599
on campus the night he was murdered.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,804
Mindy says she had the Volvo parked

10
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:20,601
at the Neptune Grand all night.

11
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:22,512
Any guess as to who's lying?

12
00:00:22,513 --> 00:00:24,982
Did you and Madison have
sex over winter break?

13
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,511
We were broken up at the time.

14
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:29,058
You know how I feel about her.

15
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:32,402
Fennel, you run first team today.

16
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:33,880
Wait, coach-

17
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:35,565
You want to keep your
starting job, Mason,

18
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:38,369
start showing me something. Let's go!

19
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,062
Damn it!

20
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:44,187
Can someone tell me just what the hell

21
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:45,277
we're doing out there?

22
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,654
We're on a basketball court
in basketball uniforms,

23
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:51,884
but what we're playing?
That's not basketball.

24
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,778
Where's the passing?
Where's the teamwork?

25
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:58,398
Where's your heads?!
And where are you, Josh?

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,028
You gonna pull your head out of your ass

27
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,029
and start playing ball?

28
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,531
You're getting back-screened
every trip down.

29
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:04,485
I'm trying, Dad. They just-

30
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:05,876
I don't want excuses, Josh.

31
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:07,077
I want you to grow up.

32
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:08,417
You know what you got to do,

33
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:09,564
so how about instead of whining

34
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:10,765
about how you can't do it,

35
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,287
you just man up and do it?

36
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:15,029
Does that sound like
something maybe you can manage?

37
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,618
You know what, Dad? Not really.

38
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,973
So, why don't you just lay off me?

39
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:18,974
Josh, damn it. Don't.

40
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:20,671
Don't what? Quit?

41
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:23,281
Hey, that might be
something I'm capable of.

42
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:29,240
Wait! Josh, you don't want to do this.

43
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:30,227
Your dad's been...

44
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:31,561
Come on, everybody.

45
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:34,374
So, they're killing us inside.

46
00:01:35,643 --> 00:01:37,958
Fennel, look alive.

47
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:41,737
Well, look on the bright side.

48
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:43,748
Of a twenty-point loss?

49
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:46,000
In which the All-Conference
small forward quit the team.

50
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:48,930
Well, you did play a
lot of minutes for a guy

51
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,805
who had to quit the team first semester.

52
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:53,501
That's a side, and it's somewhat bright.

53
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:55,253
Me starting means Mason isn't.

54
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:57,534
And that's been awkward.

55
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:58,885
Why? If you're the better player...

56
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:02,857
That's the thing. I'm not sure I am.

57
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:06,185
It's just that Mason's always
in the coach's doghouse, and I'm-

58
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:07,379
You're you.

59
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,003
So, he hasn't been speaking to me.

60
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,143
Bright-side-wise, it's
break-even at best.

61
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:13,478
You get one more try.

62
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:16,497
Well...

63
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:19,577
I got nothing.

64
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:21,664
Walk it off, Fennel.

65
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,047
You doing okay?

66
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:25,176
With the Logan situation, I mean?

67
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:28,283
I've been trying really
hard not to think about it,

68
00:02:28,284 --> 00:02:30,854
so thanks for bringing it up.

69
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:48,870
"If you've eaten any of this
breakfast, you now owe me.

70
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:51,995
Invoices have to go out
today. See you at the office."

71
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,429
And I always fall for it.

72
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:09,023
Mr. Casablancas, I don't
suppose your buddy Logan Echolls

73
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:11,265
is gracing us with his presence today.

74
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,892
Doubtful. When they remove
a grapefruit-sized tumour,

75
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,471
they really recommend bed rest.

76
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:17,785
You might let him know that
if he misses another class,

77
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:19,823
he shouldn't bother showing up again.

78
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,712
He'll fail automatically.

79
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:23,406
I'll let him know your
prayers are with him.

80
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:26,821
Mr. Echolls, I'm more than happy

81
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:28,460
to give you your hamburger.

82
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:30,836
We'd just like to
take some of our trays.

83
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:32,905
Leave the food and go.

84
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:35,161
We're out of salt and pepper shakers.

85
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:38,024
I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.

86
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:42,012
We're running out of
salt and pepper shakers.

87
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:44,311
This needs to stop.

88
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:45,518
Why don't you let me handle this?

89
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:48,738
Yo, Logan. It's me. I'm coming in.

90
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:51,775
I'm bringing the food. Wait here.

91
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:07,946
Did you hear about the fire
in Veronica's neighbourhood?

92
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,979
Somebody's meth lab
blew up or something.

93
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,591
Bet you can see it from the balcony.

94
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,943
I'm gonna take a shower.
You guys go to town.

95
00:04:49,244 --> 00:04:51,061
You're not still looking
for the fire, right?

96
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,299
So, I got a message for you

97
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,338
rom the guy who teaches
our economics class.

98
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,547
You got to show up,
or he's gonna fail you.

99
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:02,193
Sad state of affairs when I'm
the academic on the balcony.

100
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:05,629
So, in other news, I met this girl

101
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,014
a couple weeks ago at a party.

102
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:11,079
Hot! Like, volcanic hot.

103
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,308
Like, I might have to use
an oven mitt to feel her up.

104
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:15,676
Blink if you understand.

105
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:20,656
She's coming here tonight,
and she's bringing her sister,

106
00:05:20,657 --> 00:05:24,052
who, I might add, she described
as practically her twin.

107
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:27,359
By the way, I did a little
research on pathetic sad sackery,

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,399
and "hot sister" is the
recommended treatment.

109
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
No, thanks.

110
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:33,728
You sure? We're thinking about going to

111
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,877
the swim team's beach blanket blow-out.

112
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,747
You can wear your t-shirt that says,

113
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:39,645
"I'd rather be home crying."

114
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:47,654
So, per my understanding
of contract law,

115
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:48,526
my eating the breakfast

116
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:51,380
in no way obligates me to perform any-

117
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:54,185
My daughter, Veronica. She works for me.

118
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:56,525
Veronica, this is Coach
Barry's wife and son.

119
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:57,735
Cliff brought them in.

120
00:05:57,736 --> 00:06:01,004
Coach Barry was found murdered
last night beside the PCH.

121
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,819
Sheriff suspects Josh,

122
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,971
and we've been asked to
help find the real killer.

123
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:09,538
Veronica Mars

124
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,539
3×13 "Postgame Mortem"

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,540
Transcript: Inigo [vmtranscripts.com]
Synchro: Matteo, Michele

126
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:30,444
Vieni a trovarci!

127
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:34,445
veronicamars.it

128
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:40,025
So, why don't you tell me what happened?

129
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,877
I told the sheriff already.

130
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:44,648
We had this fight at
halftime, me and my dad.

131
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:46,889
And, you know, I said I
quit, and he got all mad.

132
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,258
You know, it was like that.

133
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:50,302
There's a spot out on the PCH,

134
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:52,911
this little turnout
overlooking the ocean.

135
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,083
My dad goes there after losses
just to sit and mellow out,

136
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:57,985
so I went out to, you
know, try and talk with him.

137
00:06:57,986 --> 00:06:59,210
What did you fight about?

138
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,565
Dumb basketball stuff.

139
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:04,675
"Buck up," "be a man," all those,
you know, famous sports clichés.

140
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,751
When I got there,

141
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:08,607
I thought he already left
'cause his car wasn't there.

142
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:12,859
Then I-I saw... I saw
this body on the ground,

143
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:14,656
and I saw blood.

144
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:18,196
So, I ran over, and... it was dad.

145
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:20,690
He was dead. Shot.

146
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,967
You call the sheriff then?

147
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:24,117
No, I couldn't. I
mean, I-I-I tried,

148
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:25,312
but you can't get a
signal there, so I...

149
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:26,532
I didn't know what to do.

150
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,132
All I could think of
was Mom and Bobby and...

151
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,487
Bobby is his little brother.

152
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:31,730
I just-I just drove home

153
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:33,255
so they wouldn't have to
hear it from the sheriff.

154
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:36,001
When he came in, he looked
like he was in shock.

155
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:38,127
He had blood all over his shirt.

156
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:41,128
I- I told him to take a shower

157
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,120
'cause I didn't want
Bobby to see him like that.

158
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,839
What led them to suspect Josh?

159
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,430
Someone must have found
Tom's body and called in,

160
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:50,421
because after Josh showered,
the sheriff arrived.

161
00:07:50,422 --> 00:07:53,819
He found the bloody clothes,
then he found the ring...

162
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,961
Tom's N.I.T. championship ring.

163
00:07:56,962 --> 00:07:59,060
You took the N.I.T. ring
off your dad's finger?

164
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,644
No, he left it for me.

165
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,646
After I quit, I took a shower, and

166
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:06,130
when I went to my locker,
it was just in there.

167
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:08,260
I figured it was some kind

168
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:09,948
of peace offering or something.

169
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,145
That's why I went out to find him.

170
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,576
The PCHers have been responsible

171
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,341
for a number of carjackings out there.

172
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:18,087
I don't know why the sheriff
is so focused on Josh.

173
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:20,862
Those gang kids killed
Tom. They stole his car.

174
00:08:20,863 --> 00:08:22,647
It's obvious, and he
should be after them.

175
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:25,555
Is there anyone else

176
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:27,625
who might have had a
grudge with your dad?

177
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:28,761
Mel Stoltz.

178
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:29,762
Josh.

179
00:08:29,763 --> 00:08:30,463
Well, he hated dad.

180
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:32,298
He told anyone who
listened he wanted him gone.

181
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,924
Mel Stoltz, Stoltz industries?

182
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:36,116
Hearst's primary benefactor.

183
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:38,436
He wanted your father fired, not dead.

184
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,167
We'll look into it.

185
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:42,239
And don't worry about the sheriff.

186
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,003
He has a long and proud
history of being wrong.

187
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,234
And I'm very sorry for
your loss, Mrs. Barry.

188
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:50,839
We'll do everything we can.

189
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,878
It's as bad as she says?

190
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,753
Lamb's going after the kid?

191
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:03,598
Well, he was thinking
very hard about it,

192
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,400
or he really had to pee.

193
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,085
It's hard to tell with that man.

194
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:08,456
And you believe the wife?

195
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:10,447
She could be lying to cover for her son.

196
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:13,149
There's always a chance.
I mean, I believe her.

197
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,427
I've believed many things
that turned out to be lies,

198
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:19,623
but, well, you know, why even ask me?

199
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:21,342
Well, how about the
little brother, Bobby?

200
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:22,902
He can back up their story.

201
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:24,743
Bobby is severely autistic.

202
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:26,757
He won't be testifying for anyone.

203
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:30,412
Dude, you're not helping.

204
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:32,710
I'm aware of that.

205
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:35,165
I live here, too, you know.
This is my home.

206
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,454
People walk in, they don't think,
"this little clean area is Dick's,

207
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:40,164
and the hidden bottles
of urine are Logan's."

208
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:42,661
They think "Silence of the Lamb's basement,"

209
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:45,589
and their desire to get naked
near me takes a nose dive.

210
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:49,821
You're lucky you're rich.
This would be completely disgusting.

211
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:54,337
Hello, gorgeous!

212
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:56,032
Come in and meet Logan.

213
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,806
He doesn't normally look like this.

214
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:03,223
Uh, some chick ripped out
his heart and stomped on it.

215
00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:07,011
Logan Echolls, Melinda and Heather Button.

216
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,432
Which one's yours?

217
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:19,175
Hey, Weevil, I'm trying to have a word

218
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:21,239
with whoever's running
the PCHers these days,

219
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,509
and I was hoping you might
be able to hook me up.

220
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,945
Sure thing. Let me just
call my parole officer

221
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:28,574
and give him a heads-up I'll be
cavorting with known criminals.

222
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:30,692
I'm on the straight and narrow.

223
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:33,851
It's official business.
I could get you a few hundred bucks.

224
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:39,911
It's a true fact.

225
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:40,768
The swim team is crazier than any
frat on campus. They're wild men.

226
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:43,891
It's a party on the beach,
like with a bonfire and stuff?

227
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:45,332
I want to go so bad.

228
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,816
So, let's go.

229
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,715
- So, maybe you could keep an eye on-
- No.

230
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:54,350
I don't need a babysitter.
I can just watch TV.

231
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:56,254
Brilliant. Problem solved.

232
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:03,012
Be good!

233
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,540
You can order a movie if you want.
I'm going to bed.

234
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:13,397
You scroll through like that and click
on whatever you want to see.

235
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:14,724
Try to stay out of the porn.

236
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,584
Gross.

237
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,136
Stoltz industries.

238
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:25,103
Thank you.

239
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:28,980
Stoltz industries.

240
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,012
Thank you.

241
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:35,659
My appointment was for an hour ago.

242
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,060
He's pretty backed up.

243
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:39,639
We can reschedule you for
next week if that works for you.

244
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:47,597
Mr. Mars.

245
00:11:54,391 --> 00:11:56,779
Mr. Stoltz, a couple questions.
I'll make it quick.

246
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,288
Did you want Coach Tom Barry dead?

247
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,428
And where were you
at the time of his murder?

248
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:04,257
I'll call you back.

249
00:12:06,781 --> 00:12:08,352
Barry was a loser.

250
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:11,431
It's been six years since
our last conference title.

251
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:15,005
I wanted him gone.
Fired would have been fine,

252
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:18,194
but dead...
it does the trick just as well.

253
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:22,730
As for my whereabouts,
I was 35,000 feet in the air

254
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:25,630
on a plane travelling back from Seattle.

255
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:27,338
You mind telling me the airline?

256
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,494
- Air Stoltz.
- Air Stoltz, huh?

257
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:31,365
I'll look into it.

258
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:32,302
You do that.

259
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,722
["White Balloons" - Stephen Ashbrook]

260
00:12:37,586 --> 00:12:39,702
# Hey, you

261
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:45,177
# I am one, and you are one,
# and that makes two

262
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,327
# And it's twice what we're used to

263
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:51,012
You're still here.

264
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:54,360
Either that or you're dreaming.

265
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:00,038
They didn't come home.

266
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:10,897
Where are you? Why aren't you here?

267
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:13,331
Dude, I'm in Vegas.

268
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,340
Things got a little crazy last night.

269
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:17,012
We decided to take a road trip.

270
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,918
- I think I'm in love, man.
- Mazel tov.

271
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,215
Get your ass back to Neptune.

272
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:24,559
I would, but we just got here.

273
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,060
The ride was a bitch.

274
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:29,676
Imagine how much you'll hate it
bound in the trunk of my car.

275
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:31,634
It's not like you're leaving
the suite anyway.

276
00:13:31,635 --> 00:13:35,295
And I wasn't going to play this card, but...

277
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:37,642
shuffle, shuffle, shuffle...

278
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:40,123
you slept with my one
long-term girlfriend, dude.

279
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:42,056
Their parents are out of town, so...

280
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:44,880
I think a day of playing the nanny
is the least you could do.

281
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,372
Well, look. Be home by tonight.

282
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,351
Yeah, yeah. Bye.

283
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:55,634
I got you some eggs.

284
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:59,141
But they're probably cold.

285
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:03,304
Is that all you do is sleep?

286
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:08,616
I don't know what to say.

287
00:14:08,617 --> 00:14:11,123
Gang kids are usually quite punctual.

288
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:15,016
It's all right. Part of me actually
hopes they don't show.

289
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,443
Veronica Mars, scared of a few bikers?

290
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:23,174
Not even a quarter college-educated
and already you're square as-

291
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:26,358
It's not the bikers, per se. It's more...

292
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:28,935
what they represent.

293
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,890
I rest my case.

294
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:34,408
If they show, they probably
didn't do it, which...

295
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:37,691
would look not so good for Josh.

296
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:39,905
If they don't show,
there's a good chance they did it.

297
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:45,239
Maybe they're here to confess.

298
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:58,880
I am interested to see who
replaced you at the top of the food chain.

299
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:07,458
You brought me here to talk to her?

300
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:08,250
You know each other?

301
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:11,360
I caught Arturo here mugging
pizza boys last year...

302
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,844
and taped him to a pole.

303
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,301
You gave me the impression running
the gang was a man's job.

304
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:17,438
It was.

305
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,859
- Hey, I don't have to be here.
- Sure, you do.

306
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,245
The law is coming down on you hard.

307
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:25,138
Lots of people think you're
responsible for the coach's death.

308
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:27,939
If it wasn't you,
tell me why I should believe it.

309
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,675
- '96 roadmaster.
- Is that some kind of code?

310
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,838
It's a car. Ten-year-old station wagon.

311
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,714
That's what the paper
said the coach was driving.

312
00:15:34,715 --> 00:15:37,537
You think we're gonna kill
a dude over an $800 crap-mobile?

313
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:39,845
Besides, guns?
It ain't our style.

314
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:41,615
So, what is your style?

315
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:46,208
Nail board on the road. Target hits it.
Tire goes flat. Pulls over.

316
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:50,352
And just as the dude finishes
changing the tire, we roll up.

317
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:52,463
Your average white dude in a BMW...

318
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:55,395
gets all jumpy when he's surrounded
by brown people on bikes.

319
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:57,323
They usually give up
the keys without us asking.

320
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:00,809
That all you wanted to know?

321
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,818
- That's it.
- Okay.

322
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:09,487
Find out who did it.
This dead coach is killing my business.

323
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,725
Are you sick?

324
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,041
No.

325
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:24,034
You want me to put highlights in your hair?

326
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,301
No.

327
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:31,205
Could you show me how
to hook up your Game Cube?

328
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:43,709
Ooh! That was so awesome.
Did you see that?

329
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:48,155
Yeah, if you're Daisy or Peach,
you can use a heart to protect you.

330
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:52,124
If I had this game,
I would play it every second.

331
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,337
We should have a tournament.

332
00:16:54,338 --> 00:16:56,969
Yeah, I'm beating you as Peach.
You need practice.

333
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,537
Your life is so cool.
You have this huge TV...

334
00:17:00,538 --> 00:17:03,372
with video games and a balcony.

335
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:06,315
- You live in Neptune.
- Yeah, it's Shangri-la.

336
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,252
My family comes to Neptune
every year for vacation.

337
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:13,101
Do you ever go to Zip's?
Best ice cream in the whole world.

338
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:16,145
- No, no. Amy's is better.
- It can't be.

339
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:18,103
It can. And it is.

340
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,770
I don't believe you.

341
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,119
Why should you be any different
than any other woman?

342
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,607
So, are you all sad about a girl?

343
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:33,198
Well, I guess so.

344
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,956
I don't guess you have
any extra-small clothes around?

345
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,467
I'm starting to smell like you.

346
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:53,849
Veronica, hey. Come on in.

347
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,772
Hey.

348
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:58,817
Can you show me the spot
where you found your dad?

349
00:17:58,818 --> 00:18:00,884
The cops already checked.

350
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:02,698
They didn't know what
they were looking for.

351
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:05,221
It's so weird that he's gone.

352
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,581
- Are you close to your dad?
- Yeah, very.

353
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:09,581
That's cool.

354
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,301
Were you close with yours?

355
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:18,666
It's funny. He was my best
friend and my worst enemy.

356
00:18:24,046 --> 00:18:24,755
Sheriff,

357
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:27,408
there's a kid who says he saw
something on the cliff the other night.

358
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,285
You say you saw something?

359
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,443
So, after the game, I was heading
to San Diego to see my girlfriend.

360
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:45,759
I'm heading down the PCH,
and I see the coach's car...

361
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,196
and the coach.
He was arguing with someone.

362
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:50,321
Did you see this someone?

363
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:52,903
I went by pretty quick,
but I got a good look.

364
00:18:52,904 --> 00:18:55,203
It was Josh Barry.

365
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:59,749
No pieces of board or motorcycle tracks,

366
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,179
but it's possible they
were erased by other cars.

367
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,761
It's weird. It...

368
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:15,405
looks like a car went off right here.

369
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:42,074
I don't get it.
Why would they push the car over,

370
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:43,693
I mean, if it was a carjacking?

371
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,691
Something's up.

372
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:58,204
Howdy, sheriff.
A kitten get stuck up in a tree?

373
00:19:58,205 --> 00:19:59,887
Not now, Veronica.

374
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:02,128
Josh Barry?

375
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:04,920
You're under arrest
for the murder of your father.

376
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:14,932
Is this your girlfriend?

377
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:19,484
- Mmm. Ex.
- She's pretty.

378
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:22,778
Is she? I hadn't noticed.

379
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:32,383
Where the hell are you?
You're supposed to be back.

380
00:20:32,384 --> 00:20:35,323
Guess what, dude.
I'm married!

381
00:20:35,324 --> 00:20:37,204
Get back here, man.

382
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:39,229
Dude, where's the love?

383
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,281
I'm on my honeymoon. God.

384
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,661
Where are you going?

385
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:49,186
Oh, a guy I was chatting with
online wants to meet me,

386
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:52,167
so he's gonna pick me up out front
and then take me to Zip's for ice cream.

387
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,452
Yeah, you're not going anywhere.

388
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,600
- Uh, yeah, I am.
- No, you're not.

389
00:20:56,601 --> 00:20:58,458
-You can't make me stay here.
- Heather-

390
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,916
Like I'd really go meet a guy
that I met online.

391
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:05,256
Nicely played.

392
00:21:08,262 --> 00:21:09,976
So, who was that on the phone?

393
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,341
Oh, just your brother-in-law.

394
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:20,937
So, how's it going?

395
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:23,134
The sheriff's a tool, but otherwise...

396
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:25,105
You find out anything?

397
00:21:25,106 --> 00:21:28,017
They found your dad's car
in the water below the cliff.

398
00:21:28,018 --> 00:21:29,890
Carjacking is off the list,

399
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:31,752
and that's not great for you.

400
00:21:31,753 --> 00:21:36,157
What? God, now with Mason,
it's like they're just lining up against me.

401
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:38,137
I... I don't understand.

402
00:21:38,138 --> 00:21:40,948
Is there any reason Mason
would lie about seeing you,

403
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:42,506
grudges or anything?

404
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:45,737
Just against my dad.
He lost the starting job a few games ago.

405
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,058
- Still...
- He's got a temper.

406
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,519
...and a gun, I've seen it.

407
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,280
At a party once, he was,
like, showing it off.

408
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:53,187
I told the sheriff. He didn't care.

409
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,522
No one believes me.

410
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,797
You believe me, don't you?

411
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,043
At Mars Investigations,

412
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:04,353
believing our clients is just one
of the many services we offer.

413
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:07,148
Is there anything I can get you?

414
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:10,419
I don't know. Something to read,

415
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:13,112
cookies, peanut butter if possible.

416
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:14,342
A hacksaw.

417
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:17,024
I can do reading materials,

418
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:20,456
but the sheriff personally
inspects all the food,

419
00:22:20,457 --> 00:22:23,004
and it rarely makes it back
to the intended inmate.

420
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:25,296
Well, I'll live.

421
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,133
Hi, is this maintenance?

422
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:32,374
Yeah, I was wondering
if anyone at your airport

423
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,250
refuelled a Gulfstream V last Friday.

424
00:22:37,096 --> 00:22:38,838
Yeah, that's right.

425
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:42,159
About what time did you see Mr. Stoltz?

426
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:49,128
Thank you.

427
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,183
I got your call.

428
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,721
Did I catch you at a bad time?

429
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:10,785
I'm afraid I was calling
to say I want off the case.

430
00:23:10,786 --> 00:23:12,109
I don't understand.

431
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:16,214
Mrs. O'Dell, I found eggshell under
the wiper blade of your Volvo,

432
00:23:16,215 --> 00:23:18,567
the car you were driving that night,

433
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:22,337
the same night his office was egged
by a bunch of disgruntled students.

434
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:25,589
No, Keith, I-I didn't leave that
hotel until just before dawn.

435
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,635
I have no idea how
eggshell ended up on the car.

436
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:32,654
I can only come up with one answer,
and it isn't one you'd like.

437
00:23:32,655 --> 00:23:34,525
But that's only half of it.

438
00:23:34,526 --> 00:23:37,193
I also discovered a mysterious call
on your cell phone

439
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:38,394
the night of your husband's death.

440
00:23:38,443 --> 00:23:39,443
You tracked down my cell phone bill?

441
00:23:39,444 --> 00:23:42,542
If you and Landry were together
all night at the Neptune Grand,

442
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:44,959
then why did you need to call
his cell at 1:32 in the morning?

443
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,069
I'm sorry. I don't know why.
It doesn't make any...

444
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:51,174
yes. I remember now.

445
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:54,506
Um, I ran down to the lobby
to get some toothpaste.

446
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:56,412
- And you called Hank?
- Yeah, it was for him.

447
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:59,906
One of his students works in the hotel,
and he didn't want to be seen by him.

448
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:02,104
I just wanted to know
what brand he used.

449
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:04,718
Hello?

450
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,165
Keith Mars, what can I help you with?

451
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:10,287
Well, as you know, Dr. Landry,
I'm working with Mrs. O'Dell

452
00:24:10,288 --> 00:24:12,082
to try to prove her husband was murdered,

453
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,983
and I was just trying
to tie up some loose ends.

454
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:18,217
The crime Is that you've taken
the case. Cyrus O'Dell killed himself.

455
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:20,847
You're simply taking money
from his grieving widow.

456
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:24,029
I appreciate your firm ethical stand.
I'll mull that over,

457
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,305
but in the meantime, I was wondering
why there's a cell phone charge

458
00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:30,278
between you and Mrs. O'Dell at 1:30 a.m.

459
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,556
I was led to believe the two of you
were together the entire evening.

460
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:35,243
As I recall, she called me
from the lobby asking

461
00:24:35,244 --> 00:24:37,472
what brand of toothpaste I preferred.

462
00:24:37,473 --> 00:24:40,580
I do hope that helps.
Now, if you excuse me, I have a class.

463
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:42,525
I appreciate your time.

464
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:46,248
Look, I can't explain the eggshell.
I wish I could,

465
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:50,789
but I need to know if you're still
working to find my husband's killer.

466
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,181
- You still want me?
- Well, you're digging,

467
00:24:53,182 --> 00:24:55,160
albeit in the wrong place, but...

468
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,610
it's more than I can say about
the sheriff's department.

469
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:02,509
Why is that girl your ex?

470
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:07,925
Because that's the nice thing you call
people when you stop dating them.

471
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:10,970
Well, why aren't you dating
if you still love her?

472
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,779
It's pretty obvious.

473
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:18,445
- Because I screwed up.
- How?

474
00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:22,022
I did something that
I shouldn't have done, okay?

475
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:26,336
- Well, did you tell her you were sorry?
- Yes.

476
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:29,929
Like, in a way so
she knows you mean it?

477
00:25:31,256 --> 00:25:33,076
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

478
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,652
I poured my heart out
to her on her voice mail,

479
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,892
and she never even called me back.

480
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:42,969
She's done.

481
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,176
Well, maybe you should try harder.
Call her again.

482
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:48,920
Well, you need to keep
your mind on the race.

483
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:50,780
You're not getting any better at this.

484
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:07,183
How are the ponies treating you, Reggie?

485
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:08,825
I'm still working here, aren't I?

486
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:11,209
What's up? You want me to check up
on your daughter again?

487
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,977
Just want to confirm a client's alibi
and I figured you'd be the guy to talk to.

488
00:26:14,978 --> 00:26:17,190
- What date are you looking for?
- December 10.

489
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:21,031
Oh, no can do, Keith. The hard drive
starts recording over itself after a month.

490
00:26:21,032 --> 00:26:22,711
That stuff's history.

491
00:26:22,712 --> 00:26:26,436
Hey, if you know their plates,
I could talk to my buddy who works valet.

492
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:28,668
They keep those records
in the computer forever.

493
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:36,364
Mason, hi. I'm Veronica, Wallace's friend.

494
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:38,462
Actually, I'm working with the Barrys.

495
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,983
Oh, yeah, he told me.

496
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:44,189
It's too bad. Looks like Josh's dad
pushed him too far, huh?

497
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,035
What did you tell the sheriff
you saw that night?

498
00:26:47,036 --> 00:26:50,427
Oh, just what I saw.
I was heading south on the PCH,

499
00:26:50,428 --> 00:26:53,021
saw the coach's car,
saw the coach, saw Josh.

500
00:26:53,022 --> 00:26:55,535
- They were arguing.
- Were they facing each other?

501
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:56,485
Yeah.

502
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:58,263
So, how did you see both?

503
00:26:58,264 --> 00:27:02,082
If you're coming this way and you see
the coach arguing with someone,

504
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:05,356
it sounds like that person's back
is to your direction of travel.

505
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:09,404
No, it was him. I saw his hair,
the Hearst basketball jacket.

506
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:12,602
And, yeah, I looked back and
saw his profile when I went by.

507
00:27:12,603 --> 00:27:13,997
It was him.

508
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:16,761
Josh suggested you've been
pretty upset with his dad

509
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:18,228
about losing your starting job.

510
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:22,189
You really think that I would kill my coach
because he wasn't starting me?

511
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,453
A woman in Texas hired a hit man to take out

512
00:27:24,454 --> 00:27:26,354
the mother of her daughter's
cheerleading rival,

513
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:29,958
so, you know, I'm pretty much
willing to consider anything.

514
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,369
Where do you keep your gun?

515
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:33,737
Man, screw you, okay?

516
00:27:45,828 --> 00:27:48,000
Did you suffer a blow to the head?

517
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,900
It's work. They're for Josh.

518
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,117
So, this means you believe him?

519
00:27:54,118 --> 00:27:57,033
I'm not sure. I certainly want
him to believe I believe him.

520
00:27:57,034 --> 00:28:00,551
Ahh, sneaky.
He may need some cheering up.

521
00:28:00,552 --> 00:28:02,477
I checked with Mason's girlfriend,

522
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:04,507
she confirmed he was with her
the night of the murder.

523
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:09,079
- Dad, do me a favour.
- Anything.

524
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:10,486
- Don't get murdered.
- Honey.

525
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:13,350
Because I couldn't live without you,
and all I've been doing is thinking about...

526
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:15,506
what I would do if I didn't have you.

527
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:18,635
Maybe you should let me
handle this case by myself.

528
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:21,040
You know that won't work.

529
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:24,057
I only brood when I'm not doing anything.

530
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,567
How did Mindy take it when you
told her you dropped the case?

531
00:28:27,568 --> 00:28:29,214
I didn't quite drop it.

532
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:35,297
She had an excuse for the
phone call that checked out.

533
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,324
I hit up my sources at the hotel,

534
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:39,222
but they don't keep
surveillance tape that long.

535
00:28:39,257 --> 00:28:44,062
Tell me again why you have a relationship
with Neptune Grand security.

536
00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:46,666
I may have learned something bigger.

537
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:51,603
According to valet records,
someone took out the Volvo at 1:51 a.m.

538
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,890
and returned it at 2:59 a.m.

539
00:28:53,891 --> 00:28:57,765
The witness said they heard the gunshot
somewhere between 2:20 and 2:30.

540
00:28:57,766 --> 00:28:59,477
- I know.
- So, it's one of them,

541
00:28:59,478 --> 00:29:00,935
Right? It has to be.

542
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:02,666
It doesn't have to be,
but it looks that way.

543
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:06,943
My relationship at the Grand doesn't have
access to registration receipts.

544
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,503
You know anyone over there who might
be willing to bend some rules?

545
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:12,732
Possibly.

546
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:24,082
Good evening, Logan's girlfriend.
Veronica, right?

547
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,455
That's... right.

548
00:29:26,456 --> 00:29:27,796
How can I help you?

549
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:31,070
- You remember Rory Finch.
- Your mystery guest.

550
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:32,114
Haven't seen him in a while.

551
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:33,115
Like, since December 10th?

552
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,578
Precisely. That's his last day.

553
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,355
Do you have a record of the charges
made to the room that night?

554
00:29:42,356 --> 00:29:44,638
Let's see.

555
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:49,409
They have a room-service charge,
crème brûlée just before midnight.

556
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:53,632
And then they started
a pay-per-view movie at 2:02 a.m.

557
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:58,458
I know it always says that the movie title
isn't listed on the bill, but...

558
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:00,032
you guys know, right?

559
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:03,794
So true. It was Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

560
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,502
You don't have any way of checking to see
who delivered the room service, do you?

561
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:12,253
No, but I know who works the graveyard.
His name's Jeff Ratner.

562
00:30:12,254 --> 00:30:14,454
They stuck him on the shift after
they busted him for stealing toiletries.

563
00:30:14,455 --> 00:30:16,440
Ratner, eh?

564
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:20,730
Come here!
You have to listen to this.

565
00:30:21,044 --> 00:30:24,119
I called KRAC like 200 times.

566
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
I kept getting this recording,
and then finally, I got through.

567
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:29,176
They're gonna play my request.

568
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:31,712
Uh, local calls are two dollars each.

569
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,679
I'm teasing.

570
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:43,939
I've got a dedication going
out from a very sad boy...

571
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,740
to a very special girl.

572
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:51,555
So, if you're out there and you're
listening, Veronica, this is from Logan.

573
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:54,294
He's sorry, girl,
and he wants you back.

574
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:57,116
# Now I'm broken
# And I'm faded

575
00:30:57,117 --> 00:31:01,758
# I'm half the man I thought I would be

576
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,205
# But you can have...

577
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:08,174
# what's left of me

578
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:17,499
Take it from the guy
who has to clean up after him.

579
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,147
You don't want what's left of Logan Echolls.

580
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:23,496
He just lies around in bed
all day and smells.

581
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,394
Jeff Ratner.
Just who I was looking for.

582
00:31:26,395 --> 00:31:28,191
Let's talk crème brûlée.

583
00:31:32,776 --> 00:31:34,502
I really wish you hadn't have done that.

584
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:36,150
You're gonna thank me.

585
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:38,281
Girls love that stuff.

586
00:31:38,282 --> 00:31:40,546
They like it when you make them feel
like they're a big deal,

587
00:31:40,547 --> 00:31:43,650
like you'd do absolutely
anything to be with them.

588
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:48,622
People in love shouldn't break up.
Giving up is just stupid.

589
00:31:59,688 --> 00:32:03,315
Okay, I'm starting to feel like
I'm living in a hamster cage.

590
00:32:03,316 --> 00:32:05,738
Is there a workout room or something?

591
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:07,755
Yeah, I'll show you.

592
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:09,303
This is the room.

593
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:12,145
This is where I brought the crème brûlée.

594
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:15,415
This is right where I was standing
when I heard the fight. Can I leave now?

595
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,415
A fight? What kind of fight?

596
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,482
People yelling at each other.

597
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:19,635
What were they saying?

598
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:21,328
You know, I didn't hold a glass to the door.

599
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:24,663
You'd be surprised what you overhear
working in a four-star hotel.

600
00:32:24,664 --> 00:32:27,180
I figured it was the wrong time
to deliver the crème brûlée,

601
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:28,781
so I left and came back later.

602
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:30,303
Who answered the door when you came back?

603
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:31,630
I don't know. Some lady.

604
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:33,223
- The one you heard yelling?
- No.

605
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,085
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm pretty sure.

606
00:32:37,086 --> 00:32:39,345
I heard two men yelling.

607
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:48,420
Getting in?

608
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,345
Hi.

609
00:32:58,546 --> 00:32:59,840
Hey.

610
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:05,181
Is that my shirt?

611
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:08,516
Yeah, she was out of clothes.

612
00:33:16,271 --> 00:33:21,182
It's her. It's her.
It's her, isn't it?

613
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:22,716
Oh, my God!

614
00:33:24,581 --> 00:33:27,880
Tell her!
Tell her how you feel.

615
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:28,772
Shut up.

616
00:33:29,488 --> 00:33:32,092
Excuse me, Miss Veronica?

617
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:36,946
Yeah, were you listening to super hits 98?
'Cause there was just this dedication.

618
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:39,371
Yeah, I, um, heard it.

619
00:33:39,372 --> 00:33:44,087
Well, it's true.
Logan's sorry, and he misses you.

620
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,917
And he wants you back.
And you two should get back together...

621
00:33:46,918 --> 00:33:49,457
- because he totally loves-
- This is our floor.

622
00:33:56,938 --> 00:33:58,321
Trouble in paradise?

623
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,854
I can't believe you blew that.

624
00:34:03,855 --> 00:34:05,921
That was the most perfect opportunity.

625
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:07,422
Why didn't you tell her how you feel?

626
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:09,227
Because I'm not eleven,

627
00:34:09,228 --> 00:34:10,674
and I'm not delusional.

628
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:14,562
You don't know a single thing
about love, Heather.

629
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:17,678
You know, it isn't writing someone's name
o-on the back of your notebook

630
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,679
and drawing a heart around it.

631
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:21,309
It is easy to be happy all the time
when you're eleven.

632
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,702
You talk to me about love
when you know something about it.

633
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:32,328
Knowing that Dr. Landry and Mrs. O'Dell
left the Grand in time to kill the dean

634
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:36,032
adds a whole new level of weirdness
to attending Landry's profiling class.

635
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,646
Miss Mars, can I talk to you for a second?

636
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:45,919
Good news. You've made it to
the second round of the FBI internship.

637
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,886
It seems that the feds were
as impressed with you as I am.

638
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:53,610
Oh. Great. Thanks for pushing me to apply...

639
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:54,991
and the raccomandation.

640
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,883
Well, I'm sure the dean's
letter didn't hurt either.

641
00:34:57,884 --> 00:35:00,530
- The dean's?
- I put a notice on the faculty blog

642
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,838
asking if anyone would want
to contribute an additional letter.

643
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:07,571
Cyrus...came through for us.
A copy of your application.

644
00:35:10,185 --> 00:35:11,670
Are you okay, Veronica?

645
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:14,033
Yeah. Fine.

646
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,078
It just reminds me of that
one scene from Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

647
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,201
Really?

648
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:21,710
Yeah, you know, after
Robert Downey Jr. dies,

649
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:23,411
Val Kilmer gets a message from him?

650
00:35:23,502 --> 00:35:27,610
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang?
Robert Downey survives the whole film.

651
00:35:27,682 --> 00:35:30,375
Oh, I must be confused.

652
00:35:31,803 --> 00:35:33,400
And you brought up the movie with him?

653
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:38,421
Yeah, and he was up on the details.
It sounds like he watched it.

654
00:35:39,022 --> 00:35:39,753
Dad...

655
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:43,449
Look at this.

656
00:35:45,115 --> 00:35:48,214
I guess Dr. Landry asked
Dean O'Dell to write me...

657
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:52,015
a recommendation letter for
the internship at the FBI.

658
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:56,787
"Dear Sir, in my twenty-five years
working in academia,

659
00:35:56,788 --> 00:36:00,461
I have not come across a young person
with more initiative,

660
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:02,954
intelligence, and character
than Veronica Mars.

661
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:08,042
I enthusiastically recommend her
and would be happy to discuss

662
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:11,043
this remarkable young woman
in greater detail.

663
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,350
Sincerely, Cyrus O'Dell,
Dean of Students, Hearst College."

664
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:20,036
I would have settled for,
"I find her nosiness charming."

665
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:21,860
Man had good taste.

666
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:26,203
Let's honour him
by putting his killer behind bars.

667
00:36:26,204 --> 00:36:27,793
Agreed.

668
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:39,164
Where are you?

669
00:36:39,165 --> 00:36:42,713
Hey, buddy. Got a question for you.
You know a good lawyer?

670
00:36:45,144 --> 00:36:46,581
I know A lawyer.

671
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:48,165
Good. I'm gonna need one.

672
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,566
Like, we're on the road.
We'll be home in a couple of hours.

673
00:36:50,582 --> 00:36:52,601
Wifey-poo wants to talk to you.

674
00:36:55,229 --> 00:36:57,108
Hey, Logan, is Heather doing okay?

675
00:36:57,109 --> 00:37:01,166
Yeah, is she ever not?
Is she always like this, so... bubbly?

676
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:03,524
That's kind of her new thing.

677
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:05,365
Well, she started acting weird
when our dad walked out.

678
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:06,966
I don't think she can get it
through her thick skull.

679
00:37:07,036 --> 00:37:08,996
It can really wear you out, huh?

680
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:12,906
Just make sure she takes her Prozac,
or she'll just drive you nuts.

681
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:21,082
Go away!

682
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,489
Well, now you made me
want ice cream, so...

683
00:37:27,156 --> 00:37:31,415
I'm going to Amy's.
Come with me if you want.

684
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:48,545
So, any progress on the case?
Your message sounded urgent.

685
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:50,245
Significant progress, I think.

686
00:37:50,246 --> 00:37:53,146
Mrs. O'Dell, what can you tell me
about Kiss Kiss Bang Bang?

687
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:55,376
Um, I can tell you it's a movie.

688
00:37:55,377 --> 00:37:58,028
- Is that it?
- Why on earth is this important?

689
00:37:58,029 --> 00:37:59,355
Because I heard that
was the movie playing...

690
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:01,556
in your hotel room
at the time your husband died.

691
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,072
Well, maybe Hank started it
after I fell asleep.

692
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:07,301
I also have the valet log showing
that your Volvo...

693
00:38:07,302 --> 00:38:09,602
was checked out roughly
thirty minutes before the murder...

694
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:12,546
and checked back in roughly
thirty minutes afterwards.

695
00:38:13,287 --> 00:38:14,799
No, then someone is framing me.

696
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,123
Who was in your room
with you that night?

697
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,449
- Hank, but you-
- Other than Hank.

698
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,052
No one.

699
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:20,157
A witness says he overheard
two men arguing loudly

700
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:21,258
at approximately midnight in your room.

701
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:25,162
- No. Then-then he heard the TV.
- I don't believe you, Mrs. O'Dell.

702
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:28,622
I don't need to listen to this.
You're off the case, Mr. Mars.

703
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:32,375
You can fire me, Mrs. O'Dell, but I'm afraid
you can't take me off the case.

704
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,580
I quite liked your husband.

705
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:45,017
Okay, this is better than the place
I used to go with my parents.

706
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:46,018
Well, with age comes wisdom.

707
00:38:46,987 --> 00:38:48,973
You know, you can play Mario Kart online.

708
00:38:48,974 --> 00:38:51,974
We should have a weekly game
or something, keep you sharp.

709
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:53,897
Quit flirting with me, old man.

710
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,439
I'm eleven.
Jeez. That's creepy.

711
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,541
- You called me a freak!
- I called your toes freakish.

712
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:01,442
I didn't call you a freak.

713
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:05,941
It's supposed to go big toe, little toe,
and then on down the line,

714
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:07,468
not big toe, bigger toe.

715
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:08,788
You really make me sick.

716
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:10,559
I make you sick? You're the freak.

717
00:39:10,594 --> 00:39:12,231
Ahh, newlyweds.

718
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,644
Where the hell have you been?

719
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,486
I've been waiting to go
for like twenty minutes.

720
00:39:16,332 --> 00:39:18,193
Get your stuff. We're going.

721
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:25,467
Fridays at four are good for me.

722
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:36,982
There goes the old ball and chain, eh?

723
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:37,969
I need a shower.

724
00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:44,564
Here you go,
sheriff-approved reading material.

725
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:50,486
I think you'll really enjoy the Dumas book.
It's quite chunky.

726
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:52,706
Thanks, Veronica.

727
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:58,011
I've been thinking it over.
It's Mason.

728
00:39:58,012 --> 00:40:00,839
Why else would he lie? It makes sense.
You got to find that gun.

729
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,132
Josh...

730
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:07,358
if he did do it, he probably
threw the gun in the ocean.

731
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,535
Yeah. You're probably right.

732
00:40:12,237 --> 00:40:13,866
Thanks anyway for the stuff.

733
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:15,198
Hang in there, okay?

734
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:45,902
- You coming?
- Let the learning begin.

735
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:48,601
You miss me?

736
00:40:52,228 --> 00:40:55,439
In all these cases,
the criminals operated for years

737
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,991
unsuspected within the
completely ordinary settings,

738
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:03,105
the classic, "he seemed so nice,"
"he kept to himself."

739
00:41:03,106 --> 00:41:08,302
Knowing the signs, we can identify
the criminal among us before...

740
00:41:08,337 --> 00:41:12,357
Oh, sorry, professor.
I need one of your students. Veronica Mars?

741
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:21,725
Miss Mars. You are under arrest...

742
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:25,412
for the aiding and abetting
of the escape of Josh Barry.

743
00:41:25,413 --> 00:41:27,934
You have the right to remain silent.

744
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:31,711
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

745
00:41:32,012 --> 00:41:34,430
