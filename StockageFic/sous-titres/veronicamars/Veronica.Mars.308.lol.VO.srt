1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,243
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:18,746
How many women like
me have to be raped,

3
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:21,169
have to end up like this,
their heads shaved,

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,775
before this administration
listens to our demands?

5
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:26,727
Shut down the fraternity houses!

6
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,203
Welcome to Zeta Theta Beta.
I'm Hallie. What's your name?

7
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:32,366
Veronica.

8
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,533
There's no question Claire
lied about the rape.

9
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,019
You're expelled from Hearst
College as of this moment.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,197
What the hell are you doing here?

11
00:00:38,398 --> 00:00:41,738
Three hundred points? Nice work.

12
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,908
Look, this is our business.
I don't have to apologize...

13
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:45,995
For being a rapist?

14
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:48,510
You should meet Chip.
He's president of the Pi Sigs.

15
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,837
This girl accused me
of rape last year.

16
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:52,821
Oh, you!

17
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:11,055
Goodness and kindness
are down on their knees,

18
00:01:15,323 --> 00:01:18,290
They're both begging,
"Won't somebody please"

19
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:19,837
Dude, come here!

20
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:25,417
"Put us out of our miseries"
"Before somebody else does the choking"

21
00:01:27,157 --> 00:01:29,823
Dude! It's Chip Diller!

22
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:34,637
Your portfolio was still in a former
editor's desk when I took over.

23
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:37,521
I understand you two had some
baggage but that's irrelevant to me.

24
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:39,714
I'll take a talented photographer
where I can find one.

25
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:41,195
Great. Thanks.

26
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:42,357
You free tonight?

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,736
Um... to take photos?

28
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:48,271
Yes. It's why you're here.

29
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:50,025
You know about the election?

30
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:52,159
The board of trustees...

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,802
is voting on a resolution to remove
the Greek system from Hearst.

32
00:01:54,837 --> 00:01:57,760
That's the one. Vote's tomorrow.
Tonight there's a reception,

33
00:01:57,761 --> 00:01:59,230
that's university speak
for "cocktail party",

34
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:00,518
for the Board of Trustees.

35
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,974
We need art.

36
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:03,437
Yeah, I can shoot it.

37
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:05,305
Bonus points if you get the
Dean wearing a lampshade.

38
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:10,519
But mostly we want pictures of our most
famous alum and board member, Selma Rose.

39
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:12,965
Selma Hearst Rose?

40
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,154
The very. Granddaughter of our illustrious
founder and heir to the Hearstmart fortune.

41
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:20,430
They polled all the trustees.
Word is, Selma's the swing vote.

42
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,240
My mom, California's last flower child,

43
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:25,022
loved her. She had a poster of her;

44
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:26,438
you know the shot I'm talking about?

45
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:29,064
Flying over Watts in '73,

46
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,745
dumping out sacks of cash,
her entire trust fund.

47
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:33,380
She's giving the thumbs-up,

48
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:36,094
huge smile on her face, while
millions rain down on the ghetto.

49
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:39,682
Well, she had her heart in the right place.

50
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:41,418
Riots ensued.

51
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:42,888
She was arrested when she landed.

52
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,209
Served a month in county jail.

53
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,761
Perhaps the most embarrassing case of
noblesse oblige in the twentieth century.

54
00:02:47,762 --> 00:02:48,612
Yo!

55
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:50,356
You guys pay for photos?

56
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:51,445
Sometimes.

57
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:52,127
Great.

58
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,181
I got your front
page right here.

59
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:56,931
Is that Chip Diller?

60
00:02:56,932 --> 00:03:00,332
President of the Pi Sigs
in all his glory. Yep

61
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:09,791
I'm off to steal the souls of the rich
with my evil image-capturing device.

62
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:10,687
Have fun.

63
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:12,702
Oh, and call Logan.
He left a couple messages.

64
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:13,781
I will.

65
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:15,103
Bye!

66
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:17,613
Wow, synchronicity.

67
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:20,189
Hey, there: tall, dark, and timely.

68
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,693
I've been trying to reach you all day.
Did you get my messages?

69
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:25,567
- I did. I'm sorry. I was gonna...
- We need to have a talk, a serious one.

70
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,037
Yeah, I got that from your messages.

71
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:30,325
That-it's why I haven't called.
I haven't had time to have a talk.

72
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:31,735
Well, then I'll make it quick.

73
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,078
I want you to stay
away from the rape case.

74
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:37,246
Okay? Just let it go. And it's clear
the rapist knows who you are.

75
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:39,933
He doesn't know about the hair,

76
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:42,118
just about the getting dosed part.

77
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,743
Well, maybe he should be
in the loop on this one.

78
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,105
Don't you dare.

79
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:48,105
Fine. Just stop digging around.

80
00:03:48,106 --> 00:03:49,716
Okay? No more looking into the serial rapes.

81
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:51,716
No more putting your nose
where it doesn't belong.

82
00:03:51,855 --> 00:03:55,352
My nose kind of belongs
wherever I decide to put it.

83
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:56,732
I'm worried about you.

84
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,848
I want you to stop now.
I'm not kidding.

85
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:01,355
Kind of a one-eighty, isn't it?

86
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:03,400
Can we rewind a week?

87
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,575
Cue it up to the part
where you were asking me...

88
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:07,503
to exonerate your Mexican
vacation buddy, Mercer.

89
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:09,093
That was before you were attacked.

90
00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:11,433
Why can't you for once
just leave things alone?

91
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,086
Okay, now you're
starting to piss me off.

92
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,761
Frankly, Veronica, so what?!

93
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:17,189
You're not invincible,
and you're not always right!

94
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,396
Hey!

95
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:21,284
You might want to stop
yelling at my daughter.

96
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:23,040
Yeah? You might want to start.

97
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,277
Dad, please, it's okay. He's
just worried about me.

98
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,336
Does he have a reason to be?

99
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,998
The Hearst rapist has everyone on edge.

100
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:38,138
Hey, you take care of yourself.

101
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:40,382
I'm always a phone call away.

102
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:42,032
I know you are.

103
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:43,866
Ciao papà!

104
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:55,598
Selma, who am I gonna tell?

105
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:58,351
How can I be the swing vote if you
know which way I'm going to swing?

106
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:00,970
Mind if I take a quick shot
for the Hearst Free Press?

107
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,676
Which one of my good
sides do you want?

108
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,657
I'm guessing the one without
the trail of Thousand Island.

109
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,891
You should really be nice to me.
I'm about to kiss your ass.

110
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:11,619
I want to thank you all for coming.

111
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:14,424
Hearst College is extremely fortunate...

112
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:16,918
to have such well-respected
members on its board.

113
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:22,290
And we're especially thrilled tonight to
add Selma Rose to our distinguished panel.

114
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:28,341
Since taking over the family
business two years ago,

115
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:33,780
Ms. Rose has step-by-step turned Hearstmart
into a leader in corporate responsibility.

116
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:38,106
Ladies e Gentlemen, I give
you Selma Hearst Rose.

117
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,988
Selma!

118
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,602
You're not waiting for me to
carry you piggyback, are you?

119
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,114
Selma.

120
00:05:58,355 --> 00:05:59,712
Foul play.

121
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:01,332
You think? What makes you say so?

122
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,919
An extremely wealthy woman disappears...

123
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:04,297
in the middle of a
reception held in her honour.

124
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:06,985
Don't you find that,
I don't know, odd?

125
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:08,624
Well, I mean, there's "odd"
and there's "foul play."

126
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,814
Rich ladies aren't the
most reliable creatures.

127
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:11,815
Of course,

128
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:14,693
she must have remembered her tennis
lesson. How silly of her to forget.

129
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:18,249
I don't suppose there's someone I can
speak with who would take this seriously.

130
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,479
Dollars to doughnuts,

131
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,503
you'll find her sobbing into a mojito
at the club because she lost an earring.

132
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:23,584
Well,

133
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:25,288
you'd be the doughnut expert.

134
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,771
Excuse me.

135
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,145
Veronica, I'd like to talk to your dad.

136
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:34,679
This man is no help whatsoever.

137
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:39,685
Beer off your belly,
hand out of your boxers.

138
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,781
Put on some pants.

139
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,322
I'm bringing home a visitor.

140
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:47,734
Okay, I love you. Bye.

141
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:12,588
I've known this woman
for almost twenty years.

142
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:16,770
If there's a microphone and an audience,
she's not going anywhere unless dragged.

143
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,268
You talked to her husband?

144
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,597
He's terrified.

145
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:21,604
I'm telling you, anyone who knows Selma...

146
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:23,498
knows something is seriously wrong.

147
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:26,841
Look, the Sheriff is an idiot.
I've met smarter sandwiches.

148
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:29,755
I'm afraid she's been kidnapped, Keith.

149
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:33,870
Hearst College has had riots,
rapes... and now abductions?

150
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,295
I need you to find her.

151
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:43,655
Veronica Mars

152
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:46,656
3x08 "Lord of the Pi's"

153
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:06,659
veronicamars.it

154
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:14,837
So, I'll do what I can on
the computer tonight...

155
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:16,505
and start with the
legwork in the morning.

156
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:17,621
Thanks, Keith.

157
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,813
Oh, one last thing.

158
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:22,060
One of the board members said he
saw Selma talking to a waitress

159
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:23,934
as I began my introduction.

160
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:25,842
He turned around as
I was calling for her,

161
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:26,962
and she was gone.

162
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:29,448
All right, we'll follow up on that.

163
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:31,222
Good night, Cyrus.

164
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,382
So, here's my thought:

165
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:39,580
I'll go talk to the family tomorrow, and
you talk to the waitress and the caterer.

166
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:42,809
Ah... high road, low road.

167
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,858
Got it.

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,632
So...

169
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:50,603
One of the board members said they saw...

170
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:53,341
Selma Rose talking with a
waitress before she disappeared.

171
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,393
I was hoping to get the names
and numbers of your waitstaff.

172
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:57,979
Who are you again?

173
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,829
Veronica... Mars.
I'm working for the Dean.

174
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,457
You can call him if you want.

175
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:06,425
Well, if it was a waitress
and not a waiter,

176
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:07,854
then you only need one name.

177
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:10,143
There was only one girl working last night.

178
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:15,575
Hey, Fern. What up, girl?

179
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:17,956
What do you want, Buffy,
Tiffany, whatever your name is?

180
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,596
"The female voice in Celtic literature."

181
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:22,551
I am woman, hear me bore.

182
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:25,507
I heard you had a little chat
with Selma Rose last night,

183
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:27,144
right before she disappeared.

184
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:28,170
Can I guess?

185
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:30,065
She was contemplating a nose ring?

186
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,853
I was letting her know she had a phone call.

187
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,124
Who was calling for her?

188
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,482
I don't know. Some woman.

189
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:36,144
The phone was ringing off
the hook in the kitchen.

190
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,226
It was driving me up
the wall, so I answered it.

191
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:41,376
Someone wanted to speak to Selma Rose
and I was nice enough to relay the message.

192
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:43,331
You didn't ask who was calling?

193
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,431
I didn't care.

194
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:45,887
You know what's funny,

195
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:47,480
and not like funny "ha ha,"

196
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:50,694
a driving force in getting the
Greeks kicked off campus,

197
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:51,579
that's you,

198
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,107
is the last person seen speaking
to the trustee with the swing vote.

199
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,697
You know what else is kind of funny?

200
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:57,698
The girl who saved the Pi Sigs...

201
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:00,821
is apparently leading the charge
to track down that swing vote.

202
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:04,008
I wasn't saving the Pi Sigs,
I was getting to the truth.

203
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:07,551
Well, the truth is that your Pi Sig
friend just kicked off "Sex Quest '06."

204
00:10:07,552 --> 00:10:08,973
You know what that is, freshman?

205
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:11,927
Yeah, they award themselves
points for getting laid.

206
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,517
Just watch what you drink.

207
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,790
Mr. Mars. Sorry to keep you waiting.

208
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,791
What is that?
Is that a goldfish?

209
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:44,669
It's a carp, a golden carp awarded...

210
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:46,272
Please don't touch it.

211
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:47,880
My name is Brant.

212
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,258
I am Mr. Rose's personal assistant.

213
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:54,276
Unfortunately, Mr. Mars, my employer
won't be able to see you at the moment.

214
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:55,554
He's resting.

215
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,735
I believe he's expecting me.

216
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,919
Mr. Rose is understandably distraught,

217
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,084
as I'm sure you can... understand.

218
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:02,867
I've been hired to find Mrs. Rose.

219
00:11:02,868 --> 00:11:05,463
I'm sure Mr. Rose will want to
do everything possible to help.

220
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,737
Of course he does.

221
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:08,827
But as I mentioned,
he's not available at the moment.

222
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:09,928
Brant!

223
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:11,418
will you stop harassing our guest?

224
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:12,419
Bring him in here.

225
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:20,439
- Mr. Rose, this is...
- Yes, Brant, thank you, I know.

226
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,271
- Can I get you...
- No, just some privacy, please.

227
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:31,514
I'm sorry about Brant.

228
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:35,476
He, uh, he tries to protect me from,
well, just about everything, actually.

229
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:38,011
Do you have any news
about my wife yet?

230
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:39,277
I'm sorry. Not yet.

231
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,110
Cyrus fears she's been... kidnapped.
Is that what you think?

232
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:45,217
Right now, it's a missing-person case.

233
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:48,362
There's no ransom note.
No reason to jump to that conclusion.

234
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:50,013
No, no, right. I know. I know.

235
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:52,809
I should be stronger about all this.

236
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:56,868
Has your wife had any business problems
that, uh, you might be aware of?

237
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:59,278
Selma's always having business problems.

238
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,907
She's had to fight the board tooth and nail
for every bit of reform she's brought about.

239
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:06,842
I'm afraid I-I don't know much
about the business anymore.

240
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:09,751
Her brother Roger's flying in later today.

241
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:12,430
Um, he was coming in
for a meeting anyway.

242
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:14,818
He'll be taking care of the
company in her absence.

243
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,089
It would be helpful to speak to him.

244
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,247
Oh, yes, of course.

245
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:20,659
I'll have Brant give you
the number to his assistant.

246
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,515
She flew in yesterday.

247
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:26,096
He likes to call her his "advance team."

248
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:29,308
Well, she's worse than Brant, actually.

249
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:34,841
Please let me know if I can be of
any further assistance, Mr. Mars.

250
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:39,092
Terrifying, aren't they?

251
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:46,419
Nice car. Yours?

252
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,466
No. That belongs to the
grossly overpaid dog walker.

253
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:52,874
I should get his name.

254
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:54,392
It's a she.

255
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:05,967
Guess who's on the phone for you.

256
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:09,199
Someone who wants to sit on hold
while you play stupid games.

257
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,214
Martina Vasquez.

258
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,019
Martina Vasquez.
The h-hottie from Channel 9?

259
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,029
Said she had a few questions
about Selma Rose's disappearance.

260
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,853
Put her through for me?

261
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:23,727
Martina Vasquez.

262
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:33,535
Miss Vasquez, what can I do for you?

263
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:38,845
Well, I am here to help in
absolutely any way that I can.

264
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:41,427
By the way, I caught
your most recent piece on...

265
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:42,912
MARTINA'S LATEST TOPICS

266
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:43,913
uh... the morning-after pill.

267
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:46,768
It was... informative.

268
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:50,360
Well, thank you, Sheriff,
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

269
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:53,973
We've learned that Selma
Rose received a phone call...

270
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:55,386
before she went missing.

271
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:58,100
Have you learned who
the call was from yet?

272
00:13:58,101 --> 00:13:59,318
Actually, Martina,

273
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,567
we checked that out,
and it was false information.

274
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:04,639
There was no record of
an incoming call that night.

275
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,607
You are sure?

276
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:09,501
Yeah, if you'd like, I can keep you
in the loop with this sort of stuff.

277
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:10,618
Hello?

278
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:11,915
Dad, I'm on the phone.

279
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,803
Oh, sorry, honey! Let me
know when you're off.

280
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,009
Sheriff...

281
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:19,564
you were saying you'd be
able to keep me in the loop?

282
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:24,411
I'm off!

283
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,276
The Pi Sigs are doing
their "sex quest" again.

284
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:33,839
Collecting points for conquests?

285
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,020
Think that's such a good
idea at a university...

286
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:38,802
with a serial rapist on the loose?

287
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:41,304
You raise an uninteresting point.

288
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:44,870
But, hey, don't worry your
pretty head about your pal Dick.

289
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:48,073
My points are in order, courtesy
of Miss Bonnie Capistrano.

290
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:51,919
Her curvature of the
spine is hardly noticeable.

291
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,324
But I still got the handicapped bonus.

292
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,975
You're repugnant, Dick.

293
00:14:55,976 --> 00:14:58,011
Seriously, you'd hardly notice it.

294
00:14:58,276 --> 00:15:00,339
Ever stop to think that...

295
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,082
the Pi Sig's "sex quest"
might be connected...

296
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:05,459
to your Pi Sig president
getting his head shaved,

297
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,725
like it's a warning?

298
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:08,496
Or retribution or something?

299
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:11,467
Actually... that kind of makes sense.

300
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:15,412
Okay, I'm so not supposed
to be telling you this,

301
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:18,173
but it's... way too good.

302
00:15:18,174 --> 00:15:20,402
So, not only did Chip get Kojaked,

303
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:23,150
someone put a Roman numeral on one
of those little plastic Easter eggs...

304
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:26,363
and stuck it in his
where-the-sun-don't-shine place.

305
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,107
And you know where that is.

306
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:32,791
Worst Easter egg hunt ever.

307
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,952
Not a banner day for Chip Diller.

308
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,000
He had to get one of the brothers
to help unpack his suitcase.

309
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,356
What was the number?

310
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:45,097
What?

311
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:47,261
You said there was a Roman
numeral in the Easter egg.

312
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:48,613
You're missing the point.

313
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,408
They put it up his bleedin' bum.

314
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:55,343
Which speaks to the number
being significant, don't you think?

315
00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:56,398
I guess.

316
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,913
I don't know what the number is.

317
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,494
It wasn't a baby shower.

318
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:01,762
We didn't all sit around waiting
for him to open the egg...

319
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:02,973
so we could see what he got.

320
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:04,703
Do you know what he did with it?

321
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:07,868
If it's not in his hope chest,
I'm thinking he threw it out.

322
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:09,805
When is your garbage collected?

323
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,985
And you think I'm "repungent."

324
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:14,437
Yes, Dick. Yes, I do.

325
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:16,044
The garbage truck comes Friday morning.

326
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:19,670
Morty the homeless dude comes Thursdays
to pull out the bottles and the cans.

327
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:21,498
I can't tell you if they
recycle "keister" eggs.

328
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:28,482
Why are you following me around?

329
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:31,683
Fulfilling my gym requirement.
Yoga had a written final.

330
00:16:31,684 --> 00:16:33,709
So, it turns out...

331
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,892
there was no record of an incoming
call the night of Selma Hearst's reception.

332
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:40,079
Well, maybe the call came from
another extension in the building.

333
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,180
You ever think of that?

334
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:44,815
Just one more thing.

335
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:49,975
When you stick an Easter egg
in a frat boy's "out" door,

336
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,165
do you kiss him first?

337
00:16:52,524 --> 00:16:53,587
Is that a riddle?

338
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:58,200
Poor Chip. You really "wrecked him."

339
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,992
Ba-dum-bum.

340
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,638
Morty, my man!

341
00:17:15,257 --> 00:17:19,446
So, this is my friend Veronica.
Veronica, Morty. Morty, Veronica.

342
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,597
This might sound like a
strange proposition but...

343
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:27,750
while you're down there...

344
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:38,228
What the hell, Bonnie?!

345
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,036
That's exactly what I was thinking.

346
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:42,437
Another cute frat boy.
What the hell?

347
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:44,438
You realize you're worth,
like, half the points now.

348
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,875
You went from top shelf...

349
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:47,893
to bargain basement
in, like, three seconds!

350
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,063
It was more like the
third-floor bathroom,

351
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:52,022
to the pinball machine in, like,

352
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:54,041
forty-seven minutes.

353
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,230
She always gets a replay.
Never tilts at all.

354
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:07,815
Got it.

355
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,861
Aah. The incredible, inedible egg.

356
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,868
Selma's fine. Trust me.
I know my sister.

357
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,941
This is her just flaking out. Again?

358
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:26,269
Why is it doing that blinking thing?

359
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:29,778
She's probably wrapped in algae
somewhere outside of Santa Fe

360
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,879
with a couple of cucumber
slices on her eyes.

361
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,680
If she decided to "flake," as you put it,

362
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,981
don't you think the middle
of her reception is an odd time?

363
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,039
Oh, it's the perfect time,

364
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,662
right before she had to make a decision.

365
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:43,564
Doesn't sound like the behaviour of the
top executive of a Fortune 500 company.

366
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:45,785
Oh, my sister's not a businesswoman.

367
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:47,102
She's a humanitarian.

368
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:48,966
Not a big profit margin there.

369
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,234
Have you seen what Selma's
disappearance has done to our stock?

370
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:53,335
I haven't.

371
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:55,536
It's skyrocketing every
day that she's missing,

372
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:59,237
just on the assumption that we'll continue
to sell merchandise manufactured in Asia.

373
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,814
Selma wanted Hearstmart to deal
only American-made products,

374
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:05,766
which - here's a
hot tip - we won't.

375
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,874
I still don't have
anything from Evan.

376
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,275
I've left four messages for him.

377
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:11,676
And a fifth would kill you?

378
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:16,219
My guess? She probably took off
to get some time away from Budd.

379
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:18,336
Word is she's already talked to a lawyer.

380
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:21,209
Your sister was considering
getting a divorce?

381
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,510
Since the accident, Budd has
become more and more clingy.

382
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:26,611
He follows her around like a pull toy.

383
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:28,649
At this point, she probably
cares more about her dogs,

384
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,650
than she does her husband.

385
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:31,610
I wouldn't be surprised
if she left everything...

386
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:33,578
to little Ernest and Julio in her will.

387
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:36,323
Evan!

388
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:38,610
They glued "travel Scrabble" tiles?

389
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,111
"CXI" and "CMIII."

390
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:43,246
Inside a plastic Easter
egg and stuck it...

391
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:44,347
Halfway to China.

392
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:46,513
I'm never going on another
Easter egg hunt again.

393
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:48,114
And I'm never playing Scrabble again.

394
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:52,808
In Roman numerals...
it's 111 and 903.

395
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:55,226
And, for better or worse,
you're my numbers guy,

396
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,219
so... go.

397
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:01,739
- What am I doing?
- Telling me what these numbers mean.

398
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,640
They mean we got
some twisted sickos here.

399
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:06,641
Anything else I can help
you with, that's free of charge.

400
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:07,331
Come on.

401
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,164
It's one digit short
of a phone number.

402
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:10,860
It could be a locker number.

403
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,943
- Why would someone stick an egg...
- That's what I'm trying to find out.

404
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:15,811
Ooh, driver's-license number.

405
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,286
Check number?

406
00:20:17,545 --> 00:20:19,245
- Just one egg, right?
- Wallace.

407
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,870
Maybe it's a student ID number.

408
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:26,271
Brilliant.

409
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:36,505
No. One too many digits.

410
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:39,120
It's almost like you don't want to help.

411
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,985
Hold the phone.

412
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:52,691
Six. It's a date.

413
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:54,604
It's almost exactly three years ago.

414
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:56,347
Three years and two days.

415
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:02,030
Closed library?

416
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:03,933
Not to the help-desk girl.

417
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:04,934
To me it's wide-open,

418
00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:08,400
with all it's lovely back issues
of the Hearst Free Press,

419
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,641
just waiting to tell me...

420
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:13,199
if something significant
happened on campus on 11/19/03.

421
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,822
Theta Beta pledge
falls off house roof

422
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:28,610
Patrice Pitrelli falls off
sorority house roof?

423
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:20,097
Morning.

424
00:22:20,732 --> 00:22:21,783
Yes, it is.

425
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:25,800
It came a little bit earlier
than I would have liked.

426
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:30,106
So, I ran the plates for
the Roses' dog walker.

427
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:32,958
You want me to go check her out?

428
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,185
Size her up? Shake her down?

429
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,186
If you wouldn't mind.

430
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,421
Lucky for you...

431
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:39,740
I can do that in my sleep.

432
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,252
You're blocking my sun.

433
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:57,065
Oh, is that yours? I'm so sorry.

434
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:01,500
Oh, my God, Hallie.

435
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:05,096
Are you, like, so totally worried
about your missing boss?

436
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,319
I know she had the power to kick
you and your sisters off campus,

437
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,140
but you must be, like, a
basket case and a half.

438
00:23:12,427 --> 00:23:15,948
Your face is getting a little
pinkish. You should flip.

439
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:23,434
I'm Selma Rose's
dog walker. So?

440
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:26,521
You having a job?
Shock right there.

441
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:28,871
It requiring that you wear a
plastic bag on your hand...

442
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:30,942
while waiting for Fido
to kick out a lodger?

443
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:33,323
That makes me dizzy.

444
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:35,387
You don't know the first
thing about me, Veronica.

445
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:38,825
I know like eight,
possibly nine things.

446
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:42,790
But you're right.
I have no idea which one is first.

447
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:46,591
Is it that you're a Theta Beta
that'd do anything for her sorority?

448
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,592
You think I had something to do
with Mrs. Rose's disappearance?

449
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,793
Perhaps.

450
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:53,637
If there's anyone you should be
concerned about, it's that guy Brant.

451
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:54,928
Mr. Rose's assistant?

452
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:56,987
He's, like, in love with Mr. Rose,

453
00:23:57,022 --> 00:23:58,033
like Swimfan love.

454
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:00,696
He won't let anyone talk to him.
He follows him everywhere.

455
00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:04,597
At one time, Mr. Rose was taking a nap,
and I saw Brant stroking his hair...

456
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:06,598
so completely creepy.

457
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,249
Ugh. Oh! And just a couple weeks ago,

458
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,412
Mr. Rose asked him to help him
with an anniversary party for Mrs. Rose,

459
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:13,700
and Brant threw a teacup at the wall.

460
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:16,438
I mean, the guy's been
married for ten years,

461
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:17,439
and Brant thinks he's
going to switch teams

462
00:24:17,802 --> 00:24:19,630
for a sorry, teacup-throwing ass?

463
00:24:19,631 --> 00:24:20,744
I don't think so.

464
00:24:21,184 --> 00:24:25,977
- That's very helpful, Hallie.
- Uh, yeah. 'Cause it's the truth.

465
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:27,672
And sharing the truth is good.

466
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:30,577
I say we ride that honesty
wave all the way home.

467
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:34,079
Side question: what do you
know about Patrice Pitrelli?

468
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,180
God! What's with all the questions?

469
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:38,581
What's next? Do you want to know
where I buried Jimmy Hoffman?

470
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,076
Dustin's brother?

471
00:24:42,323 --> 00:24:45,090
I don't know who you've been talking to,
but nothing happened with Patrice.

472
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:48,091
I mean, I didn't go here yet,
but my sisters told me everything.

473
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:50,696
She had one too many hard
lemonades and she fell off the roof.

474
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,635
That's it.

475
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,093
No one did anything to her.

476
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:56,094
I didn't suggest anyone did.

477
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,995
Did Patrice claim someone
did something to her?

478
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:01,684
No, it's all lies.
Ask anyone in her pledge class.

479
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,870
That's an excellent
idea, Hallie. Thank you.

480
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:05,750
So what happened after she fell?

481
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:09,098
Nothing! It's not like
she died or anything.

482
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,982
Oh, and speaking of,
you'll be happy to know.

483
00:25:11,983 --> 00:25:13,713
Karen? Our den mother?

484
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:17,576
We had a car wash and raised enough
money for another round of chemo.

485
00:25:18,993 --> 00:25:21,336
Stay sweet, Veronica. Bye.

486
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:30,145
I don't know about you, but I
am dripping with information.

487
00:25:30,146 --> 00:25:34,046
And I have so much information,
I have no place left inside for food.

488
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:35,447
Spill.

489
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:41,348
Hmm. Roger Hearst is halting
Selma's "Buy American" plan, hmm?

490
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:43,749
It'll save the company
hundreds of millions, but

491
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,850
it is exactly the kind of business
practice Selma is fighting against.

492
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:51,551
Hmm, suspicious?
Hmm, I think so. Hmm.

493
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:56,052
Well, I rattled that sorority girl's cage,
and she sang like a canary.

494
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:58,453
She thinks that guy Brant is a wack job.

495
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:00,354
Well, he's not a big fan of hers either.

496
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:04,855
Apparently, Brant is the Smithers
to Mr. Rose's Monty Burns.

497
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:09,256
There are tales of hair-stroking,
Swimfan-ian-like love.

498
00:26:09,257 --> 00:26:11,680
Mr. Rose asked for help with
his ten-year anniversary party.

499
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:12,793
Brant's response?

500
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:14,858
Throwing a teacup.

501
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:17,007
A ten-year wedding anniversary?

502
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:19,647
Have I taught you nothing?!

503
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:24,383
What do we call a tenth
anniversary in the P.I. biz?

504
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,584
"Dine 'n' ditch."

505
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,251
After ten years of marriage,

506
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,205
a spouse is entitled to
half of his partner's assets,

507
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:32,486
so you cut the cord before ten
years, you don't have to pay.

508
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:33,987
But she's the one with the loot.

509
00:26:33,988 --> 00:26:35,127
That's my point exactly.

510
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:37,143
The brother says the
marriage is in trouble.

511
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:39,176
You think the husband had her...

512
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:41,729
you know... crrk!

513
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,390
That's one extreme possibility.

514
00:26:44,391 --> 00:26:45,891
Yeah, what's the other?

515
00:26:46,192 --> 00:26:47,420
Play a hunch?

516
00:26:48,286 --> 00:26:51,456
Brant said Selma's dogs are
the children she never had.

517
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:54,949
If Budd's trying to,
say, keep her hidden,

518
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,725
I bet she'll be a lot quieter
with her kids around.

519
00:27:01,893 --> 00:27:04,085
This is just like that time
we went to Disneyland!

520
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:06,944
If I have another altercation
with Snow White...

521
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:08,309
and her disapproving dwarfs,

522
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,057
you're taking Sneezy this time.

523
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,823
Okay.

524
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:14,680
Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na!

525
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,762
The park is closed.

526
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:20,009
The walrus out front
should have told you.

527
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:28,201
Honey, stealthy, remember?

528
00:27:28,202 --> 00:27:30,027
Right! Sorry.

529
00:27:37,696 --> 00:27:40,161
You are not going to
find this anywhere else.

530
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:43,059
This is one of the
top-rated bagless...

531
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,556
vacuum cleaners on the market...

532
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:47,088
On the market today,
and if you call right now,

533
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,414
you're not only going to get
the upholstery attachment,

534
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:50,619
but we are going to give you the...

535
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,810
Mrs. Rose?

536
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:54,816
Are you all right?

537
00:27:54,995 --> 00:27:58,264
I'd be better if you'd close the
door and didn't try to rescue me.

538
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:06,179
Mrs. Rose, my name is Keith Mars.
I'm a private investigator.

539
00:28:06,805 --> 00:28:08,949
Cyrus O'Dell hired me to find you.

540
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:13,257
Poor Cyrus. He can't get
anything right, can he?

541
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:15,652
You were at the reception.

542
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:18,190
This is my daughter, Veronica.
She works with me...

543
00:28:18,191 --> 00:28:19,374
occasionally.

544
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:21,158
Ryan. Tatum.

545
00:28:22,093 --> 00:28:23,900
When he gets in a jam,
I make with the cute.

546
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,466
Well, you can tell Cyrus I'm safe.

547
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:28,861
Well, can I tell him how you wound
up missing in your own guesthouse?

548
00:28:30,978 --> 00:28:32,535
Are you in some sort of trouble?

549
00:28:32,923 --> 00:28:34,925
I will be if you tell anyone you saw me,

550
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:36,899
so I would appreciate it if you didn't.

551
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,166
I can appreciate it
monetarily if that's necessary.

552
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,204
It isn't.

553
00:28:41,312 --> 00:28:44,647
I'm already being paid by someone
who's extremely concerned about you.

554
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:48,054
Well, how about I tell you my story...

555
00:28:48,055 --> 00:28:50,730
and you find a way to let
Cyrus know I'm okay,

556
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:51,822
without giving me up?

557
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:52,860
No promises.

558
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,638
He's afraid you've been kidnapped.

559
00:28:54,947 --> 00:28:56,711
Nope. No kidnapping here.

560
00:28:56,712 --> 00:28:59,246
Just good old-fashioned blackmail.

561
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:01,623
My husband knows about my lover,

562
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:04,970
and he's demanded I "disappear"
until after our tenth anniversary.

563
00:29:04,971 --> 00:29:06,448
The dine 'n' ditch.

564
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:08,586
What? He'd only wind
up with ten million...

565
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:09,809
instead of a hundred?

566
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,934
Something like that.

567
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:13,320
Look, I've just got two days to go.

568
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:15,271
You could stall Cyrus that long.

569
00:29:15,272 --> 00:29:17,891
But why make you disappear?

570
00:29:18,138 --> 00:29:21,277
Why not just wait to make
you sign the divorce papers...

571
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:23,630
until after the ten-year anniversary?

572
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,219
I wish I knew.

573
00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:26,708
I know!

574
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,911
Your brother is killing your
"Buy American" plan.

575
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:34,110
He's negotiating with
southeast Asian companies.

576
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:37,125
In a few days, your company
will be locked in the contracts.

577
00:29:37,126 --> 00:29:38,672
Your stock's going through the roof.

578
00:29:38,673 --> 00:29:42,444
Budd stands to make
millions more in a 50-50 split.

579
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:43,545
What a bastard.

580
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:44,612
Hey. Veronica.

581
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:45,626
She's right.

582
00:29:45,627 --> 00:29:48,055
Our marriage was great
until after his accident.

583
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:49,882
Suddenly, he had something to prove,

584
00:29:49,883 --> 00:29:52,578
and having sex with as
many women as possible...

585
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:54,182
was, apparently, the way to do it.

586
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:56,207
You know, I'm sorry if this is out of line,

587
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,671
but plenty of couples
have split over infidelity.

588
00:29:58,672 --> 00:29:59,895
I'm sure you can find a lawyer...

589
00:29:59,896 --> 00:30:01,631
who could get you out
of this less expensively.

590
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:04,541
Have you ever been a
walking punch line, Mr. Mars?

591
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:06,569
I mean, on a national scale?

592
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:07,907
Actually...

593
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:09,256
Because I've been,

594
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:12,018
and I've spent the rest of
my life trying to earn back...

595
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,660
a certain measure of respect.

596
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:18,862
This would put me
back at square one.

597
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,376
Hallie?!

598
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,833
So you've met.

599
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:28,611
She called me out of the
reception and broke the news.

600
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:31,200
She didn't love me.
She seduced me for Budd.

601
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:33,842
They're going to run away
together and live off my money.

602
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:35,836
Maybe we can fix
this another way.

603
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,204
Were you wearing those earrings
the night you went missing?

604
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:39,249
I was.

605
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,905
And do you have access
to Bud's e-mail accounts?

606
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:43,570
So the plan's in motion?

607
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,009
As we speak.

608
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,126
We found the perfect
eyewitness to the "kidnapping."

609
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:49,794
That's not me, is it?

610
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,533
Whatever happened to
"winter, spring, summer, or fall;

611
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:55,228
all I got to do is call,
and you'll be there"?

612
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:59,657
Man, all my orifices
just went on lockdown.

613
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:11,794
Here comes Peter Cottontail

614
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:14,836
Hoppin' down the bunny trail

615
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:18,870
Hippity-hoppity Easter's on its way

616
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:29,150
Hey! Hey! Stop!

617
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:40,754
Who needs a spanking?

618
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:48,747
It's okay, Veronica.
It's okay. I'm here to help.

619
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:50,527
What the hell is going on?!

620
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,829
Just calm down, all right?

621
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,223
Mr. Echolls has been
concerned about your safety.

622
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:56,062
I've been hired to keep an eye on you.

623
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:04,281
Sheriff, hey.

624
00:32:04,282 --> 00:32:06,652
This man came in,
wanted to file a report.

625
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:09,953
He claims to have seen Selma
Rose the night she went missing.

626
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,274
That guy?

627
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:12,647
Yeah.

628
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:14,709
Said he saw her having a fight
with a girl from the college.

629
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,881
I got him looking at a
Hearst yearbook right now.

630
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,234
Found her!

631
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:30,794
Oh, my God.
Was I, like, speeding?

632
00:32:30,795 --> 00:32:32,080
'Cause I so didn't know.

633
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:33,257
No, no, no. You were fine.

634
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:35,288
Oh, okay.
I didn't think I was.

635
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:36,999
I'm gonna need you to
step out of the vehicle.

636
00:32:37,898 --> 00:32:39,540
SEARCH WARRANT AND AFFIDAVIT

637
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:47,505
I have spent the last few
days being terrified...

638
00:32:47,506 --> 00:32:50,781
that I had some whacked-out
rapist following me!

639
00:32:50,997 --> 00:32:52,047
Look, I had the same fear.

640
00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:53,546
So you pay someone to tail me?

641
00:32:53,547 --> 00:32:56,768
No, so I asked you to stop
putting yourself in danger,

642
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:58,172
and you told me to piss off.

643
00:32:58,173 --> 00:32:59,729
Then I hired someone to protect you.

644
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,478
You had no right to do that.

645
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,456
Look, that's probably true, okay?

646
00:33:03,457 --> 00:33:05,095
It's just I don't care.

647
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:07,938
You don't care?

648
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:10,949
Look... I don't give a
rat's ass if it's right or fair.

649
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,234
I don't care if you're angry.
I care that you're safe.

650
00:33:13,235 --> 00:33:16,857
That's all sweet and great, but
it doesn't really work that way.

651
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:20,638
It's not like this is all some
new facet of my personality.

652
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,378
You know who I am!

653
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:23,451
You know what I do.

654
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:24,452
And?

655
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:26,198
And... it isn't gonna change.

656
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:28,003
And if you can't accept that,
this isn't gonna work.

657
00:33:28,004 --> 00:33:29,888
You know who I am.

658
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:33,577
And you're constantly
expecting me to change.

659
00:33:35,006 --> 00:33:37,925
And even right now, as you're
thinking, "crap, he's got a point,"

660
00:33:37,926 --> 00:33:40,562
you still think you're ultimately right.

661
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:44,656
I love you, Veronica.

662
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:48,638
I love you.

663
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,239
But, do you love me?

664
00:33:57,664 --> 00:33:58,682
Yeah.

665
00:34:00,364 --> 00:34:02,799
Well then, can we try to go a
little easier on each other?

666
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,686
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

667
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:10,916
So, are we okay?

668
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:15,340
Yeah... we're okay.

669
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,125
Can I help you?

670
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:24,126
Yes.

671
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:25,127
You can move out of my way.

672
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:28,382
Brant, who is it?

673
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:32,111
Oh, is this about Selma?

674
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,548
H- have you found her?

675
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:35,769
No, sir, we didn't find your wife.

676
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,193
We did find one of
her earrings, though.

677
00:34:37,194 --> 00:34:39,211
It was in your girlfriend's car.

678
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:41,944
We also found love letters
from you on Hallie's laptop.

679
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:43,952
I can see why you like her so much.
She's a very sweet girl.

680
00:34:43,953 --> 00:34:45,053
Not very tough, though.

681
00:34:45,054 --> 00:34:47,645
She said we should take a
look in your guesthouse.

682
00:34:51,064 --> 00:34:53,275
Cute, young girlfriend,
rich, older wife.

683
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:55,260
I'm kind of shocked I'm not
investigating a murder.

684
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,712
Look... you can keep on
talking all you want.

685
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:02,181
But, I'm not saying one more
word until my lawyer gets here.

686
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,694
Uh, Mrs. Rose is hoping for a
moment alone with her husband.

687
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:19,739
Was Roger in on it, or were you just
counting on him to do the wrong thing?

688
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:22,205
He is reliable that way.

689
00:35:25,794 --> 00:35:27,667
An early anniversary present,

690
00:35:28,013 --> 00:35:30,382
unless you had your
heart set on prison.

691
00:35:33,774 --> 00:35:34,928
I'm grateful for your help,

692
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:36,939
but a little surprised
I didn't get a discount,

693
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:38,563
repeat customer and all.

694
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,180
I didn't charge you for the
photocopies or the stamps.

695
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,298
Oh, that was nice.

696
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,544
Who knew the cavalry
would be so handsome?

697
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,023
Don't be nice to me, Selma.
It'll ruin everything.

698
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:51,426
I'm on my way to vote.

699
00:35:51,427 --> 00:35:53,171
Fate of the Greeks
in my hands, and all.

700
00:35:53,172 --> 00:35:54,180
How are they faring?

701
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:55,580
I know it's a difficult decision.

702
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:57,854
My official vote is "screw 'em."

703
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:58,975
They're out of here.

704
00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:14,944
I know you think I'm some kind
of gold digger, but I love Budd.

705
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:16,573
And all of his beautiful money?

706
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,863
Or is true love so blind
you didn't notice...

707
00:36:18,864 --> 00:36:20,913
he's an adulterer
older than your father...

708
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:22,309
and confined to a wheelchair?

709
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,587
Budd Rose is more of a man than
you could ever begin to handle.

710
00:36:24,622 --> 00:36:27,369
Slow down, Anna Nicole.
You're skeeving me out.

711
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,327
And the fact is I don't care
if he's Ron Jeremy on wheels.

712
00:36:30,328 --> 00:36:33,073
You want to impress me?
Tell me the truth about Patrice Pitrelli.

713
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:35,218
I told you. I didn't go here then.

714
00:36:35,253 --> 00:36:36,958
Besides, Patrice's best
friend in the whole world...

715
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:37,959
just faked a rape.

716
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,098
Why aren't you picking on her?

717
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:40,555
Patrice was friends with Claire?

718
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:42,774
Yeah, they were in
the same pledge class.

719
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:49,322
What did Chip Diller
have to do with...

720
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:52,718
Patrice Pitrelli falling off the
roof of the Theta Beta house?

721
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:55,503
Come in. We'll enlighten you.

722
00:36:55,695 --> 00:36:56,772
Who's "we"?

723
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:59,268
Look who just showed
up asking about Patrice.

724
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:01,228
Veronica Mars.

725
00:37:01,229 --> 00:37:03,898
Well, I'm impressed with your
tenacity, if not your politics.

726
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,993
I can die happy.

727
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:07,951
What did you hear about Patrice?

728
00:37:07,952 --> 00:37:09,914
She fell off the roof of
the Theta Beta house.

729
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:11,166
She didn't fall.

730
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:12,886
She walked right off.

731
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,130
Why?

732
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,914
Finally, a smart question.

733
00:37:16,504 --> 00:37:18,357
The Theta Betas used
to take some pledges...

734
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:20,282
to a secret room where
they'd have them undress.

735
00:37:20,283 --> 00:37:22,203
Are you still trying to sell that?

736
00:37:22,204 --> 00:37:24,979
I've been there. There is
no two-way mirror.

737
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,155
Then they panelled over it.

738
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:27,177
I saw it.

739
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,289
The rush officer would have the
girls strip in front of the mirror.

740
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,528
Then they'd point out the parts
that they thought needed work,

741
00:37:33,529 --> 00:37:35,110
like they were being helpful.

742
00:37:35,111 --> 00:37:37,090
They'd circle them
with a magic marker,

743
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:39,521
like a plastic surgeon
does during a consultation.

744
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:40,522
They did that to you?

745
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:41,981
No.

746
00:37:41,982 --> 00:37:45,163
They only did it to the girls
who they thought needed help.

747
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,179
And Patrice needed help.

748
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,037
They practically
covered her in circles.

749
00:37:49,038 --> 00:37:52,104
I mean, she was pale
and pudgy, but a legacy.

750
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:55,190
She was already crying when someone
turned on the light in the secret room.

751
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,569
And there they were.

752
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,100
A crowd of Pi Sigs
laughing their asses off.

753
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:02,558
Chip Diller started
calling her "marshmallow,"

754
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,714
and the name stuck.

755
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,141
They used permanent marker.

756
00:38:05,142 --> 00:38:07,815
So not only does she have to
deal with being called "marshmallow,"

757
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,719
she had those marks
all over her for weeks.

758
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:13,154
The sorority sisters kept telling
her a tan would fix everything.

759
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:16,002
They kept insisting she lay on
the roof with the rest of us.

760
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:17,728
But she was still all marked up.

761
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:21,071
She surprised us one day
by walking out on the roof.

762
00:38:21,072 --> 00:38:23,001
But instead of plopping
down on a towel,

763
00:38:23,102 --> 00:38:25,407
she just strolled right off the edge.

764
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:27,707
What happened to her?

765
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:29,588
She was in the hospital
for a couple of months.

766
00:38:29,732 --> 00:38:31,535
Now she's in a
mental-health facility.

767
00:38:34,642 --> 00:38:35,785
You don't believe it?

768
00:38:35,786 --> 00:38:37,402
Oh, I believe you.

769
00:38:38,246 --> 00:38:39,700
And I think it's horrible.

770
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:42,940
I also think it's...

771
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:46,371
powerful motivation for someone
to take desperate action.

772
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,001
Fake a rape, right?

773
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,328
Possibly a series of rapes.

774
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,447
How many of them were real?

775
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:59,915
I mean, other than Chip Diller's.

776
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:03,224
There hasn't been
any forensic evidence;

777
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:05,930
no semen, no hair found
on any of the victims.

778
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:08,312
The Greeks would be gone if
you hadn't gotten them off.

779
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,553
Are you proud of that fact?

780
00:39:09,554 --> 00:39:11,999
The moral superiority
would fit better...

781
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,765
if there wasn't already one
fake rape on your résumé.

782
00:39:15,922 --> 00:39:18,406
Nothing hurts the
cause more than that.

783
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,253
You know I'm right.

784
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,117
I'll show myself out.

785
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:35,070
Wine, wine, wine

786
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:42,970
One or two won't do

787
00:39:44,084 --> 00:39:46,646
'Cause I want it all

788
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:57,386
And I hope
I hope

789
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:03,902
Hope you know what I'm thinking of

790
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,365
I want all of your love

791
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,830
