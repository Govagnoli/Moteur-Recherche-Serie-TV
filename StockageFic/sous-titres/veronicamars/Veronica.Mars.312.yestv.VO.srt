1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,387
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:02,388 --> 00:00:05,688
I didn't kill Cyrus, Keith.
Neither did Hank Landry.

3
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:09,190
- But someone did.
- I'll take the case.

4
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:11,535
You tell my ex-wife I own her now.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,692
No more talk of alimony,
no more child support.

6
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:17,693
We're beyond even.

7
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:20,017
Tim Foyle?
This can't be good.

8
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:22,667
That's it, Bonnie.
I've had enough!

9
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,471
Logan and I hooked up in
Aspen over the holidays.

10
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:29,579
I guess you two were split, huh?

11
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,776
I don't want you to go.

12
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,776
I wish I didn't have to.

13
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:00,882
Hello?

14
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:02,959
Either you're affecting
a sexy phone voice

15
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,499
or you even make "hello" sound good.

16
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,053
What time is it?

17
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,034
I've got to go. I'm late for work.

18
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:13,676
Work, right.

19
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:15,270
Are you sure you're
not getting a body wrap...

20
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:16,767
and a blow out for
our fancy date tonight.

21
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:20,903
You got me. I better haul ass if
I want to fit in that brow shaping.

22
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:23,109
- And Veronica?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,623
Don't go changing.

24
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:27,365
See you later.

25
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,575
Oh, I've changed.

26
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:32,484
From the girl who slept,
to one who doesn't.

27
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,333
Closing my eyes means popping in
the Madison tape and pressing play.

28
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:43,755
Veronica?

29
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:45,974
Bonnie!

30
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:47,100
Can we talk?

31
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:48,569
Sure.

32
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,550
Tim's talked about you.
A lot.

33
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:54,834
Affectionately, I'm sure.
So what can I do for you?

34
00:02:58,314 --> 00:02:59,809
I got pregnant.

35
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,298
and someone slipped me RU-486.

36
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:06,140
- RU...
- It causes a miscarriage.

37
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,923
And I want you to
find out who it was.

38
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:14,238
Veronica Mars

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,239

Synchro: Camilla, Michele [veronicamars.it]

41
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:35,144
Vieni a trovarci!

42
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:39,145
veronicamars.it

43
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:46,606
The miscarriage,
you're sure it was intentional?

44
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:48,068
I didn't think so at first,

45
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,325
but then the doctor saw
that I had this weird rash

46
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:52,215
and that my hands and feet were numb.

47
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:56,116
He said it looked like I was having
an allergic reaction to the RU-486.

48
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:58,400
I told him I didn't take any.

49
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:01,015
He did a blood test. Confirmed it.

50
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:03,855
I'm so sorry, Bonnie.

51
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:08,084
I'm looking for the least
rude way to ask you...

52
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,150
if you know who the father was...

53
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,538
And that's what I came up with.

54
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,223
It was Tim.

55
00:04:14,224 --> 00:04:15,456
Or Dick.

56
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:19,240
Fair enough. So, did Tim or
Dick know about the baby?

57
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,389
They both did.

58
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,010
At first I was just so freaked out,

59
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,761
I didn't even think I
wanted to keep the baby.

60
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,234
I went to Dick and asked if
he'd help pay for the procedure.

61
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:29,801
How did that go?

62
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:33,562
He said he'd pay...
after I got a paternity test.

63
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:35,834
Yeah. He's a classy dude.

64
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:38,600
But Tim has been so sweet.

65
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,519
I mean, he is just so
great in crisis mode.

66
00:04:40,602 --> 00:04:41,871
You two are back together?

67
00:04:41,872 --> 00:04:45,353
Right. I forgot you saw the
famous Pi Sig-party fight.

68
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:48,976
I felt awful. I just left Dick
at the party to go see Tim.

69
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:52,290
I had to beg.
But he forgave me.

70
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:56,369
Excuse me for asking,
but why Tim?

71
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,465
It'll sound twisted,
but Tim takes care of me.

72
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,838
He's like my dad that way.

73
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,591
Okay, then. So how did Tim react
in the moment you told him?

74
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:11,675
I didn't tell him. He found out.

75
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,159
We got back to my place one night,

76
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,375
and there was this balloon
bouquet from my parents.

77
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,728
"Congrats from Grandma and Grandpa"

78
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:24,509
Any other guy would have lost it,
but Tim offered to marry me.

79
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,169
Your parents sent balloons?

80
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,397
Turns out our family doctor's not
the firmest believer in the whole...

81
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:31,740
doctor/patient confidentiality.

82
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:34,349
Which, um...

83
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,818
kind of changed the equation in
terms of keeping the baby or not...

84
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:41,356
'cause my parents are pretty religious.

85
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:46,410
And then, you know,
Tim wanted me to keep the baby.

86
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,975
I'll see what I can find out.

87
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:52,912
Just please, Veronica,
don't let Tim know I hired you.

88
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:57,963
I would feel horrible if he even thought
for a second that I didn't trust him.

89
00:06:04,517 --> 00:06:06,405
Jeans! Bold choice.

90
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:08,737
I hope the maitre d' is fashion-forward.

91
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:12,132
Did you and Madison have sex
during winter break?

92
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:20,417
- I asked you point black.
- And I lied.

93
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:25,281
Point-blank. It wasn't information
that you had a right to know.

94
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:27,482
I knew you wouldn't be able to
deal with the Madison thing.

95
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:28,760
Which thing are you talking about?

96
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,068
The "she roofied me" thing

97
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,094
or the thing when I stumbled
to my car in the morning,

98
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:36,154
wondering where my virginity was,

99
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,248
and she'd written "slut"
on my windshield?

100
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:40,542
Was that what you thought
I couldn't deal with?

101
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:42,752
I am so genuinely sick right now.

102
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:46,280
If I could have eaten anything today,
I'd be throwing up all over your floor.

103
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,774
We were broken up at the time.

104
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,378
You know how I feel about her.

105
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,660
There's no way that, at some
point while it was happening,

106
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:58,272
that you weren't thinking about
how much I'd hate you being with her.

107
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:01,509
- It wasn't like that.
- No? Do you want another variation?

108
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:05,927
'Cause I've got a million sickening
scenarios running on a loop right now.

109
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:08,525
- I wasn't trying to hurt you.
- Oh.

110
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:10,939
Really? Imagine if you tried.

111
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,918
What do you want me to do?
What can I do?

112
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:19,459
Make it not true?

113
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:24,351
Get it out of my head and never
let me think about it again?

114
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:28,033
'Cause...

115
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:29,964
unless you can do that,

116
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:33,965
this is something
I'm never getting past.

117
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:46,964
Hello Mr. Mars!

118
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:50,616
I was out dog-walking, and I thought
of a question I wanted to ask.

119
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:53,209
- You know we're only ten blocks away?
- No, I didn't.

120
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,324
I thought I'd save myself a phone call.

121
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:58,008
There seems to be a discrepancy
in the police report

122
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,660
concerning your husband's death.

123
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:02,588
I mean, knowing the sheriff,
I'm sure it's a mistake.

124
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:03,487
What did you find?

125
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:07,397
It says a minivan was parked in Cyrus'
spot the night he was killed

126
00:08:07,398 --> 00:08:10,149
My daughter told me he
normally drove an old Volvo?

127
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,877
He did. The minivan's mine.
We traded cars for the weekend.

128
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:18,775
Cyrus needed the van to haul his son's
drum kit around while I was out of town.

129
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:20,902
Would you like some coffee?

130
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:23,565
Oh, I'm afraid he wouldn't stand for it.

131
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,132
In another thirty seconds, he's gonna
pull my arm out of the socket

132
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,310
if we don't get moving.

133
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:32,070
But, uh, thanks for the info, and, uh,
I'll keep you posted on what I find.

134
00:08:35,032 --> 00:08:37,343
The best way to forget
about your own problems?

135
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:39,274
Dive into someone else's.

136
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:45,318
So, Bonnie Capistrano tells me you
knocked her up and blew her off.

137
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:47,793
Yeah, whatever happened with that?

138
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:52,794
You do your hair like that to cover up
the three sixes on your scalp, right?

139
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:56,679
I told her to get a paternity test.
I'm not here to help her turn a profit.

140
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,309
I just feel like you have this...

141
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,133
wadded-up Maxim magazine where
your heart is supposed to be.

142
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:06,740
Oh, I'm heartless?
First Duncan, now Logan.

143
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:09,708
You're running out of rich
bachelors' heads to mess with.

144
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:11,974
Is it some kind of weird sport for you,

145
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:13,970
you know, breaking dudes' hearts?

146
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:17,225
What, you put another
notch on your lipstick case?

147
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:20,016
Logan slept with Madison
when you guys were in Aspen.

148
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:24,584
And?

149
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,842
Sorry, Dick, I probably shouldn't have...

150
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:34,605
What, me worry?
Can we be done?

151
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:36,021
I've got things to do.

152
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:39,832
Redheaded things. Nadia!

153
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,565
There's my big, dumb blonde.

154
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:50,565
It must be a liberating thing not to
be cursed with a moral compass.

155
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,054
Hi! Is Bonnie here?

156
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:57,567
She's still at class.
You're Veronica?

157
00:09:57,776 --> 00:09:59,155
Bonnie told me about you.

158
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:01,169
I'm Bonnie's roommate, Phyllis.
Come on in.

159
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:05,885
Wow!

160
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:07,607
Raiders of the Lost Dorm room!

161
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,495
Oh, yeah. God, Bonnie would love that.

162
00:10:10,496 --> 00:10:13,430
Her dream is to be the
female Indiana Jones.

163
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:17,424
She can spend three hours
watching a documentary on
people digging up a tooth.

164
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:20,704
So... you know what happened to Bonnie?

165
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:23,542
Yeah. Bonnie and I have been
best friends since seventh grade.

166
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:25,972
Not much happens in our
lives that we don't share.

167
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,694
What do you think about
Bonnie getting back with Tim?

168
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:32,090
I hated the arrogant little toad
from the first time she introduced him.

169
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:34,250
Don't hold back, Phyllis.

170
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,164
I've kind of turned a
corner on Tim, though.

171
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:38,991
The boy came through in the clutch.

172
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,685
He found out about the baby,
and he stepped up.

173
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:45,593
He bought her What to
Expect When You're Expecting.

174
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:47,346
He got her, like, prenatal vitamins.

175
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,305
So he was handing her pills?

176
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:51,701
- Could he-
- There's no way it was Tim.

177
00:10:51,702 --> 00:10:53,620
He offered to marry her.

178
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:55,266
He was gonna talk to
her dad and everything,

179
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:57,270
and you know how
intimidating that would be.

180
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:59,637
Yeah, Bonnie said her
family is pretty religious.

181
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:02,146
- Do you not know about her dad?
- Should I?

182
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:09,774
$5,000...

183
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:14,233
...and if there's only one thing
you got to remember,

184
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,341
- There's Papa Capistrano.
- it's this...

185
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,342
He's on all the time.

186
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:21,868
- God may hate the sin, but god loves you.
- Amen.

187
00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:25,044
- Say it to yourself. God loves you.
- God loves you.

188
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:29,571
Bonnie's a preacher's daughter.
How very Footloose.

189
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:35,236
Unless Tim was able to convince a
gynaecologist he was a pregnant female,

190
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:38,149
I'm betting he scored the RU-486 online.

191
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,782
If I can't question Tim,

192
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,201
maybe his computer will
give me some answers.

193
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:48,010
Sometimes when things don't work
out the way a girl wants them to,

194
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:51,551
there's nothing quite as
satisfying as the hissy fit.

195
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:57,233
Oh, I hate this stupid day!

196
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,029
Are you okay?

197
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:09,172
No.

198
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:13,184
This is, like, the worst
day ever of my entire life.

199
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:17,726
I was supposed to meet my brother
at his office, and he's not here.

200
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:21,913
And he's not picking up his cell,
and he's not even my brother anyway

201
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:26,088
because my parents just
told me I'm adopted.

202
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,879
- Is this his office?
- Huh, huh.

203
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,602
Thanks. You've been so helpful.

204
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:53,670
It's so much easier letting the
twitch of a man's lip tell you...

205
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:58,319
he's guilty than relying on him to not
empty the cache on his hard drive...

206
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:02,005
or trying to figure out his password.

207
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:03,583
Onto plan B.

208
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:17,171
The only thing worse than being up all
night obsessing over Madison Sinclair

209
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,794
is knowing how much she'd enjoy it.

210
00:13:22,164 --> 00:13:26,607
If I have to see this one more time,
I'm having my frontal lobe removed.

211
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:33,827
Good. You're up.

212
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:35,828
I've got a little conundrum.

213
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:39,829
Nish says she egged the dean's Volvo
on campus the night he was murdered.

214
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,762
Mindy says she had the Volvo parked
at the Neptune Grand all night.

215
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:46,269
Any guess on who's lying?

216
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,250
Both of them? I don't know.

217
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:51,673
Your lack of opinion concerns me.

218
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:55,134
Logan and I broke up. Again.

219
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,189
My idea this time.

220
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,555
Ah, I'm sorry.

221
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:01,501
- You doing okay?
- No.

222
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:03,324
No, no, no, no, no.

223
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,644
Good night.

224
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:18,925
I'm in a hurry, Veronica.

225
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:22,717
I know you enjoy screwing with me,
but it's kind of losing its charm.

226
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:24,297
I have no idea what you're talking about.

227
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:26,536
I checked my grade online.
It said I got a B.

228
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:27,679
You and I both know I got an A.

229
00:14:27,714 --> 00:14:30,608
I entered an A. You were looking
at someone else's grade.

230
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:32,586
Like I didn't look carefully.

231
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:35,495
Either you did this on purpose,
or you messed up the entry.

232
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,991
Why didn't you print out
a grade report, hmm?

233
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:46,190
I shouldn't have to.
I should have the grade I earned.

234
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,362
Veronica.

235
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:49,258
Yes?

236
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:53,098
My space... your space.

237
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:04,340
Ah, here it is. An A,

238
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,306
Like I said.

239
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:08,336
Huh.

240
00:15:08,337 --> 00:15:11,063
Maybe I was looking at
someone else's grade.

241
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:18,867
If there is a justification for my
actions right now, it's this:

242
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:20,801
I have gone completely crazy.

243
00:15:20,802 --> 00:15:23,057
When I'm lying in bed and I can't sleep

244
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:25,706
because of visions of Madison
and Logan rolling around.

245
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:26,741
She wins.

246
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,719
When I've got her in my sights,
I'm in control.

247
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:45,003
How does it empower you, Veronica,

248
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:48,927
to know Madison brings her laundry
home from USC each weekend?

249
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:52,631
Shut up, sane Veronica.
I'm in charge now.

250
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:02,482
Surprise!

251
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,936
Aah! Oh, my god!

252
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,401
And watching her get a new
Mercedes for her birthday...

253
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,709
very healing.

254
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,897
At least it's reminded me that
I need to buy Mac a present.

255
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:15,337
Oh! Thank you!

256
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,975
Gotzmine.

257
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:24,593
You win, crazy Veronica.
She's all yours.

258
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:54,476
My space... your space.

259
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:02,678
His password is "Dick Tracy"?

260
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,713
Aw. That is adorable.

261
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,400
Okay, Tim,

262
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:15,122
let's see where were you
browsing three weeks ago?

263
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:21,974
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

264
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:27,068
Neptune clinic?

265
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:29,910
Whoa.

266
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:31,783
O'Dell - suicide?

267
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:34,675
Tim's investigating the dean's death?

268
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:36,377
Forensics - Suspects - Witnesses

269
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:40,591
Anthony Martin?

270
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:44,091
There's no Anthony Martin
mentioned in the police report.

271
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:46,564
Earwitness.

272
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,311
Heard shot while walking
home from Pi Sigma party.

273
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:50,458
Witness was drunk.

274
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:52,161
Couldn't determine time of death.

275
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:04,700
FOR A GOOD
TIME CALL...

276
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:15,423
Did you hook up with Madison?

277
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,751
I did.

278
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:21,844
It just happened, you know.

279
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,334
I didn't think you had any
feelings left over her.

280
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:29,129
It's still uncool.

281
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,973
You don't do that to a buddy.

282
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:34,317
And by the way,

283
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:36,981
you laying in here
in the dark is pathetic.

284
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:46,873
I have an appointment to discuss
my options at the clinic Tim contacted.

285
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:50,162
In the meantime, a little spiritual
advisement wouldn't hurt.

286
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:52,205
GODZLUVV

287
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:55,770
Exhibit A on why I don't
trust TV preachers.

288
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:11,601
Carl, did you pack up those TCP forms?

289
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:13,895
Can I help you, miss?

290
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,665
Sorry, it's kind of personal.

291
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,248
Well, if you're here to see if
your skirt is long enough,

292
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:22,983
the answer is "no."

293
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:25,156
Ah,

294
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:26,415
I'm an old fogy.

295
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,668
Actually, you know, you kind of
caught us at a bad time.

296
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,818
What is it, Thurman?

297
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:32,068
It's nothing, Ted.
This young lady was...

298
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,392
Hester.

299
00:19:33,393 --> 00:19:35,529
I was hoping you could help me.

300
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:37,935
I can always try.

301
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:40,396
So...

302
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:41,921
what can I do for you?

303
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:44,557
I'm pregnant,

304
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,207
and now I don't know what to do.

305
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:51,099
Well, I can't imagine you
came in here thinking that

306
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,291
I was going to say anything other than...

307
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:54,604
that you should keep your baby.

308
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:57,466
Yeah, I guess.

309
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:58,308
Just...

310
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:02,121
my parents will never understand.
They'll disown me.

311
00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:04,746
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure about that.

312
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:07,361
The promise of a grandchild
is a powerful thing.

313
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:09,327
Yeah, if I were thirty.

314
00:20:09,328 --> 00:20:12,644
I'm sure you wouldn't be thrilled if your
teenage daughter came home pregnant.

315
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:14,800
Well...

316
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:19,797
Actually...

317
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:21,346
I was.

318
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,090
My daughter is about your age,

319
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,132
and she became pregnant.

320
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,335
You know what her mother and I did?

321
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:33,845
We celebrated.

322
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:38,481
But our desire to meet our grandchild...

323
00:20:38,482 --> 00:20:42,748
far outweighed any regrets about
the circumstances of the pregnancy.

324
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:50,048
Maybe your parents will surprise you.

325
00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:55,464
Reverend Ted?

326
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:57,260
I'm... I'm sorry.

327
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:01,745
She lost her baby.

328
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:09,229
So...

329
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,649
You think your friend was slipped RU-486?

330
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,124
Yeah, and this is the only
place to get it locally.

331
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,528
That's an awful story.

332
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:20,169
I'm thinking it could be one of the guys
she thought might be the father.

333
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,911
Is there any scenario...

334
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:26,008
where a guy could come in and say
it was for his wife or girlfriend?

335
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:27,135
Not on my watch.

336
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:30,737
So, if a girl comes in and
says she wants RU-486...

337
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:33,560
She would take it here in the office.
No exceptions.

338
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,440
Is it possible...

339
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:39,159
for someone to hide it under her tongue

340
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,800
or palm it,

341
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,441
make it out of here with the pill?

342
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:44,878
I guess. Anything's possible.

343
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:49,274
Is there any way you could tell me...

344
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,670
who came into the clinic
between Thursday-

345
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:57,230
You don't really expect
me to say "yes," do you?

346
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,815
- Had to ask.
- Okay.

347
00:22:00,747 --> 00:22:01,891
NEPTUNE WOMEN'S CLINIC

348
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:02,662
Hello?

349
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,770
Anthony. Just the guy
I wanted to hear from.

350
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:09,900
I am absolutely a good time.

351
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:11,978
So, if I understand correctly,

352
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:14,057
you got pretty blitzed
at the Pi Sig party,

353
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:16,238
and you wandered back
to your dorm room late.

354
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:19,604
You passed the administration building,
and that's when you hear the gunshot.

355
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,930
That about sums it up.

356
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:21,981
Why didn't you report it?

357
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:23,885
Report what?

358
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:25,068
A guy shoot himself,

359
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:27,965
I read it in the paper the
next day, and I was like,

360
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:29,601
"oh, that's what that was."

361
00:22:29,602 --> 00:22:30,961
Besides...

362
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:34,936
I don't need another alcohol
infraction on my record.

363
00:22:36,627 --> 00:22:39,823
So, how did Tim Foyle find you?

364
00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:41,610
Is he a friend of yours?

365
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:42,923
Never met the guy.

366
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:46,887
I guess I told a bunch of people
when I realized what I had heard.

367
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:48,231
It must have gotten back to him.

368
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,446
How'd you find out?

369
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:52,702
I found out from Tim.

370
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:54,844
So, what did he want to know?

371
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:56,506
You know. What I heard,

372
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:57,642
what I saw,

373
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,478
and what time it was.

374
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,609
And what did you tell him?

375
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,874
I didn't see anything, I heard a gunshot,

376
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,560
and I had no idea what time it was.

377
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:07,561
Okay.

378
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:09,189
Well, if you think of anything...

379
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:11,898
Wait!

380
00:23:13,347 --> 00:23:14,616
I just remembered.

381
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,751
I turned on Space Ghost.

382
00:23:18,752 --> 00:23:21,062
Terry Jones was the guest.

383
00:23:21,063 --> 00:23:23,587
They went on about spam.

384
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:30,119
According to the website,
they re-run Space Ghost at 2:30.

385
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,149
It probably takes ten
minutes to stumble from

386
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,118
the administration building
back to the dorm.

387
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:49,027
Oh, you sought me out.

388
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,803
That can only mean one thing.
You need a favour.

389
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:54,770
Is it a favour if it's something
we both would enjoy?

390
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:57,765
Remember you told my
criminology class about

391
00:23:57,766 --> 00:23:59,974
how you stole some guy's
car and had it crushed?

392
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:01,534
Yeah. Why?

393
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:05,938
Maybe I was thinking about having
someone's car stolen and crushed.

394
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:09,091
Oh. What happened?
You broke up with Logan?

395
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:11,460
Good for you.

396
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:14,734
I'd be happy to have Logan's car crushed.

397
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:15,949
What's he driving?

398
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,197
Not his.

399
00:24:17,198 --> 00:24:19,598
A little Mercedes at this address.

400
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,116
You can't miss it.
The plates read "gotzmine."

401
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:25,013
Wow. I'm surprised somebody
hasn't crushed it already. Whose is it?

402
00:24:25,014 --> 00:24:26,782
Madison Sinclaire.

403
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:28,785
From high school... I remember.

404
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:32,085
She lost a hubcap and told the
principal I stole it for drug money.

405
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:35,044
So, you want her car cubed or-

406
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:37,041
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, no problem.

407
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,777
And the next time I need some literature
compared, I know you'll be there for me.

408
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:40,882
Okay.

409
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:45,493
Now, this has nothing to do
with you and Logan, right?

410
00:24:45,494 --> 00:24:46,832
Did I come here for therapy

411
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,746
or to get a car stolen and cubed?

412
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,028
"Gotzmine," huh?

413
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:54,638
Yeah. I have been wondering
if I still have the touch.

414
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:58,329
And, uh, it's gonna cost you five hundred.

415
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,074
That is the going rate, isn't it?

416
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:05,692
- Hey dad!
- Hey honey.

417
00:25:05,693 --> 00:25:08,554
So, I found out something
on the O'Dell case.

418
00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:11,541
There was a guy who heard
the shot around 2:20.

419
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,423
What?

420
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:16,700
Is there anything maybe
you want to tell me?

421
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:17,776
About what?

422
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:21,898
Well, I found this in our mailbox today.

423
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:29,618
"Dear Sir, the enclosed
photographs were taken...

424
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:33,228
at Neptune Women's Clinic,
which performs abortions."

425
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:41,978
I can't believe these people.

426
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:44,770
They sit up in a building
with their telephoto lens

427
00:25:44,771 --> 00:25:48,485
and take pictures of people in their
most private, personal moments.

428
00:25:48,486 --> 00:25:49,412
That's disgusting.

429
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:51,736
Uh, honey, that's how we pay the rent.

430
00:25:51,737 --> 00:25:53,852
- It's different.
- I like to think so.

431
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,184
Back on point.

432
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:57,141
Is everything okay?

433
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:59,772
Does this have something
to do with you and Logan?

434
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:01,711
No...

435
00:26:01,712 --> 00:26:04,570
No! Dad, no.

436
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:07,383
I am not now, nor have
I ever been, pregnant.

437
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:09,442
I visited the clinic for a case.

438
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:14,419
Someone slipped this girl RU-486,
and it caused a miscarriage.

439
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,542
- That's awful.
- Yeah.

440
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:18,601
Where did this come from?

441
00:26:18,602 --> 00:26:21,143
There's no return address.

442
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:23,114
No postage.

443
00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:26,540
"Does everyone go to heaven?"

444
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:30,521
Actually, what does it say?
I've got intro to theology next semester.

445
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,477
Mmm. Doesn't look like it.

446
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:33,884
Well, here's a bookmark

447
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:36,350
if you can't make it all the way through.

448
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,971
"Good Word Press, San Diego."

449
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,520
Harassing women in crisis since 1973.

450
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:44,575
You think...

451
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:47,577
maybe you want to get
all up in their "bid'ness"?

452
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,749
Yeah? Who are you?

453
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,726
My name is Carson Drew,
and this is my assistant, Nancy.

454
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:06,855
We're trying to find who published this.

455
00:27:06,856 --> 00:27:08,780
You found him. Eddie Nettles.

456
00:27:08,781 --> 00:27:13,147
Mr. Nettles, some of your materials
ended up in a packet sent anonymously-

457
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:14,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

458
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:16,832
I told you people before,
this here's my constitutional right.

459
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,799
If you have a problem, see my lawyer.

460
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,500
We're private investigators working
on a rather delicate matter.

461
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,068
You see, our clients...

462
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:27,887
their son is engaged
to a girl who... well...

463
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:29,532
They don't know much about her,

464
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:31,608
so they asked us to look into...

465
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:36,377
They suspect that the bride-to-be
may have misled the groom

466
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:38,216
regarding past indiscretions.

467
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:43,171
They heard she recently terminated
a pregnancy at the Neptune free clinic.

468
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,897
I know. And if it's true,

469
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,871
the parents want their son to know.

470
00:27:47,872 --> 00:27:51,435
Is there any way you could
point us in the direction of the
person who took the photos?

471
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,246
Man, this world, huh?

472
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,128
I got them.

473
00:27:55,129 --> 00:27:58,531
There's the binders there.
The photos are arranged chronologically.

474
00:27:58,532 --> 00:27:59,944
You're free to take a look.

475
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:13,601
- Hey, Edward, how's it going?
- Thurman.

476
00:28:13,636 --> 00:28:15,008
Just put them with the others, huh?

477
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:16,478
Who are these folks?

478
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:19,251
This is Carson Drew and his assistant...

479
00:28:19,252 --> 00:28:20,905
what's your assistant's name?

480
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:21,906
Nancy.

481
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,469
They're lying to you, Eddie.

482
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,953
She came into our office yesterday
calling herself Hester,

483
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:29,735
claiming she was troubled.

484
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:34,688
She really is troubled.

485
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:39,500
Well, we've done better.

486
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:43,442
"Godzluvv."

487
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:44,829
Tasteful.

488
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:47,173
We did okay.

489
00:28:47,174 --> 00:28:48,230
How so?

490
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:50,477
One of the girls in the photo binder.

491
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,106
I've seen her with Dick.

492
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,554
The Casablancas kid?

493
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:55,409
Who might have been the father.

494
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:06,189
Wow. Impressive.

495
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,046
I hear "Modern Breasts"
is a really hard class.

496
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,483
The rebound starts with me? Nice!

497
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,888
That redhead from the other day, Nadia.
Does she have a last name?

498
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,287
Comaneci.

499
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:19,165
What?

500
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,842
Dick, do you think I'm an idiot?

501
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,737
Nadia Comaneci is an Olympic
gymnast from Romania.

502
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:27,125
You sure? I mean,
she doesn't have an accent.

503
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:29,583
Don't play dumb, Dick.

504
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:31,714
Some girl I see you hugging on pops up...

505
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:34,103
at the women's clinic a week after
Bonnie told you she's pregnant?

506
00:29:34,175 --> 00:29:35,862
I have to ask.

507
00:29:35,863 --> 00:29:38,128
Was she picking something up for you?

508
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:39,786
Hopefully a box of sponges.

509
00:29:40,372 --> 00:29:43,220
Look, if we're not gonna have
an empty sexual encounter,

510
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:45,819
I kind of got stuff to do, so...

511
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,430
Yeah.

512
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:03,486
- Hi. Are you Nadia Fassano?
- Yeah.

513
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:04,425
Thank goodness.

514
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:06,400
I had to go through the
whole freshman facebook

515
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:08,468
and flirt with the registrar
to get your schedule.

516
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,183
Okay. Why?

517
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,173
'Cause I wanted to talk to you,

518
00:30:12,174 --> 00:30:13,801
but your pal Dick

519
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:15,277
wouldn't give me your real name.

520
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:17,858
- I have a pal named Dick?
- Dick Casablancas.

521
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:20,710
Nadia, I know you know him.

522
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:22,696
I saw the two of you walking together,

523
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:23,816
and when I asked about you,

524
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:25,910
he told me your last name was Comaneci.

525
00:30:26,297 --> 00:30:28,830
- I just want to know-
- Okay, that Dick.

526
00:30:28,831 --> 00:30:29,831
Yeah, um, I got drunk at a party,

527
00:30:29,832 --> 00:30:33,309
and I made out with him
for like five seconds,

528
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,753
and then I gave him a fake name.

529
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,658
What? Would you want him calling you?

530
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:49,704
Hello?

531
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:52,452
Hi. Keith, um, i-it's Mindy O'Dell.

532
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:54,851
Listen, can you come right away?

533
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:57,317
Uh, there's someone in
the house downstairs.

534
00:30:57,318 --> 00:30:58,087
Where are you?

535
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:00,184
I'm in my bedroom.
I'm with the boys.

536
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:01,290
You call the cops?

537
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,189
You're closer, and you're competent.

538
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,060
Keith, hurry, please.

539
00:31:38,556 --> 00:31:40,964
Good morning Mr. Batando.

540
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,113
You might want to dial the cops now.

541
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:44,907
Yeah.

542
00:31:44,908 --> 00:31:45,992
Yeah. Give 'em a call.

543
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:51,089
I'm sure they'd love to hear about all the
fun and games my ex has been up to,

544
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,557
and you, too, Mars:

545
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:54,515
accessory to kidnapping,

546
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:56,651
stealing my bone marrow.

547
00:31:57,404 --> 00:31:59,611
The sheriff'd love to hear all about that.

548
00:31:59,612 --> 00:32:02,174
No one made you sign
that settlement, Steve.

549
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:04,228
You got money and a Porsche.

550
00:32:04,229 --> 00:32:06,058
Which they just repo'ed.

551
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,250
She stopped the payments...

552
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:11,077
to me and on the car.

553
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:12,795
I was just taking what she owed.

554
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:16,297
Since Cyrus died, I haven't
been able to afford it.

555
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:18,098
Dad?

556
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:20,616
Hey, there's my boy.

557
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:22,911
Come here.

558
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:30,780
Mom and Dad were just
going over some stuff.

559
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:38,886
I think I should get going.

560
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:44,250
Now, maybe next week we
go see a Laker game and...

561
00:32:44,251 --> 00:32:47,820
and, uh, I'll see if I can get my
hands on some tickets.

562
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:58,723
There's that vase.

563
00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:05,315
Okay, time to go to bed.

564
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,862
Okay? Let's go.

565
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:12,980
What do you want?

566
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:14,866
Just checking to see if everything's okay.

567
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,955
Everything's awesome.

568
00:33:25,283 --> 00:33:26,491
Well, he seems...

569
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:28,487
I'm not sure if "okay" is the word, but...

570
00:33:28,488 --> 00:33:30,924
Yeah, long story.

571
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:34,940
You know Cyrus was considering sending
him to a teen-discipline school?

572
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:36,984
But I don't even know if that would work.

573
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:38,970
Well, I should get going.

574
00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:42,355
If he comes by again,
you should really call the cops.

575
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:45,049
People with his kind of problem can...

576
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,683
uh, be more trouble than you realise.

577
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:49,096
Yeah, "problem"? Which problem?

578
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:51,967
Back when I was sheriff,
I saw my share of meth heads.

579
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:54,898
Yeah, I know.
He's been in and out of rehab.

580
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,134
Goodnight, Mrs. O'Dell.

581
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:58,103
Actually, um...

582
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:01,290
would you mind staying,
just until I check on Jason?

583
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,567
My nerves are still a little jangled.

584
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:05,896
You mind if I pour myself a drink?

585
00:34:05,897 --> 00:34:07,974
My nerves are a bit frayed myself.

586
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:10,272
No, anything you can find is yours.

587
00:34:56,236 --> 00:34:57,224
Keith?

588
00:34:58,474 --> 00:35:03,213
Growing up, my parents would
keep the adult beverages in
a fridge out in the garage.

589
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:05,729
Yeah, well, we keep ours in the kitchen.

590
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,702
Oh.

591
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:21,117
It's Veronica. Leave a message.

592
00:35:22,063 --> 00:35:23,598
Ah!

593
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,728
Veronica's voice mail!

594
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:31,281
So, where are you, Veronica?

595
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:35,013
Out digging through
someone's trash, maybe?

596
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:40,302
Interrogating one of your friends?
Beating out a confession?

597
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,160
You know, if you dig deep enough,

598
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:46,847
you're gonna find that
everyone's a sinner.

599
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:50,853
Judge not, Veronica,

600
00:35:50,854 --> 00:35:53,827
et cetera, et cetera.

601
00:35:55,024 --> 00:35:56,938
All right, stay on message, Logan.

602
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,263
Okay, honestly...

603
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:04,174
it's encouraging...

604
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:07,796
that someone still has such
high expectations of me.

605
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:16,001
Veronica, I would give anything if
I could take back that night in Aspen.

606
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:24,118
I'm sorry it causes you so much pain.
I'm sorry it happened.

607
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:31,106
I really love you, Veronica.

608
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:37,518
And how are you this a.m.?

609
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,716
Cramming for philosophy.

610
00:36:38,717 --> 00:36:41,575
Have you seen my copy of Either/Or?

611
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,194
No, but I've got an old issue
of Buts you can have.

612
00:36:44,195 --> 00:36:47,348
The comedy styling of Keith Mars,
ladies and gentlemen.

613
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:50,203
Hey, look, it's that guy
from the printing office.

614
00:36:50,204 --> 00:36:53,787
Apparently the preacher's leaving
cable access for the big-time.

615
00:36:53,788 --> 00:36:57,613
That guy Thurman is the ministry's CFO?

616
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:59,709
Should a ministry have a CFO?

617
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,769
You don't think he did it, do you?

618
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:06,403
He struck me as being
aggressively pro-life.

619
00:37:06,703 --> 00:37:09,029
How do you think a televangelist

620
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,143
with a pregnant, unmarried daughter
would play to his flock?

621
00:37:12,144 --> 00:37:15,947
A fly in the collection plate, perhaps?

622
00:37:18,441 --> 00:37:20,448
Bonnie, hey, it's Veronica.

623
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:23,811
Hey. So, what have you heard?
Are you making any progress?

624
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:25,876
Yeah, it's coming along.

625
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:28,486
Do you know
Thurman Randolph very well?

626
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:30,157
- He works for...
- My dad, yeah.

627
00:37:30,158 --> 00:37:32,782
- You trust him?
- Not really.

628
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,925
I want to search his office during
today's service. Can you get me in?

629
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:39,805
If you can get here in fifteen minutes.

630
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:41,570
Do you have church clothes?

631
00:37:41,571 --> 00:37:44,288
So, I'm heading out.

632
00:37:48,296 --> 00:37:50,003
New voice mail

633
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:53,573
Ah!

634
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:55,374
Ah! Veronica's voice mail!

635
00:37:57,164 --> 00:37:59,260
So, where are you, Veronica?

636
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:02,089
Out digging through someone's trash...

637
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,104
Something wrong, honey?

638
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:05,563
- No, just...
- Message erased.

639
00:38:05,564 --> 00:38:07,313
old crap.

640
00:38:08,046 --> 00:38:09,510
I got to run.

641
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:13,500
Hello?

642
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,908
Hey, it's me.

643
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:18,830
So, if you want to see German
engineering reduced to a cube,

644
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:21,681
come by the yard this
afternoon around 2:00.

645
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:24,046
I'll be there right after church.

646
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:25,564
Thanks, Weevil. Bye.

647
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:27,484
Church?

648
00:38:31,158 --> 00:38:32,408
Hello.

649
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:33,346
Hi.

650
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:34,799
I didn't know you knew Bonnie.

651
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,191
We only met recently.

652
00:38:38,062 --> 00:38:40,503
Oh, hi. You two met?

653
00:38:40,504 --> 00:38:41,964
We did.

654
00:38:41,965 --> 00:38:43,800
Hester didn't tell me the
two of you were friends.

655
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:45,096
Hester?

656
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:47,668
I, uh, hope you're well.

657
00:38:48,002 --> 00:38:49,259
Reverend Ted!

658
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,466
How's my other daughter?

659
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:52,873
Are you ready to celebrate?

660
00:38:52,874 --> 00:38:54,694
You look like you lost a little weight.

661
00:38:54,695 --> 00:38:59,366
Well, three thousand regular parishioners,
each with their own cheesecake recipe.

662
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,086
I finally had to clamp down.

663
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:02,537
You mean vomit.

664
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:04,468
Bonnie.

665
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,041
I think Tim slipped you the RU-486.

666
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:10,891
What?!

667
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:12,624
Bonnie? What is she-

668
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,342
Why do you say it was Tim?

669
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:18,845
This bookmark is... a gift,

670
00:39:18,846 --> 00:39:20,874
sent by a pro-life group

671
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,091
to everyone who comes
out of the Neptune clinic.

672
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:26,517
It's the only clinic in the
area that provides RU-486.

673
00:39:26,518 --> 00:39:28,760
It's some sort of a shame campaign.

674
00:39:28,761 --> 00:39:32,608
I just found it in the
pregnancy book Tim gave you.

675
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:37,741
By the way, your CFO works
with the same group.

676
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:40,528
Somebody slipped you...

677
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:42,077
Bonnie, why didn't you tell-

678
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:43,359
Phyllis.

679
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,255
Bonnie?

680
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:47,946
Tim didn't give me that book.

681
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:50,973
Phyllis did.

682
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,146
Bonnie, let me explain...

683
00:39:54,147 --> 00:39:55,942
I did it for you.

684
00:39:55,943 --> 00:39:58,715
Do you really think those
guys were worthy of you,

685
00:39:58,716 --> 00:40:00,737
of being the father of your baby?

686
00:40:00,738 --> 00:40:02,821
And think what it would have meant.

687
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:05,468
All of your plans, all of your goals?

688
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:09,255
No career at all, just divorce
and a baby to support,

689
00:40:09,256 --> 00:40:11,605
and you have dreams, Bonnie.

690
00:40:11,606 --> 00:40:13,635
And I was trying to help you.

691
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,751
I know you.

692
00:40:15,752 --> 00:40:19,891
You wanted to give up the
baby, and you were going to
until your parents found out.

693
00:40:20,731 --> 00:40:21,691
Bonnie...

694
00:40:21,726 --> 00:40:24,931
- Bonnie, I'm so...
- Sorry?

695
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:27,797
You're sorry?

696
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,158
Get out!

697
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,973
I can't look at you right now!
I want you out of my sight!

698
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,004
- Bonnie...
- Bonnie!

699
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:36,489
- Go to hell! Go to hell!
- Bonnie! That's enough!

700
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:40,408
It's done. She didn't mean to hurt you.

701
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:42,019
She didn't mean to.

702
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,838
Try to be forgiving. It's the only way.

703
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:48,520
Anger will tear you down.

704
00:40:50,038 --> 00:40:53,261
It'll make you less of the
person that you want to be.

705
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:56,775
And it will tear apart your soul.

706
00:40:58,141 --> 00:40:59,917
The bible teaches us

707
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:04,210
that he who is slow to anger
is better than the mighty

708
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:08,480
and he who rules his
spirit can capture a city.

709
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,526
He who is slow to anger
has great understanding,

710
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:15,851
but he who is quick-tempered exalts folly.

711
00:41:19,064 --> 00:41:21,627
So, we're all set to go
as soon as they finish.

712
00:41:21,628 --> 00:41:22,983
I even washed it

713
00:41:22,984 --> 00:41:24,660
so it'd be shiny when we crush it.

714
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:27,424
I know it doesn't sound logical,
but trust me, it's much better.

715
00:41:27,425 --> 00:41:29,046
Let's not do it.

716
00:41:30,558 --> 00:41:31,592
Are you sure?

717
00:41:31,593 --> 00:41:34,157
'Cause, you know, I did go through
all the trouble of stealing it.

718
00:41:34,237 --> 00:41:36,358
Here's a little something for the effort.

719
00:41:39,752 --> 00:41:44,040
Maybe you could open a can
of tuna, set it inside her A/C vent,

720
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:46,438
then park it back on the block.

721
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:48,588
I can do that.

722
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,797
Yeah.

723
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:52,893
You're going soft, Mars.

724
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:58,562
