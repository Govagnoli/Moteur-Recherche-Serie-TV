1
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:14,207
Oh, my god, Logan.

2
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:15,557
But I didn't stab him, Veronica.

3
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:16,538
I believe you.

4
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:20,671
Logan's high-priced lawyers crushed the P.C.H.Ers, and the town went crazy.

5
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,789
You're breaking up with me?

6
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:26,268
Someone's gonna get killed, Logan.

7
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:30,046
Ah, young love.

8
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:32,225
- Let's just get on the bus.
- I'm gonna miss you.

9
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:34,717
Did I mention that he didn't take the breakup that well?

10
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:36,042
So, where did your dad meet her?

11
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:38,202
She was a laker girl.
And you know my dad --

12
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:39,149
he has good seats.

13
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:42,345
The way she's acting, you'd think I seduced Duncan on their wedding day.

14
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:44,257
I'm gonna go try and talk to Meg one more time.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,921
You don't owe her anything.

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,582
You didn't do anything to her.

17
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:49,879
I thought it was important as a mayoral candidate

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,012
that my daughter, gia, attend the public high school in Neptune.

19
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,579
All here?

20
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,242
All here.

21
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:03,393
They're all dead!

22
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:04,951
It just went straight off the cliff.

23
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:06,106
They're all dead!

24
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:13,658
If a school bus traveling 40 miles per hour drives off a cliff

25
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,568
and plunges 90 feet into the jagged coastline,

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,319
how many seconds do the six high-school students, their teacher,

27
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,802
and bus driver have to contemplate the fact that they're about to die?

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,214
Two mississippis' worth of screams, life flashes, and prayers, maybe.

29
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:35,551
But if anyone used that time to make a deal with his maker,

30
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,338
only one of them was heard.

31
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:40,373
How's Meg?

32
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:44,226
The same -- unconscious but hanging in there.

33
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,999
Hey, cindy, I'm gonna take my break.
Can you watch the front?

34
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:52,242
You have to stop torturing yourself.

35
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,797
I'm not torturing myself.

36
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:57,234
I'm experiencing an appropriate degree of guilt.

37
00:01:57,424 --> 00:01:58,347
There's no crime.

38
00:01:58,637 --> 00:01:59,803
This isn't your fault.

39
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:02,353
If it wasn't for me, Meg would have been in the limo.

40
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:03,736
She'd be home.

41
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:06,547
She wouldn't need a machine to breathe.

42
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,396
You're not the only one she was avoiding.

43
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:11,102
Yeah, I was.

44
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:15,126
If I wasn't with you, Meg would have been.

45
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,976
She'd be safe.

46
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,960
When you guys are done breaking up, can I get a macchiato?

47
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:27,277
I'm actually just the hostess, but --
look, I don't care if you're the house magician.

48
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:29,373
Can you just make me a macchiato?

49
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:35,228
Your macchiato.

50
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:38,687
You know you can do better, right?

51
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:43,317
Will any s ort of bus-maintenancerecords be made public?

52
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:45,708
Several parents have questioned the district's commitment

53
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,837
to providing new, well-maintained buses

54
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:50,996
in a town where only kids from the poor side of town take the bus.

55
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:54,115
The bus driver was from that same side of town.
Maybe they should think about that.

56
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:57,025
So is the bus driver the focus of your investigation right now?

57
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,025
Are we looking at doyle?
Of course.

58
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,561
Have we uncovered information that concerns us?

59
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:03,622
Yes.

60
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:04,650
Such as?

61
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:10,112
Such as a history of mental illness, a history of marital problems.

62
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:13,818
We know that ed doyle was prescribed an antidepression medication,

63
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,472
and that prescription was never filled.

64
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:18,335
There was also one previous attempt of suicide.

65
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,067
And there were no drag marks or skid marks at the scene?

66
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,030
There were not.

67
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,249
So, just to be clear, you are investigating the possibility

68
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,959
that doyle drove off the cliff to commit suicide?

69
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,273
We are investigating all possibilities.

70
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,756
Sir, sir!

71
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,757
Since the bus crash, reporters have laid siege to the school,

72
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:43,274
all looking for those students who want their name in the paper or face on tv so badly

73
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:47,838
that they're willing to pimp out their memories of our dead classmates to anyone who asks.

74
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,059
Morning.

75
00:03:56,793 --> 00:03:58,376
You know who I am, right?

76
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:00,418
I do.

77
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:06,036
Just out of curiosity, did you know who I was last week?

78
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:09,278
Nope.

79
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:16,192
Your dad drives one bus off a cliff, and your days of being under the radar are over.

80
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,149
I'm sorry.
Did you want something?

81
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:23,814
Yeah, so, I need proof that my father didn't kill himself.

82
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:28,684
Um, I have a mother and a little brother,

83
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:34,898
and we've become accustomed to having a place to live and, like, food.

84
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:37,923
Insurance companies don't pay if they decide it's suicide.

85
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:42,279
Jessie, I wouldn't even know where to start with that.

86
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,537
I mean, how do you prove that someone didn't kill themselves?

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,785
If I knew, I wouldn't be waiting for Veronica Mars in a bathroom.

88
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:52,453
I'm sorry.
I can't.

89
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,249
Great. Because "I'm sorry" is so helpful.

90
00:04:58,513 --> 00:04:59,426
Jessie.

91
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:02,858
You know, if my dad killed a bunch of people I went to school with,

92
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:05,580
I don't know if I'd have the nerve to show my face at school.

93
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:10,823
Hey, Veronica, are you and Duncan coming to Logan's "life's short" party?

94
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,026
It's gonna be --

95
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:15,391
okay.

96
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:17,447
I'll help you.

97
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:19,543
But you must chill.

98
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:23,223
<I>A long time ago,

99
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:26,788
<I>we used to be friends but I

100
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:30,292
<I>haven't thought of you lately at all

101
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:33,608
<I>come on, now, sugar

102
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,019
<I>bring it on, bring it on, yeah

103
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:39,893
<I>just remember me when

104
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,365
<I>we used to be friends a long time ago

105
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,031
<I>we used to be friends.

106
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:03,889
I don't even know what I'm looking for --

107
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,809
skid marks the sheriff's department missed or purposefully overlooked?

108
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:09,966
There's nothing here to help jessie.

109
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:11,477
There's nothing here to help anyone.

110
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:24,352
I guess my dad doesn't rate a votive candle.

111
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,674
This doesn't mean anything.

112
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,818
If you were on that bus, you would want your pile to be the biggest.

113
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,127
Come on.
There's nothing here.

114
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,620
Neptune -- cleaner, safer.

115
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,093
That's my entire platform.

116
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:49,063
I'm running for county supervisor because I care about this town.

117
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:50,587
It's my home.

118
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:55,470
Dakota, you're stepping in too soon.

119
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:57,862
Come on, man! When you gonna get off the field?

120
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:03,798
It's 11:05.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,620
You guys are supposed to be off the field.

122
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,211
Wow, you can tell time.

123
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,966
Do you know what the key element to my safer plank is?

124
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:14,078
- I don't.
- Having an effective sheriff in office.

125
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:16,013
Keith, I want you to run for sheriff.

126
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:20,093
I'm prepared to use all my resources to support your candidacy.

127
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:22,128
- Mr. Goodman --
- Woody.

128
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:27,140
Woody, out of curiosity, where did you stand when I was removed from office?

129
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:30,345
I signed the petition to get rid of you.

130
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:33,791
I'm admitting right now that I was wrong.

131
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:36,531
We had a good thing going with as you as sheriff,

132
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,746
and there's a whole community, I believe, that realizes that now.

133
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:41,498
Come on, guys, let's go play.

134
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:45,862
Woody.

135
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,366
Hey! Break it up!

136
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:50,266
Break it up!

137
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:51,164
Come on, hey!

138
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:52,110
Break it up!

139
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:53,263
Break it up, fellas!

140
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:54,310
Come on, now!

141
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:56,064
There's enough daylight for everybody.

142
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,186
I apologize, boys.

143
00:07:58,492 --> 00:07:59,921
I see I let things run over.

144
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:03,084
Sportsmanship -- that's what it's all about, isn't it?

145
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:05,278
That's what separates us from the animals --

146
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:08,452
that and opposable thumbs.

147
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:10,862
All right.

148
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:13,613
Boys, clear the field. You guys have a good workout.

149
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:14,316
Cheers.

150
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:15,702
Come on, hustle it up!

151
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:17,356
You want to make the big leagues?

152
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:21,281
You'll think about what we talked about and get back to me by the end of the week?

153
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:22,155
Of course.

154
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,973
Great.
Come on, you guys.

155
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:26,558
Let's go. Hustle up!
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

156
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:27,612
Hustle! Come on, now!

157
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:29,939
I believe --

158
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,306
and correct me if I'm wrong --

159
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:35,039
that woody goodman is what some people might call a shoo-in.

160
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:36,672
He is unopposed.

161
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,122
So he's basically guaranteeing you a victory?

162
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:40,414
What is there to think about?

163
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:42,590
Elections aren't that easy, Veronica.

164
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:43,885
Sure, they are.

165
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:46,656
A couple of catchy bumper stickers,

166
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:49,887
your handsome mug plastered on all the benches in Neptune --

167
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:51,595
done and done.

168
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:53,864
Elections dredge up ugliness.

169
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:56,400
I don't want to subject you to that again.

170
00:08:58,323 --> 00:08:59,462
You want to protect me?

171
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:01,075
Run for sheriff.

172
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,689
<i>...Before driving off the pacific coast highway.</i>

173
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:05,655
<i>He was kind of a weird duck.</i>

174
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:06,966
<i>You could tell that right off the bat.</i>

175
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:12,934
<i>The guy comes in, buys a couple things, pays, goes to leave, then stops --</i>

176
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:13,886
<i>right? --</i>

177
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,810
<i>And then comes back to the counter, all serious-like.</i>

178
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:18,488
<i>Picks up one of these.</i>

179
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,255
<i>Can you guys see that?</i>

180
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:23,940
<i>It's a st. Christopher medal.</i>

181
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:27,205
<i>My man pays for it, then throws it out, just like that.</i>

182
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:31,984
I can't imagine where I'd be if you had gotten back on that bus.

183
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:34,870
You'd be sad for a while,

184
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:38,955
and then you'd probably turn my room into some sort of sewing nook or yoga studio.

185
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:40,781
You don't have to make a joke, you know.

186
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,872
Sure, I do.

187
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:48,936
You know, I wonder what else the bus driver bought --

188
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:51,604
the couple things the clerk mentioned.

189
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:53,791
What if it was nodoz or red bull?

190
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:55,645
That would tell us that he's sleepy, right?

191
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,907
And if he fell asleep, that would explain why there were no tire marks.

192
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,182
Veronica, you can't try to make sense out of this.

193
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:03,751
I know the bus driver's daughter.

194
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:09,850
I think a little rhyme or reason would probably make a big difference to her.

195
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:12,467
Yeah.

196
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:17,165
At least everyone we know got off the bus, except Meg.

197
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:21,696
You think her face will be, you know, normal?

198
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:25,579
What a bitch!

199
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,298
Hey.

200
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:29,480
Been looking for you.

201
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:31,105
What's wrong?

202
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:33,927
You've been listening to radiohead, haven't you?

203
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:35,866
That's it. I'm putting you on a strict nelly diet.

204
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,641
And how should I be feeling?

205
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:40,216
Happy, like you?

206
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,341
I think you missed the boat on the watching-me-sleep years.

207
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:03,158
It's 8:00. When do you plan on getting up?

208
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:06,651
The plan was two hours ago.
The reality is another 40 minutes.

209
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:08,564
No, no. We're not gonna play this game again, jackie.

210
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:11,644
- You cannot Miss another day of school.
- Even if I have cramps?

211
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,827
You know, from my monthly?

212
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:14,786
Jackie!

213
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,196
Wow, that was pretty fatherly.

214
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:20,378
Almost sounded like you'd been saying my name in exasperation for years.

215
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:22,300
All right.
How about we try this?

216
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:26,067
You can get your ass out of that bed right now,

217
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,629
or you can go back to new york and explain why you're there to your mom.

218
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,818
So, this is how it's gonna be?

219
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:35,901
"Clean your room or you can go back to new york?

220
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:38,227
Get straight a's or you can go back to new york?"

221
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:40,232
And you can also add,

222
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,061
"speak to your father with the respect he deserves or you will go back to new york"

223
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:44,166
to your list.

224
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:48,967
I'll be back in two days.

225
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:51,906
You can reach me on my cell if you need anything.

226
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:54,686
Hmm.
These don't look german.

227
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,180
You're not taking the porsche.

228
00:11:56,503 --> 00:11:57,550
You take the bronco.

229
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:09,866
Servando was just an exceptional person, you know?

230
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:12,828
I guess you never met him because you're new, but you would have loved him.

231
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,914
He was this badass P.C.H. Biker, and he was on the honor roll.

232
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:18,599
They didn't give him a hard time?

233
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,955
Well, I guess at first, but then they learned to respect it because

234
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:23,867
that was the kind of person that servando was.

235
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:36,830
You should take this to the attendance office.

236
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,044
And where's that?

237
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,465
Mmm!

238
00:12:42,854 --> 00:12:44,035
Thanks for taking me.

239
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:45,898
I don't know what I would have done.

240
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:47,991
This school is so big.

241
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,806
You know, I'm just trying to be a nice guy.

242
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:51,285
How's that working out for you?

243
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,997
I'm getting about three hallways worth of quality time.

244
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:55,302
I'm gonna say it's going pretty good.

245
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:58,583
Look, I haven't dated a guy in high school since the 8th grade.

246
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:00,115
I'm an old soul.

247
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:02,458
Seriously, these eyes have seen things.

248
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:04,429
Did I mention I'm a nice guy?

249
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:05,819
Ah, "nice" --

250
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:07,607
the great panty dropper.

251
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:09,820
- Okay, I'm not that nice.
- Oh, yes, you are.

252
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:10,865
How do you know?

253
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,129
'Cause I haven't tried to make out with you yet.

254
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,320
Oh, you're one of those --

255
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,855
only like the bad boys.

256
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:19,030
Why do all the hottest girls always have a daddy complex?

257
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:21,288
Daddy complex?

258
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,373
What?

259
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:24,902
I was kidding.

260
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:28,760
I met you about three seconds ago, and you've already got me analyzed.

261
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:30,396
Get over yourself.

262
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:33,328
Jackie, I'm sorry.
I was kidding.

263
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:43,637
A "whatever, bitch," and a 180 back to study hall and we could have had something.

264
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:52,235
Afternoon delight?

265
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:56,003
Ooh, considerably better than 5th-period english.

266
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:58,805
Oh, you need to not remind me you're in high school.

267
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:00,213
There's an ick factor.

268
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:01,524
Is that so?

269
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,685
Yeah. School in general, not very hot,

270
00:14:05,108 --> 00:14:07,694
unless I'm wearing a naughty schoolgirl uniform.

271
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:09,403
Then it's very hot.

272
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:12,284
I'm sure it would be for the three seconds you had it on.

273
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,423
You know, you're my first younger guy.

274
00:14:15,474 --> 00:14:17,515
Oh. It is an honor and a privilege.

275
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:24,824
I suck.

276
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:26,704
I was just trying to make you feel better.

277
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,792
I'm struggling with all this, too.

278
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:29,904
I know.

279
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:31,562
I know.

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,873
I just have all these conflicting emotions --

281
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,676
Grief for everyone who died and everyone who lost someone

282
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:54,395
Guilt about Meg.

283
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:57,910
The one that kills me --

284
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,156
joy.

285
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:04,829
Because I'm alive, and by all rights, I shouldn't be.

286
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,584
Veronica, it's not your fault.

287
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,446
I'm afraid that line only works in "good will hunting."

288
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:22,031
Being with a younger guy must suck.

289
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,514
Hold it, hold it.

290
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:27,967
Someone's home.

291
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:33,636
Never, ever let that country club valet touch the car.

292
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:35,924
It comes back with a scratch every time, all right?

293
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,990
Oh, my god!

294
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:43,678
You scared me.

295
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,292
- Hey.
- Hi.

296
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:49,259
Hey, why is Logan's truck in the driveway?

297
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:53,126
Uh, because there's water in the pool.

298
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:54,648
He's upstairs waiting for you.

299
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:57,908
And I'd really rather your friends not just show up whenever they want.

300
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,536
I'm not running an orphanage here.

301
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:11,564
Dude, why is your stepmom such a bitch?

302
00:16:13,143 --> 00:16:15,329
Seriously, a guy asks for one sandwich.

303
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:16,498
Hey, Logan.

304
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,922
How's everything going?

305
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:19,962
Really well.

306
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:21,978
Thanks for asking, Mr. C.
And you?

307
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:22,795
Excellent.

308
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:24,497
See, you had to one-up me.

309
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:27,387
Listen, don't worry about Mrs. Casablancas.

310
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:28,778
You're welcome here anytime.

311
00:16:29,357 --> 00:16:30,906
You like to bust chops.
I respect that.

312
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:31,695
Hey, thanks.

313
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:35,023
Dick jr. And I are going over to the firing range tomorrow.

314
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:36,322
Interest you in a little target practice?

315
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:38,347
As long as I'm not the target.

316
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:44,832
Okay. So I guess I'll just stay here and knit something.

317
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,045
Detention, and you locked your keys in your porsche.

318
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:51,967
Bad first day?

319
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,414
Someone hit my father's car.

320
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:56,791
Aw.

321
00:16:57,715 --> 00:17:00,056
And if that isn't bad enough, they left a fake note.

322
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,652
"People are watching me leave this note.

323
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:07,278
"I'm sure it looks like I'm leaving my insurance info.

324
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:10,876
I'm not." That's just mean.

325
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:13,177
This is exactly what my father's expecting.

326
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:15,508
I can help...if you want.

327
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:17,878
I can.

328
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:19,203
Like how?

329
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,730
I know someone.

330
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:22,782
Trust me.

331
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,545
I'm gonna track this scumbag down.

332
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:38,582
Hey, Wallace.

333
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:39,875
What you doing?

334
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,055
Remembering why I'm a misanthrope.

335
00:17:42,383 --> 00:17:44,275
They're selling souvenirs, Wallace --

336
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,828
bus-crash souvenirs.

337
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:47,046
You okay?

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,339
Yeah. I'll be fine.

339
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,174
What did you need?

340
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:53,282
Don't worry about it.

341
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:54,609
I'll take care of it myself.

342
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,743
I'll see you tomorrow, all right?

343
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,702
Yeah, okay.

344
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,993
So?

345
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:02,643
It's all good.

346
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,219
I'm on the case.

347
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:09,048
Now, how to convince this spotlight-loving bozo that I'm his friend.

348
00:18:09,314 --> 00:18:12,411
Please let ed doyle's last meal be super-caffeinated.

349
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:14,169
Give me something good to tell jessie.

350
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,246
Hey, you're the guy from the news, right?

351
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:18,827
I am, man.
Did you see that?

352
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:21,901
Check you out. Let me ask you a question.
Do I look fat to you?

353
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:25,178
'Cause I was watching it on the news, and I was like, "damn, I look fat."

354
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:29,165
Then I read something on-line says the camera adds 10 pounds,

355
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:30,803
so I was thinking maybe it was them.

356
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:33,658
But just in case, I started a diet regimen this morning.

357
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,447
God, that must have been so freaky to be the last one to talk to the bus driver.

358
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:39,353
It was weird.

359
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:44,112
Just thinking about him standing here is, like, just so cool.

360
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,985
Or maybe you think that's weird.
I don't know.

361
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,683
I'm kind of into the macabre.

362
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:52,423
Yeah, you're one of those freaky sex-and-death-type kids, aren't you?

363
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,346
We've been getting a lot in here lately.

364
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:56,721
Boss tells me to throw them out,
but I'm like, "no way, man."

365
00:18:56,772 --> 00:18:59,056
Goth money spends just as well as, uh...

366
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,679
non-goth money, so...

367
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,793
but if we've been getting a lot of munsters in here,

368
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:10,044
I'd say that you're the Marilyn, hon, 'cause you're...pretty.

369
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:11,543
Thanks.

370
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:14,060
Okay.

371
00:19:14,617 --> 00:19:17,854
Would you think I'm sick if I asked for the last meal the bus driver ate?

372
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,654
I would, but you wouldn't be the first.

373
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:22,310
You'd be, like, the 97th person that asked for it.

374
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:23,981
- Really?
- Yeah.

375
00:19:26,614 --> 00:19:27,265
Let me tell you something.

376
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,366
If I was gonna do a kamikaze, you know,

377
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,353
off a bridge with a bus full of kids and stuff,

378
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,916
a convenience store would not be the site of my last meal.

379
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:39,066
I'd want to eat something on the brink of extinction, you know,

380
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:42,209
like the last emu or a meerkat.

381
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:46,964
Would definitely not be a monster glug, right, and a bag of peanuts.

382
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,626
$1.98, hon.

383
00:19:51,144 --> 00:19:52,374
Slushie and peanuts?

384
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:53,771
That tells me nothing.

385
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:01,520
$3.02. One, two, three.
There you go.

386
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,057
But I can't leave here without one of these.

387
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:07,365
Hmm. St. Chris.

388
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,370
Hope it helps you.
Didn't help him.

389
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,258
There you go.

390
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:15,895
Thanks.

391
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:17,370
Be careful going around those cliffs.

392
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:19,063
Don't pull a bus, please.

393
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:20,563
You're too cute for that.

394
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,316
"No change -- don't ask," huh?

395
00:20:25,443 --> 00:20:26,265
Wait.

396
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:30,282
Ed doyle's saint toss wasn't a sign he was turning his back on god.

397
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:34,524
He just needed change for the phone, so he bought the cheapest thing he could find.

398
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:38,099
But who did he call, and why doesn't anyone know about it?

399
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,518
Either I am getting stealthier or your hearing is not what it used to be.

400
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:57,240
What do you want, Veronica?

401
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,332
An application.

402
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:00,113
Right.

403
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:03,384
It says right here you're looking for a part-time receptionist.

404
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:05,934
Why aren't you in school?

405
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,580
Job hunting on my lunch break.

406
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:09,708
I have excellent time-management skills.

407
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,813
I'm also great with people, and I have a very soothing phone voice.

408
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:14,673
You're serious?

409
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:17,346
As a code 3 on a 187 is a res. Dist.

410
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:28,997
Is there someplace quiet I can fill this out?

411
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:44,070
Few people have quick access to pay-phone records.

412
00:21:44,165 --> 00:21:46,449
On the short list, the police.

413
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:51,131
Hi, this is deputy ann shaughnessy from the Neptune county sheriff's department.

414
00:21:51,182 --> 00:21:57,782
I need a number and an address for a call placed last wednesday between 4:15 and 4:30 P.M.

415
00:21:57,902 --> 00:21:58,653
What's up, man?

416
00:21:58,975 --> 00:21:59,707
Hey, what's up?

417
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:03,604
I always see you guys playing hacky sack over here after lunch.

418
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:04,823
Chip?

419
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:07,335
Sure. Nice.

420
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,309
Hey, my friend's car got slammed the other day.

421
00:22:09,402 --> 00:22:10,905
I was wondering if maybe you saw something.

422
00:22:11,182 --> 00:22:12,021
Yeah, the porsche?

423
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:13,950
- You saw it?
- Yeah, man. That was rough.

424
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,887
This chick just came out of nowhere, slammed into it.

425
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:18,791
Just pow!

426
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:20,304
You know who it was?

427
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:21,515
Some blond chick.

428
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:24,320
She had a nice ass, but I never seen her before.

429
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:25,763
But if that's all you got,

430
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:28,996
I got to go look at every decent-ass blond chick in the school.

431
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:32,527
She was driv ing a green car,if that helps.

432
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:33,559
Thanks.

433
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:40,771
You'll never guess who's in the interrogation room right now filling out an application.

434
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:43,472
You're right.
I'll never guess.

435
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:44,641
Who?

436
00:22:44,803 --> 00:22:45,763
Veronica Mars.

437
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,765
You left Veronica Mars in there alone?

438
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:51,987
I got it. Thanks.

439
00:22:58,262 --> 00:22:59,886
What are you up to, Veronica?

440
00:23:00,518 --> 00:23:01,692
Last question, actually.

441
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,685
"Why do you want this position?"

442
00:23:03,952 --> 00:23:04,771
Honestly --

443
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:06,188
and really tell me the truth --

444
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:11,075
how much of an ass-kiss would I be if I admit it's to be close to you?

445
00:23:14,247 --> 00:23:18,984
Seriously, why do birds suddenly appear every time you're near?

446
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,054
So I got the basics from the stoners, right?

447
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,911
Used my attendance-office connections --

448
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:26,315
don't ask --

449
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,942
and I got a parking-permit list.

450
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:29,023
Name -- bam!

451
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,320
Plate number -- bam!

452
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:34,237
I got the car, make, and color of every student's car parked at Neptune high.

453
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:37,532
Weeded out the dudes, and then -- wait for it --

454
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:41,498
cross-referenced to the yearbook to eliminate all the nonblondes.

455
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:43,782
And, yeah, then there were four.

456
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,330
So you located the bitch?

457
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:48,616
I'm in the whittling stage right now.

458
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,149
It's a process.

459
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,493
I checked out two suspects.

460
00:23:52,756 --> 00:23:55,956
One's been driving her mom's blue dodge all week, and the other one's car is mint.

461
00:23:57,481 --> 00:23:59,406
My father's coming home tomorrow.

462
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:00,870
It'll be fixed by tomorrow.

463
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,231
Yeah, but when the credit-card bill is due, I won't be able to pay it,

464
00:24:03,282 --> 00:24:04,426
and I'll have to go to him.

465
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:05,860
You'll have your money by then.

466
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:08,036
I'm telling you, I will find her.

467
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,377
I promise.

468
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:11,294
Wallace Fennel is on the case.

469
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,641
You know what that means?

470
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:16,089
That Wallace Fennel wants to get in my pants.

471
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:19,206
And...what else?

472
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:21,719
That's all I've got.

473
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:23,524
It's already solved.

474
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:25,507
There's only one girl left on the list.

475
00:24:30,808 --> 00:24:31,916
What are you doing?

476
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:34,018
Jane!

477
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:36,191
What did you do to yourself?

478
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:37,995
I had knee surgery.

479
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:39,538
Ohh, ouch. When?

480
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,132
About a month ago.

481
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:43,014
I didn't think you knew who I was.

482
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:44,908
What? Are you kidding?

483
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,334
No. I mean,

484
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:48,724
we had spanish together all last semester,

485
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:50,838
and you never said two words to me.

486
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:52,187
In english, either.

487
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:55,192
That's bob.

488
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:58,522
He's my friend -- kind of my chauffeur friend right now.

489
00:24:58,573 --> 00:25:01,703
But, um, he's just a friend.

490
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,930
Yes, there's sugar in here.

491
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:07,990
We like our iced tea to come from crystals.

492
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:09,884
It's fine. Thanks.

493
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:15,066
So, um, my dad calling someone is a good sign then, right?

494
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:16,639
It might be.

495
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:19,918
Do you recognize the name "cotter"?

496
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:22,628
The address is from your apartment complex.

497
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:25,537
Did your dad ever hang out with any of the neighbors?

498
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:26,978
No.

499
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:30,638
I went by there earlier, but no one was around.

500
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:31,893
I'll stop by again later.

501
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:38,407
Is your mother home?

502
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:40,239
No, she's picking up my little brother from daycare.

503
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:42,048
- I have a search warrant.
- What for?

504
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:43,123
Looking for evidence.

505
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,493
Suicide is a crime.

506
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:47,097
Suicide that takes the lives of six others is murder.

507
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:48,811
What are you doing here, Mars?

508
00:25:49,951 --> 00:25:51,216
Jessie's a friend.

509
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:15,573
That'll slow 'em down.

510
00:26:27,634 --> 00:26:29,017
You ever shoot before, son?

511
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:30,639
Uh...no.

512
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:33,316
It's a good way to let off some steam,

513
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,021
but when you're at the point where you want to shoot someone,

514
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:36,650
you want to take them down, you don't want to wing 'em.

515
00:26:38,016 --> 00:26:39,404
Heart and head --

516
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,886
that's where it counts.

517
00:26:41,356 --> 00:26:42,275
Ain't that the truth?

518
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,345
You need focus, precision, the ability to only think about the task at hand.

519
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:49,762
When I'm working, my family doesn't exist.

520
00:26:50,504 --> 00:26:51,353
That sound awful?

521
00:26:51,491 --> 00:26:52,422
No.

522
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:53,669
It's not.

523
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:56,425
Because when I'm with my family, work doesn't exist.

524
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:02,606
I think my father has a similar philosophy.

525
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:04,895
Of course, he's a murderer, so...

526
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:06,527
yeah.

527
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:10,107
Yeah.

528
00:27:13,523 --> 00:27:15,930
Hey, we should have some chicks over tomorrow night.

529
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:18,272
Dad's got this banquet at the Neptune grand,

530
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:20,036
and he's forcing kendall to go with him.

531
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:22,709
Have you forgotten?
I live alone.

532
00:27:23,415 --> 00:27:26,072
Yeah, but only psycho chicks want to go to casa de killer.

533
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,453
I need a job where I get paid to read the personals and drink slushies.

534
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,480
You see this?

535
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:48,563
It's about servando.

536
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:51,322
If I die unexpectedly, do me a favor --

537
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:54,929
go on "oprah" and tell the world I loved kittens.

538
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:59,534
"Servando wept the first time he saw 'stand and deliver.'"

539
00:28:00,037 --> 00:28:01,360
Where do they even get that stuff?

540
00:28:01,574 --> 00:28:04,578
There was this new girl in class just soaking up the drama.

541
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,187
She probably couldn't wait to talk to reporters.

542
00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:15,011
Yeah?

543
00:28:15,282 --> 00:28:17,741
Wait. Let me guess.
Save our beaches, right?

544
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,088
- Jeff cotter?
- Yeah.

545
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:20,007
My name is dawn --

546
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:20,879
dawn lamb --

547
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,690
assistant to the district attorney.

548
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,495
Did you know ed doyle?

549
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,749
Um, he was the bus driver in that accident, right?

550
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,608
Yes.

551
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:32,121
I've heard of him, you know, from the news.

552
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:34,359
I think he lives around here, too.

553
00:28:34,468 --> 00:28:35,317
What's this about?

554
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:39,116
Ed doyle placed a call from a convenience-store pay phone to your apartment

555
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:41,779
about 15 minutes before the bus went over the cliff --

556
00:28:42,302 --> 00:28:44,457
last wednesday, 4:05 P.M.

557
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:45,907
I was in new york on wednesday.

558
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,067
Just got back this weekend.

559
00:28:47,118 --> 00:28:48,320
Hey, carla, sweetheart, come here.

560
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:52,502
She's saying that bus-driver guy, the guy from the accident --

561
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:54,068
he called here last week.

562
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:54,723
Who?

563
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:58,173
Ed doyle. Were you home last week between 4:00 and 5:00 P.M.?

564
00:28:58,802 --> 00:28:59,600
Yes.

565
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:02,841
But I don't know what you're talking about.

566
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:04,092
Wait.

567
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:07,368
I did get a wrong number last week.

568
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:09,345
It might have been wednesday.

569
00:29:13,507 --> 00:29:14,758
Thank you.
Sorry to bother you.

570
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:15,525
No problem.

571
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:16,653
Jessie, what's up?

572
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:18,401
Jessie: You can stop whatever you're doing.

573
00:29:19,095 --> 00:29:19,859
Why?

574
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:22,338
My father killed himself.

575
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:25,685
The sheriff found his suicide note saved on his computer.

576
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,820
How can you cry about him?

577
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:37,714
You think he cared about either one of us?

578
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:39,777
He left us with nothing!

579
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:41,281
- Mom!
- What?!

580
00:29:43,263 --> 00:29:45,507
I think we can stop worr yingabout appearances.

581
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,613
Hey, you know not to listen to her when she's like this, right?

582
00:29:50,214 --> 00:29:51,051
I don't know.

583
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:52,326
Daddy was sick.

584
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:54,595
He was in a lot of pain.

585
00:29:55,522 --> 00:29:57,576
Where -- where was it?

586
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:03,240
It's hard to explain.

587
00:30:06,403 --> 00:30:08,384
Can I go play outside now?

588
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:09,823
Yeah.

589
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:11,825
Just stay in the yard, okay?

590
00:30:16,426 --> 00:30:20,895
Maybe he'll feel better when he's older, when he can read this.

591
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:24,990
Sheriff was kind enough to print it out and fax it over.

592
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:30,622
"I'm sorry to leave you this way,

593
00:30:30,972 --> 00:30:34,823
but I truly believe in my heart that it's for the best.

594
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:36,836
I can't go on like this.

595
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:39,082
I can't stay just for the kids.

596
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:43,246
Even though they mean more to me than anything, this isn't good for them."

597
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,806
You know, my mom was right for a change.

598
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:47,703
Better off without him.

599
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,645
Jessie.

600
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,622
Slow night?

601
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:13,799
Not bad.

602
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:17,409
Busy enough to not get bored, slow enough to do my homework.

603
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:20,172
I used to work nights at a store when I was in high school.

604
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:21,204
Sweet gig.

605
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:23,646
You go to Neptune high?

606
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:25,064
Yeah.

607
00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:27,132
Ah, must be rough.

608
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,706
Anyone close to you involved in that crash?

609
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:31,117
No.

610
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:32,718
Good. Thank god.

611
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:35,005
Still, you probably knew some of the kids, right?

612
00:31:35,814 --> 00:31:36,778
You looking for a story?

613
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:40,801
You got something?

614
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:42,789
Can I see this for a minute?

615
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:48,756
I've never seen notebooks like this.

616
00:31:49,347 --> 00:31:50,581
Reporters all use them --

617
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:52,837
easy to hold and write at the same time.

618
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,023
So, you said you knew some of the kids.

619
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:57,352
No, I didn't.

620
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:02,985
One quick question.

621
00:32:03,803 --> 00:32:05,997
If ed doyle dialed the wrong number,

622
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:07,760
why was it a 4-minute call?

623
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:17,944
I read his suicide note today, and I have a theory.

624
00:32:19,053 --> 00:32:22,548
He wasn't on planning on killing himself or a busload of kids.

625
00:32:22,914 --> 00:32:24,961
He was planning on leaving his wife --

626
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,018
I'm guessing for you.

627
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:32,450
Come in.

628
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:39,572
Carla, this is jessie.

629
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:48,654
You look just like your picture.

630
00:32:50,656 --> 00:32:52,267
That's why they call them "pictures."

631
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:55,103
Your dad...

632
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:59,054
talked about you all the time.

633
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:00,943
Yeah.

634
00:33:01,186 --> 00:33:02,858
Sorry.
Can't say the same.

635
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:09,057
We were in love, your dad and me.

636
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:11,575
He called to say that he'd see me later.

637
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:13,767
He didn't mean to drive that bus off a cliff.

638
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:17,332
He just couldn't bring himself to leave you and your brother.

639
00:33:18,347 --> 00:33:20,406
He didn't want to leave you with your mother.

640
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,656
Now I wish I was less understanding

641
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:50,826
because I never really got to be with the man that I loved.

642
00:33:55,475 --> 00:33:58,704
You know the charge that goes up your spine at the moment of epiphany?

643
00:33:59,051 --> 00:33:59,981
It just hit me.

644
00:34:00,526 --> 00:34:02,626
I'm not going to let the list of things I want to do

645
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:05,478
before I die turn into a list of regrets.

646
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:07,295
You came.

647
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,040
Oh, hey.

648
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,203
What are you thinking?

649
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:47,500
You know, I was trying to remember the over-under on the ohio state-texas game.

650
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,558
Oh, god.

651
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,153
What is that?

652
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:55,804
Oh.

653
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:04,265
Maybe we did it wrong.

654
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:09,326
Uh, so, what's the protocol here?

655
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,180
Do I bang my fist on the wall, call the front desk?

656
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,532
Attempt to out-moan them?

657
00:35:16,129 --> 00:35:17,524
There's really only one thing to do.

658
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:24,662
Spectra vision --

659
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:26,917
loud.

660
00:35:47,758 --> 00:35:48,573
Hmm.

661
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:50,858
What's different about you?

662
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:55,409
Did you cut your hair or something?

663
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:04,671
F.Y.I. -- If the cuddling is the best part, he didn't do it right.

664
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:21,859
Neptune grand on fifth street.

665
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:26,596
Room 1147, please.

666
00:36:28,877 --> 00:36:29,887
Hello?

667
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:33,902
Hmm.

668
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:36,573
Why didn't you wake me?

669
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,635
I have about 15 minutes till my dad activates the homing device in my molar.

670
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:14,666
Make sure you really clean that up, because if we get bugs, I'm gonna be pissed.

671
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:39,895
Hey, keith, you looking for me?

672
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:40,680
I am.

673
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:43,075
All right. Good.
Hit me with some good news.

674
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:54,411
I appreciate the offer, woody, but I've decided not to run.

675
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:55,355
No.

676
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:58,469
Good luck with the election, and you can count on my vote.

677
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:00,614
You change your mind, you give me a call.

678
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:03,420
I feel pretty good about the decision.

679
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:04,805
Fair enough.

680
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,279
You take good care, keith.

681
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:08,457
Always a pleasure.

682
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:09,111
All right.

683
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:14,331
Just listen to me for two seconds.
I've been here for three hours.

684
00:38:14,382 --> 00:38:16,851
Talk to me for one minute.
My father did not kill himself.

685
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,020
We have the note.
We have the physical evidence.

686
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:20,931
- The case is closed.
- Open it back up.

687
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:22,337
That wasn't a suicide note.

688
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:25,056
He was leaving my mom for another woman.
I have proof.

689
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:26,340
Listen to me.

690
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,779
You have to give another press conference, okay?

691
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:31,590
Please! I have a little brother.
He's 8.

692
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:34,198
He needs to know that my father didn't kill those kids.

693
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:36,259
Sorry about your loss.
The case is closed.

694
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:45,385
What are we doing?

695
00:38:46,163 --> 00:38:47,570
Exercising patience.

696
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:50,590
Just wait for it.

697
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:54,600
Wait for it and go.

698
00:38:55,671 --> 00:38:57,701
Wait. She's the one?

699
00:38:57,939 --> 00:38:59,106
My plan is unfolding.

700
00:39:00,113 --> 00:39:02,042
Let's just be impressed, watch it play out.

701
00:39:02,362 --> 00:39:04,646
- Thanks, but I got it from here.
- Whoa, whoa.

702
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:07,782
Do you want your dad to hear you got into a catfight the first week of school?

703
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:10,254
You have my spark plugs?

704
00:39:10,453 --> 00:39:11,898
You have your insurance information?

705
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:16,414
Paper bag, backseat.

706
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:26,331
Thank you.

707
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:30,835
Chances of her knowing how to replace a spark plug?

708
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,529
Chances of me running into her in the girls' locker room

709
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,528
and unleashing my own brand of justice?

710
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:36,719
Slim. She doesn't go here.

711
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,022
She's a reporter.

712
00:39:38,518 --> 00:39:40,249
Think Drew Barrymore in "never been kissed."

713
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:42,829
Hey, if Drew's in it, I've seen it.

714
00:39:43,303 --> 00:39:45,422
I let Clemmons know we had an imposter on campus.

715
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:48,100
Oh, another thing you should know about me --

716
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:52,019
I like my gratitude in small doses, spread out over time.

717
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,586
I may have to reconsider my stand on nice guys.

718
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:14,980
Um, who was that kissing you?

719
00:40:15,517 --> 00:40:16,808
That was jackie.

720
00:40:18,028 --> 00:40:18,770
Oh.

721
00:40:29,713 --> 00:40:30,430
Hey.

722
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,509
How did woody goodman take the news?

723
00:40:34,777 --> 00:40:35,766
Pretty well, actually.

724
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,458
He wasn't bummed?

725
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:38,392
Nope.

726
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:40,329
Then he's crazy.

727
00:40:40,747 --> 00:40:41,927
I told him I'm running.

728
00:40:42,365 --> 00:40:43,491
Oh, my god!

729
00:40:44,156 --> 00:40:45,168
Oh, that's great.

730
00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:46,595
That's great.

731
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:48,306
I feel safer already.

732
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:53,767
What?

733
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,128
You look different, that's all.

734
00:40:57,357 --> 00:41:01,628
Okay, I know my father is a brilliant detective with a keen intuition

735
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,357
and a finely tuned B.S. Detector, but there is no way he can tell that I've had sex.

736
00:41:08,922 --> 00:41:10,085
Right?

737
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:26,216
Hey, check this out.
