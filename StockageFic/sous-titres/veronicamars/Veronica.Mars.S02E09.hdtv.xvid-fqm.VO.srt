1
00:00:00,638 --> 00:00:02,284
Previously on Veronica Mars

2
00:00:03,312 --> 00:00:03,902
Duncan?

3
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:07,474
Why didn't you tell me how often
you'd visited meg since the accident?

4
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:08,715
What did you say to duncan?

5
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:10,399
Let's start with what I didn't tell him.

6
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:14,354
I didn't tell him that his mother
drove my mother out of town.

7
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:16,824
The night felix got killed,
did you see who called the cops?

8
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:17,436
No, man.

9
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:18,883
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

10
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:19,850
What happened to felix?

11
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:21,298
I can't remember, okay?

12
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:26,378
Is it done?

13
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:29,299
You have no idea the hell
you just brought on yourself.

14
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:35,106
Since you all had such a raucous
good time with venereal diseases,

15
00:00:35,646 --> 00:00:38,949
I'm sure you'll be thrilled
with phase two of sex ed.

16
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:40,812
Ladies and gentlemen...

17
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,398
welcome to parenthood.

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,735
So that's where babies come from.

19
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:50,963
For the next five days,

20
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:57,356
you moms and dads will team up and care
for your very own baby think-it-over.

21
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:02,390
Some parenting tips.

22
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:05,652
Your babies have very sophisticated sensors.

23
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:07,694
They know when they want to be held...

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,676
and when they want a bottle.

25
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,504
Most importantly, your babies
have very good memories --

26
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:18,845
or rather, memory chips.

27
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:21,640
So, if you're looking to pass this class,

28
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:25,435
I'd give junior some serious tlc.

29
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:27,756
Now, find a partner,

30
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:28,676
pick a baby.

31
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:34,423
Oh, aren't we supposed
to have a shot of tequila first?

32
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:41,426
Pick a good 'un, honey.

33
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:42,793
I got to go see the man.

34
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:48,853
What do you got for me --

35
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,926
S.A.T. Cheating scam,

36
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:53,041
toilet cam in the girls' locker room,

37
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:56,657
a sticky divorce, perhaps?

38
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:58,276
I need for you to open up
your purse, Veronica.

39
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,179
Hand over your keys.

40
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:09,053
All your keys.

41
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:28,447
I can explain that.

42
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,454
You don't have to.

43
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:33,664
The district's put in a security system that
keeps track of all after-hours visitors.

44
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,611
I don't see any cameras here.

45
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:39,374
There's no way you can
prove that I broke in.

46
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,743
How else could you have gotten
the drug testing results?

47
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:43,832
The faked drug test results?

48
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,172
Let me walk you through it.

49
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:48,098
Usually when I save your butt,

50
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:48,985
I start by --

51
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:50,428
what else have you stolen from my school?

52
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,419
I can't imagine that all of these
keys belong to your property.

53
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:54,900
For instance,

54
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:56,867
what's this one for?

55
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,129
That one? Let's see.

56
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:03,817
That one opens a duraguard file
safe manufactured prior to 1990.

57
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,444
And, uh, this one?

58
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,144
Fits any vespa scooter.

59
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,240
What? I like to come prepared.

60
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:13,442
In that case, prepare
yourself for a suspension.

61
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:15,598
You broke into my filing cabinet.

62
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:18,339
That's possibly even grounds
for the sheriff's involvement.

63
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,556
If you suspend me,
I won't be eligible for...

64
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:21,813
the Kane scholarship.

65
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:25,978
Yes, I'm aware of both your academic
record and your financial situation.

66
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:31,482
I might be inclined to
let you off with detention.

67
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:33,280
Fine, detention.
I'll take it.

68
00:03:38,323 --> 00:03:39,272
Excuse me, Mac?

69
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,391
Mac?

70
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:42,696
Oh, were you talking to me?

71
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:44,164
Yeah, I was, actually.

72
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:47,294
Um, I was wondering if I could hire you.

73
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:48,374
To do what?

74
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:51,582
Well, I need a domain registered
and an online identity for my company,

75
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:52,481
Phoenix Land Trust.

76
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:55,715
I would also need you to design
a logo for my letterhead.

77
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:59,682
You know, I-I-I'm happy to match
whatever your going rate is.

78
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:03,379
I need the work to be fortune 500 caliber.

79
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:06,926
Look, I'll help you get
your company up and running,

80
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:11,337
but basically you're hiring me to do
your homework for you, right?

81
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:12,340
Um...

82
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:14,701
Right.

83
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,373
Some other exciting news --

84
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:20,374
Neptune players will be holding
open audition for "Hamlet" all week,

85
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:24,652
and I am especially proud to announce
this year's special celebrity director --

86
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:28,111
television and screen star,
not to mention NHS Alum,

87
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,634
miss Trina Echolls.

88
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:32,844
Principal Moorehead,
you old star stroker.

89
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:35,205
If Logan's sister is back in Neptune,

90
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,991
that must mean she was the first one
booted off "The Surreal Life" this season.

91
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:40,078
Veronica...

92
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:43,011
you are aware that school isn't over yet?

93
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,436
But detention was just so close.

94
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:48,205
I convinced my 7th-period
teacher to let me out early.

95
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,191
Follow me, then.

96
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:51,058
Got a little project for you.

97
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,905
The janitor had a dolly accident last
week moving the permanent records.

98
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:03,538
Your sentence is up when each of
these files finds its way alphabetically...

99
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:05,388
into that cabinet.

100
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,755
And I can't use magic, right?

101
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,919
My mom's permanent record?

102
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,059
Six months ago she vanished
in the middle of the night,

103
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,100
but I guess we all leave
a little something behind.

104
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,093
Mom didn't talk about her
Neptune days very often.

105
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:40,276
But back before she started drinking,

106
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:42,933
she told me that high school is
something you had to get through.

107
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:44,386
I knew what she meant.

108
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:48,044
I always liked imagining that I would've
gotten along with Lianne as a teenager,

109
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,585
even long after Lianne the adult
failed to meet or exceed expectations.

110
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:58,417
Lianne Reynolds suspended three days for spreading
false and malicious rumors concerning another student.

111
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:08,167
Lianne Reynolds appeared at a disciplinary hearing
along with fellow student Deborah Philipina Drummond.

112
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,922
Huh. I wonder if she's any relation
to Deborah Philipina Hauser.

113
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,028
This is gonna take you a very long time
if you plan to read each individually.

114
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,100
I was just --

115
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,658
snooping through school property.

116
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:23,318
Isn't that what landed
you here in detention?

117
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:26,147
Back to work, Veronica.

118
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,462
Hey, you tripped the damn
breaker again, Berto!

119
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:47,406
You hear me, man?!

120
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:58,401
I heard your lights were out.

121
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,756
Ever hear of genetics, kid?

122
00:07:02,393 --> 00:07:06,334
Thanks to your grandma,
I've got a 50/50 shot at becoming an alky.

123
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:09,635
Guess that makes your odds
1-in-4, which isn't so bad.

124
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:14,967
Oh, and there's also
this latent mean-girl gene.

125
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:17,223
You're lucky you're made out of plastic.

126
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:20,235
Hey, mrs. Hauser,
do you have a sec?

127
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:22,531
I haven't had my coffee.

128
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:25,264
Intrude on my personal
time at your own risk.

129
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,885
You used to be friends with my mom,
Lianne Reynolds?

130
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:30,585
You were in the same class?

131
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:32,722
I knew your mother.

132
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:36,299
Well enough to get suspended
together senior year.

133
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:40,183
Why would you dig up
an ugly story like that?

134
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:44,935
Discovering that your mom and your teacher were
suspended for spreading a false and malicious rumor

135
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:46,413
who wouldn't want to know more about that?

136
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:50,235
It's not a juicy story, Veronica.
It's an embarrassment.

137
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:54,812
I'm ashamed I even listened to
Lianne's gossip, let alone repeat it.

138
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:57,114
I didn't understand the consequences.

139
00:07:57,331 --> 00:08:00,535
A lot of people got hurt because your
mother just couldn't keep her mouth shut.

140
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:05,331
Maybe you can learn from her mistake.

141
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:30,099
There you go, kid.

142
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:32,502
Here's life lesson number one --

143
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,704
what goes around, comes around.

144
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:37,140
A long time ago,

145
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:39,904
we used to be friends but I

146
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,757
haven't thought of you lately at all

147
00:08:45,246 --> 00:08:47,282
come on, now, sugar

148
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,594
bring it on, bring it on, yeah

149
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:53,248
just remember me when

150
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:55,268
we used to be friends

151
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:57,564
a long time ago

152
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,884
we used to be friends

153
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:16,137
You've been working here
for what, like, ever?

154
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,038
Any idea what my mom did her
senior year to get herself suspended?

155
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:22,204
Let me get this straight --

156
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:25,759
you want follow-up on what I explicitly
forbade you from doing yesterday?

157
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,918
Um...yes.

158
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:30,856
More alphabetizing,
less cold-casing.

159
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:40,288
Back then I was a young science teacher.

160
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:43,000
I would have no idea.
Didn't you read the report?

161
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:44,853
Yeah, but they blacked
all the good stuff out.

162
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:46,311
Hmm.

163
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:47,784
Who else was here in 1980?

164
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:52,413
What? I'm just trying to figure out
what kind of person my mom was.

165
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,530
Mrs. Hauser was a student.

166
00:09:55,976 --> 00:09:57,549
Mr. Moorehead was the vice principal.

167
00:09:58,135 --> 00:09:59,359
Mary mooney was a student.

168
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,386
I think that's it, the entire list.

169
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:05,209
Mary Mooney? Who's that?

170
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:08,921
Excuse me, Mary?

171
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:11,049
Mary Mooney?

172
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,890
You can ask as loud as you want.
Lunch lady does not talk.

173
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:17,017
She's, like, retarded or deaf or something.

174
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,462
Mom learned to sign because
she had an aunt who was deaf.

175
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:22,928
She taught me the alphabet,
but that was a long time ago.

176
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:26,217
Excuse me.
Did you know...

177
00:10:26,864 --> 00:10:34,958
L-i-a-n-n-e R-e-y-o-n-l-d-s?

178
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:42,876
Alas, it seems that sign language
isn't at all like riding a bicycle.

179
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:47,710
I'm sorry. Can you go slower?

180
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:53,756
Lianne was a... fiend?

181
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,789
My mom, the fiend.

182
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:58,703
Tell me something I don't know.

183
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:06,144
Principal Moorehead.

184
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:07,774
Veronica.

185
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:10,839
I see that mr. Clemmons is
failing in his prime directive.

186
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:11,988
What's that?

187
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:13,625
Keeping you out of my face.

188
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:15,556
Mind if we walk and talk?

189
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,142
You were vice principal here in 1980.

190
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:19,557
Indeed, I was.

191
00:11:19,558 --> 00:11:24,359
And you suspended my mom for spreading a
false and malicious rumor about another student.

192
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:25,594
That sounds like me.

193
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:26,984
What was your mom's name?

194
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:28,532
Lianne Reynolds.

195
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:34,219
Well, uh, I saw a great deal of your mother,
as a matter of fact.

196
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,565
Do you remember why she was suspended?

197
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:38,712
What did she say that was so awful?

198
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:40,341
Well, of course, I don't, Veronica.

199
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:42,647
But even if I did,
why would I want to repeat it?

200
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:46,018
I'm sure your mom turned
into a terrific person.

201
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:51,303
But during the time she was here,
Lianne was rather... vicious.

202
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:01,029
Veronica?

203
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:04,902
And you, alan. How's my favorite principal?
Take five.

204
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,318
Oh, isn't he a big old teddy bear?

205
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,260
Well, Trina, it's good
to have you back here.

206
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:18,070
And you look...fantastic.

207
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:19,956
That look is so great.

208
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,010
J'adore.

209
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,011
So, how have you been?

210
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:25,344
I mean, aside from that
whole mess with dad and all.

211
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,293
What, that?

212
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:27,509
It's water under the bridge.

213
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:30,052
Great. I've really been meaning to call you.

214
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:32,959
There has been some super
exciting news with the project.

215
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:34,078
Three words --

216
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:35,888
Evan Rachel Wood.

217
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:37,487
Okay.

218
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:40,077
She's gonna play you in
"the Aaron Echolls story".

219
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,062
Name changed since you
won't sign the release forms.

220
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:44,833
It's such a great part.

221
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,156
It was all over the trades.
You didn't see it?

222
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,661
I don't know how I missed it.

223
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,392
You should audition for the play.

224
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,717
Oh, you can audition using anything.

225
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:57,297
Frankly, we need some pretty girls.

226
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:58,910
Yeah, thanks anyway.

227
00:12:59,118 --> 00:12:59,916
I can't act.

228
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:01,617
Oh, acting's overrated.

229
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,045
You've got presence, sweetie.

230
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,688
Listen, we'll catch up later.
Right now my company needs me.

231
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:10,550
Oh, the play is my master,
and I am its whore.

232
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:17,812
Someone request turn-on service?

233
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:20,145
I'm pretty sure
it's called turndown service.

234
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:22,340
Oh, well, who would want that?

235
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:23,576
Logan's not here.

236
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:26,188
Loosen up, Richie Rich, okay?

237
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:29,517
I've been in both your beds.
I've earned the occasional drop-by.

238
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:33,727
Oh, my god,

239
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:35,644
tell me that is not a baby.

240
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:39,179
Don't be silly.

241
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:44,858
It's an animatronic
parental-lifestyle simulator.

242
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:48,601
It's a class project.

243
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,138
Well, isn't that just the creepiest
little thing I've ever seen?

244
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:57,357
So, you want a break from daddy duty?

245
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:58,948
Let me take you for a ride.

246
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:02,431
A ride?

247
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:04,443
Big d's maserati is downstairs.

248
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:08,261
You got to check it out.
You would look so hot in it.

249
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,800
Can't I just be loved for me?

250
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:17,278
The maserati retails for 150 grand,
but I'll let you have her for half that.

251
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:19,607
You do know how to drive a stick, don't you?

252
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,036
Actually --

253
00:14:21,037 --> 00:14:22,021
don't worry.

254
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:24,124
I'll teach you the fun way.

255
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:26,740
We don't even have to leave the couch.

256
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:36,324
Do they, like, chemically castrate
you boys over at that school?

257
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:38,534
You don't need sex ed.

258
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:41,598
I am sex ed.

259
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:46,152
Hey, Trina.

260
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:48,645
Duncan, you're looking good.

261
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:49,829
It's all the clean living.

262
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:51,286
Hi, baby.

263
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,625
What took you so long?

264
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,347
If I had known you were throwing yourself
at my roommate, I'd have raced home.

265
00:14:59,654 --> 00:15:00,796
I brought a surprise for you.

266
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:02,627
I figured you and Duncan could try it.

267
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,132
Maybe if you boys play nice,

268
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:08,128
you could share or take turns or something.

269
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:11,106
Duncan's not into that
sort of thing, pumpkin.

270
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,272
I'm talking about Dick's maserati.

271
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:14,268
Wait a minute.

272
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,884
Are you, like, sleeping
with my little brother?

273
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:19,508
What is he -- 13?

274
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:21,866
13? He wishes.

275
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:26,146
So, is this your much-older
sister I've heard nothing about?

276
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:27,525
Ah, yes, where are my manners?

277
00:15:28,026 --> 00:15:30,222
Kendall Casablancas, Trina Echolls.

278
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:32,602
Rode hard, meet put away wet.

279
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:34,785
I'm guessing she's the wet one.

280
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,578
Well, I'd love to stay and chat,
but I've got places to be.

281
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,251
Where?

282
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:43,642
Is there a club where you, Dedee Pfeiffer, Joey
Travolta, and Melissa Rivers all meet for drinks?

283
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:46,892
There is. I don't think you'd like it.
It's 21 and over.

284
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,260
We're hitting an after-party at
Chuck E. Cheese, though, if you're free.

285
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,138
Okay, well, I need him in bed
by 10:00 P.M. sharp.

286
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,506
He's got school tomorrow.

287
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:58,772
Night, all.

288
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,066
Well, the joke's on her.
She came over to borrow my video camera.

289
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,642
The girl does love a good exit line.

290
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,684
After scouring mom's senior yearbook,

291
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,379
I found one mysterious inscription amidst all
the "stay cool"s and "let's party this summer"s.

292
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:16,402
One Patty Wilson wrote,

293
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:19,312
"Lianne, thanks for all the dishy dish.

294
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:20,969
You made physics bearable."

295
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:24,228
Lucky for me, not only does
Patty still live in Neptune,

296
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:26,376
but she jumped at the chance
to meet me for coffee.

297
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,013
At least someone remembers mom fondly.

298
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:29,919
Patty?

299
00:16:30,842 --> 00:16:32,657
You must be Veronica.

300
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:36,355
Just look at you.
Pretty, just like your mom.

301
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:41,209
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear
that your mom was very popular.

302
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:42,632
That's great.

303
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:48,789
We were lab partners, and we'd just sit in the
back of the room and gossip and snipe... girl stuff.

304
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:52,301
But the juiciest bits were always
about your mom's love life.

305
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,069
Really?
What about?

306
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,187
Your mom and Jake Kane...
The Jake Kane...

307
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:00,235
were on again, off again
the summer before senior year.

308
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:02,924
But by homecoming,
they were together for good...

309
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,577
or so Lianne thought.

310
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:05,579
What happened?

311
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:10,743
That spiteful little shrew that he dated over
the summer told him that she was pregnant.

312
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:13,891
Jake Kane got somebody
pregnant 25 years ago?

313
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:17,123
Well, your mom didn't think so.
She was sure that Celeste was lying.

314
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:18,311
Celeste Kane?

315
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,768
Celeste Carnathan back then.

316
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:23,924
Her family was moving
out of the school district,

317
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:26,865
so she had to find a way to break
Jake and Lianne up for good.

318
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:29,469
Celeste finished the year at penn.

319
00:17:30,273 --> 00:17:33,434
Of course, she managed to find
her way back to Neptune for prom.

320
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,685
And I'm guessing she
wasn't pregnant at the dance.

321
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:39,290
That's right. Jake's love child
had magically disappeared.

322
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,377
Either mom got dumped because
Celeste said she was pregnant

323
00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:48,291
or mom said Celeste was pregnant
because she was dumped.

324
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:57,584
Sorry I'm late.

325
00:17:57,761 --> 00:18:01,180
Almost started without you.
You'd have missed out on my chili surprise.

326
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:02,443
You made chili?

327
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:03,279
Surprise.

328
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,307
Had to stop by Duncan's
and pick up my progeny.

329
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,819
Can I ask you a question about mom?

330
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:13,525
Shoot.

331
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:18,851
When you met her, she was
still a cool person, right?

332
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:22,669
Of course she was cool.
She married me, didn't she?

333
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,406
Why do you ask?

334
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:29,991
I just found out that mom was
suspended her senior year.

335
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:33,993
I'm pretty sure it was for spreading
a rumor that Celeste Kane was pregnant.

336
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:35,725
That doesn't sound very cool.

337
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,031
My point exactly.

338
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:39,173
Do me a favor?

339
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:40,281
What kind of favor?

340
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:43,685
Access the county birth records,
find out if mom was telling the truth.

341
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:44,876
And that's gonna tell you what?

342
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:48,566
You know who your mom was.

343
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:51,262
Forget the past couple of years.

344
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:53,737
You loved her.
She loved you.

345
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,074
Which is more torturous :

346
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:09,639
organizing disciplinary files or spending lunch watching
the bard get flogged by the second lead of "Wilder Things" ?

347
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:12,114
Are you honest?

348
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:13,979
My lord?

349
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:15,653
Are you fair?

350
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:17,576
What means your lordship?

351
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,020
Oops, sorry. It's mine.
He's just a little colicky.

352
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,514
That if you be honest and fair,

353
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:31,269
your honesty should admit
no discourse to your beauty.

354
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:34,913
Could beauty, my lord,
have better commerce than with...

355
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:54,213
You are too cute.

356
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:56,074
You want to have a meeting.

357
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:57,272
I love it!

358
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:00,538
So, what's this all about?

359
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:04,111
What's that?

360
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:10,542
This is the box for my father's $15 000 panerai
destro that you sold to the webbers for 5 grand.

361
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:16,844
This family has been humiliated
enough already. You need to stop.

362
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:21,649
Yeah. He bilks investors for millions,
but I'm humiliating the family?

363
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:23,985
I don't have a little trust fund
to take care of me,

364
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:27,513
so a girl's got to do
what a girl's got to do.

365
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:30,510
I have a better solution.

366
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:33,981
I'm using my trust fund
to start a real-estate business.

367
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:35,972
I've already found some
office space downtown,

368
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,496
and I've drawn up a prospectus,

369
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:40,442
if you'd like to take a look at it.

370
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:41,870
What's this got to do with me?

371
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:45,692
I'm 16 : I can't meet with investors,
I can't sign legal documents.

372
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:47,952
Now, this is where you would come in.

373
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:51,258
You would be the face
of the Phoenix Land Trust.

374
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,860
Gee, Cassidy,
I didn't think you liked me.

375
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:59,099
I don't, but I find value
in your desperation.

376
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:10,472
Look, kid, I have worked very
hard over the years to avoid working.

377
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,729
Now you want to give me a job?

378
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:14,482
I know nothing about sales.

379
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:16,093
Sure you do.
That's all you know.

380
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:21,119
Look, you'll be salaried, a grand a week
plus commission that you'll see outlined there.

381
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:23,333
Big "D" is gonna get
through this eventually.

382
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:28,010
It's sweet what you're trying to do.
Your dad would be so proud.

383
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,604
If you want this little arrangement to work,
try not to patronize me.

384
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:37,697
Sir. Yes, sir.

385
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:41,596
So, when do I get my first check?

386
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:55,272
There's no baby born in 1980 under
either last name, Kane or Carnathan.

387
00:21:56,324 --> 00:21:57,840
So Celeste was lying.

388
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:00,446
That or she might've had an abortion.

389
00:22:00,957 --> 00:22:02,780
Is that the type of thing
you can check up on?

390
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:08,174
Honey, it looks to me like you and
Duncan have a nice little thing going,

391
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:12,150
so why do you have to go out of
your way to pick off a 25-year-old scab?

392
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,418
I just want a little proof that
my mom was a good person,

393
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:19,647
that she wasn't one
of the girls I hate so much,

394
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,857
one of the girls that makes
high school miserable for everyone else.

395
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:24,446
Okay.

396
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:26,559
What?

397
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:28,281
Kind of a bonus, isn't it?

398
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:32,234
That you can prove Celeste is the witch
you think she is at the same time?

399
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:37,574
If she didn't split Jake and your mom up,
well, you wouldn't have me.

400
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:40,426
And that means you wouldn't be you,Veronica.

401
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,433
And that would be bad, right?

402
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,267
Right.

403
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:49,538
So, try to keep that
in mind when I tell you this.

404
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:57,956
A Jane Doe baby was delivered to the
Balboa County Hospital on may 8th, 1980.

405
00:22:57,991 --> 00:22:59,186
That's weird.

406
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,685
It gets weirder.

407
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:05,384
They found the baby in the girls' bathroom
during the Neptune High School prom.

408
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:06,586
Celeste.

409
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:08,847
You don't actually listen
when I talk, do you?

410
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:18,287
You're it.

411
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,941
Oh, no, no, no.
Junior's all yours tonight.

412
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:23,028
Baby and cheeseburgers.

413
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:24,520
It's a package deal.

414
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:27,431
I have to get some sleep tonight,
civics test.

415
00:23:27,604 --> 00:23:29,285
I would if I could, but I've got plans.

416
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:32,547
Plans? I don't remember
you running anything by me.

417
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:38,502
I left the bottle in my car.

418
00:23:42,206 --> 00:23:43,578
Well, at least you brought
the baby up this time.

419
00:23:44,827 --> 00:23:46,800
Look, I'll handle this, but then
you've got to get out of here.

420
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:49,002
Do you have a chick coming over?

421
00:23:49,981 --> 00:23:50,874
I'm going out to dinner.

422
00:23:53,503 --> 00:23:55,907
You know I'm surprised that mom
never got one of these things for Lilly.

423
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:58,804
She was always so terrified
that Lilly would get pregnant.

424
00:23:59,098 --> 00:23:59,915
That's ironic.

425
00:24:00,677 --> 00:24:01,463
What's ironic?

426
00:24:02,168 --> 00:24:04,448
Your mom afraid that
Lilly would get pregnant.

427
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:07,668
Hey, now, you're not about
to bad-mouth Celeste, are you?

428
00:24:07,841 --> 00:24:08,784
Heavens no.

429
00:24:09,218 --> 00:24:13,274
I mean, what could I say about that...saint?

430
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:21,778
She is a warmhearted, good-humored, lovely
woman of high breeding and impeccable social grace.

431
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:24,299
Why, thank you, Veronica.

432
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:31,315
Mom. Hey, you're early.

433
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:34,036
I wanted to give you your
clean clothes before dinner.

434
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:35,692
What is she doing here?

435
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,225
"She" meaning me?

436
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:41,142
I guess I'm here as
Duncan's secret girlfriend.

437
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:43,262
Oh, and we have a love child.

438
00:24:45,703 --> 00:24:47,939
Want to hold her?
She's snuggly.

439
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,857
I'll pass.

440
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,548
Astrid, if you're done gaping,
the clothes?

441
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:55,395
I'm sorry. I should've told them.

442
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,599
Or mentioned to me that you hadn't.

443
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:00,849
I told your father something
like this would happen.

444
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:03,491
This is exactly why we should've
taken you up to napa.

445
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:05,024
Not in front of the baby.

446
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:06,802
This isn't amusing, Veronica.

447
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:07,569
It's not.

448
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:11,600
Me breeding with a kane?
No laughing matter.

449
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:14,131
But, look, no one has to know, right?

450
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:18,823
Worst case scenario, things don't work out,
I'll just dump her off at the big dance.

451
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:20,909
It worked at your prom, didn't it?

452
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,096
Does she ever make sense, Duncan?

453
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,005
Does she ever thaw out, Duncan?

454
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:30,411
When I look at your face,
all I see is your drunk slut of a mother.

455
00:25:30,472 --> 00:25:30,871
Ma!

456
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:34,113
- Look, Duncan, she can't just...
- Veronica, I need a moment alone with my mom.

457
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:34,716
Sure.

458
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:36,418
We'll be in the bedroom.

459
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,452
You don't mind your dirty laundry
mixing with your clean laundry, do you?

460
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,894
Nice boss you got out there.

461
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:47,319
Ooh, yeah.

462
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:48,903
How can you put up with her?

463
00:25:48,969 --> 00:25:52,161
I wouldn't, but she promised to pay
my way through grad school next year.

464
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:57,523
Kind of a weird question,
but is that your real hair color, Astrid?

465
00:25:57,525 --> 00:25:59,781
You're right.
That is a weird question.

466
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:03,046
I'm more of what you'd call a bottle blonde.

467
00:26:03,983 --> 00:26:05,692
And I'm guessing you're about 25?

468
00:26:06,687 --> 00:26:10,428
You should really work at a carnival.
I am indeed 25.

469
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:13,022
Please, don't ask me my weight.

470
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,658
We're leaving, now.

471
00:26:22,451 --> 00:26:24,915
So, is that how Celeste lives with herself?

472
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,245
She hires her abandoned daughter to fold
laundry in exchange for paying her tuition?

473
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:34,034
If Astrid is the prom baby, she's got a
whole hell of a lot more coming her way.

474
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:37,311
Excuse me, mrs. Murphy?

475
00:26:37,424 --> 00:26:38,159
Yes, Logan?

476
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,846
Hey, you mind if I take a bathroom break?

477
00:26:40,643 --> 00:26:43,825
You always ask to go to
the bathroom during this period.

478
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:48,376
I know. It's that 12-pack I slam at lunch.
It goes right through me.

479
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:50,365
Hurry back, Logan.

480
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:02,027
I hope that tape didn't burn
too much when they ripped it off.

481
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:04,065
I hear that can leave some chafing.

482
00:27:04,116 --> 00:27:05,411
You made the wrong play, dog.

483
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:07,824
I shouldn't let you live
for what you pulled.

484
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,637
What I pulled?

485
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:11,283
Hang on, compadre, let's recap.

486
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,059
You blasted a shotgun through
my car with me inside.

487
00:27:16,012 --> 00:27:16,628
That wasn't me.

488
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:17,723
You torched my house.

489
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:21,055
Then your masked bandidos
played russian roulette with my hand...

490
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:23,369
Okay, my math says you still owe me.

491
00:27:23,526 --> 00:27:24,935
I thought you killed Felix.

492
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:26,153
I didn't.

493
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:28,927
Yeah, I pretty much know that now.

494
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,547
Are you waiting for the music
to swell before you start the apology?

495
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:34,145
We have something in common now.

496
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:36,936
We both need to find out who killed Felix.

497
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:38,083
So, what, we team up,

498
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:42,138
get matching capes,
I ride shotgun in a sidecar?

499
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:43,864
Something like that, but not yet.

500
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:47,617
See, I can't let you leave here looking
the way you did when you walked in,

501
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:51,524
not if I don't want to end up some bald guy
with tattoos who rides the school bus.

502
00:27:52,374 --> 00:27:54,657
I hope you don't just expect
me to stand here and take it.

503
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:56,066
Wouldn't be much fun if you did.

504
00:27:56,673 --> 00:27:57,804
Who's gonna throw the first --

505
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:01,650
<i>[playing: The hives - Walk, idiot, walk]</i>

506
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:14,261
<i>Well, is it true what they say about it?</i>

507
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:17,279
<i>They say it's new, but I have to doubt it.</i>

508
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,488
<i>And then they tell you everything about it</i>

509
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:21,654
<i>Had enough</i>

510
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,882
All right. All right. Let's move it.

511
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:26,524
Come on, get to class.

512
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:30,470
<i>I got some people saying this way</i>

513
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:33,672
<i>I got some people saying that way</i>

514
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:34,791
<i>Ain't it tough?</i>

515
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,315
<i>See the idiot walk</i>

516
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:42,585
<i>See the idiot talk</i>

517
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:43,808
let's go.

518
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:47,600
<i>See the idiot chalk up
his name on the blackboard</i>

519
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,236
Nothing to see here.
Come on, let's go.

520
00:28:53,781 --> 00:28:55,011
<i>See the robot talk</i>

521
00:28:55,098 --> 00:28:56,311
They're lucky they got that door down.

522
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,835
Sounded like weevil was just
beating the freckles off his ass.

523
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:01,608
Did you see him walk by?

524
00:29:02,132 --> 00:29:04,176
Wasn't much left off that pretty 09er face.

525
00:29:04,684 --> 00:29:05,823
But he walked, didn't he?

526
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:09,336
If that was me, after what surfer boy did,

527
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,320
I would've put him in the ground.

528
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:18,138
I gave you a few options.

529
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:21,633
Here's if you want to go with
the whole flash animation route.

530
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,746
Sweet.

531
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:28,779
But if you're worried about inducing
epileptic fits with your clients,

532
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:33,097
we can go with a more sleek graphic version.

533
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:34,530
I like sleek.

534
00:29:34,828 --> 00:29:35,459
Me too.

535
00:29:38,984 --> 00:29:42,045
"Phoenix Land Trust, inc.
Cassidy casablancas, CEO."

536
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:45,517
Nice! I would totally trust
this company with my money.

537
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,579
And it'll work wonders with the ladies.

538
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,132
Chicks dig scars and acronyms.

539
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,614
Good to know.

540
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:53,218
I'm a giver of info.

541
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:58,420
Yeah, well, as much as I'd like
to impress the ladies with my title,

542
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,471
I actually need the ceo to be listed
as Kendall Casablancas.

543
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:04,789
Pay me in cash,
I ask no questions.

544
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:08,621
Just tip me off when you're going public.

545
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:11,882
You know, I think that might be illegal.

546
00:30:12,584 --> 00:30:13,166
Still.

547
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,781
You're admiring my moxie, aren't you.

548
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:19,444
Something like that.

549
00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:27,053
You must be mrs. Mahnovski.
Thanks for coming down.

550
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,653
If you wouldn't mind
following me into my office.

551
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,360
Adoption agencies tend to keep
their information under lock and key.

552
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:40,146
Temporary foster parents, however, tend
to be the weak link in the security chain.

553
00:30:43,797 --> 00:30:47,336
I see you and your husband have taken
in a number of children over the years.

554
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:53,758
You don't happen to remember a little girl who
was in your care for a few weeks back in 1980?

555
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:54,717
She was the one who was...

556
00:30:54,718 --> 00:30:55,968
found in the high school.

557
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:57,795
How could I forget the prom baby?

558
00:30:58,103 --> 00:30:59,705
The prom baby, right.

559
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:05,589
Well, my clients seem to think she might
be their very own long-lost child.

560
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:06,409
Well, I'll be.

561
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,128
My clients don't want a lot of publicity.

562
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:14,251
They're quite wealthy, and they're really only
interested in taking care of the child financially.

563
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:16,972
So, if you could just point me
in the right direction...

564
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:19,531
I'm just not sure their money
would mean all that much to her.

565
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,204
Really? Why is that?

566
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,114
I happen to know she ended up
in a wealthy local home.

567
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,439
She did?

568
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,493
Though this past year, I'm afraid,

569
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,945
her adoptive mother committed suicide
and her adoptive father went to jail.

570
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:42,649
By all rights,
I should just let this drop.

571
00:31:42,964 --> 00:31:44,853
I can't pretend I'm righting a wrong.

572
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,535
I'm not rescuing a housekeeper.

573
00:31:46,984 --> 00:31:48,732
Be honest with yourself, Veronica.

574
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,741
You just can't stand Celeste Kane,
and you want to see her humiliated.

575
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:55,226
Heard you were still in here.

576
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,614
Yeah, they're keeping me
another day for observation.

577
00:31:59,102 --> 00:32:01,610
Doc wants to make sure the swelling
goes down before I leave.

578
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:04,970
I should let you rest.

579
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,009
I don't even know why
I'm bothering you with this.

580
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:08,676
What's that you've got?

581
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:11,042
Nothing.

582
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,423
I was just thinking
of trying out for the play.

583
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:15,290
And I wanted to tape myself,

584
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:16,864
maybe get some direction.

585
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:32,664
Don't do this to yourself.
You're dying.

586
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:34,771
Can't you see you're dying?

587
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:37,767
Then please let me die in peace.

588
00:32:38,382 --> 00:32:40,766
I can't do that,
because there is hope.

589
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,255
There's always hope.

590
00:32:42,475 --> 00:32:45,303
I don't need hope.
I need bone marrow.

591
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:49,314
My doctor said only
a blood relation can save me.

592
00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:50,940
What about your parents?

593
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,170
I'm adopted.

594
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:58,931
Unless the mother who abandoned me comes
forward, unless I find out who I really am...

595
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:01,869
it's over for me.

596
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:06,534
And scene.

597
00:33:07,815 --> 00:33:09,332
You know, I really am adopted.

598
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:12,228
Really? I... I didn't know that.

599
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,547
So, who's the mean girl now?

600
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:22,133
To do what needs to be done,
I wouldn't just be shaming Celeste.

601
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,260
I'd be making a public
spectacle out of Trina.

602
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,160
Okay, Trina, I was lying.

603
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:33,309
That whole bit about wanting
to try out for the play -- a lie.

604
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:34,483
The truth is,

605
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:40,963
as a baby, you were left in a Neptune High
girls' bathroom on prom night 25 years ago.

606
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,288
No way.

607
00:33:44,006 --> 00:33:48,494
Ashton kutcher is hiding somewhere, right?
Ashton, come out.

608
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:50,380
You can't get me that easy.

609
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,055
Trina, I'm dead serious.

610
00:33:52,763 --> 00:33:53,398
Okay.

611
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:57,041
If you're joking, you really can act.
You're a natural.

612
00:33:57,158 --> 00:33:59,977
You were found in a
girls' bathroom on prom night.

613
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:00,732
What?

614
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:06,267
So, you mean my mother was, like, one of those
trashy sluts that dumped me in a garbage can?

615
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:11,020
I'm pretty sure Celeste Kane is your mom.

616
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,490
Well, there's worse news
you could've given me.

617
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:18,329
They've got billions.

618
00:34:18,443 --> 00:34:19,455
I suppose they do.

619
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:24,094
Um...I was gonna use this
audition tape to smoke her out,

620
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:25,867
shame her.

621
00:34:26,442 --> 00:34:29,567
I was gonna send this video
to all the tabloids.

622
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:32,809
Oh, you're a rascal,
Veronica Mars.

623
00:34:32,935 --> 00:34:33,680
Am I?

624
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:37,493
I was thinking I was something
else less flattering.

625
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,086
You know, if we hurry, that tape can
make tonight's entertainment news.

626
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:46,821
Oh, it's the least big pat can do for me after
leaving all those pervy messages on my voice mail.

627
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,469
"Poor yorick.
I knew him, horatio..."

628
00:34:52,986 --> 00:34:54,903
Okay, people, take five.

629
00:34:57,673 --> 00:34:59,968
"Starlet's silent struggle with death."

630
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:02,964
"The echolls family curse."

631
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:06,384
"Webster rumored to be
discovered in neverland basement."

632
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,625
I'm sorry. You have to go slower.

633
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,348
Look -- it's lunch lady Doris.

634
00:35:14,552 --> 00:35:16,628
Doris was so nice to me when I went here.

635
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:18,411
Used to always give me extra cake.

636
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:19,723
Actually, her name is Mary.

637
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:23,154
Really? Guess I just decided
to call her Doris.

638
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,664
You want to help?

639
00:35:24,855 --> 00:35:28,493
Oh, that's so sweet. Tell her thanks,
but this is a student production.

640
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:30,425
Trina?

641
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:35,295
What's she saying?

642
00:35:40,129 --> 00:35:44,245
Veronica, could you please
tell me what's going on?

643
00:35:46,536 --> 00:35:50,088
She's saying she wants
to give you her bone marrow.

644
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,856
Trina is really your daughter?

645
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:19,956
Trina was the prom baby?

646
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:27,253
What did my mother do to hurt you?

647
00:36:31,242 --> 00:36:34,159
"Hurt? You mother was my friend."

648
00:36:35,702 --> 00:36:36,301
Friend?

649
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,010
Lianne was your friend?

650
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,545
What a difference a letter makes.

651
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:49,591
"Lianne could sign. She'd eat lunch with me most of
the time. She was the sweetest, coolest girl in school."

652
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,737
You know, when I was a kid,

653
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:05,463
I used to imagine that someday I'd find
out my parents were, like, movie stars.

654
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,231
Trina, your parents
actually were movie stars.

655
00:37:09,415 --> 00:37:10,873
I mean my real parents.

656
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,365
So, why are you so interested in all this?

657
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:17,289
25 years ago,

658
00:37:17,524 --> 00:37:21,090
Mary told my mother she was having
an affair with a faculty member,

659
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,785
and mom made the mistake of asking
her friend Deborah Hauser for advice.

660
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:31,334
So, when the future health teacher
spread the story all over school,

661
00:37:31,372 --> 00:37:33,418
they got called into the principal's office.

662
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:35,750
So, did they nail my mystery dad?

663
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:38,978
Nope. Mom recanted,
said she made the whole thing up.

664
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:40,053
Why?

665
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,582
'Cause Mary begged her not to tell.

666
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:45,464
She didn't want the story being confirmed.

667
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,631
So she wanted to protect the teacher?

668
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,014
Mary was scared and pregnant.

669
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:54,342
So she decided it would be easier
to just dump me at the prom?

670
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:56,497
No, she left you on your father's doorstep.

671
00:37:57,005 --> 00:37:58,463
He was the one who panicked,

672
00:37:58,464 --> 00:38:01,543
knowing he couldn't take you to
the hospital without drawing suspicion.

673
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,417
The dance was perfect.

674
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:06,278
Everyone would assume
the baby belonged to a student.

675
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,790
So, what happened to my real dad?
You said he was a teacher, right?

676
00:38:10,743 --> 00:38:11,645
Even better.

677
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:14,568
Raise academic achievement scores.

678
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:18,162
Hey, pops.
Hope I'm interrupting.

679
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:21,019
Trina, glad to see you're feeling better.
I'd heard that you were...

680
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,955
at death's door?

681
00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:25,592
And when exactly were you planning
to hook me up with a little bone marrow?

682
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,157
Perhaps we should take this outside.

683
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:28,908
Oh, come on, dad.

684
00:38:29,634 --> 00:38:34,324
It's the least you can do for your daughter
after dumping me in the john on prom night.

685
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,646
Hey.

686
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:41,951
You grab dinner yet?

687
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,665
Funny you should ask.

688
00:38:44,587 --> 00:38:46,194
I'm not actually that hungry.

689
00:38:46,912 --> 00:38:50,535
I was scrounging through the old
fridge for a little study snack.

690
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:52,959
And I'm not normally
a corn dog type of girl...

691
00:38:55,844 --> 00:38:57,150
...But this...

692
00:38:58,155 --> 00:39:00,250
is gonna put me off them forever.

693
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:04,067
Are you keeping a dead rat
in our freezer or do we have a slam-

694
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,339
dunk lawsuit against
the processed-food industry?

695
00:39:06,442 --> 00:39:07,609
I found it on the bus.

696
00:39:08,008 --> 00:39:09,828
You checked out the bus and didn't tell me?

697
00:39:10,408 --> 00:39:12,656
It was duct-taped under
one of the back seats.

698
00:39:15,383 --> 00:39:17,836
It was a message for me.
I'm the rat.

699
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:19,261
I don't know, maybe.

700
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:21,187
Maybe it was someone else on the bus.

701
00:39:24,126 --> 00:39:25,256
You were right, Veronica.

702
00:39:26,187 --> 00:39:27,531
I should've won that election.

703
00:39:28,713 --> 00:39:30,223
I should've taken over this case.

704
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:38,603
You sly, old dog.

705
00:39:38,866 --> 00:39:40,095
Your sentence is up, Veronica,

706
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:43,799
unless you're here to atone
for something I don't yet know about.

707
00:39:44,062 --> 00:39:47,952
Deducing I had a key to your
office now, that was clever.

708
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:50,921
Obviously you had to find
a way to stick me in detention.

709
00:39:51,477 --> 00:39:55,316
That way you could be sure I'd find
my way into my mom's permanent file.

710
00:39:55,464 --> 00:39:56,549
What are you going on about?

711
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:00,959
You read Machiavelli
this summer, didn't you.

712
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,085
Ooh, nice.

713
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:06,879
Not taking credit for it?

714
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,734
Even more badass.

715
00:40:08,996 --> 00:40:10,929
That's a very imaginative theory, Veronica.

716
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:13,064
But if you'll excuse me,

717
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,126
I've got a lot of paperwork.

718
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:30,766
Hello?

719
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,897
Hello, ms. Mars?

720
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:35,974
This is the neptune memorial hospital
again regarding abel koontz's belongings.

721
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,445
How sobering is it that the sum of
a person's life fits into a cardboard box?

722
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:02,528
Since I've made it past security already,
there's one thing I want to check...

723
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:06,396
Meg's room, unguarded.
