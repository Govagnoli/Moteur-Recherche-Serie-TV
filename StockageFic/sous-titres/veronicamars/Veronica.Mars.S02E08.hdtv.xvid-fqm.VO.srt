1
00:00:00,277 --> 00:00:01,910
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:01,987 --> 00:00:03,910
I have information about 
that mexican kid who got killed.

3
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:06,115
I'm the one who made the 
anonymous call from the bridge.

4
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:08,310
You're under arrest for 
the murder of Felix Toombs.

5
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:10,444
Ooh, I am having the weirdest déjà vu.

6
00:00:10,526 --> 00:00:11,883
Logan made bail in, like, two minutes.

7
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,532
Maybe it is time we did something 
about Logan Echolls.

8
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:16,567
The fitzpatricks are meth-head lunatics,

9
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:19,271
but they're not gonna kill 
a bus full of kids over 3 grand.

10
00:00:19,272 --> 00:00:22,497
Their problem with cervando would have 
been solved in an alley with a baseball bat.

11
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:23,221
Veronica?

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,006
Duncan?

13
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:26,997
How's Meg?

14
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:29,128
If you cared about Meg, 
she wouldn't have been on that bus.

15
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:35,337
Do you love me?

16
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:39,211
Did you ever love me?

17
00:00:41,723 --> 00:00:45,786
On the bus, my life didn't flash before me.

18
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,767
You did.

19
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:50,462
Our first kiss.

20
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:53,990
The last perfect moment we had together.

21
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:56,122
Remember?

22
00:00:56,693 --> 00:00:57,445
On the beach.

23
00:00:58,354 --> 00:00:59,081
Please.

24
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:02,160
You promised me.

25
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:04,973
You made promises.

26
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,233
You can save me.

27
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,809
All you have to do is want to.

28
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:12,616
I've heard enough.

29
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:14,338
Have you heard enough?

30
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:16,192
What does she have?

31
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:19,200
What does she have that I haven't got?

32
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:23,725
Well, I'm conscious,

33
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:25,512
and that's just for starters.

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,954
Is that really what you want?

35
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,889
Teddy bears and mash notes?

36
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:32,783
Grow up.

37
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:34,926
Grow up and get over it.

38
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:40,003
All I'm saying is, 
I followed him into the cigar shop,

39
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,958
he bought some cigars, and he left.

40
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:45,128
Didn't your dad say that
the cigar store's a front for drug dealers?

41
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:46,152
That's got to be something.

42
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:47,018
Or not.

43
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:50,561
Sometimes a cigar store
is just a cigar store.

44
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,053
Well, I'll remember to be quippy 
when you're looking at 20 to life.

45
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,400
Oh, you're being a jackass.

46
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:57,722
It must be an even-numbered day.

47
00:01:57,815 --> 00:02:01,527
I do so prefer the odd-numbered days 
when you're kissing my ass for a favor.

48
00:02:01,594 --> 00:02:05,729
You find out why this plastic surgeon is
trying to get me sent away for killing Felix,

49
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,281
and I will make sure that all even-numbered 
days are removed from the calendar.

50
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:11,923
Did Duncan go to bed?

51
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:12,576
Yes.

52
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:15,163
And he wanted me to tell you 
to give me your undivided attention.

53
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:17,626
Pretend for a moment 
that your dog's life is at stake.

54
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,326
Hey.

55
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:24,880
Hey, maybe this so-called doctor
is a pipeline to prescription drugs.

56
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:27,943
That's how my pediatrician lost his license.

57
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,922
Well, it's pretty easy to check 
on something like that.

58
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:57,229
I found something.

59
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:57,638
What is it?

60
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:02,135
Well, the A.M.A. Website lists any disciplinary
actions taken against its members.

61
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:04,681
Apparently Dr. Griffith was reprimanded --

62
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,755
something about an inappropriate 
off-site practice.

63
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:12,020
The patient's name is Danny Boyd.

64
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:12,928
What does that mean?

65
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:14,224
I don't know.

66
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:16,224
But I'll check it out tomorrow.

67
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:21,552
Hey, man, you got the stuff in yet?

68
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,704
I'm, like, wondering if I need
to take my business elsewhere.

69
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:27,706
What stuff?

70
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,908
I, uh, ordered an eight ball.

71
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:30,910
Coke?

72
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,980
Who am I, John Delorean?

73
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:36,202
I never sold coke to you, man.

74
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,503
Hey, this is a $200 shirt, man!

75
00:03:41,632 --> 00:03:42,343
Really?

76
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,030
It's missing some buttons.

77
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:47,605
Hey, come on. Don't jerk me around. 
I paid one of you biker guys.

78
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,685
Oh, yeah?

79
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:50,763
Describe this biker guy you paid.

80
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,899
I don't know.
He was, you know, brown.

81
00:03:57,807 --> 00:03:59,432
Hey, those are nice rims.

82
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:02,741
You know, I was thinking about
getting me some just like those.

83
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:15,129
Our son Marcos was one of
the students killed in the bus crash.

84
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:16,608
I am truly sorry.

85
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:20,865
For the past three months,
we've been grieving,

86
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:23,351
trying to put our lives back together again.

87
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,246
He -- he was our only child,
our pride and joy.

88
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:29,265
I can only imagine how 
difficult that must be.

89
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:33,206
Then try to imagine if someone was doing 
their best not to let you forget.

90
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:35,586
I'm not sure I understand.

91
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:37,969
We're being harassed,
mr. Mars.

92
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,540
Someone is breaking into our house
and leaving these.

93
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,899
Well, that's horrible.

94
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:47,104
We'll come home,

95
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,656
and the house will smell like 
the cologne that Marcos used to wear.

96
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:53,147
Marcos' pictures will be 
turned around in their frames.

97
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,644
And that's not the worst part.

98
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:59,328
We've been getting messages 
on our voice mail from our son.

99
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,807
We don't believe in ghosts,
mr. Mars.

100
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:03,623
Our son is dead.

101
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:08,099
Messages are just nonsense --

102
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:10,207
old recordings of Marcos.

103
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,295
We should just take Ned's offer, Carlos,

104
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:14,942
and sell the house.

105
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:17,068
We have nothing keeping us here.

106
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:18,234
We don't run, Maria.

107
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:20,019
That's not us.

108
00:05:24,194 --> 00:05:27,205
So, I'm assuming you want me 
to find out who's been harassing you.

109
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,128
Oh, I know who's harassing us.

110
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:30,981
I want you to find the proof.

111
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:36,730
This is it.

112
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:40,197
The owner of this dump's 
a front for plastic surgery?

113
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:42,254
Unh-unh.
You're staying here.

114
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:44,141
This takes a certain subtlety.

115
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,510
But if I need anyone punched in the face,
I'll whistle for you.

116
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,517
Danny Boyd?

117
00:05:58,871 --> 00:05:59,344
Yeah.

118
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,843
My name is Laurie Zachs.

119
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,796
I don't need to know your name, honey.

120
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:04,390
Just tell me you're 18.

121
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:05,870
Actually --

122
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,271
oh, who's kidding who?
Like I care.

123
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:10,825
Okay, uh,
the reason I'm here --

124
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:16,284
I was considering having dr. Tom Griffith 
perform a surgical procedure on me,

125
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:19,064
and I'm one of those people 
who really likes to check a doctor out.

126
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:21,018
Dr. Griffith, huh? He's a good man,

127
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:24,699
but I wouldn't go getting too crazy
'cause you don't need very much work done,

128
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,901
you know,
besides the obvious.

129
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:28,315
Yeah, thanks.

130
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:33,430
Um, I noticed he was given a medical
reprimand for a procedure he did on you,

131
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:34,556
and I just wanted to see --

132
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:35,801
did he get in trouble for that?

133
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:38,851
I'm guessing it had to do with your face.

134
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,592
You think, huh?

135
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:43,712
No. Come on. I'll show you.

136
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:10,303
Great.

137
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:12,720
I've walked right into the River Styx --

138
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:15,134
home base for the fighting fitzpatricks,

139
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,337
Neptune's first family of crime.

140
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,506
Come here.

141
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:20,832
Come here.

142
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,129
Check it out.

143
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:24,161
Take a look.

144
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,564
That's my blood.

145
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:28,914
Can you dig that?

146
00:07:29,544 --> 00:07:31,634
What happened?

147
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:33,201
It was a little bar fight.

148
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,655
Yeah, you should see the other guy.

149
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,851
I got 45 stitches.
Good as new.

150
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:40,205
A plastic surgeon did that?

151
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:43,602
He wasn't trying to make it look pretty,
just trying to stop the bleeding.

152
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:47,355
And dr. Griffith's --
hey, liam. Liam.

153
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,868
What do you call the good doctor?

154
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:51,207
He's kind of like a 
"friend of the family" type thing?

155
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,274
My niece Molly -- she saw the blood, 
she got freaked out.

156
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:56,276
And she called an ambulance.
I got three months in county.

157
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:57,875
I guess the doctor got in trouble, too, huh?

158
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:00,416
Oh, well, all's well that ends well, right?

159
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:03,328
I mean, it's a conversation piece, 
that's for sure.

160
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:04,322
Who are you?

161
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:06,894
Uh, Laurie.
Her name's --

162
00:08:07,014 --> 00:08:08,483
who are you?

163
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,962
Uh, I'm Laurie.

164
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,632
She's getting some 
plastic surgery done by --

165
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:16,583
her name's not Laurie.
It's Veronica Mars. She goes to my school.

166
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:18,951
She's Keith Mars' daughter.

167
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:21,982
Go, pirates.

168
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:23,601
Veronica?

169
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:28,181
Well, you're about to tell me the real 
reason you're asking about dr. Griffith.

170
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:33,193
You lie to me again, and you really
will need a good plastic surgeon.

171
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:35,335
<i>Tonight there's gonna be trouble</i>

172
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:40,445
<i>A long time ago,</i>

173
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,851
<i>we used to be friends but I</i>

174
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:47,533
<i>haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

175
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:50,680
<i>Come on, now, sugar </i>

176
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:53,139
<i>bring it on, bring it on, yeah </i>

177
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:56,728
<i>just remember me when</i>

178
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:58,860
<i>we used to be friends</i>

179
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:01,027
<i>a long time ago</i>

180
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:03,494
<i>we used to be friends</i>

181
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:13,573
tell me why you're here, Veronica.
What, did someone send you?

182
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,191
It's -- it really is plastic surgery.

183
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:19,844
I didn't want to use my name
because it was too embarrassing.

184
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:21,197
You're a good liar.

185
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:24,281
It's gonna make things so much tougher.

186
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:41,639
Oh, all right, then.

187
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,704
That was fun.

188
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:48,081
But let's not stop there.
Monk, Monk, bring it here!

189
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:55,665
So, what's it gonna be, Veronica? Hmm?

190
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:57,459
Pink moon?

191
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:58,703
Yellow stars?

192
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:00,045
No?

193
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:01,921
A green clover or daisy?

194
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,480
I'm just gonna start in over here.

195
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:09,244
As soon as I hear something
resembling the truth... I'll stop.

196
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:09,942
Hey!

197
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,610
I've got 911 on the line.
Who can give me the address here?

198
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:15,971
No one?!

199
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,182
Yeah, I've got one of those 
ankle monitors on. Does that help?

200
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:23,923
Yeah. The River Styx.
There's blood everywhere.

201
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:25,903
Veronica, let's go.

202
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:29,470
Well, lads, let see how much damage
we can do in the next two minutes.

203
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,095
Stop!

204
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,308
I've had a very bad year.

205
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:36,835
Easy boy.

206
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:41,562
<i>so take a look at me now</i>

207
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,594
<i>so take a look at me now</i>

208
00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:47,825
<i>so take a look at me now</i>

209
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:52,360
<i>so take a look at me now... now... now</i>

210
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,102
Hey, it's okay.

211
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:15,435
You're gonna be okay.

212
00:11:15,436 --> 00:11:18,103
A gun, Logan?! A gun?!

213
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:19,408
What are you doing with a gun?!

214
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:22,499
You're gonna get yourself killed!
Don't you understand that?!

215
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:24,476
Look, it's not even loaded.

216
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:25,786
Oh, I feel so much better.

217
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:29,363
Dick's dad gave it to me.
He said given my situation --

218
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:33,506
given your situation, 
you should just move out of Neptune.

219
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:36,109
Yeah, well, no can do.

220
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:52,800
Honey?

221
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:55,648
Did you know Marcos Oliveras?

222
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:58,412
Um, should I?

223
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,605
Yeah.
He was on the bus.

224
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:03,700
Hey, are you okay?

225
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:07,238
Tough day.
But, yeah, I'm fine.

226
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:10,371
Um, what about Marcos Oliveras?

227
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:12,899
His parents were just in,

228
00:12:13,126 --> 00:12:16,306
and they're suing the school district
for negligence over their son's death.

229
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:18,457
And since they've filed the suit,
they've been harassed.

230
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:20,574
Harassed?

231
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,204
Toy buses left in their house,

232
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,583
their son's cologne lingering in the air,

233
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:28,874
phone messages from 
their dead son on the machine.

234
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:34,438
So, what, the school district administration is
harassing them to get them to drop their suit?

235
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,189
I'm sure those school administrators 
are a sinister and venal bunch, honey,

236
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,051
but in my experience,
most crime is personal --

237
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,685
not these weird conspiracies.

238
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:47,718
Well, in my experience,
that is exactly what they want you to think.

239
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:49,420
Well, all the same.

240
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:52,585
Do you mind asking around about the kid?

241
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:55,385
Marcos Oliveras?

242
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:56,718
No one?

243
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,985
No one can tell me anything?
He was in this class.

244
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:02,986
It's for an article for the navigator.

245
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:07,788
Here's the truth about Marcos.
He never said anything to anyone.

246
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:10,632
He just kind of goofed off
with the equipment and kept to himself.

247
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,372
No one really knew him.

248
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:21,588
"Marcos Oliveras -- not pictured."

249
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:25,992
What would it be like to be simply...

250
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:28,126
forgotten?

251
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:34,225
Please be Wallace again and please
be more than the brush-offy

252
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:37,537
"I just need some time to think"
he finally sent me yesterday.

253
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:39,868
No such luck.

254
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,034
I heard you're doing 
an article about Marcos.

255
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:45,693
I figured you probably 
didn't get much information,

256
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:49,509
so I wanted to send a note so 
at least you had one thing to quote.

257
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,549
Marcos was great. Kinda shy, but really
interesting once you got to know him.

258
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:58,339
Sorry not to sign this, but I've got 
a jealous boyfriend who knew...

259
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,973
- What?
- I liked him, so...

260
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:01,779
This is the third time I called this week.

261
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,829
I sent the damn thing back 
to you guys two weeks ago!

262
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:10,913
Look, I told the first person my name.
Don't you talk to each other?

263
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:14,796
You've got the serial number. You've got
everything on those damn data banks!

264
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,991
It's on the computer screen right
in front of your face! It says what?!

265
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:23,244
Oh, sorry.
My fault. Bye.

266
00:14:23,836 --> 00:14:26,369
Why must you make 
the tech-support people cry?

267
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:31,444
I found this mp3 player 
taped under mrs. Oliveras' car

268
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:34,057
playing a loop of her son's voice
over her car radio.

269
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:38,151
That's creepy...
and bizarre.

270
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,077
And it gets bizarre-er.

271
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:43,731
This was paid for by 
the Neptune school district.

272
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:47,528
You mind having 
a chat with the man tomorrow?

273
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:50,726
And I'll visit tech support, too.

274
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:59,778
It's just we're doing an article for the Navigator
on the parents' reaction to the bus crash.

275
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,503
Look, I'm just a vice-principal.

276
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:04,763
Anything I say on the subject 
has to be cleared by the principal, so --

277
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:08,346
so you're just a powerless factotum,
and I should talk to principal moorehead?

278
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:09,608
Yes.

279
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,802
Exactly.

280
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:17,519
It's a horrible tragedy.

281
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,645
I sympathize with these families, 
I really do.

282
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,372
We made settlement offers,
but the oliverases insist on suing.

283
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:29,504
Now, if they win their suit and 
the sum that they're asking for,

284
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:33,903
we're talking no band,
no art classes, fewer staff.

285
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:37,964
So, yes, we take this very seriously.

286
00:15:38,281 --> 00:15:44,838
You are aware that an mp3 player registered to the school was
found broadcasting Marcos Oliveras' voice in his mother car?

287
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,629
We would know nothing about that.

288
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:50,729
Now, if you have further questions
on the topic,

289
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:53,631
I'll just refer you 
to the district's lawyers.

290
00:15:56,104 --> 00:15:58,115
Simon and Stern --
they're big.

291
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:01,755
As I said, we take this very seriously.

292
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:05,492
So what I'm trying to figure out is,

293
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:09,193
is there any way to tell where 
or when a recording was made?

294
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:14,371
Okay, folks, that's it for me. I'm out.

295
00:16:14,604 --> 00:16:15,652
Oh, hey, this guy?

296
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:16,669
You know him?

297
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:17,861
It's Captain Krunk.

298
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:19,701
Captain Krunk?

299
00:16:19,902 --> 00:16:22,066
Yeah, he's one of the guys 
on "Ahoy Matey's."

300
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,951
"Ahoy Matey's" --
it's a pirate radio show,

301
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:26,785
this weird sort of cult thing.

302
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:28,050
There's these two guys --

303
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:30,830
Captain Krunk and Imitation Crab --

304
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,073
who just talked a lot of bizarre
smack about Neptune High.

305
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:36,652
If you knew about it,
Captain Krunk's totally a star.

306
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,954
Wait. We're talking about Marcos Oliveras.

307
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:43,673
I can't find a single person
at school who heard him talk,

308
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:46,995
and now you're telling me that
he's the Howard Stern of Neptune High?

309
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:50,106
You didn't want to get on
Captain Krunk's bad side.

310
00:16:50,471 --> 00:16:51,998
He'd tear you a new one.

311
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:53,489
<i>Trying to tell it like it is.</i>

312
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,510
<i>The truth hurts. I'm out.</i>

313
00:16:57,305 --> 00:16:58,472
"Ahoy Matey's"

314
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:03,309
540 on your A.M. Dial.
Listen or walk my enormous plank.

315
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,459
Oh, I get it.

316
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:08,077
It's not all crotch-grabbing,
scatological man humor.

317
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:09,499
There's a little something for everyone.

318
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,579
Flatulent sound effects for me?

319
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:13,367
And bitter tirades for me.

320
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:16,998
I'll download a few episodes for you.
They air every thursday.

321
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,233
What's this 4-week gap here?

322
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:21,374
Oh, they went on a little sabbatical.

323
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:22,554
Do you know why?

324
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:24,017
I suspect to torture me.

325
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,386
Then they came back, and Captain Krunk
wasn't on anymore, and it blew,

326
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:28,405
so I stopped listening.

327
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:29,504
The show's still on?

328
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:31,771
A bastardized subpar version
of the show is still on.

329
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:34,025
Any way to find out 
where they're broadcasting from?

330
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:34,825
Yes.

331
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:41,715
Sorry, I was seeing how long we could have a
conversation with your side only being questions.

332
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,206
We can track the signal.

333
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:53,113
I'd be interested to know if you had 
the capabilities to track said signal.

334
00:17:56,821 --> 00:18:00,528
Look, I'm happy to be the "Q"
to your Bond, but crime pays.

335
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:03,583
Technologically assisted mystery
solving costs.

336
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:06,190
If you want to play 
"find the crappy radio broadcast",

337
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,396
Mama's gonna need 
a few things from radio shack.

338
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:13,755
Listen and love, my friend.

339
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:18,180
And here it comes.
Imitation Crab.

340
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:22,249
The winner of this week's 
"cock of the walk" countdown --

341
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,567
don't leave them hanging, Captain.

342
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:25,701
It's Logan Echolls.

343
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,391
That's 40 weeks running.

344
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:32,683
"Rosemary's baby: The teen years."
If I was his mother, I'd kill myself, too.

345
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:35,329
Seriously, Captain,

346
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,910
you name your daughter Roxie, and it's guaranteed
at some point she'll be showing her cans for cash.

347
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:41,227
I'm saving up for that very day.

348
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:45,219
Or get a varsity jacket and four liters of
wine coolers, you can see them for free.

349
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:51,092
Yeah, Becker's a date rapist, but in his defense,
he's hideous and stupid, so meeting girls is hard.

350
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:56,359
It seems Taylor read the fine print in our
abstinence pledge and found a few... loop something?

351
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,794
Oh, right -- holes.

352
00:18:58,127 --> 00:19:00,301
Captain Krunk bagged on everyone at school.

353
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:02,045
So, what if someone found out?

354
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:05,882
Suddenly I've gone from trying
to find out if anyone might have it in

355
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:08,659
for Marcos to wondering if there's
anyone at school who doesn't.

356
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:12,794
Duncan Kane, you can't be that rich and that
pleasant without harboring a dark secret.

357
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:14,076
What do you think, Crab?

358
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:17,236
- Serial murderer? Puppy strangler?
- Girlfriend ignorer?

359
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:19,175
What's gotten into Duncan?

360
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,467
Any news on Nick Schmuck?

361
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,220
It's pretty clear, isn't it?

362
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,812
Our favorite plastic surgeon, for whatever reason,
seems to owned by the fighting fitzpatricks.

363
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,806
Well, as far as I know,
I've done nothing to get their irish up.

364
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:36,148
And I'm working on the connections, okay?

365
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,700
If you could exonerate 
me sometime soon, that'd be great.

366
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:41,763
I really don't want bottom bunk in
"fisty mcrapes a lot's" cell.

367
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,901
If you want a top,
I'm sure it's negotiable.

368
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,801
Help me, Mars-wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

369
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:00,382
I'm feeling the calculating stare,

370
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,060
but where's the villainous 
hand-wringing and maniacal laugh?

371
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:05,142
You know, you should be nicer to me.

372
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:07,661
Or you'll huff and puff 
and burn my house down?

373
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,892
You lied to me.

374
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:13,248
What, are you working 
for the fitzpatricks now? Is that it ?

375
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:14,382
Lied?

376
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:17,274
I'd be dead before I worked for those micks.

377
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:20,662
"Meth-upped lunatics," I believe,
is what you called them before,

378
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:23,002
giving me the impression 
that you didn't get along so nice.

379
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:27,898
So imagine my surprise when the new star
witness in Felix's murder case

380
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:30,482
turns out to be a fitzpatrick puppet.

381
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:32,796
They're scratching your back.

382
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:36,883
My question is, 
how are you scratching theirs?

383
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,227
Okay. I'm here.
What do we do?

384
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:45,520
You got your signal dialed in, right?

385
00:20:45,731 --> 00:20:46,279
Yep.

386
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,836
Okay, the station only has,
like, a 2-mile radius,

387
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:53,169
so just keep walking in the direction
that gives you the strongest signal.

388
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:55,838
Wait.

389
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,916
Wait if nerd hunters drive by 
and tranq and tag me?

390
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:00,881
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

391
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:04,322
Now, I'm just checking something.

392
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:07,641
Am I still in charge here?

393
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:09,633
Huh?

394
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:14,627
'Cause, you see, a couple days ago,

395
00:21:15,512 --> 00:21:19,257
some 09er comes up to me and asks me
where the coke is that he ordered.

396
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,075
He said some brown-skinned 
biker sold it to him.

397
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:27,386
And then a little birdie tells me
that the witness who came forward

398
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:31,113
in Logan Echolls' case was bought 
and paid for by the fitzpatricks.

399
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:34,151
And it gets me wondering.

400
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:37,475
Did the rules change?

401
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:39,519
Huh?

402
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,025
Are we in business with these potato heads
and I just don't know about it?

403
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,473
Did somebody here try 
to make some extra cash?

404
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,866
It's now or never, boys.

405
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:03,407
Go on.
Get out of here.

406
00:22:03,718 --> 00:22:05,379
Go scare some old ladies or something.

407
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:16,747
Do you really think someone's 
working for the micks?

408
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:19,810
I'm just asking.

409
00:22:21,594 --> 00:22:23,108
The night Felix got killed,

410
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:25,106
did you see the guy who called the cops?

411
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:27,112
No, man.

412
00:22:27,605 --> 00:22:28,795
Why not?

413
00:22:30,037 --> 00:22:30,889
You were there.

414
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:34,300
That's what you told me.

415
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:35,766
That's what you told the cops.

416
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,459
Yeah, but the cops
didn't have the whole story.

417
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:39,785
Talk.

418
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,849
You went down.

419
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:43,869
You were out.

420
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:46,061
Then after that, Felix was running the show.

421
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:49,336
Thumper, you and Dody 
get Weevil back to his house.

422
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:51,495
Go! We got to get his bike home!

423
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:53,453
Why don't you take it home?

424
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:55,981
'Cause we got an extra bike now, dog.

425
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:58,944
Sulley, go get Cervando.
You bring him back here.

426
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,987
Tell him to get Weevil's bike
back to his place. Go.

427
00:23:02,272 --> 00:23:03,194
You want to jump?

428
00:23:03,861 --> 00:23:05,144
Here's the edge, genius.

429
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:07,525
You know what I always wanted my whole life?

430
00:23:07,906 --> 00:23:09,692
A bright-yellow S.U.V.

431
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:13,678
For my surfboard...

432
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,090
and my snowboard.

433
00:23:20,228 --> 00:23:20,927
Bitching.

434
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:23,023
Ugh!

435
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:38,490
You told me you saw it.

436
00:23:38,998 --> 00:23:40,790
Hector and Bootsy was there.

437
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:41,558
What's the difference?

438
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,452
That's what happened.

439
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:45,606
Come on, Weevil.

440
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:48,148
We need as many guys as possible.

441
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:51,505
One rich white boy's word
against the two of us.

442
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:53,105
We didn't tell you to protect you.

443
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:55,753
If you didn't know,
you'd never have to lie.

444
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:58,878
One way or another,
I'm getting to the bottom of this, okay?

445
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:01,095
We're gonna find out what's true.

446
00:24:04,257 --> 00:24:07,602
The signal is strong here --
strong like a bull.

447
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,473
I think it's coming from inside the house.

448
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:11,725
Shall we?

449
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:12,841
Let's.

450
00:24:14,414 --> 00:24:16,689
Excellent work, as usual, "Q".

451
00:24:17,347 --> 00:24:19,039
Right back at you, mr. Bond.

452
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,817
You've got a plan, right?

453
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:25,133
Yes.

454
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:33,880
Miss Mars.

455
00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:36,534
I'm glad we caught you at home.

456
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,539
Would you mind if we used your phone?
We're both in a bit of a hurry.

457
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:43,662
Right.

458
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,018
Actually, we're here to see But..

459
00:24:47,858 --> 00:24:49,513
uh, Vincent.

460
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:54,070
We have some, uh, "homework" questions.

461
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,895
You are so...

462
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:01,226
...dead. I know. Whatever.
You're the one who was all,

463
00:25:01,454 --> 00:25:04,413
"let's go see what Vincent's doing.
I wonder what Vincent's up to."

464
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:09,897
I'd greatly prefer if next time
you would call first.

465
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:12,348
Okay.

466
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,319
Son?

467
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:23,576
Vincent.

468
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:27,376
Um, private basement time, remember?

469
00:25:27,716 --> 00:25:28,890
You have visitors.

470
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:32,444
Veronica Mars and her friend 
are here to see you.

471
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:33,988
Tell them I'm not home.

472
00:25:35,198 --> 00:25:36,486
They're right here, son.

473
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:43,313
Hey, Vincent, whatcha doing?

474
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:47,769
If the girls would like
some snacks and soda...

475
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:52,232
look, what are you doing here?

476
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:54,244
Well, we were hoping to bust a move,

477
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:56,118
but the song's almost over.

478
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:59,704
Look, I'm working on my models.

479
00:25:59,764 --> 00:26:02,639
So, if the paint dries,
then the color won't match.

480
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,190
I wonder why they're not
playing another song.

481
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:10,934
I want you out of here.

482
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:13,758
Why are you so crabby?

483
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,029
Um, Butters...
your blanky's blinking.

484
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,123
I have a theory.

485
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,372
Want to hear it?
Here it goes.

486
00:26:31,211 --> 00:26:33,012
You are Marcos were buds,

487
00:26:33,436 --> 00:26:36,383
and then your dad found out about 
the radio show you two did together.

488
00:26:36,687 --> 00:26:39,255
And when the Oliveras family decided to sue,

489
00:26:39,985 --> 00:26:41,110
your dad made you a deal.

490
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,794
He'd let you keep pumping up the volume,

491
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:49,955
but he'd need recordings of Marcos and
a key to his house and your radio knowledge.

492
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:53,935
What? My dad doesn't know 
anything about the show.

493
00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:56,767
A vice-principal's kid 
ragging on the school?

494
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:57,822
He would kill me.

495
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:04,866
Marcos quit the radio show more 
than a month before the bus crash. Why?

496
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:08,265
He went to camp.
It was out of the blue.

497
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:12,267
He must have gotten tossed off 
by a pony 'cause he came back all weird.

498
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,433
He called and said he wasn't
doing the show anymore.

499
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,684
Well, did you ask him why?

500
00:27:16,894 --> 00:27:17,624
Yeah.

501
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:22,241
We got together for hot cocoa and cinnamon
toast and talked all about his feelings.

502
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:25,043
Oh, like girls.

503
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,018
Captain Krunk really elevated the comedy.

504
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:31,119
All I know is, he quit.

505
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,085
Then the bus crashed,

506
00:27:33,305 --> 00:27:35,900
and I really didn't have a chance
to ask him about it after that.

507
00:27:36,938 --> 00:27:38,694
Can you go now, please?

508
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:43,603
I really think he likes me.

509
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:48,594
And that's where the recordings
of his voice come from.

510
00:27:49,146 --> 00:27:50,560
So he was on the radio.

511
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,709
I guess that's the perfect place for 
a shy kid. That's pretty enterprising, huh?

512
00:27:55,339 --> 00:28:00,048
He used the anonymity to poke fun 
at his classmates, sometimes a bit harsh.

513
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,830
It's possible he really 
offended some people,

514
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:05,528
enough to make them hold a grudge.

515
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:06,481
Come on.

516
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,953
Marcos died.

517
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:11,839
You really think a kid's gonna pursue 
revenge on a classmate's grieving parents?

518
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,708
I had my daughter 
do a little digging at school,

519
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:16,592
and she thinks something might 
have happened at summer camp --

520
00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:18,428
I'm sorry.
Your daughter thinks?

521
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,613
This isn't kids' stuff.
This isn't about summer camp.

522
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,089
It's about money.

523
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,445
Those greedy sons of bitches 
at the district are trying to shut us up.

524
00:28:26,628 --> 00:28:29,228
I just want to make sure
we look at every possibility.

525
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,153
Look, we've got three days
to settle or drop this suit.

526
00:28:34,601 --> 00:28:37,382
We know who's doing it. You just 
have to find something that proves it.

527
00:28:40,867 --> 00:28:42,802
I'm heading over to the oliveras' house.

528
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,067
It's their bowling night,

529
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,387
so I'd figured I'd do a little stakeout,
see if I can't catch the guy in the act.

530
00:28:49,112 --> 00:28:49,765
Good luck.

531
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,934
If mr. Oliveras doesn't think
camp is important,

532
00:29:01,062 --> 00:29:03,089
he's forgetting how brutal teenagers can be.

533
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,271
Here it is.
Itemized charges for july.

534
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:09,011
Camp selfquest.

535
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:13,079
Not to be mistaken for the 
elf-hunting camp of a similar name.

536
00:29:14,094 --> 00:29:18,813
"Camp Selfquest is an intensive program
for teens struggling with their sexuality.

537
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:25,054
Selfquest offers a unique plan proven to redirect
teens to a more traditional, healthier lifestyle.

538
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:28,059
Selfquest can motivate a permanent change."

539
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:30,510
Marcos was gay?

540
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:48,900
Who are you?

541
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,448
I live next door.

542
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,463
I'm just a neighbor.

543
00:29:52,498 --> 00:29:54,793
You always wait till bowling night
to come calling on your neigh...?

544
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:58,040
I came over to borrow 
a couple of beers, okay?

545
00:29:58,485 --> 00:30:02,109
My wife won't let me keep beer in the house.

546
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,254
So you come over here,
toss back a few,

547
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:12,218
maybe turn around a few pictures,
spray a little cologne?

548
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:17,049
You think your wife would ease up on you a bit if
you had enough property to extend your house?

549
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:18,470
What?

550
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:21,128
I know you're looking to buy this place.
How bad do you want it?

551
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:24,348
I came here for the beer.
Ask carlos.

552
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,646
Go get your beer.

553
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:30,403
I'm good.

554
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,977
Mr. Oliveras? Keith Mars here.

555
00:31:28,978 --> 00:31:30,194
A couple questions for you.

556
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,879
Does your neighbor routinely 
keep beer in your fridge?

557
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:35,585
He does?

558
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,017
And he has the alarm code?

559
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:39,481
Okay.

560
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:44,210
Second thing -- another toy bus appeared,
in your fish tank.

561
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:48,832
I found a scrap of paper in your wastebasket
with your alarm code written on it.

562
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:52,979
It's scribbled on the back of some 
Simon and Stern letterhead.

563
00:31:53,343 --> 00:31:54,080
Yeah.

564
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:56,936
The school district's law firm.

565
00:31:58,393 --> 00:32:00,298
I thought that would make you happy.

566
00:32:02,443 --> 00:32:04,222
Yep. I'll bring it to the deposition.

567
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:07,173
You're welcome, mr. Oliveras.

568
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,026
What is wrong with people?

569
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,237
Wake up,
sleeping beauty.

570
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:45,836
What the hell is this?

571
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,912
It's the "people's court," junior.

572
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:51,350
You're on trial 
for the murder of Felix Toombs.

573
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:54,334
Sorry I don't have a bible
for you to swear on,

574
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:57,915
but I'll get the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help me, god.

575
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,546
That's your judge and jury.

576
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,047
I'm the prosecution.

577
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:07,651
You -- you get to represent yourself.

578
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:13,993
The first question for the defendant --

579
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:19,022
what happened to Felix
that night on the bridge?

580
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:20,762
I don't know.

581
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:21,952
I don't know.

582
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,976
He's all yours, judge.

583
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,313
No! No! No!

584
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:40,639
Oh, come on, man!

585
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:42,649
One in six says you take a bullet.

586
00:33:42,746 --> 00:33:43,567
No, come on.

587
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:44,358
Come on, man!

588
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:45,663
Don't do this! Come on!

589
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:46,738
What, are you crazy?!

590
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:48,853
Oh, jesus!

591
00:33:50,365 --> 00:33:51,286
I'll ask you again.

592
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:51,916
Look, I --

593
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:54,769
- what happened?!
- I can't remember, okay?

594
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:56,785
I swear to god, I can't remember.

595
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:59,228
Damn it, man! I'm telling you the truth!

596
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:02,497
You're a killer, aren't you, boy?
Just like your old man.

597
00:34:03,464 --> 00:34:04,349
Oh, god.

598
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:06,506
Please! Pl--

599
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,039
no! No!

600
00:34:08,118 --> 00:34:09,659
No, no, no, no, no! No!

601
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:13,866
Oh, stop, please.

602
00:34:14,294 --> 00:34:15,687
Okay, I don't know anything.

603
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,516
Damn it, man.
I swear.

604
00:34:18,027 --> 00:34:18,934
Don't talk to me.

605
00:34:20,287 --> 00:34:21,698
It's the judge you got to convince.

606
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,902
Please.
I'm telling the truth.

607
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:25,185
I didn't do anything!
I swear to god!

608
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,643
You know what I think the problem is?

609
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:30,992
This boy don't care about his hands.

610
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:33,415
Let's try some more valuable real estate.

611
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:36,749
Oh, come on, man. No.

612
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:37,571
No!

613
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:38,850
No! Please!

614
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:40,208
Please don't do this.

615
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,103
Come on. Please don'T.

616
00:34:42,134 --> 00:34:43,456
Please don't!

617
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:45,106
Uhh! Please!

618
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:45,967
Listen to me.

619
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:47,509
Why would I lie, you guys?

620
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:49,172
Come on, man.

621
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:49,586
Please.

622
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:51,417
We're done for the night.

623
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:02,212
Give me a hand, man.
I think he might have wet himself.

624
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:43,355
Is it done?

625
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:46,353
Oh, it's just getting started, weevs.

626
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:50,487
You have no idea the hell
you just brought on yourself.

627
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:59,287
Fish sticks and chocolate milk.
Yuck. That can't be good for you.

628
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:00,770
Can you graduate already?

629
00:36:01,512 --> 00:36:03,947
What did Marcos tell you
about Camp Selfquest?

630
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:05,736
What the hell is Camp Selfquest?

631
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,262
It's the deprogramming camp
Marcos' parents sent him to.

632
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,146
You know, to make him un-gay.

633
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,323
Marcos wasn't gay.

634
00:36:14,764 --> 00:36:15,928
You sure about that?

635
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:17,154
Positive.

636
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:19,370
He talked about chicks all the time.

637
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:23,625
He wasn't a fairy.
He was playboy-loving booty hound.

638
00:36:25,078 --> 00:36:26,829
Do me a favor.
Never describe me.

639
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:30,590
He was all about girls --
all the time.

640
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,746
He almost got his ass kicked for it once.

641
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:34,092
By the girl?

642
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:36,429
By her jealous boyfriend.

643
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:39,314
Okay. Okay.

644
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:47,887
"Sorry, but I've got a jealous 
boyfriend who knew I liked him, so."

645
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:51,230
Maybe the secret admirer
can give me an answer.

646
00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:54,398
"Free concert tickets 
for high school students.

647
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:58,618
The radio broadcast alliance is seeking 
students for a survey in concert promoting.

648
00:36:58,905 --> 00:37:03,945
To apply, please call
619-555-0127 immediately."

649
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:07,842
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

650
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:08,702
That's fine.

651
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:11,664
Our lawyer said there'd be a few 
papers that you'd have to sign for us

652
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:13,968
in addition to testifying 
about what you discovered.

653
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:16,165
Excuse us a second.

654
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:26,173
Before I'm deposed, 
there's something I need cleared up.

655
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:27,474
What's that, Keith?

656
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:29,799
I found fish food floating in the aquarium.

657
00:37:30,203 --> 00:37:32,351
For the life of me,
I can't make sense out of it.

658
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,164
I suppose the guy who broke in decided to...

659
00:37:38,274 --> 00:37:39,132
feed the fish.

660
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:50,582
I know this harassment - whatever the 
cause - must have been terrible for you.

661
00:37:52,406 --> 00:37:54,594
And I feel bad I didn't 
catch him red-handed.

662
00:37:55,813 --> 00:38:01,592
But I can't help but wonder if someone left that
last toy bus and that scrap of paper for me to find.

663
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:08,385
I'm afraid you don't want me
testifying, mr. Oliveras.

664
00:38:09,712 --> 00:38:11,220
I suggest you take the settlement.

665
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:24,109
Hello?

666
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:25,811
Radio broadcast alliance.

667
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:35,221
One reverse phone book later,

668
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:37,800
and I've got the address of
Marcos' secret admirer...

669
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:43,309
and hopefully the not-so-loyal girlfriend
of the crazy, jealous boyfriend.

670
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:47,264
Veronica Mars.

671
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:48,346
Roxie.

672
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,285
I have a couple questions for you
about Marcos Oliveras.

673
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:52,625
What about him?

674
00:38:53,576 --> 00:38:54,777
Come on. Don't play coy.

675
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,231
You sent me an e-mail.

676
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:57,964
You called and hung up.

677
00:38:58,219 --> 00:38:59,073
No, I didn't.

678
00:38:59,782 --> 00:39:02,197
Ryan, you didn't forget
my milk shake, did you?

679
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:04,880
Do you have an idiot brother, too?

680
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:13,424
You can get me later.

681
00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:16,087
Ryan, I think I'll get you right now.

682
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:20,352
I used to listen to the show religiously.

683
00:39:21,514 --> 00:39:22,917
I didn't know Marcos at school.

684
00:39:23,605 --> 00:39:24,883
I-I just knew who he was on the radio.

685
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,078
I was pretty much in love with him.

686
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:31,150
Marcos and Butters --

687
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,470
they signed out this reverb
Mike from broadcast journalism.

688
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,182
I heard it used in the show,

689
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,220
so I knew it was them.

690
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:38,667
I told them I was a fan.

691
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,781
Thus began our beautiful friendship.

692
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:44,062
So, you guys were like a couple?

693
00:39:45,157 --> 00:39:45,822
I wish.

694
00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:50,025
More like I was madly in love and 100% gay,

695
00:39:50,026 --> 00:39:54,271
and he liked me as a friend 
and was sexually on the fence.

696
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,401
I kept trying to subtly push him over.

697
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:00,925
I was giving him a back rub this one time,

698
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:03,084
and his parents came in.

699
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,875
For some reason, seeing their shirtless son
with a boy straddling him was upsetting.

700
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:15,585
They shipped him off to camp homophoby
and made him promise to never see me again

701
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,215
And then he died.

702
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:21,148
No.

703
00:40:22,865 --> 00:40:25,606
And then he was forced to do normal things,

704
00:40:27,246 --> 00:40:28,908
like go on field trips to baseball games.

705
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:31,911
Marcos is dead for one reason --

706
00:40:33,057 --> 00:40:35,129
because he was desperate
to win back his parents.

707
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:40,389
Still, the Oliverases lost their son.

708
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,868
Those pranks really hurt them.

709
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,512
Good.

710
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,117
That was the idea.

711
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:51,095
I'm sorry I've been so out of it lately.

712
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,218
I guess it's just 
a confusing time, you know?

713
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:56,999
I don't know why you're so confused.

714
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:04,428
You either want to save me, or you don'T.

715
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:07,110
You know you're the only one who can.

716
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,947

717
