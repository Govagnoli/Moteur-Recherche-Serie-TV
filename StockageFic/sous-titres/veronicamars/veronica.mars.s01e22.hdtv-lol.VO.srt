Previously on Veronica Mars

2
00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:03,924
- Stop by the office and we'll finish up.
- Finish up?

3
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:06,430
- I'm referring to the reward.
- Veronica and I had an arrangement.

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,427
I'm a murderer and a rapist now.
I slept with you.

5
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:11,804
- Well what about that is so wrong?
- 'Cause you're my sister.

6
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:15,453
I know you were with Abel Koontz at the time
he supposedly murdered Lilly Kane.

7
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:18,297
- You think they're serious.
- It won't last long. My mom's in rehab.

8
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:19,807
When she gets cleaned up, she's coming home.

9
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:21,885
If you think you're going to lay a hand
on her the way you did Lilly...

10
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,741
Don't you even say her name.

11
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:28,151
- You learned that from Lilly.
- No, Lilly learned that from me.

12
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:33,580
Now, let me make sure I'm hearing this correctly.

13
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:39,521
Abel Koontz couldn't have killed Lilly Kane
because at the time of the murder,
he was in the company of Miss, um·

14
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:41,306
Cheyenne.

15
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:43,629
- Cheyenne.
- Deborah Collins, yes.

16
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:47,595
Keith, even if I did believe your story which,
at the moment I don't,

17
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:50,491
there's no way top brass
would risk a story like this.

18
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:53,674
If is turned out to not be true,
we'd become a national joke.

19
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:55,258
Well, we tried.

20
00:00:55,258 --> 00:00:57,101
It is true.

21
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:01,234
I'm serving up the story of your lifetime, Lloyd.

22
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:07,278
Look, Keith, I can't risk my career because
of testimony, all due respect, of a hooker.

23
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:10,999
Well, there's more, a lot more.
You read it.

24
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:13,909
If you think there's merit,
talk to Miss Collins here.

25
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:16,240
Thanks.

26
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:42,318
Hi Dad. This is so stupid.

27
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:45,008
No, I'm telling you. No tears.

28
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:48,547
Keith, the radio, 
like old times.

29
00:01:49,097 --> 00:01:50,654
It works, see.

30
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:54,370
<i>* SONG: Where the boys are *</i>

31
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,019
Keith, tacos.

32
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,270
What?

33
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,081
It's just funny to me how you always have to
have your music match your meal.

34
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,367
It is called setting a mood.

35
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:07,218
Of course.

36
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:11,754
Connie Francis is spaghetti bolognaise
with a crusty bread and a nice Chianti.

37
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:15,607
Uh, sans the Chianti.

38
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,272
Okay, say we were having
hot dogs and Tater Tots?

39
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:23,198
Late seventies southern rock,
Skynyrd, maybe Creedence.

40
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,004
- Pork chops.
- Country, old school.

41
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:28,247
Unless it's fried,
then it's Elvis, the early years.

42
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,451
<i>* SONG: Por Ti Sere *</i>

43
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:35,904
There you go, how's that?

44
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,989
<i>* Bamba bamba *</i>

45
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:37,800
Perfect.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,338
<i>* Bamba bamba *</i>

47
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:05,218
Tell me this is a joke.

48
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:08,452
You want to sue the Kane family.

49
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:10,054
Yes.

50
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:16,072
Please tell me there's another Kane family
in town. Maybe a Boris and Gilda Kane?

51
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:17,108
They'll settle.

52
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:21,292
Oh, they will. Well, that's good to hear.

53
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,189
Seems like you have this pretty well sewn up.
Anything you need me to have notarised?

54
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:31,509
There's phone records, man.

55
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,542
An-an-and how do you-
how do you explain the shoes, huh?

56
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:38,570
It doesn't mean jack.
You need to chill out, Beav, right now.

57
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:41,268
To the grave, man, that's what we said.

58
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:48,330
Since his removal from office, Keith Mars,
the ousted sheriff, has tirelessly and

59
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,828
single-handedly continued his own investigation,
despite being shunned by the community at large.

60
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:56,909
You'd think it might be gross to read a love
 letter to your dad, but I kind of enjoy it.

61
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:00,417
All I know is if I were him right now,
I'd be I-told-you-soing all over Neptune.

62
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,402
My blonde-pulling-me-into-the-
girl's-room fantasy?

63
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:08,684
Ruined!

64
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:10,372
Do me a favour?

65
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:13,040
Go outside and tell me when Logan's gone.

66
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:14,446
Okay.

67
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:16,885
How much longer
do you think you can avoid him?

68
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:25,081
I mean, believe me, the last thing
I want to do is hurt you.

69
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:31,169
If there's a chance to keep my family together,

70
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:32,975
I have to take it.

71
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:39,248
I just don't know what else to say.

72
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:44,817
You're really doing this?

73
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:47,895
Is it really what you want?

74
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,607
Everything okay?

75
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,723
Oh, it's fine.

76
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:13,085
I just had to tell Alicia
that my situation is changed.

77
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:17,561
Sorry. I know how much you care about her.

78
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,494
Yeah.

79
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:22,242
She's got to understand, though, right?
I mean with Mom coming back?

80
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:22,981
Yeah.

81
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:36,925
Don't seat the entertainment people next to the
corporate people. Right? Let's keep it civil.

82
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:40,629
Jake, honey, when did we become Republicans?

83
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:44,159
We haven't, we're, uh, we're going with the flow.

84
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,167
Besides the, uh, governor's, uh, very popular and,

85
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:49,793
uh, honestly, it's going to be good for business.

86
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:52,699
- And his social policy-
- No. Just spare me.

87
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,732
So, anyone read the paper today? Garfield.

88
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:58,710
I mean, will he ever learn?
Oh yeah, and there was this other thing.

89
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,971
I guess Abel Koontz didn't kill Lilly.
Let's open the floor for discussion on that one,
what do you say?

90
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:05,238
It's hogwash, Duncan.
It's an invention of Keith Mars.

91
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:06,869
The woman was a prostitute, for god's sake.

92
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:09,106
- Stop! Quit lying to me.
- Duncan, please.

93
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:11,005
Dad, I can't take it anymore. All the lies.

94
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:13,775
Does anyone ever tell me the truth? Ever?

95
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:16,102
You treat me like I'm six years old, 
you always have.

96
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:21,346
You wanna know, Duncan? 
You want to know everything?

97
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:22,670
Jake, no!

98
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,166
Yeah, I wanna know.

99
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:31,313
You did it, son. You had a fit.

100
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,225
You killed your sister.

101
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,407
Duncan. Duncan, come inside.

102
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:41,566
Duncan!

103
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:47,410
Duncan!

104
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:52,095
Lilly?

105
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:03,666
Look, it was an accident, Duncan. 
We know it was.

106
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,358
You didn't know what you were doing.

107
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:11,400
You loved your sister. 
We've done this for you, son,

108
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,575
so you could have a future.

109
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:19,045
Keith Mars is suing us. We've been served.

110
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:28,551
Hello?

111
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,598
Beaver?

112
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,974
It's, uh, it's Cassidy. My real name's Cassidy.

113
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,188
What can I do for you Cassidy?

114
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:42,226
Well, there's something that you should know,
it's for your own good.

115
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,519
Spill.

116
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:47,393
Well, the weekend that Lilly was killed, me,
Dick and Logan, we were down in Mexico, surfing.

117
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:48,588
I know this.

118
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:51,265
Yeah, well Logan, he, uh, he got-he got

119
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:54,647
all worked up, you know, talking about
how he that Lilly was seeing somebody new.

120
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:57,131
Yeah.

121
00:07:58,105 --> 00:08:00,232
So he got up early that morning,

122
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:05,862
the day that Lilly was murdered, 
he drove back to Neptune to see her.

123
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:15,395
Beaver said that Logan had bought 
Lilly a shot glass

124
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,679
that he found in a tourist shop down there.

125
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,376
Does that seem odd to you?

126
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:22,306
Not that odd. Lilly collected shot glasses.

127
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:26,036
Beaver said it said "I got baked in Ensenada"

128
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:27,915
and she would have loved it.

129
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,282
Are you all right, honey?

130
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,887
Yeah, just Logan.

131
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,036
Baked in Ensenada! Veronica!

132
00:08:39,036 --> 00:08:41,543
<i>* SONG: C'mon baby be my bad boyfriend *</i>

133
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:42,724
What are you looking for?

134
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,547
This. It's an inventory of everything

135
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:48,304
in Lilly's bedroom, everything in Lilly's car.

136
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:51,454
Shot glass.

137
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:56,072
Baked in Ensenada. It's here, it was in her car.

138
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:58,081
You know what this means?

139
00:08:58,854 --> 00:09:01,756
Means Logan found Lilly.

140
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:13,326
<i> * SONG: I've got something special 
for my bad boyfriend*</i>

141
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:15,216
Hey.

142
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:22,086
Oh. I exist? Thought I felt different today.

143
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:23,684
I've been avoiding you.

144
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:26,923
Really? I hadn't noticed.

145
00:09:26,923 --> 00:09:29,410
I'm sorry. I freaked out.

146
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,966
That night in the guest house, we were like

147
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:36,096
crossing over into something and I-I don't know,

148
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:37,714
all of a sudden I just felt really weird and guilty

149
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:40,089
and I started thinking about Duncan and about

150
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:41,644
Lilly and

151
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:45,047
it wasn't the easiest night to begin with.

152
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:46,904
I know.

153
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:48,427
I just couldn't deal.

154
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:51,267
Well, you could've told me.

155
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,452
No, I mean even if you just said
I can't deal but you bolt

156
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,522
and you dodge me for a couple days

157
00:09:57,522 --> 00:09:58,720
It's what I do.

158
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,586
When things get out of control, I need to be alone.

159
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,236
Listen, you know, I am freaked out, too,

160
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:07,371
you know, this whole Abel Koontz thing.

161
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:09,576
Knowing what we do about Duncan.

162
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,187
I don't want to believe it could have been him

163
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:14,483
but it's-it's like the only thing
that makes sense, right?

164
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:16,194
I don't know.

165
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:19,854
I have this feeling that things
are gonna get really bad.

166
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:21,427
Yeah?

167
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:26,734
Don't run out on me again, okay, I mean,

168
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,230
if you need to do whatever, you just let me know.

169
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,355
I need to do whatever.

170
00:10:31,355 --> 00:10:33,528
Just for a couple of days and then I'll be

171
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:37,641
back to normal or as close to normal as I can get.

172
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:40,008
Okay.

173
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:47,282
You know where to find me.

174
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:58,206
It's me. I just ran into Logan. I know, I know.

175
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:02,858
I couldn't help it. He's trying to pin it on Duncan.

176
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,514
Any news on Tijuana?

177
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:06,222
The Border Patrol got back to me.

178
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:09,357
Logan's car crossed the border at 8:57am

179
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:11,198
on the day Lilly was murdered.

180
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:13,934
Beaver was telling the truth.

181
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:17,112
He had plenty of time to get back
to Neptune and kill her.

182
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:18,450
Okay, I'll see you later.

183
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,611
Hey, are you okay?

184
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:20,557
No, I'm fine.

185
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:21,645
Love you.

186
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:22,707
Love you too.

187
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:30,383
That's not what it sounded like.

188
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:34,695
It sounded a lot like Logan killed Lilly.

189
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:38,298
These rich boys think they can
get away with anything, don't they.

190
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:44,798
Miss Mars may have agreed to help find your son

191
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:47,279
but it was Mr Mars, a licensed private investigator

192
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,589
who located him and ensured his safe return.

193
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,668
I'd be happy to give Mr Mars a cheque right now.

194
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:52,729
And the condition?

195
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:56,476
Veronica relinquishes any future claim
to the Kane estate.

196
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:59,151
Contracts are prepared;
all we need is your daughter's signature.

197
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:03,925
Future claims? So what, she slips and falls
outside Kane Enterprises; tough toenails?

198
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:08,255
Yeah, I guess now is a good time to protect your
assets with the Abel Koontz witness coming forward.

199
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:10,799
I'm sure you'll encourage your daughter
to do the right thing.

200
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,125
Oh, believe me, I'm willing to make this deal.

201
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,874
But I'll let Veronica make the decision

202
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,197
once I figure out how to explain it to her.

203
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:21,957
Keith, we both know your daughter knows exactly
why she's being asked to sign this.

204
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:25,385
And we both know it's better
for everyone if she does.

205
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:35,963
You're not trying to burn a hole through a stack
of paper using only the power of your stare again?

206
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,056
Hey, sweetheart.

207
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:42,679
Have a seat a minute;
I have to talk to you.

208
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:46,101
I met with Celeste Kane today.

209
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,127
She's paying you double and
sponsoring our club membership?

210
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:54,866
Well, she actually agreed to pay up
but only if you sign this contract that says

211
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,767
that you'll never sue them again.

212
00:12:56,767 --> 00:13:00,663
She wants you to waive any claim
on the Kane fortune.

213
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:14,421
What? Was I supposed to sign in blood?

214
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:16,495
Do you know what you just signed away?

215
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,328
There's nothing that I want from them.

216
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:24,217
Nothing. You didn't sign away a thing.

217
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:30,030
Veronica, I am without a doubt your father.

218
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:46,648
Oh! Yeah, you are!

219
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:50,602
You think that charm of yours is
learned behaviour? That's genetics, baby!

220
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,544
I say we put a dent in that
fifty grand and celebrate.

221
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:04,738
Actually, honey, this new information we have
on Logan, his alibi is completely blown.

222
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:08,768
I think we can finally go to the authorities.

223
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:13,598
Um-hm.

224
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:19,846
Afternoon, sir.

225
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:21,629
Sheriff. Can I help you with something?

226
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,986
You can show me to your son's room.

227
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:25,470
We're gonna need to search it.

228
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,159
What do you want with my son?

229
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,068
Some new information has come up
regarding the Lilly Kane murder case.

230
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:33,290
We're gonna follow up. Routine.

231
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:35,611
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't just barge in here!

232
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:38,328
Now, come on now.
You've been in like, what, thirty cop movies?

233
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:40,521
Hey, make sure you check
the air conditioning vents.

234
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:41,785
Got you, boss.

235
00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:46,110
Our snitch says these crafty little buggers today;
they hide things in the vents.

236
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,165
Wait a minute, wait a minute. W-where's my son?

237
00:15:01,938 --> 00:15:03,509
Logan Echolls?

238
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:06,199
Yeah. What's going on?

239
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,457
We'd like you to come with us
down to the station, please.

240
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:11,246
We have a few questions we'd like to ask you.

241
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,586
You said you were in Mexico
the day of Lilly's murder. Why?

242
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:21,859
How many episodes of "NYPD Blue" did you have to
watch to get the finger tapping down?

243
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:25,041
- I asked you a question.
- And I ignored it and moved on. Keep up.

244
00:15:25,914 --> 00:15:28,568
Do I look like I am playing around with you?

245
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:30,273
So how 'bout that phone call, huh?

246
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:31,689
Whoops.

247
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:33,368
What, you didn't read the manual?

248
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:37,819
Okay, I get a phone call, it's the law.

249
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:40,095
Your daddy's already sending a lawyer.

250
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:43,196
Go ahead.

251
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:48,726
Hey, it's me.

252
00:15:48,726 --> 00:15:51,069
<i> Hey, I'm in kind of a jam.</i>

253
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:55,805
<i> Yeah, I'm here at the lovely
sheriff's department, being grilled·</i>

254
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:58,132
Without representation I might add.

255
00:15:58,132 --> 00:16:01,378
Hey, do you think, uh,
you could track down my father,

256
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,916
maybe work some of that Veronica magic
that gets people out of these things?

257
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,170
Sure. I'll do whatever I can.

258
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,483
Thanks.

259
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:12,289
Well, I'd love to chat, but I have a guest.

260
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:14,924
Talk to you later.

261
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:17,156
Okay, bye.

262
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:21,823
You called Veronica Mars.

263
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:24,561
Yeah. What's it to you?

264
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:27,368
Ah, it's funny, that's all, I just mean,

265
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:31,417
she's the one who came to me
with information about you.

266
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,655
Keith Mars, line two.

267
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:42,309
Keith. What can I do for you?

268
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:44,822
The Echolls kid. What'd you find out?

269
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:47,068
Among other things, I'm pretty sure·

270
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:48,880
<i> He's dating your daughter.</i>

271
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,362
That, uh, girl of yours...

272
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:53,717
<i> She's pretty hard-boiled, huh?</i>

273
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:55,761
Logan. Where is he now?

274
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,143
We let him go on account we didn't
have much to hold him on. He lawyered up.

275
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:01,873
<i> You know the deal.</i>

276
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,362
Lianne, where's Veronica?

277
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:07,404
She took Backup out.

278
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:21,687
So, I guess we broke up, huh?

279
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:24,298
What do you want me to say, Logan?

280
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:26,882
"Logan, I'm gonna go home and put my head

281
00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:30,362
in the oven because I can't go on living
knowing what a heartless BITCH I am."

282
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:31,374
Something like that!

283
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:33,969
So you're saying you want me dead?

284
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,723
One word from me and Backup goes for your throat.

285
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,037
Is that what you'd do, boy?

286
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:41,390
You'd tear out my throat?

287
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:48,276
Who's a man killer, huh? Who's a man killer?

288
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:51,501
You know, I,

289
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:55,350
I knew Lilly was seeing someone.

290
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,465
It was driving me crazy.

291
00:17:57,465 --> 00:18:01,405
When I left for Neptune, I didn't know if I was
gonna scream at her for treating me like dirt

292
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:03,241
or beg her to take me back.

293
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,962
And I saw her at the carwash.

294
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,603
I didn't see you there.

295
00:18:09,603 --> 00:18:12,220
Well, I just parked across the street
and watched her.

296
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:15,428
And this feeling came over me, you know, I don't

297
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:18,867
know how to describe it but I just knew it was over.

298
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:21,935
So I sat in my car and I wrote this note to her,

299
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,299
explaining it.

300
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:24,524
Did you give it to her?

301
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:26,169
Yeah, I left it in the car.

302
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:28,196
With the shot glass.

303
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:31,221
Yeah, with the shot glass.

304
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:35,656
You know, if you read that letter,
you'd know I'd never hurt her.

305
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,588
Hey! Get away from her!

306
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,482
You get away from her, now!

307
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:47,355
I keep thinkin' that
things can't get worse, you know?

308
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:52,063
You know what? She's all yours.

309
00:18:57,056 --> 00:18:59,032
You two are dating?

310
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:01,073
Not anymore.

311
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:06,601
Dad says that though his deputies found the

312
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,496
shot glass Logan left for Lilly,

313
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:12,559
the break up letter Logan says he wrote was
never discovered.

314
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:24,977
If Lilly wanted to keep it a secret,
I have an idea where she would have kept it.

315
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:27,889
<i>LILLY: Veronica, you have to check this out.</i>

316
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:30,376
That guy I met in Italy last summer?

317
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:31,312
Yeah?

318
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:34,528
He sent me some pictures.

319
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:37,241
Doing some rewiring?

320
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,859
Celeste is a bit on the nosey side.

321
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:40,678
Yuck.

322
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:43,105
Tell me about it. I'm getting even, though.

323
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:46,543
I left phone numbers on matchbooks for Tyrone

324
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:50,503
and Leroy and Chico around the room.

325
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:52,951
Give the woman a little drama in her life.

326
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:57,376
Wait...who's Tyrone and Leroy and Chico?

327
00:19:57,376 --> 00:20:02,192
Beats me, but they seem to really upset Mom.

328
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:06,544
Lilly, those are naked photos.

329
00:20:06,544 --> 00:20:08,645
They certainly are.

330
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,965
If Lilly kept Logan's letter, that's where
she would have hidden it.

331
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:18,603
Now, what does one wear to meet the governor?

332
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:40,841
Hi, the number to the 
Hazelwood Facility in Soquel?

333
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:44,938
Wouldn't plan it without you, of course.

334
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:46,660
Dear, just take it over there.

335
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,642
We'll talk to you later.

336
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:54,508
The crab puffs are fantastic.

337
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:59,162
Smoked salmon, and the same·

338
00:21:34,688 --> 00:21:37,667
Who the hell are you? 
What are you doing in here?

339
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:39,170
Duncan, Duncan, it's me.

340
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,419
Veronica! What are you doing?

341
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:43,231
I'm looking for something.

342
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:44,883
Well, shouldn't you be looking in my room,

343
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:46,740
I mean, that's where
all the clues would be, right?

344
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,913
Yeah, yeah, come on. 
You didn't put on a whole costume,

345
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:50,587
an-and sneak into my house,

346
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:51,858
just to leave empty handed.

347
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,842
- Duncan, stop.
- No, come on let's see what you can find out.

348
00:21:53,842 --> 00:21:56,268
Really, I want you to. Find out everything.

349
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:58,008
Uh, maybe I left a confession 
on my Etch-A-Sketch.

350
00:21:58,008 --> 00:22:00,021
Duncan, Duncan, calm down, okay.

351
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:02,646
I don't think you killed Lilly, Duncan.

352
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:05,817
I think Logan did.

353
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:09,689
No, no way.

354
00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:12,103
He wasn't in Mexico the day she was killed.

355
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:15,821
Dick and Beaver lied for him.
He came back early because he found out

356
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:19,066
Lilly was seeing someone, Weevil,
I think and he admitted that much,

357
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:23,000
but he said he wrote her a letter on
the day she died that would prove his innocence.

358
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,612
I remembered Lilly
used to hide things in her air vents.

359
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:33,117
Let's see what's in there.

360
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:39,265
Well?

361
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,164
There's just these.

362
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,859
I've got a camera we can play 'em on.

363
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:02,033
Where's this?

364
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,399
Logan's. The pool house.

365
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:08,416
That's her pep squad outfit.

366
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:11,760
This is the day she died.

367
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,928
<i>Come here, lover. Time to earn your keep.</i>

368
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,984
What?

369
00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:43,303
See the other tape.

370
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,538
This one's dated October 1st.

371
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,740
Oh my god.

372
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,252
Mr Echolls?

373
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,312
I've got a secret. A good one.

374
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,612
Veronica?

375
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:42,122
I know what happened. I know what happened.

376
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:03,625
Oh, you dirty dog.

377
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,576
Lilly.

378
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:38,998
I want those tapes back!

379
00:25:38,998 --> 00:25:42,417
Mr. Echolls, hi! Sorry, Logan's not here.

380
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,186
I am not playing with you.

381
00:25:44,186 --> 00:25:47,203
Oh, really. Well, you're usually
very interested in playing with me.

382
00:25:47,203 --> 00:25:48,520
Lilly, give me the tapes, now.

383
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,886
Like, what, you don't see yourself
enough on film?

384
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:53,150
I want those tapes, you stupid little bitch.

385
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,421
Oh, I'm the stupid one?

386
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:59,436
Well, now you can just watch the tapes on
"Access Hollywood" along with the rest of America.

387
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,262
Lilly! Lilly!

388
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:39,628
Oh my god. No, no, no, Lilly,

389
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:42,666
Lilly. Lilly, Lilly, come on. Come on.

390
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:48,907
Lilly, wake up! Lilly, wake up. Wake up.

391
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:54,504
My god, wake up. Lilly, wake up.

392
00:26:59,862 --> 00:27:01,415
Duncan!

393
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:06,229
Duncan, what have you done? 
What've you done?

394
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:08,145
Lilly! Honey, baby.

395
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:10,447
What have you done? 
What have you done?

396
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:11,574
- No!
- What did you do?

397
00:27:11,574 --> 00:27:13,044
- No!
- Honey, honey!

398
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:17,811
Could he really do it?

399
00:27:17,811 --> 00:27:19,029
He's psychotic.

400
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:21,134
I watched him beat a guy into a bloody mess

401
00:27:21,134 --> 00:27:23,729
and then ask Logan how his school day was.

402
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:26,030
He beats Logan, you know?

403
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:32,580
He's here. Now. He came to meet the governor.

404
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:36,058
I have to get these tapes to my dad.

405
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:39,039
Will you help me?
You keep Aaron in your sight at all times

406
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,135
- until I call you.
- Yeah, of course.

407
00:27:41,135 --> 00:27:42,721
Hey!

408
00:27:44,838 --> 00:27:47,934
Be careful, okay.

409
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:52,285
My dad had a paternity test.

410
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:56,940
I'm not your sister.

411
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:02,963
<i> Hi, sweetheart.</i>

412
00:28:02,963 --> 00:28:04,977
Dad, it's Aaron Echolls. He did it.

413
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:07,248
<i>I have video of Lilly in his bed 
on the day she died,</i>

414
00:28:07,248 --> 00:28:08,495
<i> they were having an affair.</i>

415
00:28:08,495 --> 00:28:09,008
Where are you?

416
00:28:09,008 --> 00:28:12,068
- I'm just leaving the Kanes.
- No, you stay put. I'll be right there.

417
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:14,202
No Dad, he's here.
He's talking to the governor.

418
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:16,617
Duncan's gonna keep an eye on him, 
I'll be home in ten minutes.

419
00:28:16,617 --> 00:28:18,801
All right, you come straight home,
you don't stop for anything.

420
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:19,674
Okay.

you can do to me, huh?

427
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,764
I'll think of something.

428
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:16,401
Hey.

429
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:18,281
I can't find him.

430
00:29:18,281 --> 00:29:20,077
Did you ask around?

431
00:29:20,077 --> 00:29:22,832
I've been asking everyone
but no one knows where he is.

432
00:29:22,832 --> 00:29:26,030
Thanks, well call me if you find him.

433
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,884
Let me know when you get home, okay?

434
00:29:27,884 --> 00:29:30,413
Okay.
Bye.

435
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:44,438
Keep driving.

436
00:29:45,193 --> 00:29:48,105
Nuh, uh, uh, uh. Driving.

437
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,939
Oh. I've been looking for these.

<i> It's Veronica. Leave me a message.</i>

439
00:30:27,378 --> 00:30:28,841
Is everything okay, Keith?

440
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:31,640
Yeah, it's fine. I'll be back soon.

441
00:31:25,495 --> 00:31:29,686

<i>Veronica, dear. Where are my tapes?</i>

451
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:58,852
I'll let you out as soon as I have my tapes back.

452
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,991
No, thanks. Honestly, I feel safer in here.

453
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:04,691
Well you know, you shouldn't.

454
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,300
You wanna know something about
Joan of Arc, Veronica?

455
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,642
Huh? God didn't really talk to her.

456
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:24,673
Uh-uh. It's true, I saw it on TV.

457
00:33:24,673 --> 00:33:30,385
You know, it was one of those historical forensics
programmes. And they decided she had a brain tumour.

458
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:34,179
Burned alive. What a waste.

459
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:38,701
She thought her death meant something. 
But all it meant was she was crazy.

460
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:42,417
Think about that. Veronica. Where are the tapes?

Where are the tapes?

464
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:02,602
Where are the tapes? 
You know,

465
00:34:02,602 --> 00:34:05,861
Lilly never told me 
where the tapes were hidden either.

466
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:09,050
<i> I-I kinda think 
there's a cautionary tale in that, Veronica.</i>

467

a seventeen year-old piece of ass ruin my life!

Aaron Echolls, you have the right to remain silent.

493
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:32,573
Anything you say will be used against you in a
court of law. You have the right to an attorney.

494
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:36,653
If you can't afford an attorney, one will be
appointed to you. Do you understand these rights?

Are you okay? Where's your father?

513
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:50,552
- He's in the hospital.
- What Happened?

514
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:52,091
He's gonna be okay.

515
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:53,725
What, Veronica, what happened?

516
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:59,870
It's over now and I'll tell you the rest
in the morning. But first I need you to pack.

517
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,540
What? What do you mean?

518
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,596
You can't be here when dad comes home.

519
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:08,729
- Veronica.
- I know, Mom. I know you're not through drinking,

520
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:11,108
I know you didn't even finish rehab.

521
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:15,233
You checked yourself out 
and that was my college money.

522
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:18,558
I bet on you, and I lost.

523
00:40:18,558 --> 00:40:23,415
I've been doing that my whole life. And I'm through.

524
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:26,071
Veronica...

525
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:29,767
it's not easy.

526
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:32,206
I know it's not.

527
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,595
Hey you.

528
00:40:50,274 --> 00:40:53,746
Veronica didn't want you to be alone.

529
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:26,333
<i>* SONG: Lily I hope you 
picture me in your dreams *</i>

530
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:29,218
Isn't it better, like this?

531
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:31,745
So much better.

532
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,534
This is how it's supposed to be.

533
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:38,133
Totally.

534
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:40,489
This is how it's gonna be.

535
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:46,235
From now on. Right? Lilly?

536
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:51,158
You know how things are gonna be now, don't you?

537
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:54,023
You have to know.

538
00:41:55,475 --> 00:41:59,805
Just like this. Just like this.

539
00:42:00,807 --> 00:42:03,516
Don't forget about me, Veronica.

540
00:42:07,886 --> 00:42:10,688
I could never.

541
00:42:24,635 --> 00:42:28,465
I was hoping it would be you.
