1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:02,728
Previously on Veronica Mars…

2
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:04,934
The Lilly Kane murder case took an unexpected turn

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:07,734
as Abel Koontz fired his public appointed legal counsel.

4
00:00:07,796 --> 00:00:08,861
Guess he's ready to die.

5
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:12,794
I guess what everybody says about you is true too. That you spy on Duncan Kane.

6
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:14,975
Duncan Kane. He used to be my boyfriend.

7
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:18,328
Did you know that your dad and my mom were king and queen of the prom?

8
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:20,770
I guess they were like a couple or something.

9
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:24,641
This is an enlargement of a crime scene photo taken the night of Lilly's murder.

10
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:26,311
And I need to show you something.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,400
What are those shoes doing in Abel Koontz's possession?

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,500
Good question.

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,270
Two photos that don't add up;

14
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:38,097
there's only one person who can make sense of them

15
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:42,183
and only one person who can get me in to see that person.

16
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:43,725
Cliff McCormack.

17
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:45,552
Just the person I wanted to see.

18
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:47,252
Can I get you some coffee,

19
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:49,351
a doughnut, baked good of some sort?

20
00:00:49,438 --> 00:00:50,805
Aren't we pleasant?

21
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:53,359
You're not gonna try to sell me a raffle ticket, are ya?

22
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,272
Close.

23
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:57,149
I want you to get me onto death row to meet with Abel Koontz.

24
00:00:57,526 --> 00:01:00,625
You crazy kids. This stuff you're into;

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,443
Hula-hoops, cramming into phone booths, visiting death row inmates.

26
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:06,795
What's it going to be next month?

27
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:09,059
I'm serious. You're Koontz's lawyer.

28
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:12,181
Interesting fact; once a person confesses to a crime,

29
00:01:12,263 --> 00:01:14,716
gets sentenced to death and refuses to appeal,

30
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,901
the term becomes former lawyer.

31
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:18,360
You can get him to see me.

32
00:01:18,443 --> 00:01:22,534
He alone decides who he'll see and so far, he's seen no one.

33
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,493
Except you, his ever-loving lawyer.

34
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:29,374
Yes, me. His $20 an hour public defender.

35
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:32,779
Dershowitz, Cochrane and Shapiro were offering up their limbs

36
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,821
and he comes here for representation.

37
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:38,039
I failed criminal law and I still know that can't be good.

38
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:39,568
Tell me.

39
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,179
Do these look like the same pair of shoes to you?

40
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:45,671
Um, sure, I guess so. Why?

41
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:49,163
One of those photos was taken in Lilly's room after her murder.

42
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,763
The other is from Koontz's houseboat, two months later.

43
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:53,634
I see.

44
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:58,119
Why would Abel Koontz break back into the Kane house simply to steal a pair of shoes?

45
00:01:58,193 --> 00:02:00,755
Because he's crazy?

46
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:04,257
Your dad didn't page me, did he?

47
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:10,642
Help me get in to talk to Koontz and I'll judge whether he's crazy for myself.

48
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,345
Write him a letter stating your case, I'll make sure he gets it

49
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:15,790
and deny any involvement with what you're doing.

50
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:16,873
Thanks, Cliffy.

51
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:18,316
Um-hum, he's gonna say no.

52
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,294
You think?

53
00:02:19,484 --> 00:02:22,935
Sometimes people find it very difficult to say no to me.

54
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:38,700
Where are my clothes?

55
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:48,524
Where are my clothes?

56
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,439
Veronica, did you find your clothes, yet?

57
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:05,139
Ugh, the people can be so awful here.

58
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:08,811
Well does this towel make me look fat?

59
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:10,838
You need something to wear?

60
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:17,480
I usually have sweats in my locker. Sorry.

61
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:21,201
No, this is perfect. I just have to resist the urge to do a cartwheel.

62
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:24,099
Why don't you come have lunch with us?

63
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:25,524
You're already dressed for the occasion.

64
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:33,069
I think I'm gonna go straight home and change but thank you for this.

65
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:33,914
Really.

66
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:43,059
Number 26, have you ever done it in a car?

67
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,309
Yes.

68
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:46,904
Number 27, have you ever done it in a moving car?

69
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:48,081
Yes again.

70
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,351
Oh my god. Meg, is Veronica Mars wearing your uniform?

71
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,150
Yeah.

72
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:54,860
Better make sure she washes it.

73
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:56,130
I'd boil it if I were you.

74
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:58,066
We fear what we don't understand.

75
00:03:58,407 --> 00:03:59,878
Veronica's cool, you guys, really.

76
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:00,923
Tell that to Logan.

77
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:02,831
She put a bong in his locker and got him suspended.

78
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:05,832
What about Ashley? She told her that her dad was having an affair.

79
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:08,009
A week later her parents split up.

80
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:10,501
You're too nice, Meg. The girl's a skank.

81
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,538
Says Pam, the girl who scored a 63 on the purity test.

82
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,634
- Shut up. 
- Gosh.

83
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,723
- I did not. 
- What's a purity test?

84
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:21,726
Aw, it's this online list of questions of everything you could possibly do that's dirty or fun or illegal:

85
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:23,946
have you smoked pot, have you ever shoplifted…

86
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,902
Have you ever done a reverse cowgirl?

87
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:32,210
And then it tallies up your answers and gives you the score of what percentage pure you are.

88
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,684
The lower score, the badder you've been.

89
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,514
So if you get a 60, you're 60% pure, 40% sack jockey.

90
00:04:38,606 --> 00:04:40,398
Anything under 60's really slutty.

91
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,847
Unless you're a guy.

92
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:45,093
It was emailed to the whole school. Everyone's taking it.

93
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,110
What'd you score?

94
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:49,747
Uh, 91.

95
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:53,085
Dude, Snow White took it and scored an 89.

96
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:57,831
I think it's sexy we decided to wait.

97
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:04,626
All right, Cole.

98
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,341
Kissing on the lips now.

99
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,592
Somebody describe second base to me.

100
00:05:10,212 --> 00:05:11,312
Tell  me what it's like.

101
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,182
Is it beautiful there?

102
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:16,028
Twenty seconds, baby.

103
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:18,631
You're this excited about the super featherweight crown?

104
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:20,528
I know I'm usually so passive.

105
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,823
But our bond grows stronger every day, he-who-has-satellite-dish.

106
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,449
So, did you take the purity test.

107
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,087
Yeah, me neither.

108
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,669
Stupid, right.

109
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:34,968
What'd you score?

110
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:36,099
S eventy.

111
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:40,632
Wow, you are 30% danger-lovin', girl-touchin' rock star.

112
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:43,359
More like one point away from being cool.

113
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:44,347
Here.

114
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:48,018
Now you're a big stud. Happy?

115
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:51,207
Wallace.

116
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:54,101
Can I talk to you for a moment?

117
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:05,007
That had to worth at least two points.

118
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:12,440
I thought we talked about you hanging out with that girl.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,850
I've only heard bad things about the Mars family since we moved here.

120
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,022
Except from me.

121
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,348
We have the chance of making a fresh start in Neptune.

122
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,193
Now there have to be lots of respectable kids in your school.

123
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:30,418
I don't want you spending all your time with Veronica Mars.

124
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:34,791
I'm an angel. I'm hot.

125
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,361
Straight from heaven.

126
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,303
Did she invite me for supper?

127
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,623
Aw no, it's no big deal.

128
00:06:39,814 --> 00:06:41,806
There aren't many girls she caught flashing me.

129
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,515
Listen to this.

130
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:47,176
Not that innocent? Buy the results of anyone's purity test.

131
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:51,358
Ten dollars will let you know if you're dating an angel from heaven or a hottie from hell.

132
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:54,272
That's crazy. You can go on there and buy anyone's test?

133
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:56,277
I never thought I'd say this.

134
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,725
But I kinda can't wait for school tomorrow.

135
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:22,556
I knew when you came back from Spain last summer, there was something different about you.

136
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:26,118
Should have guessed you slept with that Hobby Air guy. You couldn't shut up about him.

137
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,347
He was our tour guide.

138
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:30,040
Oh. Was sex included in the package or was that extra?

139
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:31,721
I did not have sex with him.

140
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,068
I haven't had sex with anybody.

141
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:35,289
This is crazy; I didn't even take the test.

142
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,254
Have you ever slept with someone who spoke a language you didn't know?

143
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:43,185
Have you ever had a fling while on vacation?

144
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,790
Do you lie to protect your reputation?

145
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,750
It all makes sense, every question here.

146
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,960
You turned me into a joke.

147
00:07:54,356 --> 00:07:55,241
Thanks.

148
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:03,167
I didn't even do anything.

149
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,714
I know.

150
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:05,717
You believe me?

151
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:09,092
Meg, you're the last good person at this school.

152
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:12,618
I'd believe cartoon birds braided your hair this morning.

153
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:18,010
If you want, I can find who posted that test for you.

154
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,560
We'll clear your name and make somebody pay.

155
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:21,733
Really?

156
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,835
Unless there's a fairy godmother already on it.

157
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:09,211
Is there any way to convert cipher text to plain text without initial knowledge of the crypto-algorithms?

158
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:10,536
Ah, excuse me?

159
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:13,921
I'm trying to figure out how someone could have overridden the control framework

160
00:09:13,982 --> 00:09:16,793
on the school server in order to access everyone's password.

161
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:17,885
Can you help me?

162
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:22,707
Yeah, uh, in real life, I'm actually a gym teacher.

163
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:24,817
The person you want to talk to is Mac.

164
00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:27,412
Try the parking lot, look for the blue hair.

165
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:36,797
Damn it!

166
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:41,867
Have you ever seen that movie "Repo Man"?

167
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:46,628
Just call me Otto.

168
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:58,353
Wow. That's really criminal of you, Otto.

169
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:00,114
I'm impressed.

170
00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:01,645
Thanks.

171
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,428
I don't know why I bother locking it in the first place. It barely runs.

172
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:07,963
Mostly I just keep it around for status.

173
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:09,295
Fashizzle.

174
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,373
Check out the LeBaron.

175
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:13,474
Stylin'!

176
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,904
I'm Veronica, by the way.

177
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:16,727
Mac.

178
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:18,558
Is that 'cause you're good with computers?

179
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,718
Ah, no, 'cause my last name's MacKenzie.

180
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,487
How'd you know I was good at computers.

181
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:29,314
Every student has an email address that's easily accessible.

182
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:31,870
You're VeronicaMars@NeptuneHigh.org,

183
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,735
Meg would be MegManning@NeptuneHigh.org.

184
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:36,640
That's the easy part.

185
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,166
Anyone can buy a copy of the test but to post the results in the first place,

186
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:43,978
you need to use your password. Who has that information?

187
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,092
Only the student and the IT guy.

188
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:48,012
Neptune High School has their own IT guy?

189
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:49,287
Rene DeMois.

190
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:53,648
We share him with the entire school district but he's here Tuesday and Friday mornings.

191
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,145
You know his schedule by heart.

192
00:10:55,518 --> 00:10:57,162
I do a lot of computer stuff.

193
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,138
Plus you'll understand when you see him.

194
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:02,267
Cool. Thanks.

195
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,366
Yeah and if Rene can't help you let me know

196
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:07,961
'cause I might be able to find a way to sneak into the system and get you some answers.

197
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,992
That's really criminal.

198
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,487
Thanks.

199
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,022
Why are you holding your hands like that?

200
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:20,529
So  that one day in your memoirs, you'll describe me as inscrutable.

201
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:23,408
I was leaning more toward bonkers.

202
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:25,087
I'll take what I can get.

203
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:28,286
Ah, I guess I'll get that.

204
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:39,658
It's been over two months now and no rent.

205
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,678
You've been really great and I appreciate it.

206
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:44,902
I'm tired of being great, you know, I have my own bills to worry about.

207
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:46,811
Listen, can we talk about this later?

208
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:50,155
I had to take a painkiller for my back and I'm a little fuzzy.

209
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:53,790
That fall that I took on your front steps really wrecked me.

210
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:56,602
I think you should probably get those fixed.

211
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:08,219
From New York City to the California coast, Miss Poppum is hoping

212
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:11,783
to bring a little bit of Broadway to the beach. Meg.

213
00:12:12,469 --> 00:12:13,769
Thank you, Michael.

214
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:17,404
Auditions for "Cabaret" will be held this Friday immediately after school.

215
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,396
You're quite the actress yourself, aren't you Meg?

216
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,248
Uh, weren't you the lead in "Guys and Dolls" last spring?

217
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,120
Ah, yeah.

218
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:40,552
That was so uncool.

219
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,021
He shouldn't have gone off script.

220
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:43,276
No, it was my fault.

221
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:44,971
I'm just not myself lately.

222
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:47,792
Maybe Mrs Denton will fire him and promote you.

223
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,664
You should have been picked anyway, Kimmy. Your audition tape was awesome.

224
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,036
Thanks, Meg.

225
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:56,874
Hey, you okay?

226
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:58,855
Barely.

227
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:04,801
Boys have been calling my house, emailing me porn, slut sneezing.

228
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:05,758
What?

229
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,505
Slut!

230
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:09,972
Slut!

231
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:17,534
Okay, whoever posted those results had to have gotten hold of your password somehow.

232
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:20,053
Here's my very important question.

233
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,248
Does anyone else besides you know it?

234
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:24,467
No, no one.

235
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:27,324
Well maybe my sister Lizzie.

236
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:29,756
I mean, we're very close.

237
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:32,838
I wish I had posted it.

238
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:36,979
You have no idea what a pain in the ass it is living in that house with her.

239
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:42,300
It's all: "Meg got a scholarship, Meg keeps her room spotless,

240
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,724
Meg never got kicked out of summer camp for waking up in the swim coach's cabin."

241
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:47,717
That it?

242
00:13:47,808 --> 00:13:50,957
Unless you want to tell me you created the fake test for your sister.

243
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,858
No.

244
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,835
But you might as well blame me.

245
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:56,144
I get blamed for everything else.

246
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:02,703
Mr DeMois?

247
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:03,809
Yes?

248
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:06,492
Whoa! Um, I was-

249
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,991
Can I help you with something?

250
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,382
I hope so.

251
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:14,868
Um, my friend Julie, it's her sweet sixteen tomorrow

252
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,830
and I wanted to change her screen saver to say happy birthday, like, as a surprise,

253
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:23,285
but I don't know her password. I was told I could get it from you.

254
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:26,143
She won't mind, I promise. We're like total BFFs.

255
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,510
I don't know what that means but I cannot give you someone else's password.

256
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:32,123
They are confidential.

257
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:34,728
Am I supposed to, like, pay you or something?

258
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:37,254
I cannot give it to you. I would lose my job.

259
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,972
I'm sorry but… no way.

260
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:50,550
You can tell my brother, that's not grim 'cause if he squeals on me I'll squeal on him,

261
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:55,921
But don't tell Mama, bitte don't tell Mama,

262
00:14:56,013 --> 00:15:01,654
please, sir, don't tell Mama what you know.

263
00:15:03,248 --> 00:15:06,750
So if you see my Mommy, mum's the word!

264
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,241
Good job, Kimmy. Um, Meg? You're up.

265
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:35,329
Mama thinks I'm living in a convent

266
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:42,878
A secluded little convent in the southern part of France.

267
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:48,428
Mama doesn't even have an inkling

268
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:49,579
- We do. 
- Slut.

269
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:55,599
That I'm working in a nightclub in a pair of lacy pants.

270
00:15:58,194 --> 00:16:04,935
So please, sir if you run into my mama,

271
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:08,938
Don't reveal my indiscretion,

272
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:14,160
give a working girl a... chance.

273
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:27,692
Life is so not a cabaret.

274
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:29,310
I can't take this anymore.

275
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:32,582
This is too much. Everyone thinks I'm the biggest slut in school.

276
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:38,267
Well, second biggest.

277
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:41,876
I suppose the only surprise is that it took them this long to come after me.

278
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:47,745
Dear Mr Koontz,

279
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:54,640
my name is Ellen White and I'm a graduate student in criminology at San Diego State University.

280
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:57,394
I also happen to be from your home town.

281
00:16:57,471 --> 00:17:00,056
I would love the opportunity to talk with you.

282
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:20,663
I admit it. I splurged and spent ten bucks to read my own purity test.

283
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:24,132
Apparently I've pleasured the swim team while jacked up on goofballs.

284
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:25,226
You're back.

285
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,913
I need to change the password on my email account.

286
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:31,213
Someone managed to figure out the old one.

287
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,304
That's why your password should always include numbers as well as letters.

288
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:39,163
Everyone thinks its fun to use the name of your dog or boyfriend,

289
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:42,348
but that actually makes it easy to crack.

290
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:47,284
My old password was GJ7B!X.

291
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:51,826
Well, try and make this one a little bit tougher.

292
00:18:00,202 --> 00:18:01,917
What do you think you're doing?

293
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:03,330
What does it look like?

294
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:08,512
You are not supposed to be in here. You have a stove in your own apartment.

295
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,774
No, I don't have a stove, you see, I have a hot plate.

296
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:14,246
Jeremy, I have been about as patient with you as I'm gonna be.

297
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:16,576
Now, do you think that I charge you rent for the hell of it?

298
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,398
I rely on that money.

299
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:22,443
God! You're like this mosquito that's buzzing around my ear.

300
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:23,432
Hey,  watch it man.

301
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:27,123
You know, I can't enter my home, right, my home without being accosted.

302
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,368
Every time I make a move, I get this yappity yap in my face.

303
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,416
Yeah, all right then. Let's get this yappity yap-

304
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:35,889
Whoa, whoa. Hold on, son, hold on.

305
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,012
Go ahead.

306
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:41,121
Go ahead, make your dinner.

307
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:45,934
Come with me Wallace, come on.

308
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,044
You-you set an example for your brother, now.

309
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:49,995
That's exactly what I plan on doing, ma.

310
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:52,959
Listen to me, listen to me, come on.

311
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,790
You ready to put the hurt on that Pythagorean Theorem?

312
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,422
Oh, you don't even wanna mess with me on that today.

313
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:08,723
I just about murc'd my mom's crazy, no-rent-paying tenant this afternoon.

314
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,277
That guy's sleazy so I hope "murc'd" means something bad.

315
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,852
You know, my dad's still got that Sheriff sheen.

316
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:17,181
He's great at scaring people away.

317
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:18,390
No, I got it covered.

318
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:19,866
Seriously, you should talk to him.

319
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:23,018
Am I giving you the birds and bees again, Wallace?

320
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:25,722
Wallace's mom is having trouble with her tenant.

321
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:28,574
Dude's a bit unstable. Wallace got in a fight with him today.

322
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,799
It's really not a big deal.

323
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,688
I'll stop by, it'll take two seconds.

324
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,178
I don't even know when he'll be home, Mr Mars.

325
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,672
Wallace. It's nothing.

326
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:37,653
Just leave the address for me, will ya? 'kay?

327
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:40,145
Don't worry. It's his speciality.

328
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,753
Bustin' heads and breakin' hearts.

329
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,295
This was written in 1928…

330
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:47,887
So, I found out that this version of the purity test

331
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:51,005
was originally published in "Grind Girl" magazine.

332
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:52,684
My sister subscribes to that.

333
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:53,509
I know.

334
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:56,571
She's the only person at Neptune High who does.

335
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:59,980
Veronica. You seem to be in a sharing mood.

336
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:02,141
Why don't you tell us your position on this?

337
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:04,620
All fours.

338
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:06,647
Dick Casablancas.

339
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,600
You can see me after class.

340
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:12,437
Congratulations, Dick.

341
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,928
You just made my list.

342
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:26,676
Hi, Mrs Fennel?

343
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:29,370
I'm Keith Mars, Veronica's father.

344
00:20:29,954 --> 00:20:31,465
Your daughter's not here.

345
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,090
I know. Wallace mentioned that trouble you were having with the tenant

346
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,240
and I thought I could be some help.

347
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,294
Well, thanks, but I have it under control.

348
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,349
It's no trouble at all.

349
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:42,431
Look. If I have a problem, I'll go to the police.

350
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,064
Wallace was concerned.

351
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,060
Well, I'll tell you what.

352
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,880
I'll worry about my children, you worry about yours.

353
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:10,164
Hello.

354
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:11,627
Ellen White, please.

355
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:14,272
Speaking.

356
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:17,514
I'm calling to set up a visitation with Abel Koontz.

357
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:20,641
He's agreed to see you this Friday between two and four.

358
00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:23,768
Prison guidelines are as follows: No cameras permitted inside…

359
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,502
So now it comes out.

360
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:30,252
Meg was one of those Britney Spears virgins, huh.

361
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,593
And you were her noble Justin, just keeping it all on the down low.

362
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:38,302
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

363
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:40,725
Come on, man, we know you did.

364
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:42,839
The sweet ones always turn out to be the freakiest.

365
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,507
No, man, Meg's a good girl, really good.

366
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:47,051
Good at everything she does.

367
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:49,665
And she does do everything.

368
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:53,135
Keep it up, hot shot. Everyone's so impressed.

369
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,914
Hey, maybe I should post some of the love poems you wrote to Meg.

370
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,660
I know where she keeps 'em, you know.

371
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:00,417
Meg always said you were immature.

372
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,127
Funny. According to her purity test, you were always premature.

373
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:07,135
Shut up, Lizzie.

374
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,516
Stop talking about my sister, Cole.

375
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:10,606
You don't even like her.

376
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,531
Maybe not, but I love her.

377
00:22:16,316 --> 00:22:19,054
What's up, Veronica? Want to interrogate me some more?

378
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,688
Why, yes, I do.

379
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:24,102
I was supposed to meet Meg here after lunch. Do you know where she is?

380
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:25,557
She didn't come to school today.

381
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:27,416
Is she all right?

382
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:32,007
Let's just say my parents have stopped bugging me to be more like her.

383
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:43,768
First my dad wanted to sue the school

384
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,854
or kill whoever posted that score and then he searched my room.

385
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,585
For what? Your porn stash?

386
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:51,106
No.

387
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:55,060
There were these letters I got from a guy I met in Spain.

388
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,408
He had a crush on me and wrote all this sexy stuff.

389
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,159
Dad kind of flipped out.

390
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:02,063
Told me I was acting just like Lizzie.

391
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:03,419
That must have been fun.

392
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:08,580
After everything else, I was, I was just too decimated to make it to school today.

393
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,192
I don't see how you do it.

394
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:11,970
Do what?

395
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:12,943
Deal.

396
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,714
The way people talk about you.

397
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,488
Does it bother you, the things they say?

398
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:20,121
No.

399
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:23,014
Here's what you do.

400
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:24,755
You get tough,

401
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,403
you get even.

402
00:23:26,491 --> 00:23:27,280
Really.

403
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:29,343
Works for me.

404
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:35,072
And you are going to school tomorrow.

405
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:38,534
And you're not taking crap from anyone.

406
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:46,920
What the hell is that?

407
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:49,373
Oh my god, its gas.

408
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:50,196
Come on.

409
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:53,329
- I've got to turn it off. 
- Wait. Cover your mouth. Cover your mouth.

410
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:54,800
All right. All right.

411
00:23:56,188 --> 00:23:57,036
Hurry up.

412
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:02,813
Hurry up, hurry up.

413
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:05,737
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah, I'm okay.

414
00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:06,483
Okay.

415
00:24:06,556 --> 00:24:07,619
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah.

416
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:10,160
Well, now we have something to go to the police with.

417
00:24:10,436 --> 00:24:12,888
I'm sorry, there's really nothing I can do to help.

418
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:15,796
You're gonna need to get a lawyer involved and file an eviction notice.

419
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:18,649
Best case, he won't be out for 60 days.

420
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,032
Thanks. That's very helpful.

421
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:24,430
Yeah. You're a help.

422
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,684
- Wallace. Come on in. 
- Hello Mr Mars.

423
00:24:33,282 --> 00:24:34,947
Think I could crash on your couch tonight?

424
00:24:35,227 --> 00:24:38,443
My house is getting exterminated and we have to be out of the house for the night.

425
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:41,704
Of course. Are you hungry? We just finished supper.

426
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:42,815
Thanks, yeah.

427
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:43,620
What happened?

428
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:44,824
Nothing.

429
00:24:47,715 --> 00:24:49,537
Did you ever get over to talk to Mrs Fennel?

430
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,977
Yeah. I went over there.

431
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:54,668
Wallace's mom had a plan and I didn't want to overstep.

432
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:58,810
Overstepping is your main form of transportation.

433
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:03,751
You know, I have to go back to the office and grab some stuff.

434
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,195
My mom thinks I'm staying at Norman's house.

435
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:12,998
Who's Norman?

436
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:17,457
Norman is my imaginary, straight-A, eagle-scout, mama's-boy, friend.

437
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,659
He sounds boring for an imaginary friend.

438
00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:21,134
Mom seems to like him.

439
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:24,917
I guess she'd freak out if she knew you were staying at a girl's house, huh?

440
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,185
What?

441
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:29,961
Not the flashing thing again?

442
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:33,033
Let's just say the old biddies over at the Kane Software rumour mill

443
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:34,825
are filling her head with a lot of garbage.

444
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,876
Not a big fan of the Mars family, huh?

445
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,305
I know. It's whack.

446
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:44,450
I get it. It's fine.

447
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:49,863
Want some popcorn?

448
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:50,990
Yeah, thanks.

449
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,311
Does it ever bother me, what people say?

450
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,637
Okay, maybe once and a while.

451
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,417
Depends who's listening.

452
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:35,292
Who the hell are you?

453
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:37,494
So you are moving out.

454
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:42,569
You have until, let's say, um, 6am.

455
00:26:42,656 --> 00:26:47,063
That gives you, oh, six hours to pack up all your stuff.

456
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,540
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

457
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,084
6am, big boy.

458
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:08,036
Time to get going.

459
00:27:08,158 --> 00:27:09,557
You can't be in here.

460
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:10,975
You think you're pretty clever, huh?

461
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:15,546
Taking advantage of a single mom, sixteen-year-old kid, huh?

462
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:18,511
Okay, well, it's over.

463
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:21,399
You're out.

464
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:22,806
This is my apartment.

465
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,694
It stopped being your apartment two minutes ago.

466
00:27:27,184 --> 00:27:28,440
So what do you think?

467
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:33,246
You ready to impress me with your nuttiness, 'cause I hear that's your schtick.

468
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,106
Come on, son, perform for me.

469
00:27:35,264 --> 00:27:37,803
Let's see the show, let's see if you can scare me.

470
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:42,288
Is that it, is that all you got?

471
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,923
That's nothing.

472
00:27:47,203 --> 00:27:48,611
You wanna see crazy?

473
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,869
You pay attention, 'cause this is gonna get good.

474
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,370
See that was crazy. Now I want you to pack your bags and get out.

475
00:28:11,687 --> 00:28:14,007
You're never to bother Mrs Fennel again.

476
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:18,205
You don't talk to her, you don't drop by, you never lived here, right?

477
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:20,119
Right?

478
00:28:20,218 --> 00:28:20,940
Right.

479
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:40,702
Could you use your investigative skill to find my keys?

480
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,973
You got breakfast?

481
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,567
Don't act like this isn't usual, Wallace will think I did it for him.

482
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,576
I know you did.

483
00:28:53,073 --> 00:28:54,261
Have you seen my keys?

484
00:28:57,476 --> 00:28:58,750
Well, what do you know?

485
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:01,787
The last place you'd think to look.

486
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:07,292
Ten bucks a pop, man.

487
00:29:07,618 --> 00:29:09,442
Somebody's getting rich.

488
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:12,622
I know some kids who have ordered dozens.

489
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:13,711
Did you order any?

490
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:16,425
Think that I have ten dollars to spare?

491
00:29:16,932 --> 00:29:18,453
You've seen my car, right?

492
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:22,498
Can you email me the dummy corporation info anyway?

493
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:23,588
There might be something.

494
00:29:41,402 --> 00:29:43,634
The computer won't let me access my account.

495
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,284
Somebody's logged on as you right now.

496
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,588
It says they're on a computer in the journalism room.

497
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:19,003
So how hush-hush are the contents of your mailbox?

498
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,085
Just homework and class schedules. Anything on the QT,

499
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:24,588
I keep in my personal email, not my Neptune-

500
00:30:25,161 --> 00:30:26,102
Oh god.

501
00:30:26,822 --> 00:30:27,605
What?

502
00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:30,123
My outbox.

503
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:34,577
There's an email from me to my ex-boyfriend.

504
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:36,064
Duncan Kane?

505
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:39,453
You used to be all anyone gossiped about.

506
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,582
You still are, just…

507
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,764
in a different way.

508
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,196
So what does it say?

509
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:51,568
Dear Duncan. I want you to know that I still love you very much

510
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:53,834
and I think about you constantly.

511
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:56,297
Every time I see you, my heart breaks.

512
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,800
I need to tell you that when we were dating I had VD.

513
00:31:00,236 --> 00:31:02,703
I hope you didn't catch anything from me…

514
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,067
Am I naked?

515
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,297
Because in my nightmares, I'm usually naked.

516
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:16,705
Someone wants to chat with whoever's pretending to be you.

517
00:31:20,608 --> 00:31:23,204
They think I'm still whoever was on my account.

518
00:31:23,265 --> 00:31:24,555
But the bell's rung.

519
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:28,441
They'd know that whoever it is would have left for their next class.

520
00:31:29,413 --> 00:31:31,205
Unless they're not at school.

521
00:31:33,336 --> 00:31:37,196
Can you get a password for me?

522
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:43,104
Another one?

523
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:46,366
We have all the information we need.

524
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:52,120
We do? Wait, Veronica. Who is Froggy, do we know? Who's Froggy?

525
00:31:55,815 --> 00:31:59,486
There's just one frog who knows everyone at Neptune High's password

526
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,596
and I followed him to the low rent version of Lovers' Lane,

527
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:07,563
Inspiration Rock Quarry and while there's nothing more satisfying than solving a case,

528
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:12,505
there's something seedy about being the interruptus in someone else's coitus.

529
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:23,482
Who would want to sully the reputation of the nicest girl in school?

530
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:26,257
Cole, the sexually deprived boyfriend?

531
00:32:26,456 --> 00:32:30,486
Pam, the type-A tightass debutante?

532
00:32:33,363 --> 00:32:36,963
Lizzie, the oversexed overlooked little sister?

533
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:43,588
Or single white female, Kimmy?

534
00:32:46,261 --> 00:32:48,089
Hey, Kimmy, check this out.

535
00:32:48,191 --> 00:32:51,591
I followed our IT guy around last night. Guess where he ended up.

536
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,751
Oh my god.

537
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:57,239
I heard the purity test website is gonna start posting pictures to illustrate the questions.

538
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,081
Wouldn't these be perfect? Look.

539
00:33:00,336 --> 00:33:02,481
Number 23, have you ever touched it?

540
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,741
Well, I guess you have.

541
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:07,525
This here's a stellar example of number 78 and this one, whoa,

542
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,906
I think my score went down just looking at that.

543
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:13,147
Although it would be hard to score below a 14, wouldn't it Kimmy.

544
00:33:13,214 --> 00:33:14,212
Why are you doing this?

545
00:33:14,298 --> 00:33:16,028
Because you messed with the wrong person.

546
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:18,395
You don't even know me and you posted that test for me.

547
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:19,849
- No, I didn't. 
- Stop lying.

548
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:21,984
I know you got my password from Rene.

549
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:24,616
You know, he's 23, you're 17.

550
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,843
I don't think they allow conjugal visits in prison.

551
00:33:26,925 --> 00:33:28,262
Please, it wasn't me.

552
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,235
Then who was it?

553
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:30,398
It was Pam.

554
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:33,592
Pam posted the test for you.

555
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:36,407
She hates you because Duncan is still hung up on you.

556
00:33:36,826 --> 00:33:38,840
I only posted Meg's, I swear.

557
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:40,180
Why would you do that?

558
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:42,941
She gets everything I want. Everything.

559
00:33:43,094 --> 00:33:46,269
The lead in the musical, cheerleader, the anchor job.

560
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,138
Thanks, Kimmy.

561
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:49,811
What did you-

562
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:52,633
Oh, god.

563
00:33:55,214 --> 00:33:59,003
So, your boyfriend was the one running the purity test website, right?

564
00:33:59,090 --> 00:33:59,704
No!

565
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,263
Kimmy, why do you insist on pissing me off?

566
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,153
You and Pam aren't smart enough to pull that off.

567
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,136
Seriously!

568
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:07,619
He didn't even know why I wanted the passwords.

569
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:10,082
I don't think he even knows the purity test exists.

570
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,289
Wait, what are you gonna do with that tape?

571
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:22,367
This is the debate club piece, the school board meeting and the lacrosse team.

572
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:23,385
Okay, no problem.

573
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:24,582
Hurry Meg.

574
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:29,472
Any you're live in five, four, three, two…

575
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:34,116
Last night's victory continued the winning streak for the Pirate lacrosse team.

576
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:35,830
Kevin Stockland has a story.

577
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,301
Please, it wasn't me.

578
00:34:37,403 --> 00:34:38,386
Then who was it?

579
00:34:38,472 --> 00:34:39,532
It was Pam.

580
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:42,492
Pam posted the test for you.

581
00:34:42,636 --> 00:34:45,205
She hates you because Duncan is still hung up on you.

582
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,483
Note to self, cue tape for client.

583
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:50,581
I only posted Meg's, I swear.

584
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:52,686
Why would you do that?

585
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:55,614
She gets everything I want. Everything.

586
00:34:55,712 --> 00:34:59,168
The lead in the musical, cheerleader, the anchor job.

587
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,641
Thanks, Kimmy.

588
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:03,570
What did you-

589
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:08,947
And last night's lacrosse match with the Point Pleasant Raiders…

590
00:35:08,993 --> 00:35:11,245
You dumb wanna-be freak show.

591
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:12,204
I had to tell her.

592
00:35:12,296 --> 00:35:14,696
Of course you did. Because you're spineless.

593
00:35:15,552 --> 00:35:18,977
Please start crying 'cause you're not pathetic enough already.

594
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:23,119
Nice hair cut by the way. Does Meg know you bring her picture to Fantastic Sam's?

595
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,440
Very dramatic, Kimmy.

596
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:29,802
Very Meg.

597
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:36,166
What?

598
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,445
All fours, huh, Dick?

599
00:35:43,676 --> 00:35:44,936
You mess with the bull.

600
00:35:54,344 --> 00:35:58,105
There was really only one person smart enough to set up the purity test.

601
00:35:58,176 --> 00:36:02,503
How can I resent someone who took sex-crazed 09ers for their allowance money?

602
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:05,067
I was looking for a white horse.

603
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:08,001
Ooh. So now I'm your knight in shining armour?

604
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:09,005
Pretty much.

605
00:36:09,205 --> 00:36:13,214
All of a sudden everyone's running up to me saying how they never believed I did those things.

606
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:15,590
Cole, even. Not that I care.

607
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,065
I'm glad.

608
00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:20,602
Funny. No one's come running up to me.

609
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:23,131
It's because people are afraid of you.

610
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,744
Then something's working.

611
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:26,665
Getting tough?

612
00:36:27,274 --> 00:36:28,938
Yeah, that was good advice.

613
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:30,253
And I needed that.

614
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,776
The getting even part?

615
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:35,865
You might want to rethink that one.

616
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,890
You do have friends, Veronica.

617
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:53,468
Duncan, hey.

618
00:36:54,523 --> 00:36:55,312
Hey.

619
00:36:55,848 --> 00:37:00,712
Somebody stole my computer password and used it to sent fake emails from me to you

620
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,145
so I don't have VD, I've never had VD

621
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:05,008
and I don't still love you.

622
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:07,252
Just so that you know.

623
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:13,278
Good. 'Cause, I'm not, you know, still hung up on you or anything.

624
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,619
I never thought you were.

625
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,064
Wait. You don't have VD?

626
00:37:22,147 --> 00:37:24,112
'Cause I keep getting this thing on my lip

627
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,569
and I'm not sure who I could've gotten it from…

628
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:47,250
So. My tenant moved out.

629
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:50,532
Wallace said I have you to thank for it.

630
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:56,752
I know how the law works. Slowly.

631
00:37:57,065 --> 00:38:00,459
And I was-I was worried. For Wallace.

632
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:03,541
The fact that you helped me,

633
00:38:03,663 --> 00:38:05,432
even though I was awful to you,

634
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,287
you're a very decent man.

635
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:13,347
Yeah, I'd like to think that but really I just like tossing people out, it's kind of a hobby.

636
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:15,758
I don't know if you've heard some of the things they say about you.

637
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:16,951
Oh, I know, trust me.

638
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:21,487
I barely let me socialise with myself. I'm a bad influence.

639
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:26,177
- Do you have any sugar? 
- Oh, yeah.

640
00:38:35,554 --> 00:38:37,651
They say the truth will set you free.

641
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:40,995
And I'm looking for the truth in a maximum security prison.

642
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,643
Don't worry.

643
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:44,864
The irony isn't lost with me.

644
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:51,522
Ellen.

645
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:55,109
Well aren't you a breath of fresh air.

646
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:58,889
I want to thank you for taking the time to meet with me, Mr Koontz.

647
00:38:58,982 --> 00:39:02,211
It's always nice to chat with a hometown girl.

648
00:39:02,622 --> 00:39:07,107
Do you ever get back to good old Stallingsburg for the pear blossom festival?

649
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:08,985
You mean apple blossom.

650
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:10,808
Of course.

651
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:13,624
Just bought my tickets for May.

652
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:17,393
You know, you remind me of someone.

653
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:19,313
How old are you, Ellen?

654
00:39:19,461 --> 00:39:20,516
Twenty-two.

655
00:39:22,215 --> 00:39:25,108
She must have been the same age when I knew her.

656
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:30,311
Hmm. I shouldn't bore you with ancient history.

657
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,132
Now, what shall we chat about?

658
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:36,541
Well, I found these photographs online.

659
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:42,208
I think they could prove you didn't take Lilly's shoes the night of the murder.

660
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,229
It might be enough evidence to get you a retrial.

661
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:52,711
Now why would I want a retrial when I could have all this?

662
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:55,021
Somebody had to plant those shoes on your houseboat.

663
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:56,770
You never saw Lilly Kane in your life.

664
00:39:56,826 --> 00:39:58,466
Why would you confess to killing her?

665
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:00,089
So you're one of those.

666
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:04,368
What will it take for Keith Mars to let sleeping dogs lie?

667
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:11,891
Do you wanna know exactly how I bashed your friend's brains in?

668
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:16,750
Oh. I know who you are Veronica Mars.

669
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:20,630
I knew your mom when she used to visit the office during lunch hours.

670
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:21,854
I don't believe you.

671
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:24,354
You're a very dedicated young lady.

672
00:40:24,594 --> 00:40:28,843
Certainly you didn't inherit that quality from poor scattered Lianne.

673
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:33,922
Unfortunately for you, that makes you your father's daughter.

674
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,867
My dad tried to save your life.

675
00:40:35,944 --> 00:40:38,315
I meant your real father.

676
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,066
Think about it Veronica.

677
00:40:40,455 --> 00:40:42,284
Look in a mirror.

678
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,006
Are you the product of a schluppy sheriff

679
00:40:46,296 --> 00:40:48,970
or the king and queen of the prom?

680
00:42:02,026 --> 00:42:06,187
