1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,324
Previously on Veronica Mars…

2
00:00:02,396 --> 00:00:05,048
What do you think Mom was doing at the Camelot motel with Jake Kane?

3
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,404
Veronica. Please.

4
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,704
I know all about your dad and the murder investigation.

5
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:10,741
No you don't. Lilly Kane was my best friend.

6
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:12,488
A guy confessed. He said he did it.

7
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:15,401
You're dying, Abel. You didn't kill Lilly Kane.

8
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:17,014
You're just somebody's patsy.

9
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:19,478
Did you know that the head of security at Kane Software

10
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:21,289
was the one that got Koontz arrested?

11
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,460
I think I have a secret admirer.

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,400
J. Geils was right, love stinks.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,860
Mom.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,505
I searched for my mother for the better part of a year.

15
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:56,848
I doubt that Clarence Wiedman just happened to find her the same night.

16
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:17,738
He didn't know where to find my mother.

17
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:19,632
He knew where to find me.

18
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,278
I never donated to the wildlife alliance,

19
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:35,320
yet I kept that stupid pencil sharpener they sent.

20
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,525
Wiedman was listening when I booked my flight to Barstow.

21
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,594
I should have left right from the dance but I didn't want my mother to see me

22
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,979
for the first time in a year looking like an extra from "Valley Girl".

23
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:58,990
It seemed important at the time.

24
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:02,651
I know who's doing it Mom, I know who's blackmailing us.

25
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:07,162
He had to have seen me.

26
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:09,035
He knows I've made contact.

27
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,556
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

28
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:16,849
Honey, just please go. Please go, baby.

29
00:02:19,153 --> 00:02:23,299
I have been searching for you for a year. I'm not going anywhere.

30
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:25,855
Oh, god, I've missed you so much.

31
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,119
But this is bad. This is very bad, you shouldn't be here.

32
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,144
Neither should you.

33
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:35,793
I'm trying, though, I'm trying to protect you and I can't.

34
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:39,643
I can't. It's just so hard.

35
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:43,795
Can we get some coffee over here please?

36
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:46,427
It's okay.

37
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:52,235
Mom, Mom, everything is gonna be okay. 


38
00:02:56,208 --> 00:03:00,035
Clarence Wiedman was listening when I booked my flight to Barstow yesterday morning.

39
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:01,955
I can only hope he's listening now.

40
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,157
Or maybe, I want him listening.

41
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,636
Now that was just racy.

42
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:34,827
Respect the jumper, Jack. Respect the jumper. Kid's got rank.

43
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:37,335
Enjoy this moment, 'cause it's over now.

44
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:38,508
I've space and opportunity.

45
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:46,060
Ooo. That's your jock back there.

46
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,635
Do you need to jump back and kiss yourself? 'Cause I can wait.

47
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:52,025
Good practice, good practice.

48
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:53,822
Wallace, my man!

49
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,389
Hey, what's up Wallace.

50
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,640
Good game.

51
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:57,857
Wassup, player?

52
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:02,808
They like you! They really like you!

53
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,570
Hi Wallace.

54
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:08,123
Hi.

55
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:09,387
Who's the hoochie?

56
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:12,858
Nadine? She's in our grade.

57
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,260
See, you need to socialise more, that's your problem.

58
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:17,886
Wait. That's my problem?

59
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,600
Yeah, I know. This school hasn't always been that great to you.

60
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,930
The gentleman does have the gift for the understatement.

61
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:24,076
I-I'm just saying…

62
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:29,497
I've met a few people around here. They seem pretty cool.

63
00:04:29,998 --> 00:04:32,417
Maybe this school isn't as bad as you think it is.

64
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,394
They seem friendly.

65
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:42,774
Veronica. My office. Now.

66
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:46,805
I love this school.

67
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,066
When we arrived this morning, we discovered that Polly was gone.

68
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:55,118
Missing or...?

69
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,630
Missing!

70
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,646
Someone stole our mascot?

71
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:03,950
Well, lets get to it.

72
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,261
You know is was me and I know it wasn't

73
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:09,690
and now I'm suspended or expelled, tarred, feathered-

74
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:10,716
Excuse me?

75
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:12,082
I didn't take the bird.

76
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,378
I'm not accusing you.

77
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:15,128
I'm asking for your help.

78
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,952
I want you to find Polly.

79
00:05:56,505 --> 00:06:00,308
You know how out of control the rivalry between Neptune and Pan High is.

80
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:05,043
It used to be toilet paper on trees but in recent years things have… escalated.

81
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:09,068
If this matter isn't resolved quickly and discretely,

82
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:10,829
things could get ugly.

83
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,972
We don't really have the money to hire a professional

84
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:17,690
but I have noticed that you have certain…

85
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,752
skills plus as I understand it, you work for your dad in some capacity.

86
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:24,535
I do.

87
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:26,527
And what do you normally charge for something like this?

88
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:27,418
A lot.

89
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:30,628
Yeah, it's gonna set you back.

90
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:31,755
How far back?

91
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:35,241
Personal letter of recommendation. I'll write it, you'll sign it.

92
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:39,727
My own parking space and... a different locker, preferably in the east hall.

93
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:41,160
The letter and the locker, fine.

94
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:43,214
But you're not getting your own parking space.

95
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,596
- Can you get me out of PE? 
- No.

96
00:06:44,652 --> 00:06:46,542
- How about a few excused absences? 
- How about one?

97
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:47,862
- I'm thinking three. 
- Miss Mars...

98
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,572
- You're the one with the missing bird. 
- Fine.

99
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:51,821
Two.

100
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,977
And  this is, obviously, a confidential matter.

101
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,941
It'll be our little secret.

102
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:10,711
Good game, Wallace.

103
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:13,882
Yo, Wallace! You hear some guys from the Pan High stole our parrot?

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,884
Do not take this lying down.

105
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:17,292
- They stole Polly? 
- Gone.

106
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:18,327
I guess the secret's out.

107
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,853
And this matters to you?

108
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:23,846
I have plenty of free time as an office aide. Me and Polly, we bonded.

109
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,151
It'll eat right from my hand.

110
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:26,247
What's  up Wallace?

111
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:31,306
I must say, I'm a little touched. You picked the locker next to mine.

112
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,660
This is prime real estate. Wallace Fennel adajacent?

113
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:39,354
I'm telling you. This school is so much better than my old one. Look at this.

114
00:07:39,954 --> 00:07:41,617
Wow, your own cookies?

115
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,593
Snickerdoodles. And they just appeared in my locker, just like that.

116
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:47,203
Open my locker, bam. Homemade cookies.

117
00:07:48,104 --> 00:07:49,026
And that's not all.

118
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,332
A peeled grape?

119
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:54,074
"Go Wallace. We love you. You rock."

120
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:59,627
Wow. A snack and an ego stroke. I wish I was a baller.

121
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:01,048
Great game the other night, man.

122
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,999
Eighteen points, eight assists.

123
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:04,586
On the streets, we call those dimes.

124
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:08,037
Streets! You live on the corner of Pleasant Valley and Marigold.

125
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:10,060
Hey, did you cut your hair?

126
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:15,958
No, I'm growing it out.

127
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:20,474
Wel- anyway, it looks great.

128
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,528
Thanks.

129
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,534
- We gonna beat Pan, man? 
- Bet on it.

130
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:28,399
Can I just do something?

131
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,824
Why does everyone keep doing that to you?

132
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:34,098
Seriously, it's like you're made of velour or something.

133
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,429
Wallace, you coming or what?

134
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,812
I was gonna go hang out with some of the guys on the team at lunch.

135
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,198
And ruin the sanctity of our lunch duo?

136
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:44,395
You know that'll send me crying to the bathroom.

137
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:45,398
Come hang out.

138
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:47,228
At the cool jock table? Me?

139
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:49,105
Come on. They're all right.

140
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,409
Thanks, but I have other plans.

141
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:04,398
Pan High, the Un-Neptune. Just 15 miles away but when those miles are heading inland,

142
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,581
there are no yacht clubs and no $5 million homes with coastal views.

143
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:11,617
The parking lot is full of American-made cars from the nineties

144
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,110
and the vending machines don't carry Orangina.

145
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,030
People here hate Neptune as much as I do.

146
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,470
Go to any High School in America and you can tell who the popular kids are.

147
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:22,749
Who's that?

148
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:26,478
They travel in packs of the biggest, the shiniest, and the prettiest.

149
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:30,153
And much like wolves, they're always on the lookout for new meat.

150
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,360
Got some room over here!

151
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:38,263
Whoever said it's a man's world had no idea how easy it is sometimes to be a girl.

152
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:46,900
I was doing the first day scout. Where to sit, where not to sit.

153
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:48,805
This is a good choice, I promise.

154
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:49,589
I'm Richie.

155
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:53,353
Uh-oh. Thirteen. Is it my unlucky day?

156
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:56,445
Hardly! It's your first day and you're already at the cool table.

157
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:58,186
- This is Curtis. 
- How you doing.

158
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,853
- And that's Zeke. 
- Hey.

159
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:01,356
Hi. I'm…

160
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,413
Betty.

161
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,593
So, you guys all play basketball?

162
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:07,739
Curtis and I do.

163
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:10,381
I'm team manager. Which is like being on the team.

164
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:12,206
Which is like being near the team.

165
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:13,602
I love basketball.

166
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:17,345
I'm kind of a freak when it comes to sports. I totally get into it.

167
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:18,712
Are we talking face paint?

168
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,661
Face painting, hair streaking the colour of the school. At my old school, I was Horny.

169
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,153
We were the Rhinos.

170
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:26,971
I was the mascot.

171
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:28,854
And what school was that?

172
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:30,313
Riverdale.

173
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:34,098
Never heard of it.

174
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,872
Oh, but hey, did you guys hear? Someone stole the Neptune parrot.

175
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,348
Parrot? And you thought rhino was weird?

176
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:42,541
Well, they're the Pirates.

177
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:45,296
So, you know, their mascot's a parrot. It's…

178
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:46,704
yeah.

179
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:51,234
Whoever stole it is my hero. Neptune High sucks.

180
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:52,428
Believe me.

181
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:53,514
Oh, I do.

182
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:55,925
We beat them every year.

183
00:10:56,022 --> 00:11:00,052
That was then, this is now. I tell you, that Fennel kid is amazing.

184
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:02,043
He is? Really?

185
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,711
We're not gonna lose. I guarantee it. All right?

186
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:06,718
We got something special up our sleeve for Neptune.

187
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:09,345
Hey Richie! You're not gonna believe this. They've got our goat!

188
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,377
- What? 
- Neptune, man, the stole Billy!

189
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,683
It's so on!

190
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,966
A day in the life of a human google.

191
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,333
Always in search mode.

192
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:19,253
One moment tracking down the absurd, parrots and goats,

193
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:23,082
metaphors for a school pride I don't possess and an hour or two later,

194
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:26,486
going after the appalling, the murderer of a teenage girl.

195
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:29,968
Sheriff Lamb takes an annual marlin fishing expedition.

196
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,227
I can't let the opportunity go to waste.

197
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:35,176
Just let me know if you need something else.

198
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:39,609
How's my makeup?

199
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,393
I wish you weren't seeing me like this.

200
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:47,593
You  should have seen me last night. I was wearing blue eyeshadow.

201
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,582
We had an eighties dance at school.

202
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:54,084
Oh, that sounds fun. Was that fun?

203
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,748
Well, I guess things don't just stop, do they.

204
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:02,705
There's still birthdays and dances

205
00:12:03,044 --> 00:12:04,114
and Christmas.

206
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,071
No,

207
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,452
there's really not.

208
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:11,859
You remember that time you wanted to shave your hair like Cyndi Lauper?

209
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:13,856
I know about you and Jake Kane.

210
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:16,207
I wanna know what was between the two of you.

211
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,274
Were you so adamant that dad not go after Jake for Lilly's murder

212
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,918
because you still had feelings for him?

213
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,648
- Oh Veronica. 
- Tell me.

214
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:24,056
Jake was innocent.

215
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:26,392
- How do you know that? 
- I just know that.

216
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:29,223
Like in your heart because you love him?

217
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:32,662
No. Because I was with him at the time of the murder.

218
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:35,407
We were in a hotel room at the Neptune Grand.

219
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,615
Just so you know, in my mind that daydream was about me.

220
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:47,812
Oh yeah?

221
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:52,544
I was a little surprised you had me in full armour but, whatever.

222
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,283
So what can I do for you?

223
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,653
Ah, I need a favour.

224
00:12:58,618 --> 00:12:59,784
A big one.

225
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:07,642
Please say you need me to take care of a parking ticket for you.

226
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:13,116
I need you to get me the interrogation tapes from Lilly's murder investigation.

227
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:18,550
You got a weird call yesterday.

228
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,676
The bank wanted to let you know you were overdrawn.

229
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:26,700
I thought you were squirreling away all that college money.

230
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:28,231
Must be a mistake.

231
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:30,069
Forgot a decimal or something?

232
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,582
Or I blew it on dames and horses.

233
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,810
You'd tell me if there was a problem, right?

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,243
I tell you everything.

235
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:40,453
Maybe not everything.

236
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:43,971
There are some things you're better off not knowing.

237
00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:50,600
Guess you couldn't tell Dad you were in a hotel with your ex.

238
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,845
It wasn't like that.

239
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:53,898
I doesn't matter what it was like, Mom.

240
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:55,513
I just went there to talk to him.

241
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,855
On the one day all the Starbucks were closed.

242
00:13:57,953 --> 00:13:59,638
Well, it had to be in private.

243
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:03,825
Everything's just not so easy to explain, Veronica.

244
00:14:03,902 --> 00:14:04,973
Could you just try?

245
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:08,582
Do you think maybe I could have some real, actual answers?

246
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:11,112
You left us.

247
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,038
Well, a few days before,

248
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:20,798
I was in your room putting up the laundry.

249
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:23,697
Your phone rang, the machine got it.

250
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:25,233
I heard Celeste's voice.

251
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:27,132
Celeste Kane was leaving me a message?

252
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,741
She said she had important information involving me and her husband.

253
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:35,058
Things she thought you ought to know.

254
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:37,751
She didn't want you seeing Duncan.

255
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:43,444
So I called Jake, I met him at the Neptune Grand and I told him to tell his wife to back off.

256
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:47,576
I was protecting you.

257
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:53,803
Uncool, Zeke, uncool.

258
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:57,796
It's not like that. See, now, no matter what, after the game, I'm gonna be happy.

259
00:14:57,944 --> 00:14:59,828
- What's wrong, guys? 
- Well hey, Betty.

260
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,131
I just learned that Zeke here bet $200 on Neptune.

261
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:07,715
Richie! They're 14/6, we're 6/14. I mean, there's no line. I'd be crazy to pass this up.

262
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,240
They were favoured last year and we beat them.

263
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:13,906
Okay, all I'm saying, is I'm not the only one. There's a bookie that set up camp at Rest Stop 15

264
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,469
and from what I hear, everyone from Neptune and everyone here

265
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:18,199
are gonna go out there and put money on Neptune.

266
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:20,472
What's Rest Stop 15?

267
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,118
It's halfway between here and Neptune.

268
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:26,849
It's like a cross between Inspiration Point and Tijuana.

269
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:29,090
It overlooks the ocean, people go there to park.

270
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:31,430
Plus guys sell stuff out of their trunks. You can get your hands on anything -

271
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:35,449
beer, weed, porn, car stereos. That's what I'm told.

272
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:44,823
What is that all about? Why is everyone clapping for Wilson Stablers?

273
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:46,534
Dude, he's the one that stole the parrot.

274
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,344
He's showing everybody this picture he has saved on his phone with himself and the parrot.

275
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:53,620
I'm gonna go shake that man's hand. See, Zeke. That's Pan pride.

276
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,038
What's that?

277
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,522
Is this a big drop off point?

278
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,874
"To Pan High cafeteria.

279
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:09,292
Bon appetit.

280
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:11,207
Love Neptune."

281
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:20,863
They butchered Billy.

282
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:28,350
Wilson!

283
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:30,643
Hello?

284
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:34,145
I hear you're the guy to see about seeing a parrot.

285
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,437
Man. Word really gets around, doesn't it?

286
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,171
You're the new girl, right?

287
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,179
Word does get around.

288
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,656
You wa-you want to see the parrot, huh?

289
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:45,501
I do.

290
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:48,578
I just think that's so cool that anyone would do that.

291
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:51,015
I mean that takes a real man, you know?

292
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:52,618
Yeah.

293
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,702
How'd you get your hands on it?

294
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:01,568
I just walked into the school, like I was a student there

295
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:03,571
and nobody even asked me anything.

296
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:06,395
That's so brave.

297
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:08,670
Can't believe that worked.

298
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:10,491
Wilson?

299
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:12,056
Yeah?

300
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:13,887
I  hope this doesn't seem forward but…

301
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:17,134
I was planning on heading over to Rest Stop 15 later,

302
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:18,658
you know, to check it out.

303
00:17:18,802 --> 00:17:20,907
I was wondering if you'd be my tour guide.

304
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:22,596
Show me around?

305
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:25,182
Meet me up there?

306
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:29,022
Four o'clock. Don't be late.

307
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:57,232
Bingo, Betty.

308
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,032
Hey it's me.

309
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,081
No, it's not my phone.

310
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:05,123
Listen, I'm sending you a picture.

311
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:06,634
You wish.

312
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,918
What are you doing later?

313
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,615
Ever hear of Rest Stop 15?

314
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,615
Why doesn't that surprise me.

315
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,592
Hey there, buddy.

316
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:41,512
Looking for love in all the wrong places?

317
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:44,041
Who, me? I'm a no one.

318
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,490
Where's the bird, Wilson?

319
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:48,542
I'm nearly bursting with Pirate pride here.

320
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:50,369
Weevil wanna punch a cracker.

321
00:18:50,472 --> 00:18:51,327
What bird?

322
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:54,044
You want to think about that answer, man? 


323
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:56,544
All right. Look, I know what you're talking about

324
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:58,689
but I didn't take the parrot, I swear to god.

325
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:01,541
Someone's going to H-E-double hockeysticks.

326
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:03,888
That's not Neptune's mascot in the photo.

327
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:05,996
It's from a pet store, okay.

328
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,583
I heard that somebody took the mascot.

329
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:11,601
Everybody was making such a big deal out of it.

330
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,824
Look, they all thought it was so cool.

331
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:16,749
Wait a minute. You went to a pet store and took a picture of yourself

332
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:19,267
with a parrot so people would think you were cool?

333
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:21,525
Yeah. All right?

334
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,436
That's this close to taking a hot cousin to your prom.

335
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:26,727
Go home.

336
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,411
Get out of here.

337
00:19:34,624 --> 00:19:37,960
No more favours for you. Now I gotta feel bad for this kid.

338
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,207
If it's any consolation, I hate myself.

339
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:43,782
Hey!

340
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:45,021
Are you the guy?

341
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:46,234
Probably.

342
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,197
Hey, can you put me down for a hundred on Neptune?

343
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:54,212
Hey, Betty.

344
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,022
Why don't you excuse us… Betty.

345
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:01,368
We're doing some business here.

346
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:06,853
Lucky for me I have business of my own to attend to.

347
00:20:07,426 --> 00:20:08,434
Family business.

348
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:12,684
When Dad lost his job as sheriff, he announced to my mom and me that we were going

349
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:16,309
to stay in Neptune and he would try to make his living as a private investigator.

350
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:18,619
That was the last straw for Mom.

351
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:22,828
Honey, I'm not feeling too great.

352
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:27,210
You should have something to eat.

353
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:28,853
That's not gonna do it.

354
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:32,089
- I just need a little sip of something. 
- No.

355
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:36,462
Honey, my head is pounding. It's like tangled and-

356
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:39,263
I don't want you to, Mom. I want you to keep talking to me.

357
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,797
What did Jake say when you told him about Celeste's call?

358
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:44,275
I don't know, nothing but I'm just gonna get a beer.

359
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:48,775
What happened with Jake?

360
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:51,280
I don't know, I just, I convinced him to make her back off.

361
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:53,455
- How did you convince him? 
- It's very complicated Veronica,

362
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:55,621
I don't know how to explain it to you or have it make any sense…

363
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,935
Just tell me the truth! How did you convince him?

364
00:20:57,992 --> 00:21:00,157
I told Jake that if Celeste tried to contact you again,

365
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,998
I'd have a paternity test done and take him for millions.

366
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,338
So you know, then?

367
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:10,187
Are you sure that test will prove that Jake's my father?

368
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:12,558
No.

369
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:15,883
Will it prove that Dad is?

370
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,316
I don't know.

371
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,710
How's that for inconspicuous?

372
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:36,770
They don't teach you this at the academy by the way.

373
00:21:36,853 --> 00:21:38,107
That's on me.

374
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:41,717
Thank you.

375
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:42,920
Yeah.

376
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:45,137
That's not going to be good enough.

377
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:51,179
I hate to bribe you but I'm fairly certain that aiding and abetting qualifies me for a dinner date.

378
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:56,091
Actually, it qualifies you for dinner and a movie but you undershot, so…

379
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:57,482
Damn.

380
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:01,420
Hey, do you know anything about sports betting?

381
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,136
A little.

382
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:07,052
Why would a bookie take bets on a team to win straight up,

383
00:22:07,113 --> 00:22:09,924
no line, if one team is heavily favoured?

384
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:14,148
He wouldn't. A bookie usually tries to find a line on a game in which half the money

385
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,041
gets bet on one team and half the money gets bet on the other.

386
00:22:17,123 --> 00:22:18,378
They make their money on commission.

387
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:22,003
If a bookie accepts bets that are all on one side of the line,

388
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,694
he's, well, he's either going to make a killing or he's gonna get killed.

389
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:27,864
Why would he risk it?

390
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:29,887
I don't know.

391
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,640
Maybe he knows something that the people who are betting, don't.

392
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:41,863
Four years I've been going here and we've never beaten these guys.

393
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,865
This most definitely is our year. I'm telling ya.

394
00:22:43,932 --> 00:22:44,756
You gonna eat those?

395
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:46,923
I gotta go get a book out of my car.

396
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:48,401
- Wallace! 
- Catch up with you guys later.

397
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,892
Why are you following me?

398
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:02,364
You say following, I say taking a walk with a friend.

399
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:06,662
I'm just curious to know where you're going with the apple, the potato chips and the raisins.

400
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:08,394
Forgot about that third eye.

401
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:09,542
So what'cha up to?

402
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,007
Trust me, you don't want to know.

403
00:23:11,094 --> 00:23:13,213
Oohh. I hate to know things.

404
00:23:13,756 --> 00:23:16,247
Please tell me that's not filled with Polish hookers.

405
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:36,325
- Oh, man, what is with you? 
- You stole a goat?

406
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:37,620
They stole our parrot.

407
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:40,878
Matter of principle. Unlike you, I have some school pride.

408
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:43,692
And a goat crapping apples in the back of your buddy's van.

409
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:44,762
Congratulations.

410
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:46,299
Will you quit it?

411
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,689
Well, this is what high school is all about.

412
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,208
Having some fun, you know, messing around.

413
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,244
This was Jack's idea.

414
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,450
I don't even know how I got stuck with the damn thing.

415
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,406
I had it in the guest house and it ate everything, the rug, the sofa, my Air Jordans.

416
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:10,906
And he lived to tell the tale?

417
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:13,486
I don't' know what to do with it. It's driving me crazy.

418
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:15,161
Bad, kidnapped goat!

419
00:24:15,463 --> 00:24:18,277
That's it? You're not gonna offer me any help?

420
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:23,794
Looks like we're going to have plenty of material for the "Letters to the editor" page.

421
00:24:24,091 --> 00:24:28,842
"Polly's kidnapping is more than just a juvenile school prank. It is an act of terrorism."

422
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:30,588
Wow. Polly wanna payback.

423
00:24:30,675 --> 00:24:32,160
There's about twenty more just like it.

424
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:33,384
Bird's got fans.

425
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,107
And now for an opposing view.

426
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,661
A little something for the uninformed masses.

427
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:43,158
"Maybe the people who think that the person who took Polly is so awful should stop

428
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:46,639
and think about the person who ripped Polly from her natural habitat

429
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:48,468
and forced her to live in a cage.

430
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,136
I only hope whoever took that beautiful bird had the decency to set her free.

431
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:57,156
And if Polly really loves them, she'll fly back to them."

432
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,212
I think she's one of those SAAC girls.

433
00:25:00,945 --> 00:25:03,188
Yeah, that's gonna need a little further explanation.

434
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:05,307
Uh, Students Against Animal Cruelty.

435
00:25:05,456 --> 00:25:08,903
They threw the bucket of blood on the homecoming queen a couple of years ago for wearing fur.

436
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:11,808
Bucket of blood. Have we learned nothing from "Carrie"?

437
00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:18,963
Jake, you know I have to talk to you, it's routine.

438
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,410
Well, I already told you, Keith.

439
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:23,196
I was at the Neptune Grand with Celeste.

440
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:24,717
What were you doing?

441
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,060
You're kidding.

442
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,772
I was in a hotel room with my wife. What do you think I was doing?

443
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,758
Come on, you know what it's like when you've got kids.

444
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,133
Privacy just goes out the window.

445
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,522
This is something that we do from time to time.

446
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:45,002
So you've done this before?

447
00:25:45,432 --> 00:25:46,129
Yes.

448
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:50,035
So you have receipts, to verify that this is something you do.

449
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,438
I mean, this is insane.

450
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,459
You should be out finding Lilly's killer, not grilling me.

451
00:25:54,776 --> 00:25:55,826
Were you making love?

452
00:25:56,307 --> 00:25:57,485
Private, don't you think?

453
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:59,721
Under the circumstances, no.

454
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,407
How long did you make love for?

455
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,162
I'm not answering that.

456
00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:08,887
You were in a hotel room for two and a half hours.

457
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:10,720
How much of that time was spent making love?

458
00:26:10,823 --> 00:26:12,190
Well, I don't remember exactly.

459
00:26:12,722 --> 00:26:13,793
It was a while.

460
00:26:14,053 --> 00:26:15,927
So what did you do when you first got into the room?

461
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:16,926
I don't' know.

462
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,723
We settled in.

463
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,232
What does that mean? You took off your shoes, your tie…

464
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,993
No, I put on the TV.

465
00:26:23,192 --> 00:26:24,299
What was on the TV?

466
00:26:27,774 --> 00:26:29,106
Why are you doing this Keith?

467
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:30,560
I'm just asking questions.

468
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:32,440
Not even hard ones.

469
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:35,845
We put on the TV for background noise so we could get right to it.

470
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:36,766
Okay?

471
00:26:38,282 --> 00:26:40,248
Now do you want a, uh, play-by-play?

472
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:49,152
It must be some good music.

473
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:53,591
I could've painted the living room, you wouldn't have noticed.

474
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:55,562
I left my algebra book over here.

475
00:26:57,692 --> 00:27:00,302
So, maybe you were right about the goat.

476
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:09,272
Wait a minute.

477
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:11,547
These are snickerdoodles.

478
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,801
You're the one who's been making my spirit boxes?

479
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,767
I used to be on pep squad, remember?

480
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:20,352
But you think all this stuff is stupid.

481
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:21,382
You don't.

482
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:26,000
Hey, you wanna open your locker tomorrow and find an empty box?

483
00:27:32,656 --> 00:27:35,268
Um-um-um, the girl can bake.

484
00:27:35,326 --> 00:27:36,477
That she can.

485
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,681
Hey, are you picking your mom up from work today?

486
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,845
Yeah.

487
00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:43,388
Can you do me a weird favour without asking any questions?

488
00:27:44,326 --> 00:27:47,264
Isn't that the bedrock upon which our friendship was founded?

489
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:50,368
When you're at Kane Software,

490
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:54,591
go to Clarence Wiedman's office. Put this on his assistant's desk.

491
00:27:54,826 --> 00:27:56,731
It's from her secret admirer.

492
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,370
Um, um, should I wait for a tip?

493
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,341
I don't understand why you couldn't talk to both of us at the same time.

494
00:28:07,463 --> 00:28:10,084
I'm sorry, Celeste, it's department policy.

495
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:17,995
How long were you in the hotel?

496
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:19,514
Two and a half hours.

497
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:21,425
That's just what Jake said.

498
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:24,302
Well we were there together.

499
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:27,021
Can I get you some water or something?

500
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,624
No, thank you.

501
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:30,729
Celeste, it's just routine.

502
00:28:30,913 --> 00:28:32,126
You don't have to worry.

503
00:28:32,238 --> 00:28:33,519
Just answer the questions.

504
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:37,963
If it's routine, then just talk to Jake.

505
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:40,456
I don't understand why you have to talk to me.

506
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:43,027
The two of you were together in the room the whole time?

507
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:44,240
Yes.

508
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:46,631
And what did you do when you got there?

509
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:49,897
We had some champagne. On the patio.

510
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:50,968
From room service.

511
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:54,014
No, we brought it from home.

512
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:56,800
Do you usually bring your own champagne to the Neptune Grand.

513
00:28:56,979 --> 00:29:00,061
We don't usually have to stay at the Neptune Grand.

514
00:29:00,629 --> 00:29:02,062
Special occasion.

515
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:04,259
Do you remember what was on TV that afternoon?

516
00:29:04,562 --> 00:29:07,480
Trust me, Keith, we weren't watching TV.

517
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:15,861
Grab your lip gloss and your pepper spray, sweetheart. Your date's here.

518
00:29:22,134 --> 00:29:25,225
In my culture, Chinese food is always followed by gelato.

519
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:27,862
I don't remember you brokering in a dessert stop.

520
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,206
Getting out of the car was a tacit agreement. 

521
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,806
Right this way.

522
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:37,575
Breath mint, smooth.

523
00:29:38,021 --> 00:29:39,352
That's all I wanted.

524
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:46,495
Veronica?

525
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,513
Uh, hey.

526
00:29:53,504 --> 00:29:55,234
Look at you, you look gorgeous.

527
00:29:58,843 --> 00:29:59,704
Hey, Leo.

528
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,695
You know Duncan, right?

529
00:30:02,807 --> 00:30:04,768
- No. 
- Yeah, uh, no.

530
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:06,002
- Hey.
- How ya doing?

531
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:11,548
These are Duncan's parents, Mr and Mrs Kane.

532
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:13,758
- How ya doing? 
- How's it going? Hi.

533
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:17,937
Hey, well, um, enjoy.

534
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:24,311
Maybe we should find something a little cosier.

535
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,335
It's fine.

536
00:30:25,508 --> 00:30:26,365
Good evening.

537
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,432
Are you sure this is okay?

538
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,736
It's perfect.

539
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:39,155
…the day Lilly died, round the exact time, actually,

540
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:41,182
Jake and I were in that motel room.

541
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:45,002
Out of nowhere, Celeste bursts in.

542
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:47,234
She'd been following Jake around.

543
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:51,484
She's screaming, saying these horrible things,

544
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,614
I just got out of there.

545
00:30:54,908 --> 00:30:56,235
You don't see them again?

546
00:30:56,317 --> 00:30:57,069
No.

547
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,899
Well actually, I went to the ladies room in the lobby

548
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:04,381
and when I came out, I saw Celeste storming out of the lobby.

549
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:08,527
You see anything you like?

550
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,983
Yes I do.

551
00:31:15,982 --> 00:31:19,889
Celeste told my father she was in the hotel with Jake for two hours.

552
00:31:19,976 --> 00:31:23,227
The way my mother tells it, she was there for 20 minutes, tops.

553
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:26,017
So what if Celeste say my mom in the lobby?

554
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:28,675
What better way to control my mother than have Clarence Wiedman

555
00:31:28,747 --> 00:31:31,281
take photos of me framed in a rifle-sight.

556
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:33,422
Maybe it wasn't a paternity issue.

557
00:31:33,663 --> 00:31:35,387
Maybe it was an alibi issue.

558
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,130
Maybe it was both.

559
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:40,350
…not knows that there are still thirteen seats left on the Big Bear ski bus

560
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,674
for the weekend of the 18th through the 20th.

561
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:47,861
And on a more serious note, the SACs are coming up… 

562
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:50,861
I don't want to hear about your protein deficiency, Marsha.

563
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:53,001
You eat eggs, you might as well eat baby.

564
00:31:53,124 --> 00:31:54,024
Arriana?

565
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:58,197
Hi. I just wanted to let you know, I really liked your letter.

566
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,051
Really?

567
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,379
Yeah, really.

568
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:08,750
I'm sorry. I have a hard time believing that someone who let a cow die

569
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:11,385
so she could wear butch boots cares about a parrot.

570
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:13,502
My boots aren't butch.

571
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:14,889
But they are leather.

572
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:16,825
Let me cut to the chase.

573
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,475
Do you know anything about Polly?

574
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:22,666
Yeah. I know that she's better off not being in a cage.

575
00:32:22,768 --> 00:32:26,982
Is she better off scrounging for food when she's used to having it provided for her?

576
00:32:27,797 --> 00:32:30,459
- Come here. 
- Do it. Put it under there.

577
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:33,920
It's fake fur, you freaks.

578
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,435
Greetings from your masters at Pan High.

579
00:32:45,553 --> 00:32:50,153
If Wallace Fennel plays in tomorrow night's game, Polly the parrot will die.

580
00:32:50,504 --> 00:32:53,345
We now return you to your regularly scheduled programme.

581
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:58,675
…by the Dance Committee and a school wide vote will choose the winner.

582
00:33:04,395 --> 00:33:05,986
How's our feathered friend?

583
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,764
Excuse me?

584
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,376
You took the parrot, didn't you?

585
00:33:09,642 --> 00:33:12,750
You're taking even money bets on a team everyone thinks will win.

586
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:17,778
Why would you do that unless you knew that Wallace, our best player, wouldn't play?

587
00:33:18,137 --> 00:33:22,007
You know, I always knew you had a thing for me but

588
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:24,542
I never thought you wanted me for my brain.

589
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:26,446
I'm gagging on the inside.

590
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:28,637
Come on, Veronica.

591
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,338
Do I look that smart?

592
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:32,171
I'm just a simple bookie.

593
00:33:32,272 --> 00:33:34,331
I got both sides of the line covered.

594
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,837
And ask yourself this.

595
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:40,747
Why would I help you find the parrot if stealing the parrot was my secret plan, huh?

596
00:33:55,552 --> 00:33:57,413
This just sucks.

597
00:33:58,257 --> 00:34:00,935
I have to say, it really does.

598
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:04,120
Coach called me into his office and said I should play.

599
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:06,377
All the guys want me to play.

600
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,201
But my playing isn't really a big deal. Jack's good.

601
00:34:11,773 --> 00:34:13,280
He was a starter last year.

602
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,912
What do you want to do?

603
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:18,307
You know I want to play.

604
00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:21,230
But on the other hand, it ain't worth Polly's life.

605
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,294
I can't do it. I can't play.

606
00:34:28,444 --> 00:34:30,549
Would it cheer you up if I brought back the goat?

607
00:34:32,915 --> 00:34:34,119
Yeah, it would.

608
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:40,083
I need your help with something.

609
00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:42,944
Hey. Um, sure.

610
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:43,886
Whatever you need.

611
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:45,960
How was your broadcast interrupted?

612
00:34:46,037 --> 00:34:46,764
I don't know.

613
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,991
When there's no breaking news, we record the show the night before.

614
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:55,156
So, someone had to get in and cut in the Polly announcement before it aired this morning?

615
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:55,979
They must have.

616
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:58,397
Wow.

617
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:01,714
We actually kinda just had a conversation.

618
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:04,695
See, that's what you do now.

619
00:35:08,008 --> 00:35:10,930
You take that deep breath like you're preparing for battle or something.

620
00:35:11,023 --> 00:35:12,477
I was just breathing.

621
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:15,272
I want everything to be okay between us.

622
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:18,176
It is.

623
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,622
We just- we run in different circles.

624
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,265
It doesn't have to be like that.

625
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:24,724
It does.

626
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:28,508
I'm not programmed to forgive and forget,

627
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:32,788
I can't just start chumming around with people who've ignored and mocked me for a year.

628
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:34,284
That's just not me.

629
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:36,971
Well, maybe we can have our own circle without them.

630
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:40,426
Maybe.

631
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:47,554
Well, whoever they are, they've done a stellar job at concealing their identity.

632
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,714
Jacket, mask, gloves.

633
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:53,324
No visible "Hello, my name is" sticker.

634
00:35:54,662 --> 00:35:56,421
Hey, maybe there's something on the floor?

635
00:35:57,174 --> 00:35:59,310
It's really shiny, maybe there's a reflection.

636
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:02,576
Wait a sec, what's that?

637
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:03,564
What?

638
00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:05,653
On the sneaker.

639
00:36:07,394 --> 00:36:08,844
I think it's just dirt.

640
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:11,198
Or maybe not.

641
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:15,801
I need a basketball programme.

642
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:25,710
Good job, Betty.

643
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:28,801
Who is this Betty?

644
00:36:29,351 --> 00:36:30,153
Beats me.

645
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:32,600
There's Polly and bonus mascot.

646
00:36:32,744 --> 00:36:34,438
And those are some photos for Coach.

647
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:35,365
Who had Polly?

648
00:36:37,551 --> 00:36:38,862
Give me one sec, okay?

649
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,345
Betty, you made it.

650
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:45,303
Richie, you are a really great guy

651
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:48,641
and if the popular kids at this school were half as nice as you are,

652
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,264
I'd wanna be popular.

653
00:36:50,515 --> 00:36:53,614
I know that sounds weird but it's a huge compliment.

654
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:55,758
So good luck tonight.

655
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,033
You're gonna need it.

656
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,163
Wallace Fennel has a killer crossover.

657
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:03,787
But it's really his sweetness

658
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:08,043
and purity of spirit that makes him unbeatable.

659
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:13,417
What did she just say to you?

660
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:15,388
Beats the hell out of me.

661
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,927
You better warm up, Fennel.

662
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:23,883
You got Polly back?

663
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:25,388
I kinda rock.

664
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:30,289
I know what you're thinking Jack. Aarrgh.

665
00:37:30,922 --> 00:37:36,591
Whoever made that death threat video forgot to cover up the number thirteen on his sneakers.

666
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:39,699
Now there are two thirteens suiting up tonight.

667
00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:43,667
Your Pan counterpart believes that a kid named Wilson stole the parrot.

668
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,300
Why would I steal our own parrot.

669
00:37:45,402 --> 00:37:46,215
That's easy.

670
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:49,642
With Wallace sitting out, you'll go back to being a starter.

671
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:52,566
As point guard, you can control the score of the game.

672
00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:56,625
You know, like you did last year when you missed those two free throws in the final minute.

673
00:37:56,712 --> 00:37:59,801
How much money did you make betting against your own team last year?

674
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:00,941
You went in my room?

675
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:02,897
I mean isn't that like breaking and entering or something?

676
00:38:02,975 --> 00:38:06,097
I told your mom I was a cheerleader and we needed Polly for the game tonight.

677
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,253
- She let me in. 
- She's crazy man.

678
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:11,770
Picture of the Pirate Pride trophy next to the parrot, Jack.

679
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:13,681
You're the guy covering all of Weevil's bets.

680
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:17,495
There must be thousands of dollars bet on this game.

681
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:19,195
You're pretty screwed here, Jack.

682
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:21,227
Come with me, young man.

683
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,066
Wallace, man.

684
00:38:27,926 --> 00:38:30,208
Okay, Wallace, you're in.

685
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:31,324
Yes sir.

686
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,853
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

687
00:38:37,202 --> 00:38:39,015
Go kick some ass, Air Fennel.

688
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,788
Ah, the big game. Another high school high that makes me want to eat rocks.

689
00:38:45,988 --> 00:38:49,100
Being surrounded by screaming, foam-fingered spirit freaks

690
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:51,266
who hate me hardly sounds thrilling

691
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:54,083
but for Wallace, this is his shining moment.

692
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:56,817
So what's it gonna be girlie girl?

693
00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:09,320
I've saved nearly every penny since I started working for Dad.

694
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:13,989
I know I can't count on college money from him and I know it kills him that he can't offer.

695
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:16,145
It's gone now.

696
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:19,263
I had enough for four years at San Diego State,

697
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:21,977
a year at Stanford and a semester at the Sorbonne.

698
00:39:22,995 --> 00:39:24,578
Lets hope it's worth it.

699
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:28,836
We do insist that payment be made in full upfront.

700
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,785
Wait. Wait.

701
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:39,543
This- I don't need you to- This isn't right, Veronica

702
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,646
I can figure this out. I can kick this on my own.

703
00:39:42,743 --> 00:39:47,351
There is nothing twelve weeks in here can do that I can't do myself.

704
00:39:47,455 --> 00:39:48,801
I don't want you to have to do this.

705
00:39:48,893 --> 00:39:50,367
I want you to come home.

706
00:39:52,394 --> 00:39:53,814
I miss you.

707
00:39:56,814 --> 00:39:57,889
Okay.

708
00:39:59,004 --> 00:39:59,931
Okay.

709
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,218
Okay.

710
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:20,401
Dad, can you come in here for a minute?

711
00:40:24,818 --> 00:40:27,868
I really need to get you a bell so you can ring for me.

712
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,091
Looks like Neptune beat the hell out of Pan last night.

713
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:32,176
Yeah.

714
00:40:33,002 --> 00:40:35,542
I want you to answer me something, honestly.

715
00:40:35,624 --> 00:40:36,530
Sure, honey.

716
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,819
Don't get mad and don't blow me off, just answer me, please.

717
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:42,684
Okay.

718
00:40:43,196 --> 00:40:47,067
Why would a person agree to confess to a murder he didn't commit?

719
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:48,545
Veronica.

720
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:54,767
Money, a lot of it.

721
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:58,166
But if you're not around to spend that money, what does it matter?

722
00:40:58,545 --> 00:40:59,959
Well, maybe there's someone else.

723
00:41:01,152 --> 00:41:04,859
Someone you care about that will be around after that person dies.

724
00:41:18,222 --> 00:41:20,392
Wait, Dad, you know what?

725
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:24,734
I think I know who's collecting the money from Abel Koontz's confession.

726
00:41:25,471 --> 00:41:28,216
Now we'll learn how well Wallace follows instructions

727
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:32,568
if my special rubber tree plant was delivered to the desktop of my choice.

728
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:36,869
Lois. Get me Amelia DeLongpre.

729
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,108
Yes, Mr Wiedman.

730
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:43,275
Let's see what the connection is between Amelia DeLongpre and Abel Koontz.

731
00:41:43,897 --> 00:41:46,633
What do you know. In the entire internet universe,

732
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:48,933
there's only one document that pairs them.

733
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:54,492
"Stella Koontz died Sunday night after a long battle with cervical cancer.

734
00:41:54,575 --> 00:41:59,455
She leaves behind son Abel Koontz of Neptune and granddaughter Amelia DeLongpre."

735
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,517
Abel Koontz has a daughter?

736
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:10,365
