1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,245
<i>Previously on "Veronica Mars"...</i>

2
00:00:02,246 --> 00:00:04,491
It just went straight off the cliff.
They're all dead.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,439
Woody's a pervert.

4
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:06,285
He's sick.

5
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:07,706
What he did to us is wrong.

6
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:09,353
Two of the boys who died
in the bus crash

7
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:10,938
were on Woody's little-league team.

8
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:13,844
Most adults keep their hands
off of other people's children.

9
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:17,822
You'll be the guy who let a child
molester and a murderer get away!

10
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:18,893
Woody's gone.

11
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,180
He took his private plane.

12
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,343
My grandmother asked me
for one thing my whole life.

13
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,926
She wants to see me walk
across that stage at graduation.

14
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,309
It's Weevil! I'm telling you!
He set me up!

15
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,600
I got something on you.

16
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:32,608
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

17
00:00:32,663 --> 00:00:33,639
I've got what?

18
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:34,242
Chlamydia.

19
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,950
Jackie left for France this morning.

20
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:37,395
I thought our story was epic.

21
00:00:38,332 --> 00:00:39,066
I have to go.

22
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:40,575
I don't want to lose you from my life.

23
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:41,932
My stepmom...
she's a gold digger.

24
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:43,818
You're cash-strapped.
I can help.

25
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:46,308
But quid pro quo,
mrs. C.,

26
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:48,376
Quid pro quo.

27
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:50,635
We find the defendant not guilty.

28
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:56,320
See, this is how it is.

29
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,994
The innocent suffer,
the guilty go free,

30
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,792
and truth and fiction are
pretty much interchangeable.

31
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,287
Mr. Echolls, how do you feel
about your acquittal?

32
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:11,662
I feel... relieved to have my name
cleared of this... horrible crime.

33
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,602
There is neither a Santa Claus
nor an easter bunny,

34
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:19,822
and there are no angels
watching over us.

35
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,265
Things just happen for no reason.

36
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:28,823
And nothing makes any sense.

37
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,692
We will not do this.

38
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:32,687
You can't let this stick in your head.

39
00:01:32,953 --> 00:01:34,813
However wrong it turned out,
it's done.

40
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,143
We're people with lives,
and we will not obsess.

41
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,107
We move on.

42
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,153
Aaron Echolls will get
his justice in his own way.

43
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,895
You really believe that?

44
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:46,333
Yes. Now, come on.
We're running a business here.

45
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:48,271
Look alive.

46
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:08,885
What happened to moving on?

47
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:12,205
Posted today.

48
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:15,855
Meg's dad offering 20 grand
for the capture of Woody Goodman.

49
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,985
Well, I'm sure someone will get him.

50
00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:21,110
Didn't you say something about
"we have a business to run"?

51
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:23,980
Shouldn't you be out hunting him down
like the dog he is?

52
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:26,643
I also said something about us
being people with lives.

53
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:29,493
See, I have this kid who's gonna
graduate from high school.

54
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:30,768
I don't want to miss it.

55
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:33,047
This is Woody Goodman.

56
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:35,142
He blew up a bus and molested children.

57
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,827
Guess I'm just sentimental.

58
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:40,558
When the management
gives you free cake,

59
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:41,821
you're supposed to eat it.

60
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:46,171
I thought you were prepared
for Jackie going.

61
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,462
Never figured
it would go down like this.

62
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:50,318
She left you a note?

63
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,206
<i>"But I was afraid if I saw you,</i>

64
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:54,619
<i>I wouldn't be able to get on the plane.</i>

65
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,205
<i>I'll always... "</i>

66
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,053
well, then it's just
a bunch of private stuff.

67
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,959
What can you do about that?

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,933
You could use a method time-tested
by women throughout the ages...

69
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:07,987
Gorge on cake.

70
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:11,477
I'll be right back.

71
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,755
Johnny Ludden.
Thanks for dropping by.

72
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:19,413
Sure. Free gelato
just to show up... why not?

73
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:22,838
Is this you on Woody's old team?

74
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:24,095
Yeah.

75
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:26,857
So, do I have to eat here,
or can I get the gelato in the carton?

76
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:29,565
Just a few more questions first.

77
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,785
Hey, honey.

78
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,004
Hey, dad.

79
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,576
Hello?

80
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,002
You've got a call...

81
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:46,789
from Vinnie Van Lowe.

82
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:48,567
So...

83
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:50,793
of course you know about the bounty
on this Goodman guy.

84
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:52,631
I'm aware of it, yes.

85
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,497
20 g's?

86
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:55,774
That's big-boy money.

87
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:57,871
Gonna be a lot of top guys
out there for it.

88
00:03:58,383 --> 00:03:59,387
I had a thought.

89
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:02,904
We team up.
Mars and Van Lowe.

90
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:04,128
Pool our resources.

91
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:05,621
Split the cash.

92
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:08,326
Sheriff got you on video
breaking into Woody's house.

93
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,913
But "Johnny Law" don't know what I got.

94
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:18,498
What do you got?

95
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:19,775
All his records...

96
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:22,663
tax, medical, corporate...
the whole enchilada.

97
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:25,662
We nail him, we split 60-40.
I'm the 60, by the way.

98
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:27,608
50-50...

99
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:29,610
if the stuff you got pans out,

100
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:31,909
and no action until
after my daughter's graduation.

101
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,412
I'm in jail.
I deserve 60.

102
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,425
I risk my life to bring
a fugitive to justice,

103
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:41,510
and you're giving me
world's tiniest violin.

104
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,331
Guess I'm just heartless.

105
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:46,298
He's got, like, 10 credit cards
in different corporate names.

106
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,195
We're gonna have
to put a trace on all of them.

107
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:54,241
-And he has a pilot's license.
-Seasonal allergies, bad arches.

108
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:57,745
And he had the clap.

109
00:04:58,367 --> 00:04:59,814
Treated twice for chlamydia.

110
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:02,080
Didn't see that
in his campaign materials.

111
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:08,464
- Bingo. Heart arrhythmia.

112
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:11,577
- So that's our strategy...

113
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:13,351
just wait for him to drop dead?

114
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:15,354
He has to take a pill every day.

115
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:18,955
Is there any way you can find out
Gia Goodman's cellphone access code?

116
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,538
Gia's cell?

117
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:22,989
Woody's lawyer is also
an old college buddy of his.

118
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:24,405
If he'd call anyone, it would be him.

119
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:26,875
If we had Gia's code
and could forward her calls...

120
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:30,353
I guarantee you she hasn't changed it
from the factory default.

121
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:31,609
Then I have a plan.

122
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,226
Up and at 'em, honey.

123
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,603
Can you believe
the big day is finally here?

124
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:58,198
There she is.

125
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:01,899
The eyes are bright,
the tail is bushy.

126
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,635
Pancakes, mom?

127
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:08,591
Are you trying to give me
an early jump on the freshman 15?

128
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:09,969
Eat up.

129
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:13,467
You think the dining halls at San Diego
state are gonna feed you like this?

130
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:17,364
Mmm... I love pancakes!

131
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:23,896
What, a comment?

132
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:26,412
"Get a room"?
You just gagged in your mouth?

133
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:30,547
No.
It's nice.

134
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:35,217
- Are you okay?
- All right.

135
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:38,457
So, how's the sheriff business?

136
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:39,790
Pretty sweet.

137
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,921
We got Otis
sleeping it off in cell one,

138
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,166
and Lamb has to wear the clete
the crime-fighting canine costume

139
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,356
to all the elementary schools
this week.

140
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,948
Listen, after the ceremony,

141
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:53,876
don't run off with that boy
because we want to take pictures...

142
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:55,899
and lots of them.

143
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,457
And I can't wait.

144
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,702
Okay, then you should practice.

145
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,953
Say "cheese. "

146
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,377
Cheese!

147
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:09,838
They gave me the wrong cap and gown.

148
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,396
Yeah, how exactly can you tell?

149
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:13,397
It's got someone else's name on it?

150
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:15,397
Guess who's going commando?

151
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:17,085
Must we?

152
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,896
Does anyone know Wallace Fennel?

153
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,852
I do.
He was in my P.E. Class.

154
00:07:20,853 --> 00:07:21,997
Awesome baller.

155
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:23,681
I think he works at sac-n-pac.

156
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:25,801
Awesome baller...

157
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:27,464
that doesn't really help me.
Can you point him out?

158
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:28,821
You didn't hear what happened to him?

159
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,395
Sac-n-pac got held up
when he was working.

160
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:33,582
The robber forced him
into the walk-in cooler.

161
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,747
He got frostbite.

162
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:37,644
Yeah. Dude lost three fingers.

163
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:39,729
Oh, my god, that's awful.

164
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:43,884
Sweetie, I love you,

165
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:46,251
but you have to be
the most gullible girl I've ever met.

166
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,137
I'm trusting. Sue me.

167
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:50,120
There he is.
That's Wallace.

168
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:55,073
Wallace?

169
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:56,789
Wallace.

170
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:58,115
- Wallace?
- Yeah?

171
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:00,315
I think I have your cap and gown.

172
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,711
- That must make you Veronica Mars?
- It does.

173
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,916
So, looking forward to
getting out of here?

174
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,849
I guess.

175
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:11,129
I don't know.

176
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,127
High school was a blast,

177
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,447
right?

178
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:16,592
Oh, you're one of those.

179
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:18,362
What's that supposed to mean?

180
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,002
Nothing.

181
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,556
Have a good life.

182
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:23,237
I'm sure you will.

183
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:31,017
Lilly?

184
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,054
Hey!

185
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,097
Tell me about everything.

186
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,175
Tell me about this new guy.

187
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:38,295
Tell me about Vassar.

188
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,542
The guy is gone.

189
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:42,747
We had a little disagreement
over fooling around with his ex.

190
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:44,533
- That bastard.
- Oh, no, no,

191
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:46,106
it was, um, it was me.

192
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,402
I kind of fooled around with his ex.

193
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:52,104
I mean, you'd think that guys
would dig that, right?

194
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:56,349
What? It's college.
It's expected.

195
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:58,173
You'll see.

196
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:00,417
God, it's so good to see you.

197
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,684
What is this?

198
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:06,068
A Lilly Kane memorial fountain?

199
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,231
Uh...

200
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:09,583
Do you smell bacon?

201
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:12,653
Graduation day!
Get up!

202
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:13,809
Lots to do!

203
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,375
I'm making breakfast.

<i>We all hope you enjoyed season 2

215
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:58,442
Get ready.

216
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:00,492
Morning, mr. Lee.

217
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:02,328
Gia Goodman asked you
to call her on her cell.

218
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:03,739
It's all right.
I got the number.

219
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,411
Gia? Bill Lee.

220
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,665
Hey, so, I'm trying to get
a message to dad,

221
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,064
but he didn't leave us a forwarding...

222
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:23,421
It's just, we got a call
from dr. Hoover,

223
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:28,369
and I guess his heart pills
are 50 milli-something this time,

224
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:30,294
instead of 100,
so he has to take two.

225
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:31,731
It's really important.

226
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:32,903
Got it, Gia.

227
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:35,089
I'll see what I can do.
Take care, honey.

228
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:42,353
Quail Creek lodge?

229
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:45,350
I need to leave a message
for mr. Underhill, please.

230
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:52,717
Bingo.

231
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,999
After you talked to Woody's lawyer,

232
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,812
he immediately called a number
for Quail Creek lodge,

233
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:05,955
20 miles outside of Reno.

234
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:08,137
It's a stocked hunting ranch.

235
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:11,047
Rich businessmen
shooting captive birds.

236
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:12,501
You think Woody's there?

237
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:14,187
I checked google earth.

238
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:16,465
Satellite photos show a landing strip

239
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:18,411
and a building big enough
to hold a plane.

240
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:21,733
I'm on a flight to Reno leaving
an hour after graduation.

241
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:22,882
I don't know if I like the idea

242
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:25,666
of you running around a place full of
armed, drunk businessmen.

243
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:28,240
That's why I rarely go to Texas.

244
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:29,906
I'll be fine.

245
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:34,846
I'll call as soon as I have him.

246
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:53,468
John Enbram.

247
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:00,106
Wallace Fennel.

248
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:13,218
- Guess what?
- What?

249
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:16,085
Beaver got us a room
at the Neptune Grand for tonight.

250
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,719
Ooh-la-la!

251
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:19,114
Any advice?

252
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:20,598
Close your eyes and think of England?

253
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:23,502
Just relax.

254
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:42,201
- Phil Climmer.
- Yo Climmer!

255
00:12:42,202 --> 00:12:43,498
Eli Navarro,

256
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:47,140
you're under arrest in connection
with the murder of Eduardo Orozco.

257
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:48,896
No, man.

258
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:50,961
You have the right to remain silent.
Not here.

259
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:53,372
- Anything you say...
- just give me 10 minutes, okay?

260
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:54,599
You have the right to an attorney.

261
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:56,961
- If you cannot afford an...
- just let me graduate!

262
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:58,817
...One may be appointed for you.

263
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:00,175
Do you understand these rights?

264
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,903
Please don't do this, man.

265
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:07,561
Cuff him.
Let's get him out of here.

266
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:09,138
Hey, hey.

267
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:11,268
You want to do this the hard way, huh?

268
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:23,068
Let's go.

269
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:29,838
Cindy Mackenzie.

270
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:34,877
Scott Markham.

271
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:40,660
Veronica Mars.

272
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:43,107
Yes! Yes!

273
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:01,434
You were expecting some other reaction?

274
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:02,917
I...

275
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:06,235
I can't decide if my life is gonna be
easier or more difficult with you gone.

276
00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:09,209
Anything I should know in case
I get another one like you someday?

277
00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:12,151
Don't keep all your passwords taped
on the bottom of your stapler.

278
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,800
And stay cool, mr. C.

279
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:25,706
For you on this momentous occasion.

280
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:31,110
A pony?!

281
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:36,413
New York?

282
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:37,548
We leave Tuesday.

283
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:41,051
Broadway? Soho? The Moma?

284
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:43,942
Yankee stadium, Shea stadium,
Madison Square garden.

285
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:46,400
Oh, thank you so much!

286
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,004
This is awesome!

287
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:50,215
Oh! Awesome.

288
00:14:50,577 --> 00:14:51,635
Now go catch Woody.

289
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:53,648
I get creeped out just knowing
he's out there somewhere.

290
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,194
Alright. You have fun tonight.

291
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:56,383
That's the plan.

292
00:14:57,216 --> 00:14:58,838
Put on your dancing shoes, Mars,

293
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,912
'cause tonight
we're gonna upchuck the boogie

294
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:02,772
to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.

295
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,494
- "Upchuck"?
- You heard me.

296
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,878
Veronica,

297
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:20,304
do you know about this?

298
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:22,766
I don't. What's wrong?

299
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,385
Wallace left this note for me
on my windshield.

300
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:27,344
He's booked himself a flight to Paris.

301
00:15:27,345 --> 00:15:28,885
He's gonna try to track down Jackie.

302
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:44,164
Mommy! Mommy!

303
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:48,268
You're 10 minutes late.

304
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:50,476
Cut me some slack, ma.

305
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,437
I haven't even been back two days.

306
00:15:52,771 --> 00:15:53,568
Jackie,

307
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:55,039
you ain't in Neptune no more.

308
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:57,203
Terrence Cook fantasy camp is over.

309
00:15:57,204 --> 00:15:58,604
This is real life.

310
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:03,029
Brooklyn Dan's?

311
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,055
Yeah. Hold on.

312
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:08,398
It's for you.

313
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:16,059
Hello?

314
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,695
What, no "Bonjour"?

315
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,185
Veronica?

316
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:20,620
How did you know?

317
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:25,751
Well, first, 3.1 G.P.A.
doesn't scream the Sorbonne.

318
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:27,757
And the Java job...

319
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:29,974
you're a mighty
good service-industry worker

320
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,245
for the daughter of a model
living on the upper west side

321
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:33,564
who never held a job before.

322
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,179
I've known for a while.

323
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:37,012
Look, I might have lied about my life,

324
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,384
but I swear I never lied
to Wallace about how I felt.

325
00:16:40,189 --> 00:16:41,473
Whatever you told him,

326
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:44,888
it really did the trick because
he just got on a plane to Paris.

327
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,992
But the good news is
he has a 4-hour layover at JFK,

328
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:51,972
so you can go tell him the truth
before he's forced to endure

329
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:54,912
several ugly days
of rude waiters for nothing.

330
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:03,260
Hello, Logan.

331
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,035
What are you doing here?

332
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,733
Well, I need a place to stay.

333
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:11,210
How are the suites?

334
00:17:12,393 --> 00:17:14,386
Well, probably an improvement
over your previous digs.

335
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,509
Might be a little weird,
though.

336
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:18,310
I don't think
any of the other guests killed anyone.

337
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,010
You know...

338
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:25,132
you should really make more of
an effort to be civil to me now, Logan.

339
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:28,476
Why? Because you beat a murder rap
and suddenly you're my father again?

340
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:30,537
No, Logan.

341
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,853
I never stopped being your father,
and I never will.

342
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:36,731
But I got the purse strings back.

343
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,923
You're my dependent again,
son.

344
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:43,418
- Going down?
- No. Up.

345
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:53,190
<i>Marijuana?</i>

346
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:56,047
<i>Sure got ourselves in a heap
of trouble this time, cousin.</i>

347
00:17:56,197 --> 00:17:58,241
<i>You got that right.
Boss is gonna throw the book at us.</i>

348
00:17:58,242 --> 00:17:59,557
<i>Not to mention the federal government.</i>

349
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:00,891
<i>When we break our probation,</i>

350
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:02,610
<i>we sure do a bang-up job of it.</i>

351
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:05,641
<i>We ought to be out of prison about
in time to collect social security.</i>

352
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:07,034
<i>It ain't funny, Luke.</i>

353
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:09,007
<i>We got to get ourselves out of this.</i>

354
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:18,436
Ow!

355
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:26,931
Information?

356
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:31,512
Yeah, can you put me through
to the local sheriff's department?

357
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:32,690
Thanks.

358
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,148
So, you used me.

359
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,973
Someone blackmails you,

360
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:47,079
and you use me to set up
the whole girl-in-the-motel thing.

361
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:51,690
Incorporation dies,
and your special secrets stay hidden.

362
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,644
Keith,
I know how this must look.

363
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:56,680
If you're about to insist this is all
some big misunderstanding, Woody,

364
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:57,678
I kind of think you don't.

365
00:18:57,731 --> 00:18:59,199
I didn't crash the bus.

366
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,417
I could never have hurt all those kids.

367
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:02,300
I don't know, Woody.

368
00:19:03,497 --> 00:19:06,479
The welfare of children doesn't seem to
have been terribly high on your list.

369
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,759
That's not how it was.

370
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:09,525
It wasn't that way at all.

371
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:12,201
Those boys...
if you knew their fathers,

372
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:14,238
how they ignored them,
mistreated them.

373
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,725
They needed someone.

374
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:18,229
I listened to them.
I cared about them.

375
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:20,146
Woody, just stop.

376
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,731
Mr. Mars, they're ready.

377
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:31,794
You caught him.

378
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,047
Loading him onto his own plane
as we speak.

379
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,813
As soon as the pilot gets here,
we'll be homeward bound.

380
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:38,575
Did he confess to the crash?

381
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:41,600
Unfortunately, he insists
that he didn't do it,

382
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,893
so we're gonna need
a lot more evidence to nail him.

383
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,188
I'm still trying to find
that third kid from the tape.

384
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,647
I've got everyone
on the team identified except one guy.

385
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,235
I think I know
where to find him, though.

386
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:52,752
The pilot just got here.

387
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:54,410
I'll be in late,
so don't wait up.

388
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:55,996
See you in the morning, honey.

389
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,276
Derek Applegate.

390
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:30,061
Who are you,
and where do you live?

391
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:40,791
Oh, god.

392
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:49,695
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

393
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,657
It's Mac.
Leave a message.

394
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,314
Mac, it's Veronica.

395
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:02,633
You have to get away from Beaver.

396
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:04,759
Do whatever you have to do,
but get away from him.

397
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:05,778
He's dangerous.

398
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,413
Call me when you hear this.

399
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,485
A listing for Hart Hanson?

400
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:17,831
Chug, chug, chug,

401
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:19,517
chug, chug, chug!

402
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:21,903
Oh!
That's what I'm talking about!

403
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:24,244
Feels good to be a man
from time to time, does it not?

404
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:26,361
- Yes.
- Enbom, get over here!

405
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:30,790
All I ask is that you don't follow
that performance with a belch.

406
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:32,912
Do you want to go check out the room?

407
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:35,556
It's liquid. It's courage.

408
00:21:35,557 --> 00:21:36,962
It's liquid courage.

409
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,203
Yeah, well, there's, uh,

410
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:39,621
there's nothing up there
that I'm afraid of.

411
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,060
Did you hear?

412
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:44,596
Veronica's dad caught the mayor.

413
00:21:44,647 --> 00:21:45,625
It's all over the news.

414
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:48,445
They're flying him out tonight
on Woody's plane.

415
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,461
That sleezoid is gonna fry...

416
00:21:50,513 --> 00:21:51,545
bzzzz!

417
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:11,970
Hey. Have you seen Beaver and Mac?

418
00:22:12,021 --> 00:22:13,081
Yeah,
they were here earlier.

419
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:15,546
What's wrong?
I think Beaver...

420
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,652
- What?
- Where's your brother?

421
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:20,620
I think he took "Ghost World"
up to his room.

422
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:22,625
They're probably
up there making love...

423
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:24,559
or playing dungeons and dragons...

424
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,627
or both at the same time.

425
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:30,132
They're both, like,
12th-level dorks... just saying...

426
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:36,029
Don't worry about it.

427
00:22:36,317 --> 00:22:38,845
I'm having a good time,
and we've got all night, okay?

428
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,569
We're cool here.

429
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,200
I'm just gonna hop in the shower,

430
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,973
and then we can head back down
to the party.

431
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:53,634
Can you tell me which room
Cassidy Casablancas is in?

432
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:55,834
I'm sorry.
We can't give out that information.

433
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,361
I can ring his room,
if you'd like.

434
00:22:57,579 --> 00:22:58,471
Sure.

435
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,066
I'm sorry.
There's a "do not disturb" on the room.

436
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:47,584
Damn it.

437
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:49,035
Hello, Veronica.

438
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:51,801
Well, don't look so surprised.

439
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:53,348
It's a small town.

440
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:55,608
Now that I'm no longer in jail,

441
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:58,376
we might just run
into each other from time to time.

442
00:23:58,988 --> 00:24:01,385
I'll have to pay better attention
to where I'm going, then.

443
00:24:01,677 --> 00:24:02,820
Well, it's a free country.

444
00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:06,668
Those founding fathers
were really onto something.

445
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,112
Freedom... ah!...

446
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,402
It's pretty damn sweet.

447
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:12,695
I like it.

448
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:14,080
So did Lilly.

449
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:15,889
Bummer you murdered her.

450
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:20,350
You know, I can see why the two
of you were such good friends.

451
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,373
You're so much alike.

452
00:24:23,052 --> 00:24:24,715
Not afraid to speak your minds.

453
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:26,963
You know,
that just might be the best part

454
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:29,840
about the day I smashed her head in
with an ashtray...

455
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,461
knowing that, once and for all,

456
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,434
she would finally shut the hell up.

457
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:41,879
Ah. Well...

458
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,715
have a nice night, Veronica.

459
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:55,791
Mac?

460
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:57,724
Hey, Veronica!

461
00:25:03,162 --> 00:25:04,165
Where's Mac?

462
00:25:04,527 --> 00:25:05,776
A better place.

463
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:10,162
Unfortunately, she never got a chance
to read your message. Now...

464
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:11,934
throw me your bag.

465
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:15,198
I said throw me your bag!

466
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:30,835
So, "Beaver's a killer"?

467
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:33,697
That's a pretty serious accusation.

468
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:35,303
What exactly do you think you know?

469
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,747
You played for Woody's little-league
team with Marcos and Peter.

470
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:42,117
He molested all three of you.

471
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:43,841
They wanted to come forward.

472
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,195
A couple of the Sharks
had to know about it.

473
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:48,521
They'll come forward.

474
00:25:48,726 --> 00:25:50,552
Things like this don't stay secret.

475
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:51,983
Damn right.

476
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,307
Yeah, but I mean do you guys really
want people to know about it?

477
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:56,576
He's a pervert. He's sick.

478
00:25:56,634 --> 00:25:57,965
And what he did to us is wrong.

479
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:01,604
Look, please don't drag me into this.

480
00:26:01,774 --> 00:26:02,838
You're already in it.

481
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:04,754
You'll thank us later.

482
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:08,230
Peter and Marcos were going to spill.

483
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:09,959
That's why they had to die.

484
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,046
My guess?

485
00:26:12,435 --> 00:26:14,837
You got the explosives
from Curly Moran.

486
00:26:15,887 --> 00:26:18,415
I saw you with that sophomore
Hart Hanson last week.

487
00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:21,253
Hart says you worked
on his war movies with him,

488
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,487
that you were in charge
of blowing things up.

489
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,877
He said you knew a guy
who taught you how to do it...

490
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:27,420
your dad's mechanic,

491
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,091
former stunt coordinator
Curly Moran, right?

492
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:33,642
Admit it, man,

493
00:26:33,961 --> 00:26:35,838
you're way happier in the limo
than sitting on the bus,

494
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:37,993
getting eye daggers
in the back from meg.

495
00:26:37,994 --> 00:26:40,508
I'd have been happier
if you hadn't had that chili dog.

496
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:53,785
Curly told Weevil that he knew who blew
up the bus.

497
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:55,186
He figured it out,
didn't he?

498
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:57,276
That's why you needed him gone.

499
00:26:57,739 --> 00:27:00,570
You know Cervando's been bragging
about hustling Liam Fitzpatrick,

500
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:04,095
so you convinced the P.C.H.Ers
that Curly blew up the bus.

501
00:27:06,648 --> 00:27:07,353
Yo!

502
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:13,239
- Come on, man, let's go!
- Come on, man!

503
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,560
But you have to finish the job.

504
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,786
<i>Tell me.</i>

505
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:31,583
<i>Tell it's me by the clamor, now, baby!</i>

506
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:34,592
You wanted to focus any investigation
in a new direction.

507
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:37,616
You knew I was a key witness
in the Aaron Echolls trial,

508
00:27:37,946 --> 00:27:38,995
so...

509
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,774
Convenient, wasn't it?

510
00:27:46,775 --> 00:27:48,932
The road hog's cliffside location?

511
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,695
Easy to dump the body.

512
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,113
You didn't hire me to catch Kendall
cheating on your dad, did you?

513
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:58,663
You knew what he was up to,

514
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:01,328
and you wanted to punish him
for the way he treated you.

515
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,403
You used me to do it.

516
00:28:02,612 --> 00:28:04,976
And you were marvelous.

517
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:07,180
Now let me ask you something.

518
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:09,692
How is it I got Chlamydia?

519
00:28:10,506 --> 00:28:11,939
Woody was treated for it.

520
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:13,788
I ended up with it.

521
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:16,067
Shelly Pomroy's party, sophomore year.

522
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:19,863
You said Dick pushed you into a room
with me after I'd been roofied,

523
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:22,563
but you didn't run out
like you said you did, did you?

524
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,065
Nope.

525
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:26,452
You wanted to prove you were a man.

526
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:29,392
It helped that I was unconscious,
didn't it?

527
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,646
Easy to imagine
whatever it is you needed to imagine.

528
00:28:35,056 --> 00:28:36,697
You raped me!

529
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,320
And Dick still thinks I'm a virgin.

530
00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:42,679
See, I know how to keep a secret.

531
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:44,717
That's what this is all about,
isn't it...

532
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:48,316
keeping your secret?
Well, it's over. It's out. I know.

533
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:50,919
Yeah, but I have a pretty good feeling
that you won't be telling anybody.

534
00:28:51,845 --> 00:28:52,879
I already did.

535
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:54,870
I told my dad.
He knows.

536
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:56,959
That's, uh, that's too bad.

537
00:28:57,925 --> 00:28:59,530
He's on Woody's plane with him, right?

538
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:00,454
Right now on his way back?

539
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:02,451
See, because I have
no more use for Woody.

540
00:29:03,168 --> 00:29:04,930
You heard about the bomb
in Woody's car, right?

541
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:07,360
Yeah, 'cause there's one on his plane,

542
00:29:08,173 --> 00:29:11,619
and all I have to do... is dial.

543
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:15,917
Want to call your dad,

544
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,064
say goodbye before I press send,
go ahead. I'll give you a minute.

545
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:23,124
Cassidy,
no, you're not serious.

546
00:29:23,182 --> 00:29:26,344
56... 55...

547
00:29:27,178 --> 00:29:28,322
ticktock.

548
00:29:35,945 --> 00:29:36,703
Pick up.

549
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:39,135
Please pick up.

550
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:42,938
Daddy.

551
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,136
Well.

552
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:57,379
What do you know?

553
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:20,229
Yeah, sorry about that.

554
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,998
I know this might be a bad time
to ask for a favor.

555
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:31,946
How would you feel now that you've got
nothing left to live for about just

556
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:34,209
rolling yourself off?

557
00:30:34,753 --> 00:30:37,687
I really don't want your DNA
all over my shirt.

558
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:42,391
<i>In a minute, Kalee.</i>

559
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,659
<i>Daddy's on the phone.</i>

560
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:46,374
<i>I'm gonna be in your neighborhood
with my daughter.</i>

561
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:48,143
<i>How about we, um, drop by?</i>

562
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:49,633
<i>That way our daughters can meet.</i>

563
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:53,328
<i>Uh... your...
well, my place is a mess.</i>

564
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,712
I sure like this thing.

565
00:30:56,874 --> 00:30:59,775
Ever wonder what it feels like
to the people you actually taser?

566
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,381
Let's give it a whirl.
What do you say?

567
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:05,202
You know what I was just thinking?

568
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,861
We're Neptune pirates, right?

569
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:09,682
This is like I'm making you
walk the plank.

570
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:12,532
Except instead of jabbing you
with a sword,

571
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:14,834
I'm sending 300,000 volts through you.

572
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,717
Now jump.

573
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,372
Please don't!

574
00:31:22,471 --> 00:31:24,084
You couldn't do this the easy way?

575
00:31:25,513 --> 00:31:27,058
You know,
Aaron Echolls is staying here.

576
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,744
What do you want to bet
that I can get him convicted

577
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,619
for the death of this teenage girl?

578
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,598
No!

579
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,029
Logan, move away from him.

580
00:31:58,627 --> 00:31:59,838
Veronica, don't.

581
00:32:01,026 --> 00:32:02,741
He killed my father!

582
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:05,817
Give me the gun, Veronica.

583
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:08,846
He killed everyone on the bus.

584
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:10,425
He raped me!

585
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:14,887
You are not a killer,
Veronica.

586
00:32:16,607 --> 00:32:17,725
Give me the gun.

587
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,325
You're not a killer,
Veronica.

588
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,449
Give me the gun.

589
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:44,006
Beaver, don't!

590
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:47,270
My name is Cassidy!

591
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:49,226
Cassidy, don't.

592
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,566
Why not?

593
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:54,944
<i>Layin' across a river</i>

594
00:32:56,054 --> 00:32:56,923
That's what I thought.

595
00:32:57,236 --> 00:33:00,318
<i>See my friends</i>

596
00:33:02,515 --> 00:33:05,412
<i>See my friends</i>

597
00:33:06,683 --> 00:33:11,266
<i>Layin' across a river </i>

598
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:16,533
<i>She is gone</i>

599
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,956
Mac.

600
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:20,503
Mac!

601
00:33:21,736 --> 00:33:25,434
<i>And now there's no one left</i>

602
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:30,557
<i>except my friends</i>

603
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:35,637
he took my clothes.

604
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:38,894
He took everything.

605
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:42,177
Why?

606
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,270
<i>She just went</i>

607
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:56,051
Oh... my... god.

608
00:34:02,062 --> 00:34:06,816
Have I told you
how much I love freedom?

609
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:09,938
I like it, too.

610
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:12,904
And any more "freedoming" tonight,

611
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,587
and I'm gonna need a wheelchair.

612
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,307
Ahh.

613
00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:49,746
Well, well, well.

614
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:53,581
Who's that handsome fella?

615
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:23,150
C.W.?

616
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:24,760
It's a done deal.

617
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,426
Hey, Wallace.

618
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:55,081
What are you doing here?

619
00:35:57,003 --> 00:35:58,250
You heading to Paris?

620
00:35:58,414 --> 00:35:59,944
What a coincidence.
Me too.

621
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:03,080
I'm not going to Paris.

622
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,486
This is for the philly shuttle.

623
00:36:06,173 --> 00:36:08,546
Cheapest ticket I could get
to bypass security.

624
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:12,389
I need to tell you some things,
Wallace.

625
00:36:14,843 --> 00:36:16,725
I never lived on the upper west side.

626
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,841
My mom isn't a model.

627
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,317
She's a waitress...

628
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,505
who had a one-night stand
with Terrence 18 years ago.

629
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:30,491
I'm just another kid from Brooklyn
who got screwed up on drugs and

630
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:32,400
booze and all the wrong friends, but...

631
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,969
by the time I was a sophomore...

632
00:36:34,022 --> 00:36:35,926
your past really doesn't matter to me.

633
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,050
I have a son, Wallace.

634
00:36:39,562 --> 00:36:40,607
He's 2.

635
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:43,906
When he was born, my mom
contacted my dad and made a deal.

636
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:47,498
I'd go to California and try to start
over, and she'd raise my baby.

637
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:49,950
When my dad just dropped me
from his life,

638
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:52,070
I realized
that I was being a hypocrite.

639
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:55,311
Here I was, torn up that...

640
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:57,457
I wasn't the center
of my dad's universe

641
00:36:57,508 --> 00:37:00,315
when my mom was raising my kid
3,000 miles away.

642
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,605
I can't be that person,
Wallace.

643
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:06,459
I had to come back.

644
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:11,385
And I have to stay.

645
00:37:15,117 --> 00:37:18,117
And your life is in Neptune,

646
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:21,201
and you have to go.

647
00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:32,972
- You're stinky.
- No you are stinky.

648
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:34,001
No, you're stinky.

649
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:35,427
He means stinky.

650
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:37,310
Both stinky.
You're stinky!

651
00:37:37,363 --> 00:37:38,665
Honk! Honk!

652
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,986
Honey, do you smell that?

653
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:42,702
You know what that is?

654
00:37:42,755 --> 00:37:44,613
I smell bacon.

655
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,910
Dad?

656
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:56,597
Hey, I'm sorry.

657
00:37:58,055 --> 00:37:59,285
I'm sorry.

658
00:38:01,098 --> 00:38:02,954
I'm so sorry.

659
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:06,212
Was that breakfast I smell?

660
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:08,224
You're alive!

661
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,860
Oh, I thought you were dead!

662
00:38:11,524 --> 00:38:13,038
I love you so much.

663
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,018
Oh, honey, what's wrong?
I don't understand.

664
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:17,452
Woody's plane...

665
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,604
Cassidy Casablancas blew it up.

666
00:38:21,222 --> 00:38:22,913
Oh, honey..

667
00:38:23,398 --> 00:38:24,546
I wasn't on the plane.

668
00:38:25,144 --> 00:38:27,901
Lamb didn't want me arriving with
Woody getting met by the press,

669
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,062
so he had them take me off
the plane at the last minute.

670
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:31,925
I ran to the car.
I drove home.

671
00:38:34,264 --> 00:38:35,465
I was a little surprised to find,

672
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:37,433
you know,
Logan on the couch,

673
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:40,471
but it was better than
finding him elsewhere, right?

674
00:38:44,668 --> 00:38:46,992
What were you saying
about the Casablancas boy?

675
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,303
It's most likely
going to be ruled a suicide,

676
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:54,515
so insurance-wise,

677
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:55,887
that's going to be a wash.

678
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:00,079
The cops found these in
Cassidy's room, however.

679
00:39:00,235 --> 00:39:01,393
Phoenix Land Trust.

680
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:02,887
It's all in your name.

681
00:39:03,126 --> 00:39:04,966
- I assume the...
- Right.

682
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:06,796
Phoenix,
the real-estate thing.

683
00:39:06,797 --> 00:39:07,914
How am I doing these days?

684
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:10,655
$8 million and change.

685
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:12,821
Tell him I said,
"nice going. "

686
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:14,214
Him?

687
00:39:15,064 --> 00:39:16,823
Betting against incorporation?

688
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:18,281
Ballsy.

689
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,069
Feels like a Richard Casablancas move
to me.

690
00:39:23,755 --> 00:39:25,198
I can feel it already.

691
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,557
The little-town blues are melting away.

692
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:29,021
You all packed?

693
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:31,252
Vagabond shoes and all.

694
00:39:31,508 --> 00:39:32,657
And pepper spray...

695
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:35,103
for if we run into
that Trump character.

696
00:39:35,493 --> 00:39:37,264
You sure you don't want to drive
with the old man?

697
00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:40,402
Logan is giving me a ride.
We're supposed to "talk. "

698
00:39:40,431 --> 00:39:42,826
How'd he take, um, what happened?

699
00:39:43,168 --> 00:39:46,292
Shrugs it off,
calls himself little orphan Annie,

700
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:49,053
which I think means "badly. "

701
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:52,770
I should go out front.

702
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:54,123
I should get my autograph book.

703
00:39:54,856 --> 00:39:57,165
Carol Channing is still alive,
isn't she?

704
00:39:58,103 --> 00:39:59,111
I'll see you at the gate.

705
00:40:04,228 --> 00:40:05,391
So?

706
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,522
What are you doing here?

707
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:21,873
I'm not gonna see you for a whole week.
That's, like, months.

708
00:40:22,343 --> 00:40:25,069
Yeah, but then I'll be back,
and everything will be fine.

<i>Swing from the ceiling</i>

710
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,903
You say that, but I don't know.

711
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:34,994
- I know. I can feel it.
- And you're never wrong? No?

712
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:37,429
Aw... young love.

713
00:40:37,785 --> 00:40:39,784
No, no, hold that position.

714
00:40:39,942 --> 00:40:43,444
Norman Rockwell wants
to come in and paint you two.

715
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,340
Did he pin on his pin,
or was he too shy?

716
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:48,412
Why are you here?

717
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:50,886
Yeah, I didn't know you could come out
during daylight hours.

718
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:54,061
I have a business proposition
for your father.

719
00:40:54,531 --> 00:40:58,081
Okay, but I'm warning you.
He doesn't carry much cash.

720
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:01,468
I need you to do something for me.

721
00:41:01,613 --> 00:41:04,152
Well, I'll be back in a week,
and at that time, I will...

722
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:05,760
I need it right now.

723
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:08,638
Sorry, mrs. Casablancas,
but I'm meeting my daughter in an hour.

724
00:41:10,332 --> 00:41:12,077
I think you'll change your mind.

725
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,036
Oh.

726
00:41:16,037 --> 00:41:18,671
Like I said, it's important.
