1
00:00:10,746 --> 00:00:11,792
You met Jackie, right?

2
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:13,207
I didn't realize you were lunch buddies.

3
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:14,109
I like her, okay?

4
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:15,796
- Hey, Veronica.
- Hey, Jackie...

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,111
and random dude.

6
00:00:17,187 --> 00:00:20,004
This is Veronica, the girl I was a total biatch to.

7
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:22,818
Hey, check this out.

8
00:00:22,894 --> 00:00:24,797
Mr. David "Curly" Moran.

9
00:00:24,873 --> 00:00:25,866
You've never seen him before?

10
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,543
I have seen this man before.

11
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,119
Why would this man have my name magic-markered across his hand?

12
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:33,596
What was it Aaron wrote to Curly on that picture?

13
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:36,075
"All these years still on 'the long haul,'

14
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:39,673
featuring a stunt performed by David 'Curly' Moran."

15
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:40,815
The bus crash --

16
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:42,480
it was meant for me.

17
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:43,651
Hey, cher!

18
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:45,728
You know that guy?

19
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:47,032
No.

20
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:57,593
Hi, can you tell me if Meg manning has been moved from the intensive care unit?

21
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,370
And what are the visiting hours?

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,479
Thank you.

23
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:07,708
Can I help you?

24
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:09,731
I need to hire a detective.

25
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:11,599
Right place, wrong day --

26
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,632
we're not open on sundays.

27
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,570
This is kind of an emergency.

28
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:17,625
I need to investigate my boyfriend --

29
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,983
or, I guess, my potential fiancé,

30
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:22,876
now that I found an engagement ring in his gym bag.

31
00:01:23,336 --> 00:01:25,417
You found it in his...?

32
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:28,152
I need some serious, serious answers.

33
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:32,907
I can take down your information and make sure Mr. Mars gets it first thing.

34
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:34,914
His name is collin nevin.

35
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:36,568
Okeydokey.

36
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:37,772
Start with the basics --

37
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,232
our standard package, your garden-variety background check,

38
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:43,153
criminal record, aliases.

39
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,746
I need way more than that.

40
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:46,991
Well, there's our premium package --

41
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:50,783
Mr. Mars will "get to know" a few friends, chat up an ex or two.

42
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:53,196
Which is what I'm afraid collin's doing.

43
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:55,951
Look, collin lives off a trust fund.

44
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,975
He has a lot of free time.

45
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,031
I'd like to know how he spends it.

46
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:01,960
Well, there is our silver package.

47
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,279
What's the silver package?

48
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:05,474
Premium package plus surveillance --

49
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:07,730
phone records, e-mail monitoring.

50
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:11,952
It's basically an all-access pass to what he's doing when you're not looking.

51
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:12,899
I'll take it.

52
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:14,970
Oh.

53
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:17,580
It's him.

54
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:19,933
He thinks I'm at yoga.

55
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:22,561
Great.

56
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:28,094
Well, Mr. Mars will review your case, ms. Block, and he'll be in touch tomorrow.

57
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,523
Ah, the man of the hour.

58
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,913
Keith Mars, Julie block.

59
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:32,826
Looking forward to working with you.

60
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,557
Huh.

61
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:35,008
Nice.

62
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,152
Jumpy fiancé?

63
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:41,220
Jumpy potential fiancé, with cash to burn.

64
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:43,395
She practically handed me a blank check.

65
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:46,844
You're organizing the office, not soliciting clients.

66
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:48,718
Maybe you haven't noticed I'm running for sheriff.

67
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,772
I can't even get to the cases I already have.

68
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:52,130
Maybe I could help --

69
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:54,970
just with the little stuff, nothing that requires body armor.

70
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:56,183
You don't work here.

71
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,734
You work at java the hut.

72
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,828
Yeah, that tip money's gonna pay for stanford.

73
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:01,521
No.

74
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:04,978
But the Kane scholarship will, so use your nights to study.

75
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,545
Please, call miss jumpy and tell her I can't take this case.

76
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:20,874
Julie, hi. It's Veronica from Mars investigations.

77
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:25,585
I'm really sorry, but Mr. Mars is unable to take on any new cases at this time.

78
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:27,534
Recommendation?

79
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:30,939
Uh, Nick Harris detectives is always good.

80
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:34,596
If you're looking locally, Vinnie van Lowe is a respected detective.

81
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:38,593
I'm really sorry about this, Julie.

82
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:40,575
I hope it all works out.

83
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:41,989
We wish you the best.

84
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:47,412
The only way I'd ever make 2 grand in a week

85
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:50,087
working at the hut is if they installed a pole.

86
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:52,514
Dad might be too busy for miss bright-side,

87
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,153
but I can pencil in some time to make a couple quick g'S.

88
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:02,361
Mr. Mars thought that, due to the nature of your case,

89
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:06,576
it might be beneficial for you to have a detective of the female persuasion.

90
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:09,668
Aren't you awfully young to be doing this?

91
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:12,901
It's amazing -- I never get tired of that question.

92
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:16,649
Julie, why do you suspect that collin is up to something?

93
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,569
My family is wealthy --

94
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,212
like very.

95
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:24,393
I tend to fall for guys who nail the girl who's teaching my spin class

96
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:26,306
while letting me pay his rent.

97
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,876
Money isn't supposed to matter,

98
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,229
so I'm letting collin think I'm regular old middle class.

99
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:34,689
I see.

100
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:38,170
Well, is there something that's prompting your concern right now?

101
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:43,824
Phone calls at late hours, lame excuses for getting out of the house.

102
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,556
Lately, it's tennis.

103
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:49,893
There is a framed photo of a woman on his bar.

104
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:51,543
Okay.

105
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:52,889
Uh, got it.

106
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:54,047
I'm on it.

107
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:54,877
Thanks.

108
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:59,624
Wallace? Do you have a shift at sac-n-pac tonight?

109
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:00,502
Nope.

110
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:03,628
Hottest girl in school asked me for help with trig.

111
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:04,969
I'm gonna give her a hand.

112
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:06,628
You need help with trig.

113
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:09,817
In fact, I might give her both hands.

114
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,267
Are you hittin' that?

115
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:13,270
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

116
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,229
Darrell!

117
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:39,022
<i>A long time ago,</i>

118
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:42,106
<i>we used to be friends but I</i>

119
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:45,748
<i>haven't thought of you lately at all</i>

120
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:48,869
<i>come on, now, sugar</i>

121
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:51,686
<i>bring it on, bring it on, yeah</i>

122
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:55,030
<i>just remember me when</i>

123
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:57,492
<i>we used to be friends</i>

124
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:59,572
<i>a long time ago</i>

125
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,911
<i>we used to be friends</i>

126
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,343
Saison 2 - Episode 4 
<i>"Green-eyed monster"
</i>

127
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,021
Hi, Julie.

128
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,152
Find out anything?

129
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:31,492
You can rest easy.

130
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:33,266
He's on his eighth lap.

131
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:36,293
And I'm on my way to starbucks, 'cause I gotta say --

132
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:37,811
spying on collin --

133
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:38,971
little boring.

134
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:41,432
I looked up his caller I.D. History.

135
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,829
He's had 20 calls in the past 6 days from the same number.

136
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,417
Don't you think that's odd?

137
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:47,697
It's worth looking into.

138
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:48,771
What's the number? I'll --

139
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:50,046
I already sent it to you.

140
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:50,722
Don't forget --

141
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:52,032
tomorrow he has tennis.

142
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:53,464
Knock, knock!

143
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:58,889
Tell me that's a ham and cheese sandwich.

144
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,905
And I almost went for the chicken salad.

145
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,281
Oh, you just fulfilled one of the top-10 male fantasies.

146
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,609
Oh, yeah,

147
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:10,500
a guy dreams his whole life of a beautiful woman bringing him a sandwich.

148
00:07:19,497 --> 00:07:21,710
Do you have a spare gun I could borrow?

149
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:26,178
That depends.

150
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:29,546
Who do you intend to shoot?

151
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,800
The guy who called out to me in the club in chicago --

152
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:39,035
"cher." He was my old boyfriend, and "cher" was his nickname for me.

153
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,013
When we were in chicago, I asked you --

154
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,614
I know. He caught me completely off guard.

155
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,698
We dated almost 20 years ago, before I was married.

156
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:49,061
And I was young and naive...

157
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:51,067
and he was crazy.

158
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:53,664
So, where does the gun part come in?

159
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:56,208
He drove by my house yesterday morning.

160
00:07:57,785 --> 00:07:59,252
He's tracked me down.

161
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:03,130
There's no way I'm letting you take a gun you don't know how to handle

162
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:05,000
to a house with a 7-year-old.

163
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:08,978
So I'll give you something a little safer to curl up with at night.

164
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:10,321
What?

165
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:12,467
You?

166
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:18,628
What do we tell the kids?

167
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:19,743
Nothing.

168
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:25,962
I think I cooked these too fast.

169
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,928
I got a late start this morning.

170
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:30,574
Mom, you okay?

171
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:33,760
- Uh-huh.
- Why don't you just sit down and eat?

172
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:35,147
Oh.

173
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:37,896
Nice surprise.

174
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:39,041
- Good morning.
- Hi.

175
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:41,084
I was out early doing some surveillance.

176
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,859
Thought I'd stop by, say hi,

177
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:47,400
and send the Fennel men to school with a bellyful of sugar.

178
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,143
Mmm.

179
00:08:50,606 --> 00:08:51,897
Keith Mars for sheriff.

180
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:57,814
My dad spend the night at your place?

181
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,501
Yep.

182
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,438
He do the A.M. Doughnut fake-out run?

183
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:02,708
Want one?

184
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:06,206
Get back, ladies --

185
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:07,032
he's mine!

186
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,741
You really are a basketball star, aren't you?

187
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:13,471
I'm not smacking the ass of some dungeons and dragons geek?

188
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:15,459
Oh, he's a star.

189
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:16,826
Just ask him.

190
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,442
Come on. Let's go.

191
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,930
Smile!

192
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:45,665
Oh, yeah, work it!

193
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:46,417
Work it!

194
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:50,127
You're gonna be pulling that camera out your --

195
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:53,246
The light's much better where you're standing.

196
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:54,947
Keith Mars --

197
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:59,261
former sheriff, private detective, author.

198
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:00,257
Wow.

199
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:02,233
Carl morgan --

200
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:05,592
three years lompoc, assault and battery,

201
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:07,769
cocaine possession, intent to sell.

202
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:11,580
We should really give our publicists pats on the back.

203
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,355
I expected you to become a problem at some point.

204
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:17,444
There's a flight to chicago leaving san diego at 4:45.

205
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,827
You need to be on it.

206
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:22,159
The next time I shoot you, it won't be digitally.

207
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,400
Unless I hit you in the finger.

208
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:25,058
Then we'll laugh about it.

209
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:30,152
Your old lady took something of mine.

210
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:33,078
I'm not leaving till I get it back.

211
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,400
She's not my old lady.

212
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:40,414
She's my special lady friend.

213
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:49,825
Hospitals wig me out, but I've put this off for too long.

214
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,271
It's time I see Meg.

215
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:53,480
Veronica?

216
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:55,321
Duncan?

217
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,265
I didn't know you were --

218
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:01,245
how's Meg?

219
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:07,126
You again?

220
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,744
Why do you come here every day?

221
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,617
How many times do I have to tell you?

222
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:12,897
We never want to see you again!

223
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,496
Stay away from our daughter!

224
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:16,963
And you -- I mean, how can you come here?

225
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,931
Don't you know your presence is upsetting to us?

226
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:21,088
We care about Meg.

227
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:22,221
Mom, he --

228
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:22,891
quiet.

229
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,787
If you really cared about Meg, she wouldn't have been on that bus.

230
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:39,736
You didn't tell me about --

231
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:41,896
what? That Meg was important to me?

232
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,059
About her parents.

233
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:48,303
You want to go eat or something?

234
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,474
Can't -- work.

235
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,504
Gotta go watch a tennis match.

236
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,113
Well, this isn't a tennis court.

237
00:12:10,368 --> 00:12:11,927
What are you up to, collin?

238
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:22,492
No good, it appears.

239
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,029
What is it with men?

240
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:26,008
Never where you expect them to be.

241
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:37,000
Hello?

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,348
Julie, it's Veronica.

243
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,483
Can you check your e-mail?

244
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,358
I'm sending you some photos right now.

245
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:46,471
And do you know anyone who lives at 8520 Primrose lane?

246
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:47,939
No. Why?

247
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:53,244
I'm afraid I've got some bad news and some more bad news.

248
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:55,614
First, collin's not playing tennis.

249
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:59,764
And second, that number that showed up 20 times on his caller I.D...

250
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:00,454
yeah?

251
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:04,190
That number belongs to whoever lives here on primrose lane.

252
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,089
It's where he goes instead of tennis.

253
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:09,109
Did you get the photo yet?

254
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:10,694
Do you recognize the woman?

255
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:12,488
Oh, no. Oh, no.

256
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:13,164
Julie --

257
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:14,634
no, no, no. No.

258
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,677
Julie, listen to me.

259
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:18,888
Do not panic, okay?

260
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,225
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.

261
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:21,977
Okay?

262
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:23,117
Okay.

263
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:24,552
All right, bye.

264
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,206
all right, collin, just give me what I came for --

265
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:45,144
you and your hot little number, deep in the throes of --

266
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:48,213
A hebrew lesson?

267
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:00,678
Julie, no!

268
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,282
Oh!

269
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:04,769
Oh!

270
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,514
Julie, stand down.

271
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,241
He's not cheating on you.

272
00:14:09,772 --> 00:14:10,958
He's with a rabbi.

273
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:12,544
A rabbi?

274
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:15,316
He's not jewish!
I'm jewish!

275
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,239
Are you there yet?

276
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,673
Every day

277
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:33,588
that's what Meg's dad said.

278
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:36,098
What's Duncan doing at the hospital?

279
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,529
Do you think he still loves her?

280
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:45,298
I don't know.

281
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,991
What? Who is this?

282
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,906
It's Julie. The photo of the woman on the bar?

283
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:52,935
She's got to be an ex.

284
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:55,440
If he's keeping her close, do you think he still loves her?

285
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:56,226
Whoa --

286
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:59,170
if I'm pondering the same question about my boyfriend,

287
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:00,889
does that make me crazy, too?

288
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:04,593
Julie, it's 2:27 in the morning.

289
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:09,407
The silver package has its perks, but post-midnight girl talk is not one of them.

290
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,939
What if I get an upgrade?

291
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:12,344
What comes after silver?

292
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,218
Psycho.

293
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:13,953
What?

294
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:14,817
Gold.

295
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:17,135
Julie, it's $3,000.

296
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:18,659
What does it include?

297
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,635
Uh...we dig deeper.

298
00:15:22,363 --> 00:15:25,276
Three months of internet activity, heavier surveillance.

299
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:30,277
We talk to consultants to set up a temptation scenario and see if he responds.

300
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,605
That's perfect.

301
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:33,243
That's exactly what I need.

302
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:37,621
With the gold package, can you find out who that is in the photo on the bar?

303
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:38,819
We can find out.

304
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,049
But if you want my opinion,

305
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:46,221
I'd say there's a fine line between looking for a problem and creating one.

306
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:47,711
Good night.

307
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:56,201
Who let you into my office?

308
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:58,425
That's funny --
I was wondering the same thing.

309
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:01,460
I thought you might want to catch a bad guy or something.

310
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,214
That's carl morgan, drug dealer.

311
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,443
He's wanted for questioning in chicago on an armed robbery.

312
00:16:06,822 --> 00:16:08,540
Drug dealer? For me?

313
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,547
It's not even my birthday.

314
00:16:10,623 --> 00:16:12,353
He's buddies with a dealer I'm tracking.

315
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,862
There's no bounty on him, nothing in it for me.

316
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:17,347
Nothing but the joy of giving.

317
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:18,671
It's not a present, sheriff.

318
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:19,981
It's kind of your job.

319
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:21,049
For now, anyway.

320
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,055
Hope you're having fun.

321
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,527
Yo, martha.

322
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:37,951
I head you took a ride downtown behind the 187.

323
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:39,536
So, did you flop for the cops

324
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:42,773
or did the local wapner hook you up with some ankle bling?

325
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:44,462
You know the deal, cuz.

326
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:48,621
Every time a kitty cries in this town, one-time tries to put a case on me.

327
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:51,674
Speaking of bling, what's up with the hoops?

328
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:54,241
If I rub your head, do I get three wishes?

329
00:16:54,354 --> 00:16:58,421
You rub my head, and you might want to make seeing tomorrow your first wish.

330
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,294
Missing an earring?

331
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,824
You need to be alone for a second?

332
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,147
Where's that disco ball you usually wear?

333
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:13,206
It's probably deep in some chick's shag carpet.

334
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,102
You think?

335
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:14,947
Yeah.

336
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:18,265
I'm guessing an evidence bag in the sheriff's office.

337
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:21,463
Out with you, dog.

338
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:24,237
My question -- and I'm betting it's the sheriff's --

339
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:26,278
what was your earring doing at the road hog

340
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:28,626
in the last place Curly Moran was seen alive?

341
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:31,499
I don't even know what earring you're talking about, so --

342
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:34,082
the one you're wearing in your yearbook photo.

343
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,808
Hmm...sheriff's department, speed dial --

344
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:39,666
if this doesn't get me out of that jaywalking ticket...

345
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,062
hello, inga.

346
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:41,999
Okay.

347
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:47,805
A couple weeks ago, a few days before Curly beached, I got this weird call --

348
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:50,430
some guy saying Curly was behind the bus crash.

349
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:52,039
You don't know who it was?

350
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:55,478
They just said Curly was hired by the fitzpatricks to get back at cervando.

351
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:57,258
As in the "fighting fitzpatricks"?

352
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:57,977
Uh-huh.

353
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:01,538
My dad put five of the fitzpatricks in chino.

354
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:03,080
They're irish catholic.

355
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,855
For every 5 you put away, there's 10 more at home.

356
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:07,511
Cervando had been bragging about

357
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,352
how he hustled leon fitzpatrick out of a few grand down at river styx.

358
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:13,635
That's a lot of info for an anonymous call.

359
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:15,127
- What'd you do?
- Nothing.

360
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:16,146
I'm sure.

361
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:18,069
The fitzpatricks are meth-head lunatics,

362
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:21,016
but they're not gonna kill a bus full of kids over 3 grand.

363
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:22,967
Their problem with cervando would have been solved

364
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:24,862
in an alley with a baseball bat.

365
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:26,464
Give me your cell.

366
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:28,206
I called the mystery guy back.

367
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:29,497
All it does is ring.

368
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,860
Look, should I be expectinga visit from lamb?

369
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:37,096
If I know I'm being brought in, I'll put on good underwear.

370
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:38,983
You should really do that anyway.

371
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:51,346
Hey, buddy.

372
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:52,200
Whatcha doin'?

373
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:55,922
Veronica, are you in immediate, life-threatening danger?

374
00:18:55,998 --> 00:18:57,569
At this precise moment, no.

375
00:18:57,897 --> 00:18:59,735
- Then I'm hanging up.
- Wait! Wait!

376
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:01,850
My go-to temptress just canceled on me,

377
00:19:01,926 --> 00:19:05,015
and I need an A.V. Wizard to be my eyes and ears for a scenario

378
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:06,792
I've got going down at 4:00.

379
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:13,781
Hey, I'd love to help, but I've got my own scenario going on right here.

380
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:18,364
Wallace, if you're getting all that Jackie love with $2 in your pocket,

381
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,399
imagine what you'd get with, say...$200.

382
00:19:28,086 --> 00:19:29,519
you didn't ask how high.

383
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:30,625
What?

384
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:33,436
Didn't goldilocks say "jump"?

385
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,575
It is not even like that.

386
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:38,367
What's it like?

387
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:40,472
We're friends, Jackie.

388
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:43,888
If she needs me, I'm gonna come through, like she would for me.

389
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:46,189
Right. I guess you have different rules here.

390
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:50,264
Where I'm from, the girl you make out with is the one you do favors for.

391
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:54,042
I may have to have a chat with miss pixy stick.

392
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:56,604
I wouldn't do that.

393
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,975
She's not somebody you want to piss off.

394
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:02,771
Yeah neither am I.

395
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:17,497
Sorry I'm late.

396
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:20,930
Whipped-cream fight at the sorority house.

397
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:22,607
Can you hand me a mic?

398
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:25,247
You got someplace to hide it?

399
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,363
Do you own those clothes or did you just make a stop at dirty-coeds 'r' us?

400
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,170
Ha ha.

401
00:20:33,813 --> 00:20:35,942
And I need to be paid up for tonight.

402
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:38,320
Gotta make a little peace with my woman.

403
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,542
Are you sure she's your woman?

404
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:45,632
'Cause I saw her at java the hut the night after our double date,

405
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,786
and some guy was all over her.

406
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:51,615
Like a couple weeks ago, when we only had like two dates.

407
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:52,509
So what?

408
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,739
So it's progressed?

409
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,475
Yeah. It's progressed.

410
00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:59,362
Have you seen her with another guy since? No.

411
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:03,736
See -- when you assume, you really just make an ass out of you.

412
00:21:04,941 --> 00:21:06,676
Just stay as tight as you can.

413
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,036
Just go lolita his ass.

414
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:10,485
Let me do my thing.

415
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:29,017
Can I help you with something?

416
00:21:29,093 --> 00:21:29,693
Please.

417
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,424
That would be so great.

418
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:32,864
Wait.

419
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,358
Do you have an accent?

420
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,324
Yeah, I'm scottish.

421
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:38,087
Really?

422
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:40,699
Like, from scotland?

423
00:21:41,713 --> 00:21:43,218
That's so awesome.

424
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,932
Foreign men are so much sexier than regular men.

425
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:50,373
Oh. Sorry.

426
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:51,578
I hope I'm not bothering you.

427
00:21:51,654 --> 00:21:53,045
It's just, I got a flat.

428
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:56,711
And my cellphone's dead, and I can't find my aaa card.

429
00:21:57,214 --> 00:21:59,385
Do you think you could give me a hand?

430
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,678
I tried real hard.

431
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,710
I just couldn't get the nuts off.

432
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:07,046
I think they're just too tight.

433
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:12,941
But I did just put lotion all over my hands, so they're kind of slippery.

434
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:17,381
You do know you've got to jack the car up first, right?

435
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:18,451
Oh, yeah.

436
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:19,974
Do you have a jack?

437
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:27,314
Oh, you -- uh...

438
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:29,098
you've got, um...

439
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:30,902
oh.

440
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:32,978
How cute are you.

441
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:43,038
No, keep it.

442
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:46,627
Listen -- we could be out here all day with me doing this.

443
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:49,580
So why don't I go in and call you a tow truck?

444
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,020
Do you have a computer in there?

445
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:55,535
Because I kind of need more than a tow truck right now.

446
00:22:56,053 --> 00:22:58,435
I go to ucsd, and I have this midterm that,

447
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:01,103
if I don't turn in, in about 10 minutes...

448
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:05,679
all right. Come on.

449
00:23:13,198 --> 00:23:14,653
Okay, come on.

450
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:16,024
The accent?

451
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:23,389
Are you, like, the catch of the year or what?

452
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:24,273
Hardly.

453
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:25,203
Please.

454
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,309
My girlfriend paige would love this place!

455
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:29,819
She's not my girlfriend-girlfriend.

456
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:31,141
She's just my friend.

457
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:33,459
I mean, we share a dorm room, so, whatever.

458
00:23:33,535 --> 00:23:34,700
It's college, right?

459
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:37,724
Oh, she would really love this place.

460
00:23:39,563 --> 00:23:43,305
I mean, who wouldn't want to wake up to this view?

461
00:23:44,377 --> 00:23:46,776
You should really let me know if you want to party with us.

462
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:47,631
We're fun --

463
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:48,693
double the fun.

464
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,504
I don't have too many parties.

465
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:52,144
I'm a pretty mellow guy.

466
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:52,824
Really?

467
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:54,822
You seem kind of --

468
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,054
I don't know --

469
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,687
wild to me, like a caged animal kind of thing.

470
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,882
You'd have to ask my girlfriend about that --

471
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:03,391
my actual girlfriend.

472
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:06,192
We're not just dorm-mates, if you get my drift.

473
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:07,728
I bet she'S...pretty.

474
00:24:08,122 --> 00:24:09,361
Drop...gorgeous.

475
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:11,812
Can I ask you something?

476
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:12,548
Sure.

477
00:24:12,554 --> 00:24:13,417
What about me?

478
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:17,310
I mean, if the range were pretty to drop-dead gorgeous,

479
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:18,860
where would I fall?

480
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:25,052
You'd fall under "knows she's gorgeous but likes to hear it anyway."

481
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:27,965
Don't forget about that midterm.

482
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,062
Veronica...

483
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,400
this is really sweet of you.

484
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:46,144
I owe you, like, the biggest favor ever.

485
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:48,730
Seriously, you can ask me for anything.

486
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:53,686
Somebody's a big movie buff, I see.

487
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:55,717
Quick -- favorite movie of all time.

488
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:56,973
Don't think about it.
Just answer.

489
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:57,927
Oh, I don't know.

490
00:24:58,003 --> 00:24:59,422
That's a hard one.

491
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:01,719
This really isn't my place, actually.

492
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:03,782
I'm just housesitting for my friend.

493
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,346
Your friend a big Nicolas Cage fan?

494
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:09,305
My friend is Nic Cage.

495
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:11,128
Really?

496
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,382
Nic Cage.

497
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:18,468
That's hot.

498
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:21,524
Would you excuse me a second?

499
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:31,392
Hello.

500
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,265
Uh, hi.

501
00:25:36,024 --> 00:25:39,196
Would you like to help the hungry, starving children of...

502
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:40,620
the world?

503
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:42,282
I'm sorry --

504
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:43,775
are you selling something?

505
00:25:44,594 --> 00:25:46,144
Yes. I am.

506
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,384
I'm selling, um, pens and...candy.

507
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:53,313
I'll take a couple of boxes of candy.

508
00:26:01,112 --> 00:26:02,461
All I got is this box.

509
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:05,281
That box is opened.

510
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:07,078
You want a couple pens?

511
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:11,443
I e-mailed the paper and called aaa.

512
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,154
Thanks for your help.

513
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,872
Your karma's golden. Ciao!

514
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:16,556
Whatcha doin'?

515
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,938
I'm cramming for that latin quiz.

516
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:20,987
Can't forget about the Kane legacy.

517
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:22,986
Have you had dinner?

518
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:26,442
No, I'm tired of room service.

519
00:26:29,511 --> 00:26:33,406
Then may I suggest "dim sum and then some"?

520
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:38,003
I got the "don't wait up" callfor the second night in a row.

521
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,071
And if dad can work all night with Mrs. Fennel, then...

522
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,873
What if we start the evening with "and then some"

523
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:57,078
and work our way back to the dim sum?

524
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,166
It's officially under consideration.

525
00:27:01,258 --> 00:27:02,943
Can I ask you something first?

526
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,578
Yes to costumes.

527
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:05,738
No to props.

528
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,273
Does that cover it?

529
00:27:08,614 --> 00:27:12,429
Why didn't you tell me how often you'd visited Meg since the accident?

530
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,793
Chinese food it is.

531
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,623
You want one egg roll or two?

532
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:23,030
Mental note --

533
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:26,874
don't mention partner's ex-girlfriend if one expects to fool around.

534
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:30,229
And while we're on the subject of men I failed to seduce today,

535
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:32,510
time to see what collin likes to google.

536
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:35,778
What dirty secrets are lurking in your browser history?

537
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,887
Escort agencies? Bootycall.Com?

538
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:40,200
Neptune swingles?

539
00:27:40,796 --> 00:27:41,919
Well, look at that.

540
00:27:42,004 --> 00:27:45,073
Julie was afraid to tell collin about her family's money.

541
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:48,051
Apparently, he's figured that out all on his own.

542
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:56,218
Oh my God, it's my dad.

543
00:28:00,422 --> 00:28:01,307
Who is it?

544
00:28:02,706 --> 00:28:05,313
It's lizzie. Um, I really need to talk to you.

545
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:06,533
H-hang on a sec.

546
00:28:07,696 --> 00:28:10,311
What is Meg's sister doing here at 2:00 A.M.?

547
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:16,871
Oh, sorry. Should I hide in the bedroom, like a hooker?!

548
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:17,705
Perfect!

549
00:28:30,894 --> 00:28:33,376
Sorry. I didn't know where else to go.

550
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,164
Is Meg all right?

551
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:37,663
She didn't wake up or anything.

552
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:39,768
My parents got a call from the school.

553
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,355
They're going tomorrow to clean out Meg's locker.

554
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:43,814
She kept this at school.

555
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,457
It's got everything on it.

556
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:50,066
I'm sure Meg told you that my parents aren't real big on privacy.

557
00:28:50,673 --> 00:28:54,087
They go through our rooms, our cars, our backpacks.

558
00:28:54,795 --> 00:28:55,987
So you want me to hide it for her?

559
00:28:56,063 --> 00:29:00,240
Well, whatever genius called from the office told my parents about this computer.

560
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:03,132
Meg has a laptop my parents didn't know about.

561
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:05,340
They're gonna want to see what's on it.

562
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,933
I don't have the password,

563
00:29:07,185 --> 00:29:09,790
but we have to get her personal stuff off this computer

564
00:29:09,866 --> 00:29:11,261
and put it back by morning.

565
00:29:11,337 --> 00:29:14,036
Okay, so what do you want me to do?

566
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:16,642
You're the son of a computer visionary.

567
00:29:16,902 --> 00:29:18,243
Can't you do something?

568
00:29:19,392 --> 00:29:20,439
I can burn a cd.

569
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,829
All I know is if my parents see what's on there,

570
00:29:23,905 --> 00:29:25,849
they'll pull the plug on Meg tomorrow.

571
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:27,592
Can I use your bathroom real quick?

572
00:29:27,668 --> 00:29:28,791
Uh, uh...

573
00:29:28,898 --> 00:29:29,719
n-not really.

574
00:29:34,498 --> 00:29:35,990
Hi, lizzie.

575
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:40,555
Okay, so, apparently, looks really can't kill.

576
00:29:40,723 --> 00:29:41,346
I'm sorry.

577
00:29:41,422 --> 00:29:42,205
I didn't want --

578
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,358
did you hear us?

579
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:44,836
Yes.

580
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,868
And if you'll let me, I know someone who can help.

581
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:52,883
I have to say, it is a little comforting.

582
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:56,434
I haven't snuck out of my house at 3:00 A.M. In a while.

583
00:29:56,806 --> 00:29:58,843
Nice to know I still have the chops.

584
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:01,667
And I'm in.

585
00:30:01,743 --> 00:30:03,084
This is the hard drive.

586
00:30:04,307 --> 00:30:05,765
You want all the e-mails, right?

587
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:06,441
Mm-hmm.

588
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,775
You must have some nosy-ass parents.

589
00:30:15,135 --> 00:30:17,162
And this goes to you?

590
00:30:17,238 --> 00:30:17,973
Right?

591
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:20,419
Yeah, I guess.

592
00:30:28,344 --> 00:30:31,616
Are you crazy, Duncan, leaving this out in the open?

593
00:30:31,858 --> 00:30:34,843
Do you leave heroin out when iggy pop spends the night?

594
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:57,357
Hello, Julie.

595
00:30:57,717 --> 00:30:58,632
Was it awful?

596
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,296
He was a consummate gentleman.

597
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,028
He didn't try to flirt.

598
00:31:03,104 --> 00:31:06,306
And, in fact, he just told me how great you were.

599
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:09,959
Okay.

600
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,908
I guess this is the moment that I officially became a jealous freak.

601
00:31:13,984 --> 00:31:16,105
Hey, Julie, can I call you back later?

602
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,615
It's lamb.

603
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:49,662
I'm thinking I might have a boot for you, too.

604
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:51,744
Any ideas where I can put it?

605
00:31:51,884 --> 00:31:55,271
Hey, you started it with your "I found you a wanted man" B.S.

606
00:31:56,752 --> 00:32:00,704
You send me in to arrest carl morgan, A.K.A. Nathan woods.

607
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:03,663
Chicago cop.

608
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:05,934
Big-time decorated detective.

609
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:09,338
Did you think I wouldn't check up on the guy, keith?

610
00:32:09,414 --> 00:32:11,533
His record is one phone call away.

611
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:13,562
How stupid do you think that I am?

612
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,320
I know it's awful if you wouldn't tell me over the phone.

613
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:33,888
After a thorough investigation, collin appears to be a loyal,

614
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:36,000
committed partner, without a criminal record.

615
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:40,402
And his friends and exes both speak very highly of him.

616
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:44,607
The bad news must be really bad?

617
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,334
The house he currently lives in and the car he drives aren't his.

618
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,525
He's housesitting...

619
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:51,172
for Nicolas cage.

620
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:53,981
That's lisa marie in the framed photo on the bar.

621
00:32:54,958 --> 00:33:00,488
And, finally, it appears as though he did do some research into your background,

622
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:03,128
and he is aware that your family is wealthy.

623
00:33:03,577 --> 00:33:05,671
He went digging for information on me?

624
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:09,050
I should have known.

625
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:11,136
He told me he had a trust fund.

626
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:14,226
He totally let me believe that house was his!

627
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,951
I have some of his internet history on my computer if you want to --

628
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,566
Mr. Mars. I thought you had the kiwanis banquet.

629
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:27,847
Miss block, I need to speak with Veronica for a moment.

630
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:28,861
Would you mind?

631
00:33:30,078 --> 00:33:30,855
Sure.

632
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:35,220
I need to go stand in traffic for a while, maybe jump off a pier.

633
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:44,008
Another satisfied customer?

634
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,852
Here.

635
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:47,656
Can you file this under

636
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:52,143
"cases I don't have time for that my disobedient daughter can take behind my back"?

637
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,570
I'm really sorry.

638
00:33:54,729 --> 00:33:55,332
For what?

639
00:33:56,387 --> 00:33:58,240
Taking the case or getting caught?

640
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,410
Okay, for both.

641
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,610
I just thought it was crazy to pass up that amount of money,

642
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:04,838
and I thought I could handle it.

643
00:34:04,914 --> 00:34:07,329
You always think you can handle it, Veronica.

644
00:34:07,438 --> 00:34:11,395
Believe it or not, at 18, you can't handle everything.

645
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:14,323
And you don't get away with it all either.

646
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:14,999
I know.

647
00:34:15,044 --> 00:34:17,490
Whether it's playing "I spy" after school

648
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:20,593
or staying out all night at your boyfriend's hotel room,

649
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:24,798
you're just not quite as clever as you think you are.

650
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:50,154
Hello?

651
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,019
Julie, I just thought of something.

652
00:34:52,095 --> 00:34:55,774
You know, you think you're dating prince charming.

653
00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:59,586
But you're really dating prince charming's kato.

654
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,811
I just called him.

655
00:35:04,465 --> 00:35:05,288
I ended it.

656
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:08,994
It's over.

657
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:13,549
As soon as he checks his messages.

658
00:35:14,132 --> 00:35:15,909
You broke up with him on his --

659
00:35:16,943 --> 00:35:21,262
Julie, the internet search that collin did on your family was dated five days ago.

660
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:23,010
Yeah. So?

661
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:25,593
So you found the ring like two weeks ago.

662
00:35:25,669 --> 00:35:28,867
He checked into your family after he bought the ring.

663
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:32,437
He was probably looking to find your father so he could ask for his approval.

664
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:34,717
I'll bet he didn't even know about the money.

665
00:35:34,793 --> 00:35:36,199
He lied about the house.

666
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:38,567
He told you it was his?

667
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:41,925
It was implied. He probably lied about the trust fund, too.

668
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:44,720
You didn't exactly tell him the truth either.

669
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:47,453
It's one thing to lie and say you're not rich.

670
00:35:47,874 --> 00:35:50,170
The other way around is way less cool.

671
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:52,152
I think I get it now.

672
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,152
Money matters.

673
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,582
Of course it matters.

674
00:36:01,168 --> 00:36:02,915
Alicia? Alicia?

675
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,856
Anybody home?

676
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:36,597
When your mom's an alcoholic, you spend a lot of time looking at bottles.

677
00:36:52,036 --> 00:36:54,106
"Julie, I wanted you to have these.

678
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:57,013
"Everything patrick collin nevin told you was true.

679
00:36:57,236 --> 00:36:58,596
"He does have a trust fund --

680
00:36:58,672 --> 00:37:00,861
"perhaps bigger than either of us imagined.

681
00:37:00,937 --> 00:37:02,243
"The enclosed article mentions

682
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:04,122
"that he hates to flaunt his wealth "

683
00:37:04,198 --> 00:37:05,736
or his celebrity friendships.

684
00:37:05,812 --> 00:37:09,336
"You both wanted to be sure "you were loved for who you really were.

685
00:37:09,412 --> 00:37:11,365
And it seems that one of you was."

686
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:23,868
Keith Mars.

687
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:26,705
Mr. Pascal, yes.

688
00:37:27,442 --> 00:37:28,903
Uh, I know.

689
00:37:29,129 --> 00:37:30,822
It's been a little busy here.

690
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:34,929
Um...

691
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:37,589
here we go.

692
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:41,976
I'm sorry, sir.

693
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,903
It looks like your wife is, indeed, having an affair.

694
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:48,179
Your uncle?

695
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:51,050
Missing persons case?

696
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:52,972
I'm very sorry, sir.

697
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:55,030
It's a little filing mix-up.

698
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:58,290
You were stuck inside Mr. Pastorelli's file.

699
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:06,586
Your uncle al is alive and well in a retirement home in waikiki and,

700
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:08,733
as far as I know, completely faithful.

701
00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:12,790
I have his number right here.

702
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:26,383
Okay.

703
00:38:27,354 --> 00:38:30,213
Maybe I can use your help around the office...a bit.

704
00:38:31,671 --> 00:38:33,215
I'm sorry. Come again?

705
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,443
You're never gonna tell me what happened to prompt this.

706
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,353
Nope.

707
00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:45,636
Now, I'm just talking about a little help with research, filing, the phones.

708
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:47,129
I do give good phone.

709
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:49,047
Just a couple days a week.

710
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:50,815
And you're keeping your job at the hut.

711
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:52,886
Of course, I'll be needing a raise.

712
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:57,775
Since talking to Weevil, I've been dying to track down this mysterious tipster.

713
00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:00,593
Who knows if Weevil -- or the tipster, for that matter --

714
00:39:00,669 --> 00:39:01,918
was telling the truth.

715
00:39:02,064 --> 00:39:06,356
Maybe Curly Moran was part of a plot to retaliate against a P.C.H.Er.

716
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,560
And maybe that's exactly what someone wants us to believe.

717
00:39:09,636 --> 00:39:11,693
That call could've come from anywhere --

718
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:14,466
a business line, a pay phone, or --

719
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:16,292
oh, my god.

720
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:25,662
Okay.

721
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:28,320
God, I just can't take the begging.

722
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:30,367
I'll relent, just once.

723
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:34,063
But no cuddling after, and I won't call you in the morning.

724
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:38,767
Saturday, september 24th, there was a 2-minute and 23-second phone call

725
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,094
on Weevil's cellphone, made from your house.

726
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,679
The caller claimed that Curly Moran was responsible for the bus crash --

727
00:39:44,755 --> 00:39:47,710
the same Curly Moran who's friends with your dad.

728
00:39:48,504 --> 00:39:49,629
Any explanation?

729
00:39:49,705 --> 00:39:51,496
Oh, my day is complete.

730
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:53,688
Veronica Mars has accused me of evil.

731
00:39:54,938 --> 00:39:55,945
Where to start?

732
00:39:57,006 --> 00:39:59,528
Oh, yes -- who the hell is Curly Moran?

733
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:01,234
And how do you know he knows my dad?

734
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:04,988
And what conspiracy theory have you pulled out of your ass this time?

735
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:08,053
The fact, evidenced by the poster in your house,

736
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:12,005
is that Curly Moran was the stunt coordinator on "the long haul,"

737
00:40:12,081 --> 00:40:14,672
starring Aaron Echolls, circa 1982.

738
00:40:15,032 --> 00:40:16,468
Now, september 24th?

739
00:40:16,842 --> 00:40:18,433
Like I have any idea w--

740
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:23,162
wait. I think I do remember that night.

741
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:26,695
That was the night of my "life's short" party.

742
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:29,259
Of course.

743
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,807
A group of lower-middle class students plummet to their death,

744
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:34,375
and the 09ers throw a party.

745
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:35,993
Hence the "life's short" part.

746
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:36,976
It was in their honor.

747
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:39,575
And in the end, it wasn't just your social betters.

748
00:40:39,651 --> 00:40:42,636
In fact, your pal Weevil and his biker boys crashed it.

749
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,771
Oh, and, uh...

750
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:50,235
Lamb and a half-dozen deputies came by to break it up...

751
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:51,835
or, at least, collect the kegs.

752
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:54,659
There are five numbers registered to your house.

753
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,282
This call came from a number I don't recognize.

754
00:40:57,358 --> 00:40:59,427
Gee whillikers. It sounds like you're onto something.

755
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:01,020
Maybe the pool boy did it.

756
00:41:01,945 --> 00:41:02,669
Well.

757
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:12,627
You don't have anything?

758
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:14,558
Not under "woods" either?

759
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:18,247
By 1987, she was going by Alicia Fennel.

760
00:41:20,325 --> 00:41:21,352
Yeah, she does.

761
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:25,396
What?

762
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,124
Are you sure?

763
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:38,240
Wallace?

764
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:43,673
Yeah.

765
00:41:44,113 --> 00:41:44,892
Who are you?

766
00:41:49,938 --> 00:41:51,198
Take a look.

767
00:41:55,793 --> 00:41:57,310
Am I supposed to know you?

768
00:41:57,967 --> 00:41:59,216
You sure are, Wallace.

769
00:42:02,043 --> 00:42:03,040
I'm your father.

770
00:42:06,418 --> 00:42:09,398
