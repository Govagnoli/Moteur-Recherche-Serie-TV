1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,719
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:07,243
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:10,731
My husband didn't kill himself.

4
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:12,285
What makes you think that?

5
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:13,979
Because I know my husband.

6
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:15,946
Why bother with
something not good...

7
00:00:15,947 --> 00:00:17,611
just because it's something?

8
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:18,815
Especially when you
know the difference,

9
00:00:18,816 --> 00:00:20,031
which not many people do?

10
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,089
I mean, do you?

11
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,332
I think I do.

12
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:36,054
Are you gonna eat that?

13
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:37,015
This?

14
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:39,041
Yeah, that fry in particular.

15
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:40,499
That was the plan.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,301
I'm just saying, if you weren't,

17
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:44,934
or if you were just gonna
consume it out of obligation...

18
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:46,957
or to meet someone
else's expectations,

19
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,418
I know someone who might be
willing to take it off your hands.

20
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:53,146
Maybe add a little ketchup,

21
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:54,642
make it worth a girl's while.

22
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,517
You're welcome.

23
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:03,665
Well, I'm off to astronomy.

24
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,143
- Did you see the Lampoon yet?
- Unh-unh.

25
00:01:06,848 --> 00:01:07,815
Enjoy.

26
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:16,338
"Multiple eggings beat
fear into Lampoon editors"

27
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:20,343
Don't tell me they actually wrote
something funny in there.

28
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:21,068
Better.

29
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,117
The Hearst Lampoon offices got egged...

30
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,138
the night after Dean O'Dell
reinstated the Greeks.

31
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:28,587
See,

32
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,456
that's where the egg was launched at
the Pi Sig party by unknown persons.

33
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:35,277
Read the Lilith House girls.

34
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:37,851
I can't believe how dumb
these people are, you know?

35
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:40,277
They're mad at the dean,
so they egg his window,

36
00:01:40,278 --> 00:01:42,462
like he's the one who
has to clean it up.

37
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:43,664
The dean's window?

38
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:45,582
It doesn't mention the dean's window.

39
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,593
That night, they egged
the dean's office, too.

40
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:50,202
I don't know why they
didn't put that in there.

41
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:52,398
Maybe they couldn't find
a way to make it funny.

42
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:55,525
He was a good guy,
the dean, you know.

43
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:57,843
It's a damn shame.

44
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,703
I filled out the request form a week ago.

45
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,469
Ah, got it. Somebody filed it under D.

46
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:16,422
Mr. Mars requested the report
on Cyrus O'Dell's suicide.

47
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:18,118
You know you're not
sheriff anymore, right?

48
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,008
Just an interested citizen.

49
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,448
It's a public record, Sheriff.
He filled out the form.

50
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:25,393
Always looking for a crime
where there isn't one.

51
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:27,143
I think you need a new hobby, Keith.

52
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:30,722
Oh, I don't know. I find solving
an investigation very relaxing.

53
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:32,662
You should give it a try sometime.

54
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:36,086
- Yeah, yeah. I'll get right on that.
- Hmm.

55
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:43,934
Veronica, hey.

56
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,191
Sir Cheats-a-Lot. How's business?

57
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:47,190
Booming.

58
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:48,499
It's like no one here
wants to do his own work.

59
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,781
I've actually brought in employees.

60
00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:53,669
Question. Does your team provide
study guides for ethics exams?

61
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,644
Every day.

62
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:56,960
Yeah, the irony has kind
of faded over time.

63
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:58,399
So, my own question.

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,588
Is it true you're, like, a
junior private investigator?

65
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:04,492
Because if it's true,
A: that's really cool,

66
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:06,739
and B: I-I've got a case for you.

67
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,467
You're just like the
rest of them, aren't you?

68
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:10,888
You just want to use me for my skills...

69
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,747
and pay me for my time and effort.

70
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:15,127
Do I have an option of using you
for your skills and not paying?

71
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,796
The friends-and-family plan...
unfortunately, you're neither.

72
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,562
Then I guess I'll pay.

73
00:03:19,563 --> 00:03:20,836
Here's the deal.

74
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:23,235
The woman I love is getting
married next week.

75
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,755
I have no idea where or to who.

76
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:28,194
I don't know her address,
her phone number.

77
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:29,989
I don't even know her last name.

78
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,554
If you don't find her,

79
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,577
I'm taking a bath with my blow-dryer.

80
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:38,438
Veronica Mars

00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,439
3X11 "Poughkeepsie, Tramps and Thieves"

Transcript: Inigo [vmtranscripts.com]
Synchro: Camilla [veronicamars.it]

83
00:03:57,344 --> 00:03:59,344
Vieni a trovarci!

84
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:03,345
veronicamars.it

85
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:07,799
So we're straight,

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,281
this girl you love:

87
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,035
you don't know where she lives,

88
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:12,245
who she's marrying, or,

89
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:14,132
if I understand correctly, her name.

90
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,982
- I know her first name.
- A triumph.

91
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:18,175
And she's from Poughkeepsie.
She mentioned that.

92
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:21,382
How do I put this delicately?
Does she know who you are?

93
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:22,871
Yes.

94
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:25,183
We met at this convention thing.

95
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:27,532
We got to talking. We hit it off.

96
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,322
We ended up staying up all night
in my hotel room talking about,

97
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:33,339
you know, life, the big picture.

98
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,351
We connected on some higher plane.

99
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:37,224
Last names, at that point, seemed trivial.

100
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,824
Uh-huh, so, what was the convention?

101
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:42,231
Is there actually a fake-term-paper
and stolen-test-provider union?

102
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:43,660
It was ComicCon.

103
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:47,552
You didn't get all sweaty in
your Wookiee suit, did you?

104
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,808
Yuk it up.

105
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:51,931
You know, it's not all Trekkies
and Star Wars nerds.

106
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:55,198
I was there because Dave Gibbons
has a new graphic novel

107
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,768
that he scripted as well as drew.

108
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:58,167
Sounds cooler now.

109
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:00,138
So, about the one that got away,

110
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,346
she was dressed as a Cylon, and
you only knew her as Six, right?

111
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:05,555
Her name is Chelsea,

112
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,603
and she was in regular clothes.

113
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:09,293
And, yeah, after the Dave Gibbons thing,

114
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:12,061
I may have drifted into the
Battlestar Galactica session.

115
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,876
And, yeah, that's where we met.

116
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:16,026
And, okay, we started
out talking about how...

117
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:20,160
the Cylon raiders on BSG look like
Batman's car when it turns into a plane.

118
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:21,443
But then...

119
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:23,097
then we started talking about...

120
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:25,401
our crappy relationships
with our parents and...

121
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:28,846
and Chuck Klosterman and moral grayness.

122
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:31,508
And how when you see a
plastic bag flying around,

123
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:33,991
you think there's so much beauty
in the world you can't take it?

124
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:35,203
You get the picture.

125
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,150
I do.

126
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:37,703
Connection, higher plane.

127
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,989
Then you frakked.

128
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,271
No.

129
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:43,113
No, but sex was hardly the point.
What we had was better.

130
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:46,564
I took her to the airport in the morning.
We were running late.

131
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:49,111
She said she left me a note by my bed,

132
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:50,802
with all her information on it.

133
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:52,560
By the time I got back to the room,

134
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,961
housekeeping had been there,
and the note was gone.

135
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:56,492
Are you sure she actually left it?

136
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:57,593
Positive.

137
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,804
So, how do you know she's-

138
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:01,840
A few days ago, she
sent me a text message.

139
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,884
It said that she was giving
up waiting for me to call,

140
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,862
that her and her ex were
getting back together

141
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:06,986
and they're getting married.

142
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:09,868
So, why am I here?

143
00:06:10,263 --> 00:06:11,684
Because I've got to stop her.

144
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:14,097
She's only marrying him
because I didn't call her back.

145
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:17,722
Well, if she sent you a text,
then you've got her number.

146
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:19,161
Call her and explain it all.

147
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:20,453
I've called a bunch of times.

148
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:22,482
Some guy answers, says he's
never heard of Chelsea.

149
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:24,760
Can I see the text?

150
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,563
I showed it to my roommate,
and he accidentally erased it.

151
00:06:27,564 --> 00:06:29,304
I have the number the
text came from, though.

152
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,025
Where?

153
00:06:30,796 --> 00:06:31,818
Have a seat.

154
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:34,894
No, thanks. It's easier to
be nosy if I can mill about.

155
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:38,106
You know Mac and Parker?

156
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,327
This is their room.

157
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:40,606
- Who?
- This photo.

158
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:42,633
No, that was from the
around-the-world party.

159
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,935
That's my roommate, Brian,
and my friend, Fred.

160
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:47,195
I think that room was
supposed to be Canada,

161
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:48,637
but it was kind of lame.

162
00:06:48,872 --> 00:06:50,160
Here's the number.

163
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:52,181
Let's give it a shot.

164
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:57,934
Yeah?

165
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:59,826
Hi, I'm sorry to bug you again,

166
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,564
but my friend is trying to track down...

167
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:03,941
someone who sent him a text
message from this phone.

168
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:06,098
I told him, I don't know a Chelsea.

169
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:10,225
Yeah, but 845, can you tell me
where that area code is from?

170
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:12,502
- Goshen, New York.
- Is that near Poughkeepsie?

171
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:14,465
About forty-three miles.

172
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:15,779
Is that where you are now?

173
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,121
Maybe someone borrowed your cell phone.

174
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:21,010
I didn't lend anyone my phone,
and I'm not in Goshen.

175
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,950
I go to college out in California.

176
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:24,574
Really? Where?

177
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:27,047
It's this tiny west coast
liberal arts college...

178
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:29,683
no one's ever heard of: Hearst.

179
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:31,419
Actually, I've heard of it.

180
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,126
Could you check your phone,

181
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:35,670
see if the text message
is still in your outbox?

182
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:39,256
I just got it last month. I haven't
quite learned all the features yet.

183
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,317
Mind if I come check for myself?

184
00:07:41,318 --> 00:07:42,730
How are you gonna do that?

185
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:44,037
Just tell me where you are.

186
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:45,841
I'll handle the travel arrangements.

187
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,481
It's right here, under "messages."

188
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:50,249
Just scroll down to "sent,"

189
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,000
and bingo. Here it is.

190
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:55,785
"Max, I don't know why I
haven't heard from you.

191
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:58,082
I guess I was wrong about
our night together."

192
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,091
I didn't send that.

193
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:00,790
When was the last time
you were back east?

194
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:02,056
Christmas.

195
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:03,227
Maybe you were out on the town,

196
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:05,329
a couple eggnogs to the wind,

197
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,382
some sweet, young thing
asks to borrow your-

198
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:09,327
Hot stuff, coming through.

199
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:11,738
And he's carrying a tray of muffins.

200
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:12,970
I know you.

201
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,667
- Uh...
- You're Max's roommate, aren't you?

202
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:18,706
Yeah, I'm Brian. Hey.

203
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,216
Brian. Really?

204
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:22,745
You look more like a Chelsea.

205
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,279
News? Already?

206
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:32,259
The glass-is-half-full version:

207
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,638
Chelsea's not getting married.

208
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,714
Are you serious?

209
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,924
Yeah. The half-empty version is...

210
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:39,716
she's a hooker.

211
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:47,939
Brian and Fred, as demented as this sounds,

212
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,407
thought you'd have more
confidence with girls if you...

213
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,417
lost your virginity.

214
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,715
I'm gonna go kill my friends now, so...

215
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:00,382
if you could just leave me a bill.

216
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:01,841
The impression I got,

217
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,611
they thought they were
doing a good thing.

218
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:07,585
I'm sorry, but on what planet
am I a sexual charity case?

219
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,477
Like I haven't had opportunities?

220
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:12,851
I've had opportunities,
but I have standards.

221
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,519
High standards.

222
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:19,526
Maybe... maybe...

223
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:21,814
that's why they picked her,
'cause they could tell.

224
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:24,417
They didn't interview her, Max.

225
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:26,712
They weren't matchmaking.
They coached her.

226
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:29,071
They told her you were a Battlestar fan.

227
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:31,894
They gave her the "so say we all"
t-shirt she was wearing.

228
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:35,179
That line about the Cylon raiders
looking like Batman's car;

229
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,781
they fed her that.

230
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:38,600
What about the text message?

231
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:39,927
When they saw you pining,

232
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:43,071
they wanted to find a way to put
you out of your misery without...

233
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:43,969
well...

234
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,323
crushing you.

235
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:48,695
Brian found out a guy he works
with is from upstate New York.

236
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:49,845
He swiped his phone,

237
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:53,638
sent you a message as Chelsea saying
goodbye so you'd get over her.

238
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,501
Can you still find her?

239
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:57,669
Um... yes.

240
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,208
But she'll still be a prostitute.

241
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:02,142
I'm not stupid, Veronica.

242
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,484
Okay, we had something.

243
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:05,005
I know it.

244
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,616
There's some things you can't fake.

245
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:10,927
There are some things women are
universally known for faking,

246
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:12,696
and this girl is a professional.

247
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:16,684
When I dropped her off at the airport,
she had tears in her eyes.

248
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:19,517
Are you sure she wasn't
thinking of the cab fare back?

249
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:21,498
Fine.

250
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:22,847
Think what you want.

251
00:10:22,848 --> 00:10:24,887
The job was to find her,

252
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:26,834
not tell me her occupation.

253
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:29,546
Are you gonna do it or not?

254
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:33,696
He wants you to track her down?

255
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,990
You can't do this.
You're just fuelling his fire.

256
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:37,913
He's obsessed.

257
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,429
He thinks she's the one.

258
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,343
She's the first girl to touch
where his bathing suit covers.

259
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:44,171
Of course he thinks she's the one.

260
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:45,514
Actually, she's not.

261
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:47,822
He wasn't a virgin?

262
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:50,737
We spent five hundred each on a hooker,

263
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:51,738
and he wasn't a virgin?

264
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:54,328
No, you spent five hundred
each, and he's still a virgin.

265
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:55,995
Okay,

266
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:59,607
she better have done
some crazy, like, circus act.

267
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,682
They talked and connected.

268
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:05,225
This is the worst moment of my life.

269
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:08,131
Well, he didn't say anything.

270
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:10,200
We just figured he's one
of those gentlemen guys...

271
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,765
who doesn't talk about it.

272
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:13,288
Wait,

273
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:14,686
is that why he wants you to find her,

274
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:15,920
'cause he wants to sleep with her?

275
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:16,894
No.

276
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:18,939
I mean, he probably does want
to sleep with her, but mainly,

277
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,256
he thinks they have a connection.

278
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:22,610
You definitely told him she was a hooker?

279
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:26,845
I think he needs to see it for himself.
A little brutal truth.

280
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:28,530
So, how did you find her?

281
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,483
A hooker search engine.

282
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,981
What will you boys come up with next?

283
00:11:35,982 --> 00:11:40,194
Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea.

284
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:42,197
And thar she blows.

285
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:43,439
One Chelsea.

286
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:47,376
That explains why Chelsea
was into comic books.

287
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:48,824
Chelsea's a dude.

288
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:49,985
That's not her.

289
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:51,939
They change their working
names all the time.

290
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,658
Great.

291
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:57,964
There are only 18,731
escorts listed on the site.

292
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:01,428
Much as I'd like to peruse
their pages individually...

293
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,097
Try narrowing the search by preference.

294
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:06,646
You know: hair colour, height,
bondage preferences.

295
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:08,365
You know Max's preference?

296
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:09,402
Hey, that's easy.

297
00:12:09,403 --> 00:12:11,666
Yeah, we just described
Milla Jovovich with a b-cup.

298
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,490
And found one into role-playing.

299
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:15,926
How very Weird Science.

300
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:19,195
Let's see.

301
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:25,040
It's like a Zagat Guide for hookers.

302
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,976
How did people find sex before
there was an internet?

303
00:12:27,986 --> 00:12:29,739
Whoa,

304
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,381
overall looks...

305
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:34,757
we've got everything from
"model material" to "tripple bagger."

306
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:36,325
I can only assume.

307
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:39,096
What's GFE?

308
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:40,300
Girlfriend experience.

309
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,349
She has to be an experienced girlfriend?

310
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,030
It's the type of experience
you want her to have.

311
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,665
You want it to be like
she's your girlfriend,

312
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,379
it's a GFE, girl friend experience.

313
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,253
But if you want to act like
you're in a porn, it's a PSE:

314
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:51,944
porn-star experience.

315
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:54,793
Is there a reality experience,

316
00:12:54,794 --> 00:12:57,553
where she reminds the guy she's
only there because he's paying her?

317
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,830
Okay, boys, let's find that hooker.

318
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:05,168
From 18,000 down to two.

319
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:08,707
Your attention to detail has
served us well, young Jedis.

320
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,005
So, which blurry-faced,
fatherless girl is she?

321
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:17,012
Pink bikini, maybe?

322
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,047
I don't know.

323
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,994
I think the one we picked
had a longer torso.

324
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:30,185
I come home after a hard day
at work, and there you are,

325
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,953
lounging...

326
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:34,686
with your bonbons and
your Harper's Bazaar.

327
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:37,712
There better be some freshly
pressed shirts in my closet,

328
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:39,132
or so help me.

329
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:41,712
What?

330
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:42,998
You got nothing?

331
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:45,447
Maybe I'm not in the mood.

332
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:47,489
Amuse me, damn it.
Amuse me now.

333
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,080
I finally...

334
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,250
got the police report on...

335
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:56,510
the dean's suicide.

336
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,746
That needs work.

337
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:02,602
Did the report say anything about
the dean's office getting egged?

338
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:05,710
Nope, but then again, it looks
like it was done by a tenth grader.

339
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:11,175
I swear it might as well have heavy-metal
band logos sketched in the margins.

340
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:14,034
There are these girls from Lilith House,

341
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:16,818
activists with a real grudge
against the Greeks.

342
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,920
They hated the dean.

343
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:21,709
One of them, Nish, was the
editor at the newspaper.

344
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,783
When O'Dell fired her,
she swore he'd regret it.

345
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:27,676
They went on an egging spree
the night of his suicide,

346
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:30,186
protesting him reinstating the Greeks.

347
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:31,408
Do you mind talking to them?

348
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:35,012
Yeah, I think I've dipped into
that well one too many times.

349
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:37,292
They're not big Veronica fans.

350
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,290
I think you're probably gonna
have to handle this one yourself.

351
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:43,183
If you go undercover as a student,

352
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:45,297
no Daniel Boone jacket, no peace signs.

353
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:47,103
The times, they have a-changed.

354
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:49,418
Will you be home for dinner?

355
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:53,920
No, I'm meeting two hookers
over at Logan's later.

356
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:56,602
On a school night?

357
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:58,981
Off-peak hours. Save a few bucks.

358
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:01,301
You're not really.

359
00:15:01,302 --> 00:15:02,588
Fiona and Lizette.

360
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:05,519
They're just a couple of gals putting
themselves through college.

361
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:11,014
Man, quit bringing me down
with your bourgeois hang-ups.

362
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:15,424
Hey, should we have gotten
more for the hookers?

363
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:19,730
As I understand it,
they prefer the term "escorts."

364
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,872
So, have you...

365
00:15:25,873 --> 00:15:27,564
ever been with one?

366
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:29,837
An escort?

367
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,035
Yeah.

368
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:33,180
Do we really want to go there?

369
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:35,142
I guess we don't have to now.

370
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,379
- That wasn't me answering the question.
- It kinda was.

371
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:39,344
No it wasn't.

372
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:41,010
That was me knowing there's a land mine...

373
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:42,469
and trying to figure out
where to put my foot.

374
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,694
Well, I guess you picked your spot.

375
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:47,581
Look, why not dispel any romantic notions?

376
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:49,256
If we see each other,

377
00:15:49,257 --> 00:15:51,333
warts and all, and still like each other,

378
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:52,334
that's a real connection.

379
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:56,327
Well, maybe I enjoy my romantic notions.

380
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:58,472
Maybe I don't care to see any warts,

381
00:15:58,473 --> 00:15:59,638
you know, yours or mine.

382
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,980
Now you see, you're smiling,

383
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:03,552
all right, so I think it's all fun and safe,

384
00:16:03,553 --> 00:16:06,248
but it's a slippery slope from
"Have you ever been"

385
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,063
to "How many" and "How often."

386
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:12,132
So you've been with multiple
hookers on several occasions.

387
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,046
I'm not having this conversation with you.

388
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:29,616
Logan, Max. Max, Logan.

389
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:37,951
Yeah, I-I didn't know she was
a hooker at the time that-

390
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:39,257
No one's judging, man.

391
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:42,679
As you know, we are
looking for a new home.

392
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,369
And when we leave,

393
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,880
we shall be able to retain
only Thomas and Betsy.

394
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:51,381
What, you think hookers are
known for their punctuality?

395
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:54,783
Where's your bathroom?

396
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,578
It's wrong that I'm nervous, right?

397
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,246
Hey, there.

398
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,750
I'm Lizette.

399
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:21,628
Hello.

400
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:23,011
Welcome to my place.

401
00:17:23,212 --> 00:17:24,118
Thank you.

402
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:27,611
Oh! Well, hey, there, to you, too.

403
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:29,758
I'm totally up for it, guys, but...

404
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,164
it's gonna cost you extra, right?

405
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:33,820
That's not her.

406
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:37,350
Sorry, Lizette. Looks like we're
gonna have to reschedule.

407
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:38,767
Pay the girl, Max.

408
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:40,940
- If we're paying her anyway...
- Honey?

409
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:43,874
Sorry, I was looking for someone else.

410
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:45,633
I'll live.

411
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:48,730
This is just wasteful.

412
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,307
Hey, there. I'm Fiona.

413
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:56,583
Chelsea.

414
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,762
Oh, my God.

415
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:03,287
Max, is that you?! Oh, my God!

416
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:27,540
This is nice.

417
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,988
We should hang out with your friends more.

418
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:31,279
So, Fiona, where are you from, originally?

419
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:34,869
Uh, actually,

420
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,622
this is a bit awkward, but
my name is really Wendy.

421
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:39,734
Really?

422
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:41,877
Wendy.

423
00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:42,957
I like it.

424
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:46,818
You guys need a refill...

425
00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:49,073
or a room?

426
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:50,367
We're good. Thanks.

427
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,083
Oh, sorry. I guess we're
being pretty rude. It's just...

428
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:57,405
I never thought I'd see Max again.

429
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:59,132
I bet.

430
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:02,045
God, I was such a girl when he
dropped me off at the airport,

431
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:04,565
all misty and dramatic.

432
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,287
I missed the misty?

433
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:12,047
When he was leaving, I felt this rush.

434
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:15,441
I thought about everything
that led to that moment.

435
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:19,232
Um, all the choices that I made
that got me to that exact spot,

436
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:21,209
that exact time..

437
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,810
how, if I made different ones,

438
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:29,436
I could be with this sweet guy who
was dropping me off at the airport,

439
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:31,002
all teary-eyed.

440
00:19:32,113 --> 00:19:33,913
Well, I-I mean... I wasn't teary-eyed.

441
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:38,557
I hadn't slept much, and,
you know, my eyes were...

442
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:44,976
Three to one, Dick forgot
his key card again.

443
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,419
Takers?

444
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,678
Madison.

445
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,029
Oh. It's you.

446
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,685
So, are you and Logan, like, dating again,

447
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,684
or are you hotel staff?

448
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:04,036
Did somebody order a PSE?

449
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,135
Dick's not here.

450
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:06,206
Hey, Logan.

451
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,514
Hey.

452
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:09,990
So, uh,

453
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,636
what are you kids up to tonight?

454
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:15,400
Oh, same old, same old.

455
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:18,119
Well, this looks like super fun,

456
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,882
but I should probably go do
something that doesn't suck.

457
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,891
Don't party too hard, you guys.

458
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:35,765
Friend of yours?

459
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:38,740
No, Madison is pretty much
the physical embodiment...

460
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:40,834
of all things I loathe.

461
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,869
If Dick starts dating her again,

462
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,230
you're gonna need to get
a different roommate.

463
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:58,107
Morning.

464
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:00,507
Whatcha doing?

465
00:21:01,147 --> 00:21:02,694
Just getting dressed for work.

466
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,616
Wait. You're missing something.

467
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:11,296
Now, remember,

468
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:13,410
when you rip off the breakaway pants,

469
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:15,644
thrust your pelvis toward
the bachelorette,

470
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:16,657
okay?

471
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:18,123
It's her special day.

472
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,811
- Claire Nordhouse?
- Uh...

473
00:21:27,812 --> 00:21:29,466
Mind if I ask you a few questions?

474
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:31,809
I'm sorry. What is this about?

475
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,056
Just a few questions, ma'am.
Do you mind if I come in?

476
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:35,995
You're Fern Delgado?

477
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:37,623
Yeah. What are you doing here?

478
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:41,445
Oh, just following upon some things
from the night Cyrus O'Dell died.

479
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:42,446
The dean?

480
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:43,357
Right. Dean O'Dell.

481
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:45,434
The night he died,
someone egged his office.

482
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:46,704
So that's a crime now.

483
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:47,722
Always has been.

484
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,850
So, you did it?

485
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:49,930
I didn't say that.

486
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:51,018
Okay, well, I am.

487
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,651
I'm saying you girls
egged the dean's office

488
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,856
the same night you were out
egging the Lampoon office

489
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,220
and various other campus hotspots.

490
00:21:56,221 --> 00:21:58,140
So I'd like to ask you a
few questions about it.

491
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:00,634
So What?! You think a few eggs,

492
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:02,375
and I'm not saying we threw them,

493
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:04,348
made the dean up and kill himself?

494
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:06,839
Actually, we believe the dean was murdered.

495
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:09,303
So, what I think...

496
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:11,637
is that you guys were in the
area when this happened.

497
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:14,717
You were known to carry
a grudge against the man.

498
00:22:14,718 --> 00:22:16,735
Hold on. We didn't kill anyone.

499
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:17,467
Who's "we"?

500
00:22:17,468 --> 00:22:19,161
Who else was on this little egg adventure?

501
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:20,162
It was just us.

502
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:21,580
Just the two of you. No one else?

503
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:23,391
And Nish.

504
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:24,573
No she wasn't.

505
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:26,673
Nish was not with us when
we egged the dean's office.

506
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:29,287
But she was with you when you egged
the Lampoon office and the statue.

507
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:30,650
Interesting. So, where was she?

508
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:33,798
When you were outside his office,
throwing eggs at his window,

509
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,415
where was your friend Nish?

510
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:37,526
Don't look at each other,

511
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:39,163
and don't you dare lie.

512
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:41,769
Where'd she go?

513
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:45,732
Would you rather talk at the station,
with your lawyer?

514
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:47,024
What, are you kidding?

515
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:51,092
Mr. Mars? Is this some kind of a joke?

516
00:22:51,313 --> 00:22:54,136
He's not a cop. He used to be.
He's a private eye.

517
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:56,477
Do you two ever watch the news?

518
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:57,458
Nish,

519
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,734
you were out egging buildings
the night the dean died,

520
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:02,109
but you weren't with them when
they egged the dean's office.

521
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,188
Where were you?

522
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:05,763
First of all, I don't have to say anything.

523
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:06,823
And second of all,

524
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:09,198
I'm pretty sure what you're
doing right now is illegal.

525
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,176
But I'll tell you. What the hell,
I got nothing to hide.

526
00:23:12,177 --> 00:23:14,458
I went around and egged the dean's car.

527
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:15,479
His car.

528
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,324
That Volvo that he loved so much.

529
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:19,394
He says the dean was murdered.

530
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,773
I got your text.

531
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:49,534
I take it your connection with Wendy
has found an even higher plane?

532
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,332
I want to hire you again.

533
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:52,666
Make Wendy disappear.

534
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:55,148
I guess she needs a new ID, a new name,

535
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:56,874
someone to close out her old apartment.

536
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,673
Max, you think maybe this is all too fast?

537
00:23:59,674 --> 00:24:03,802
I'll admit, I was surprised. She seemed
to be really fond of you, but-

538
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:06,437
Veronica's gonna help us.

539
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,098
Oh, my God. Thank you.

540
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:12,420
That's the thing about
being a working girl.

541
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:13,952
Easy to break into,

542
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,245
not so easy to get out of.

543
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,211
It's not like I'm one of the big earners,

544
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:19,207
but I have this client, a judge.

545
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,363
Ooh, a judge?

546
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:22,187
Which one?

547
00:24:22,188 --> 00:24:22,941
Cramer.

548
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:24,135
No freaking way!

549
00:24:24,136 --> 00:24:26,350
My dad busted him for taking bribes,

550
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:28,315
and the old bastard still got re-elected.

551
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:30,029
He is the kinkiest out of all my clients.

552
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,405
No sex,

553
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:34,148
he just likes to sneak me into
his office at the courthouse.

554
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:36,269
All he wants to do is have tickle fights

555
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,873
and walk around in my shoes.

556
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,857
Well...

557
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:47,181
you don't have to worry about him
stretching out your shoes anymore.

558
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:50,395
Whatever it costs.

559
00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:00,362
Where's Wendy?

560
00:25:05,657 --> 00:25:09,426
If you don't come back with me and with a
thousand dollars for your time last night,

561
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:12,344
Mr. Happyfists is gonna play
connect the bruises on me.

562
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,873
She's not going back.

563
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:15,605
We're getting you away from this.

564
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:19,228
Yeah, please, get her away from this
so I can get my ass kicked a little more.

565
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:21,250
Max, I have to go back.

566
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:22,897
Let me talk to your pimp,

567
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,290
explain things.
I have a head for business.

568
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:28,222
You'll end up with a head
for a hood ornament.

569
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:29,885
There's no other way, Max.

570
00:25:29,886 --> 00:25:31,343
I have to go.

571
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:33,977
It was a great night, wasn't it?

572
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:36,660
Maybe my best night ever.

573
00:25:40,392 --> 00:25:42,427
This was supposed to
be for paying you, but...

574
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:44,158
it's a thousand, right?

575
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,601
Yeah, a thousand.

576
00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:47,243
Hey, we'll figure something out, okay?

577
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:50,415
Come on, Wendy. We got to go.

578
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:58,891
Is he still out there?

579
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,598
He hasn't moved.

580
00:26:02,264 --> 00:26:03,808
That's it. I'm kicking him out.

581
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:05,806
No, let me talk to him.

582
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:20,181
You'll always have ComicCon.

583
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:26,122
For what little it's worth,
I was totally wrong.

584
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:29,309
You and Wendy do have something.
You two are great together.

585
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:31,045
And I'm sorry.

586
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:34,540
And this just plain sucks.

587
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:39,200
That was my useless speech.

588
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:42,539
I will now busy myself by
bringing you a glass of water.

589
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:50,438
Max?

590
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:54,599
So?

591
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,842
She wears makeup.

592
00:26:55,843 --> 00:26:57,402
It's purple makeup.

593
00:26:57,403 --> 00:26:59,068
The bruise was a fake.

594
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,202
You've been had. They duped you.

595
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,564
Nicki didn't get worked over by her pimp.

596
00:27:04,565 --> 00:27:06,668
She and Wendy just
conned you out of a grand.

597
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:08,767
That's crazy.

598
00:27:08,768 --> 00:27:11,793
Crazy? She screws people for money, Max.
That's what she does.

599
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:18,035
I'm sorry. That wasn't-

600
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,375
No, I'm an idiot.

601
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:21,346
You're not.

602
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,177
From where I stand,

603
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:25,587
Wendy's the idiot.

604
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:28,326
And now we must crush her.

605
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:33,718
How to make the happy
hooker not so happy.

606
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:37,995
Got it. Thanks.

607
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:42,110
Judge High Heels' home phone.

608
00:27:42,111 --> 00:27:43,494
This is a bad idea.

609
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,378
It's blackmail. It's the go-to idea.

610
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:49,006
In case of emergency,
break glass or blackmail.

611
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:50,914
Well, excuse me if I can't get jazzed

612
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:52,897
about my girlfriend extorting a judge.

613
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:56,325
Look, I'm not doing a back
handspring about it either,

614
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:58,287
but I'm getting Max his
thousand dollars back,

615
00:27:58,288 --> 00:27:59,807
and I'm taking away Wendy's best client.

616
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,623
It works on so many levels.

617
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:02,683
You don't have to do this.

618
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:04,177
I'll use your cell phone.

619
00:28:04,178 --> 00:28:06,166
They won't be able to trace
the call back to me.

620
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,049
Judge Cramer.

621
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,810
You don't know me,
but I know a lot about you.

622
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,659
No, really I do. I know you're a judge.

623
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,467
I know you have a weekly date
with a hooker at the courthouse,

624
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:32,971
and that you have a proclivity
for high heels and tickling.

625
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:36,085
All I need is a thousand
dollars to keep quiet.

626
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,479
Get a locker at the Neptune bus station.

627
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,022
Leave the money.

628
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:43,069
Call me with the locker number and
passcode. You have twenty-four hours.

629
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,409
Well, I guess I should get
out of your guys' hair,

630
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,715
go mope around my dorm.

631
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:53,326
Thank you.

632
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,017
I can't believe I had to blackmail a judge
just to get some alone time with you.

633
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:05,350
You really don't have to work that hard.

634
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:07,087
Sure, I do.

635
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:13,639
["A Thousand Kisses Deep" - Leonard Cohen]

636
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,028
You know, if I were a hooker,

637
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:16,851
this snuggle would cost you.

638
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:20,170
I'll gladly pay.

639
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:21,933
Really?

640
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:25,298
For this? Cash money.

641
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:27,477
But seriously, folks...

642
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,365
have you?

643
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,961
What? Ever been with a hooker?

644
00:29:35,248 --> 00:29:36,817
Why does it matter?

645
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:38,293
I just want to know.

646
00:29:38,294 --> 00:29:40,493
I assume the answer is yes.

647
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:44,778
Look at it as an opportunity for me
to show you how cool I can be.

648
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:46,879
Hooker? Who cares?

649
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:49,309
Well, here's your chance to be cool.

650
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:51,451
Stop asking.

651
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:53,435
I just...

652
00:29:53,436 --> 00:29:57,282
want to get to a place with
you where we can be really...

653
00:29:58,658 --> 00:29:59,629
intimate.

654
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,622
That's what the female praying mantis
says before she bites the male's head off.

655
00:30:03,623 --> 00:30:05,021
I'm just saying,

656
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:08,977
buried secrets tend to
surface when I'm around.

657
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:11,398
Maybe that's because
of all the digging, huh?

658
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,123
I'm giving you the chance
right now to come clean.

659
00:30:16,124 --> 00:30:18,039
You tell all. I tell all.

660
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,527
Go from there.

661
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,240
Fine.

662
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:23,448
Ask away. Ask...

663
00:30:24,094 --> 00:30:25,657
anything you want.

664
00:30:26,937 --> 00:30:28,809
Have you ever been with a hooker?

665
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:30,739
No.

666
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,396
You want to ask me anything?

667
00:30:38,397 --> 00:30:39,867
Have you ever been with a hooker?

668
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:41,468
- No.
- No.

669
00:30:43,531 --> 00:30:46,689
- The night you were in Mexico with Mercer-
- Are you kidding me?

670
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,192
How was he able to get back to Neptune,

671
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:51,052
commit a rape,

672
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:53,940
and return to Mexico without you knowing?

673
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,662
Uh... I must have passed out.

674
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,728
I don't know, it felt like a couple minutes,
but it could have been hours.

675
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,591
Although, maybe he
drugged me or something.

676
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:17,095
Your question.

677
00:31:17,096 --> 00:31:18,436
You can have my turn.

678
00:31:20,427 --> 00:31:23,105
Were you with anyone
while we were broken up?

679
00:31:23,106 --> 00:31:24,703
Land mine.

680
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,635
I fooled around with this horrible girl...

681
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:32,287
who meant less than nothing to me,

682
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:34,207
and I couldn't regret it more.

683
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,612
Thinking of it makes me ill.

684
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:41,637
So, there. Presto. Intimacy.

685
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:48,615
Still love me?

686
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:55,103
Yes.

687
00:31:55,104 --> 00:31:57,373
# Confined to sex, we pressed against

688
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,790
# The limits of the sea

689
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:08,315
Hello.

690
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:09,577
Judge Cramer called.

691
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:10,773
He dropped off the money.

692
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:12,562
Feel like coming with me to pick it up?

693
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:16,176
The pickup is the best part.
I'll meet you in twenty minutes.

694
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:28,780
GO OUTSIDE. GET IN THE LIMO. OR
WENDY GETS HUTR.

695
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:52,938
Get in.

696
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:04,387
Okay, look,

697
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:06,962
maybe calling the judge
wasn't a great idea,

698
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:09,429
but one of your girls ripped off my friend,

699
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,110
and we were just trying
to get his money back.

700
00:33:11,111 --> 00:33:12,061
So...

701
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:14,939
could you let us out of the car now?

702
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,345
Lesson learned.

703
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:19,053
Not me. Her.

704
00:33:20,854 --> 00:33:22,615
- Her?
- Me.

705
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:26,408
I'm the one who gets called when one
of my girls does something dumb.

706
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:28,143
You mean you're the-

707
00:33:28,144 --> 00:33:29,396
I'm Wendy's agent.

708
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:33,361
I don't think this is street legal.

709
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:34,693
What's the voltage on this?

710
00:33:34,694 --> 00:33:35,914
Put it down, Happy.

711
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:39,131
Wait, there really is a Mr. Happyfists?

712
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:41,312
I thought that was just
colourful language.

713
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:44,612
Look, Wendy didn't do
anything dumb, okay?

714
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:46,389
I did. I called the judge.

715
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,587
I don't think you did.

716
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:50,099
He said it was a girl's voice.

717
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:53,290
And Wendy has done a
bunch of dumb things.

718
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:56,740
She fell for a client.

719
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:59,289
She tried to leave me
without saying goodbye.

720
00:33:59,858 --> 00:34:01,837
She told a client about the judge.

721
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:04,628
I'm sorry. Did you say
she fell for a client?

722
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:05,784
She asked out.

723
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:07,690
But there's a problem, you see.

724
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:09,186
Wendy owes me money.

725
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:11,573
Braces aren't cheap.

726
00:34:11,574 --> 00:34:13,582
Tattoo removal isn't cheap.

727
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,723
Clothes and housing aren't cheap.

728
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,109
- Now, she could work it off-
- I'll pay.

729
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:22,434
You're a hell of a negotiator, Max.

730
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,118
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

731
00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:29,874
Ten grand,

732
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:33,305
and a promise that you never talk to
another one of my clients again.

733
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:35,001
And next time,

734
00:34:35,002 --> 00:34:37,433
I won't go the makeup
route with the bruises.

735
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,647
They're gonna be the real thing.

736
00:34:40,223 --> 00:34:42,093
Max, think about this.

737
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:44,268
Fine. Ten grand.

738
00:34:45,065 --> 00:34:46,885
You want to run me by my bank?

739
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,698
You just handed over a
hundred hundred dollar bills.

740
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:52,601
Yeah, I was there.

741
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:54,334
And what guarantee do you have that-

742
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:12,387
That boy is smitten.

743
00:35:12,388 --> 00:35:13,565
Yeah, isn't he great?

744
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:15,046
Yeah, pretty great.

745
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:19,726
So, what is the secret to making
a guy fall for you like that?

746
00:35:19,727 --> 00:35:21,013
Dumb luck...

747
00:35:21,014 --> 00:35:22,942
and interesting lingerie.

748
00:35:22,943 --> 00:35:25,473
Never underestimate the power of lingerie.

749
00:35:25,474 --> 00:35:26,338
Yo, Veronica.

750
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:28,528
I'm sorry. I got to tell
somebody about this.

751
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:30,651
You're never gonna guess what
somebody tried to flush down...

752
00:35:30,652 --> 00:35:33,016
the commode in the faculty lounge.

753
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,523
Hey, I-I know you.

754
00:35:34,524 --> 00:35:35,678
Weevil, this is Wendy.

755
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,067
Fiona, right?

756
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,159
You used to dance at the Electric Lady.

757
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,743
My buddy was a bouncer up there.

758
00:35:40,744 --> 00:35:42,759
You must be thinking of someone else.

759
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,384
No, I don't think so.

760
00:35:44,385 --> 00:35:45,353
You have a tattoo,

761
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:47,596
red dragon, left cheek. Am I right?

762
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:50,155
Weevil, you got the wrong girl.

763
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:56,589
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

764
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,188
I'm sorry about that.

765
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,148
See you around, V.

766
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,332
Man, you just love that report.

767
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:16,725
Your buddy Nish said specifically
that she egged the dean's Volvo,

768
00:36:16,726 --> 00:36:19,203
but according to the report,
the dean was driving the minivan.

769
00:36:19,204 --> 00:36:21,525
That's the car they
found in the parking lot.

770
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:22,846
So, Nish is lying?

771
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,317
Or maybe the dean's
Volvo was also there.

772
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:26,934
That's the car Mindy
was driving that night.

773
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,027
Maybe she paid a
visit to her husband.

774
00:36:29,028 --> 00:36:31,077
Why wouldn't she mention that to you?

775
00:36:31,078 --> 00:36:32,942
That's exactly what I'm wondering.

776
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,740
["Wheels" - Mark Lanegan]

777
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,027
Are you okay?

778
00:36:50,098 --> 00:36:52,132
Yeah. Why?

779
00:36:52,717 --> 00:36:55,312
You've just been quiet. That's all.

780
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,938
It's just-it's just, I have to
have this read by Tuesday.

781
00:36:58,604 --> 00:37:00,500
Yeah, that's fine.

782
00:37:04,365 --> 00:37:07,016
There was a dragon on your purse

783
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,469
the first time we met.

784
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:12,564
I guess you're a fan of dragons.

785
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:15,622
Yeah. I like dragons.

786
00:37:15,623 --> 00:37:16,885
# Here I am

787
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:23,232
# Just runnin' round catchin' 'em

788
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:25,071
Uh, Stewpot warning.
He's sniffing around.

789
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:26,052
Thanks.

790
00:37:26,053 --> 00:37:27,314
Who's Stewpot?

791
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:28,819
Stewart Potter, our RA.

792
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,328
I think he saw you with the bags.
He can be a pain.

793
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:34,372
Thanks for letting me hang out.
It will just be a couple days.

794
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:36,656
I just need to find a place, get a job.

795
00:37:37,223 --> 00:37:39,939
I might actually know of a job.

796
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,831
Really?

797
00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:43,325
Yeah, that's what we
came to see you about.

798
00:37:43,326 --> 00:37:45,570
My older brother is getting
married next Saturday,

799
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:49,213
and the guy organising his bachelor
party has this really uptight wife,

800
00:37:49,214 --> 00:37:50,935
so they didn't book a stripper.

801
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,582
We're scrambling to get someone.

802
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:55,467
Um, it should be a good gig.
They're all, like, lawyers.

803
00:37:55,468 --> 00:37:57,705
Hey, dudes! That's my
girl you're talking to.

804
00:37:57,706 --> 00:37:59,471
And I'm retired, actually.

805
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:02,546
Of course. Of course. I'm sorry.

806
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,019
I didn't know what the story was.

807
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,448
It's cool. We can find somebody else.

808
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:10,394
# My little love smiles on a wing

809
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:16,292
# For all a raindrop and
tears not wasted there

810
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,028
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

811
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:22,845
Probably. But go ahead.

812
00:38:23,286 --> 00:38:25,523
When I dropped you off at the airport

813
00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:28,866
and you said you left all your
information back at the hotel?

814
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:33,000
I got back...

815
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:34,860
and the room was clean. So...

816
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:37,876
I guess my question is...

817
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:41,989
uh, did-did you really leave it for me?

818
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:45,052
Was it really there?

819
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:51,080
No.

820
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:56,122
But I really wish I left it.

821
00:39:01,893 --> 00:39:04,078
I think I'm gonna take a walk.

822
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,384
I haven't paid you yet.

823
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:17,047
I don't want you to come collecting.

824
00:39:17,048 --> 00:39:19,056
If it isn't the Man of La Mancha.

825
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,416
How's tricks?

826
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:22,266
Sorry.

827
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:25,188
I mean things. How are things?

828
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:26,862
Things?

829
00:39:26,863 --> 00:39:28,295
They suck.

830
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,138
Wendy left.

831
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:33,344
The upside?
I actually got a note this time.

832
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:35,938
She said it wasn't gonna work out.

833
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:38,735
You bought her out of prostitution,
and she left you?

834
00:39:38,736 --> 00:39:41,287
Please tell me you don't
want me to find her again.

835
00:39:41,288 --> 00:39:43,578
No, no. I think she may be right.

836
00:39:44,678 --> 00:39:46,519
She said, uh...

837
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,654
What'd she say? She said, uh...

838
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,947
"the-the day we met was one
of the best days of my life.

839
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,906
I-I fell for you that day,

840
00:39:57,907 --> 00:39:59,718
but you didn't know what I was then,

841
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,879
and now you do,

842
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,201
and it shows in the way you look at me.

843
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,012
It shows in the way you touch me,

844
00:40:06,013 --> 00:40:08,262
but I'll never regret it.

845
00:40:08,463 --> 00:40:11,153
You made me realise what I was missing.

846
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:12,603
Love, Wendy."

847
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:17,720
Ten thousand is a lot
to pay for a life lesson.

848
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:20,046
She's gonna pay me back
as soon as she can, Veronica.

849
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:22,821
Max, please don't get your hopes up.

850
00:40:24,385 --> 00:40:26,169
She already paid me a thousand.

851
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,764
She made some good money last night.

852
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:33,321
I hope you don't mind getting your
money in vertically folded singles.

853
00:40:36,113 --> 00:40:38,775
Oh, Max.

854
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,061
I heard it from a pro.

855
00:40:46,062 --> 00:40:47,313
Lingerie.

856
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:50,861
Maybe I should get into the spirit of
doing things normal girlfriends do.

857
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:53,435
I should make more of an
effort to please my man.

858
00:40:53,436 --> 00:40:55,720
First comes sexy underthings.

859
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:59,594
Do you have the thigh-highs
with the seams up the back?

860
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:01,087
I think I saw some

861
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:03,747
between the pasties and
the edible underwear.

862
00:41:03,748 --> 00:41:05,293
You know,

863
00:41:05,294 --> 00:41:07,840
it's kind of smart of you to
raid the sale rack like that.

864
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:10,975
It's almost a waste for me
to spend all this money

865
00:41:10,976 --> 00:41:13,043
on something that will be
ripped right off of me.

866
00:41:13,044 --> 00:41:14,820
If you're trying to get Dick back,

867
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:16,662
I don't think you have to work that hard.

868
00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:17,492
Seriously,

869
00:41:17,493 --> 00:41:19,996
a hefty bag and some duct tape,

870
00:41:19,997 --> 00:41:20,972
and he'd be good to go.

871
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:22,816
Dick? Please.

872
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:25,483
You came over. I figured...

873
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:28,697
Oh, Logan and I hooked up in
Aspen over the holidays.

874
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,257
I guess you two were split, huh?

875
00:41:31,996 --> 00:41:34,555
I was in town and thought
he might have some free time,

876
00:41:34,556 --> 00:41:36,397
but, oh, well.

877
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:39,500
Oh, and, as a friend,

878
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:42,561
he's not so big on
the one-piece numbers.
