1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,616
<i>Previously on Veronica Mars</i>

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,874
There is going to be an article
in the school newspaper.

3
00:00:05,946 --> 00:00:08,329
You need to get rid of the
marijuana before it comes out.

4
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:11,594
Karen has cancer. This botany
professor gave her some seeds.

5
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:14,362
She won't just lose her job over this.
She'll lose her insurance.

6
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:17,316
- Please don't say anything.
- Well done, sister.

7
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:21,685
How many women like me have to be raped

8
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,244
before this administration
listens to our demands?

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,317
Your room key?
What if I drop in unexpectedly?

10
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:30,003
There's no one else.
You ought to know that by now.

11
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:33,271
Is it too tough, beats the marker?

12
00:00:33,387 --> 00:00:36,493
Instead of skipping meetings,
why don't you just quit?

13
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:38,922
Focus on your philosophy full-time.

14
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:41,732
You read your Plato,
drink your espresso,

15
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:43,630
eat all the cheese you want.

16
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:45,003
Football...

17
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:48,933
The systematic violation of the
Geneva convention made into a sport.

18
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:52,582
I'm surprised the ASPCA
doesn't protest.

19
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:54,773
Like these ladies.

20
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:57,631
"We go to Hearst. Go ahead and rape us"

21
00:00:58,088 --> 00:00:59,040
Oh, boy.

22
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,462
Nudity.

23
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,312
If you have words written
on yourself, it's not nudity.

24
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:08,221
It's political speech,
taking control of one's body

25
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:11,153
to turn the objectifying male
gaze back on itself.

26
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:13,183
Okay, no more college for you.

27
00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:19,973
So, Logan, see you at the party?

28
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:21,381
Absolutely.

29
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:23,031
Bring your friend if you want.

30
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:25,332
New friends?

31
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:27,132
Yeah, from weight-lifting class.

32
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:29,461
Right, the only class you never miss.

33
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,613
So, what, you guys, like,

34
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,523
spot each other doing squat
thrusts and stuff?

35
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:36,270
And have group sex in the showers.

36
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,200
What is this, jealous?

37
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:40,991
Oh, jealous would involve piano wire.

38
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:43,563
Oh. So what was that?

39
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:46,910
That was mild annoyance at the fact

40
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:48,892
that two gym buddies
invite you to a party,

41
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,232
and you're there already.

42
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:52,543
But whenever I want to do
something interesting, you're busy.

43
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:56,061
You mean interesting like some fossil
wheezing through a novel?

44
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:59,743
First, Martin Amis isn't a fossil,
and, second, yes, it's college.

45
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:03,240
we're supposed to expand our horizons
past video games and binge drinking.

46
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:05,852
- My horizons go slightly beyond that.
- Great.

47
00:02:05,937 --> 00:02:09,083
So how about tonight we check out
the art-major group show?

48
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:10,381
I'm busy?

49
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:12,560
No, really, I have a class till 10:00.

50
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,882
But you come by afterwards,
we could write on ourselves,

51
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:18,180
get real... political.

52
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:20,700
That's what a girl likes to hear.

53
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:25,653
"Darling, do all the weird crap you like.
Just don't be late for the booty call".

54
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:27,233
Really, how do you think that sounds?

55
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:28,651
I think it sounds romantic.

56
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:31,041
You also think weight lifting
is an actual class.

57
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:33,800
Bye. I've got errands.

58
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,431
What are you doing?

59
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:57,692
The guy in the S.U.V.
looks like he digs magic,

60
00:02:57,796 --> 00:02:59,410
so I'm getting my doves.

61
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,563
I'm leaving. What do you think?

62
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:03,492
My shift ended half an hour ago, man.

63
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:04,813
Not till Ray-Ray gets here.

64
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:06,063
Screw you. I've been washing these...

65
00:03:06,107 --> 00:03:08,441
Hey! No lip.

66
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:10,670
Work or it's back to Chino.

67
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:12,383
Hey, hey, hey!

68
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:14,343
I hit my boss once.

69
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:18,793
It wasn't quite worth the extra year.
All right?

70
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:25,312
I guess I'll go wash some spoiled bitch's
graduation gift from daddy, huh?

71
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:28,902
I'm not spoiled, and...

72
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,053
technically, it wasn't for graduation.

73
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:33,670
What about the bitch part?

74
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:35,791
That depends on who you ask.

75
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:40,511
How are you, Weevil?
I haven't seen you.

76
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,990
Since that awkward
arrested-for-murder incident?

77
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:44,262
Yeah, I remember.

78
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:46,323
You plea bargained down to assault?

79
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:48,203
And  now I'm working at the car wash,

80
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:51,272
which, as it turns out, is not
as fun as the song might sound.

81
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,483
Shoot.

82
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,212
Hello?

83
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:58,462
Sure. Okay.

84
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:04,652
And I'm being called in to see
the dean of Hearst college.

85
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:06,783
The leopard didn't
change her spots, I see.

86
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:09,173
- I wonder if Hearst knows about your...
- Hey!

87
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:11,491
You think I'm paying you
to harass the ladies?

88
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:14,880
Screw off again,
and you're out on your ass, cholo.

89
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:16,473
- You got me?
- Weevil, don't.

90
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:21,411
I got you. Now, what should I do
with you, huh?

91
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:25,521
You should let me go so
I can call your parole officer.

92
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,683
I didn't change my spots, either.

93
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:32,501
Nice seeing you, "V".

94
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:36,393
No, no, no, look.

95
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:37,982
I don't want to be one of those

96
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:41,530
mumbly college-radio
emo-rocker guys who just...

97
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:44,112
who all they want to do is play
their band's demo, you know,

98
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:48,272
though I should mention
that my band really is quite good.

99
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,331
We're called Black Licorice,
which is really cool

100
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:53,353
'cause it's dark and moody
but, at the same time, it's candy.

101
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:55,382
So, you're pitching what, exactly?

102
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,401
A call-in show... Political affairs,
cultural affairs,

103
00:04:58,446 --> 00:04:59,712
whatever affairs.

104
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,900
Witty, smart, a little crazy.

105
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:03,961
It's like Jon Stewart meets "Crossfire"

106
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,932
if Jon Stewart
didn't hate "Crossfire".

107
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,502
Hey, Trish, sorry, uh,

108
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:10,623
but you didn't see a three-ring
binder in my room this morning?

109
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:11,773
No, what's wrong?

110
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:15,073
No, it's nothing. I'm just dead.

111
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:19,990
Dean O'Dell?

112
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:23,390
They said you wanted to see me.

113
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:26,042
We can download pictures

114
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,071
from the surface of the moons
of Jupiter onto portable phones,

115
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,942
but we can't keep the
air-conditioning in this office

116
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:31,602
running for more than a week at a time.

117
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:34,792
Is there some clue about the human
predicament buried in that fact?

118
00:05:35,555 --> 00:05:36,743
I'm a freshman.

119
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:39,761
I only recently figured out
where Waldo was.

120
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:40,921
Please sit.

121
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,240
Ah!

122
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,200
Your kids?

123
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:50,233
My wife, my son from
a previous marriage,

124
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:51,750
and my stepson.

125
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:55,660
Mrs. O'Dell was my grad student

126
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:57,582
back when you could
do things like that.

127
00:05:58,178 --> 00:06:02,062
So,  miss Mars, it's rare
when a freshman

128
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,900
makes quite as big a splash
here as quickly as you have.

129
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:05,961
Well done.

130
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:07,941
I'm talking about
the Free Press article,

131
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,620
the  sorority exposé...
Sharp piece of writing.

132
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:13,592
Thanks. Actually,
the editor took some liberties.

133
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:14,760
You wrote that a source told you

134
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,823
that the house mother got her pot seeds

135
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:18,660
from a staff member here.

136
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,752
I want to know who said it
and who that staffer was.

137
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:24,592
Actually, dean O'Dell,
I think that's covered under...

138
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:27,091
Protection of sources... yes
a fine thing for the New York Times,

139
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:29,512
but I want that name,
so you can tell me

140
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,951
or I'll have you expelled
from Hearst college.

141
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:38,171

142
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:41,222

143
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:44,832

00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:48,221

00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:50,743

151
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:09,882
I wouldn't give dean O'Dell
the name of my source.

152
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,123
He gave me a week to change my mind.

153
00:07:13,186 --> 00:07:15,690
Piz, what are you doing here?

154
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:18,102
Hey, Veronica. Wallace told me you
worked at the information desk.

155
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:21,800
You need some information?
Okay, slugs have four noses.

156
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:23,462
That's what I'm offering today.

157
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,171
I actually need more like a favor.

158
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:27,583
My future mentor in radio...
Knock on wood...

159
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:31,230
Has a boyfriend with a problem,
and I'm trying to impress her.

160
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:34,581
Our football playbooks aren't supposed
to leave the athletic complex,

161
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:37,012
but I missed a few meetings
for a lecture.

162
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:40,323
I needed to catch up,
so I had it in my bag.

163
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:43,080
We turn in each week's game plans
and new plays on mondays.

164
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:46,241
If I don't have it, they're gonna use it
as an excuse to yank my scholarship.

165
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:49,550
So, staying on the team is worth $500,

166
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:50,801
which is my fee.

167
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:53,090
That's what you charged me.
You said it was your friends rate.

168
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:55,191
It was my friends-of-friends rate,

169
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,141
which I've now extended
to friends of friends of friends.

170
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:02,603
Fine. I mean, I can't go to the cops.
It would just be admitting I lost it

171
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:05,103
Or, worse, it was stolen.

172
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:07,363
Stolen, like, by another team?

173
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:09,152
Or by someone who wants
him off the team.

174
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,942
She's talking about my position coach.

175
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:14,172
I was a big deal, started
here as a freshman,

176
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,392
but then I tore my ACL
end of last season,

177
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:18,101
and now I don't see much playing time.

178
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:21,371
As far as coach is concerned,
I'm just a waste of a scholarship.

179
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:22,711
So, tell me about that night,

180
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,433
every place you could have lost it,

181
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:25,783
every person who could have taken it.

182
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:27,653
It was in my bag the whole time.

183
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:30,503
I didn't have time to study it.
I never unzipped it until today.

184
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,491
- This bag?
- Yeah.

185
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:34,162
I had it all night.

186
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:37,762
I met Trish, and we went to the
art show at the student union.

187
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:42,560
My friend Larry had
a few masterpieces on display.

188
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:46,041
Then I went back to my room,
and my buddy Pop...

189
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:49,491
Brian Popovich... Stopped by
to play "Guitar Hero".

190
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:50,981
Dude, that game rocks.

191
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,391
Yeah, it does.

192
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:59,892
Pop's my best friend from the team.

193
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:02,442
I was there the rest of the night.

194
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:04,000
The only other people I saw were...

195
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,050
these cheerleaders who dropped by.

196
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,630
They brought popcorn for pop.

197
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:10,922
Cheerleaders are clever that way.

198
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:13,211
I have no idea where it went, but

199
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,743
if I lose that scholarship...

200
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:17,012
Kurt, we'll figure out another way.

201
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:18,881
I got the whole Pell Grant
thing worked out,

202
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:20,262
and your grades are great.

203
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:22,101
Maybe I don't want to get thrown
off the team, you know?

204
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,492
Love of the game and all that.

205
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:24,861
I need that book.

206
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:27,513
Or a reasonable facsimile thereof?

207
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:31,831
Maybe it's easier to just get a
new playbook for you to turn in.

208
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:39,921
Veronica  Mars, modern
college girl on the go.

209
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:43,682
Dick Casablancas, neolithic
college boy on the sauce.

210
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:44,691
Okay.

211
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:47,541
Not sure what neolithic is,
but, hey, I'm in college.

212
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:49,410
Maybe someone will teach me.

213
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:51,393
Actually, don't you have class now?

214
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:53,383
Intro econ with Logan, right?

215
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:55,072
- It was a walk.
- What?

216
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:57,062
If the prof doesn't show
within five minutes,

217
00:09:57,115 --> 00:09:58,250
you're free to leave.

218
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:00,492
It's a college rule. Look it up.

219
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:02,233
No messages. Where's Logan?

220
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:04,942
Nailing other chicks.

221
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:11,341
Wow.

222
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:13,461
You look busy.

223
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:17,802
Probably tough with me around less.

224
00:10:18,138 --> 00:10:19,782
All that stuff piling up?

225
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,280
Somewhat, yes.

226
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:24,503
I bet you'd be pretty psyched
if I found someone who could help.

227
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:28,401
The level of psyched would
depend on the someone.

228
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,473
Eli Navarro. Remember?

229
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:33,953
You mean Weevil? Veronica, please.

230
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:34,950
Dad, I'm serious.

231
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,820
I don't know...
All those times I arrested him,

232
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:39,601
he never struck me as
great secretary material.

233
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,630
Didn't he get busted for murder?

234
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:42,711
Assault.

235
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,792
See, so he's not even
a very good murderer.

236
00:10:45,806 --> 00:10:46,872
No way, Veronica.

237
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,213
You know how parole works.

238
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:51,101
If he's not employed by his
next meeting, he goes back to jail.

239
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:52,481
I'm not running a charity, honey.

240
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:54,073
Don't make me do the stare.

241
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,093
Hello?

242
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:08,150
Yeah, that's us.

243
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:10,301
Hold on.

244
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:12,343
Hey, are you here?

245
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:13,303
Who is it?

246
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:14,861
Who's this?

247
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:18,302
Margaret Federbush?

248
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:21,013
Marguerite Federbush.

249
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,422
Just take a message.

250
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,193
I got to take a message.

251
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:25,321
All right.

252
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,340
She'll call back.

253
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,022
A shoe warehouse out east of grange...

254
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,182
Stock's been disappearing.

255
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:39,303
Manager thinks that
one of the security guys

256
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:40,752
might be embezzling.

257
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:42,250
Delivery's coming in this afternoon,

258
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:43,733
so you're gonna stake
the place out tonight.

259
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:45,160
You familiar with these things?

260
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:47,033
Yeah, toasters, right?

261
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:49,631
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

262
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:52,251
So the money shot
we want is a security guy

263
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:55,303
loading shoes in the middle
of the night. You got it?

264
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:56,702
I got it.

265
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:01,073
It turns out getting a new playbook

266
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:03,331
isn't as simple
as running off a new copy.

267
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:04,520
According to Kurt,

268
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:07,012
they're printed out
on athletic department stationery

269
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:08,533
with an I.D. number that changes

270
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,653
from week to week and player to player.

271
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:13,381
They said you guys had a trainer?

272
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:17,012
Allison Shivan totally thrashed
my ankle, the little bitch.

273
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:18,171
That  way.

274
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:07,773
World's slowest printer.

275
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:11,723
Thanks for meeting with me, coach.

276
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:15,582
Not a problem.

277
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:18,691
What's on your mind?

278
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:21,783
I just wanted to let you know
that Sonoma made me an offer.

279
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:25,223
I mean you know I love it here,
but they're giving me a full ride.

280
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:27,370
Wait a minute.
We can work something out.

281
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:29,692
You know, I'll make room
for you to stay, pop.

282
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:35,202
What is that?
What's printing?

283
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:38,790
Oh, my god!

284
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:40,890
What in god's name?

285
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:45,282
Oh, I am so, just, um...

286
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:50,693
Uh, I am so... embarrassed.

287
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:52,870
It's a hazing thing,

288
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:55,970
and my sorority said I had
to break in and steal a jock...

289
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:59,593
The little underwear, not, like,
kidnap an athlete. God.

290
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:04,222
Um, so do you think maybe I could
borrow one for an hour or two?

291
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,760
Collecting jocks, are we?

292
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:14,541
You're gonna have the most colorful
disciplinary file in the freshman class.

293
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:16,480
How about you give me that name,

294
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:18,330
and we'll start over
with a clean slate?

295
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:20,411
I said I'm not giving up the name.

296
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:21,922
And I said I'll have you expelled.

297
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:24,311
And I said I'm not giving up the name.

298
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,881
Is this how this works?

299
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:27,303
Dean O'Dell, I am sorry,

300
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:29,560
but I can't just sit out there
any longer without speaking up.

301
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,991
Actually we were just finishing up.

302
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,360
It's insulting.
You call us for a meeting,

303
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,871
and you strand us there
with those lampoon jackasses?

304
00:14:35,946 --> 00:14:37,921
- Did somebody say my name?
- Oh, great.

305
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:41,262
Nice office. It's good to be the dean.

306
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,031
Or did you call us in here
because you changed your mind,

307
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:44,871
and you will stop these idiots

308
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:47,492
from publishing their misogynistic rag?

309
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,601
Idiots? Where? Wait, us?

310
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:51,172
Stop publishing? Why?

311
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:52,620
Because it's offensive to women.

312
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:54,532
I'm sorry, did someone say "rag"?

313
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:57,171
I should really go.

314
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:58,840
You have two days, miss Mars.

315
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:02,001
Hey, you're a woman.
Does this upset you?

316
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,680
No, thanks, except maybe
the blonde in the middle.

317
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:09,021
A little, I guess.

318
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:10,813
The one in the middle. That's Claire.

319
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:13,652
Claire, they want to rape you.
That's hate speech.

320
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:17,702
I meant more it says it's a humor
magazine, but I'm not seeing it.

321
00:15:17,757 --> 00:15:20,791
Whether the lampoon's content
qualifies as humor is debatable.

322
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:22,722
Hearst's free-speech policy isn't.

323
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:26,563
That discussion was over yesterday.
Today we are discussing this.

324
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:30,110
My wife and I went out last night,
came back to our Volvo.

325
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:33,143
That was what the mechanic
hypothesized was a bat of some sort.

326
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:34,801
$4,000 in damage.

327
00:15:34,878 --> 00:15:37,040
- We didn't do that.
- I agree. It's impossible.

328
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:39,813
Where would militant feminists
get ahold of a softball bat?

329
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:41,203
Very funny, pig.

330
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:42,973
Funny you should use that word.

331
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,562
No, they framed us.

332
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:48,161
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever seen.

333
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:50,200
We're an easy target, dean.

334
00:16:01,385 --> 00:16:02,412
Hey.

335
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:05,861
So what am I on a scale of 1 to 10?

336
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:07,430
Um... 1.

337
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,933
7. 4?

338
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:11,440
Help me with some criteria.

339
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:13,012
Gentlemanliness.

340
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:14,891
I kind of resisted the impulse

341
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:17,392
to make the so-called booty call last night.

342
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:19,683
What?

343
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:21,162
Just the other day, my dad was saying

344
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:24,750
I had a thing for trying to reform
unreformable bad boys.

345
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:26,482
What does that have to do with me?

346
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:28,140
I'm reformable, good, and a man.

347
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,332
Dick said the class was a walk.

348
00:16:30,476 --> 00:16:32,221
You could have gone to the art thing.

349
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:34,802
Wait, Dick said what?

350
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:36,231
It was a walk...

351
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:38,800
You know, the five-minute rule
if the professor doesn't show.

352
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:40,631
Dick's idea of five minutes is, like, one.

353
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:44,613
Ask Madison Sinclair. The professor showed.

354
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:46,911
You mind showing me the notes?

355
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,591
Forget it.

356
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,321
You're hardly the first girl
to be led astray by Dick.

357
00:16:51,406 --> 00:16:53,153
Hey, so you up for something tonight?

358
00:16:53,218 --> 00:16:56,483
Maybe Noam Chomsky's reading
the Havana phone book somewhere.

359
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:01,262
I'm stuck at work tonight.
Maybe you could drop by.

360
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:03,930
So a booty call in the library.

361
00:17:04,017 --> 00:17:05,510
Maybe I just will.

362
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,661
Hey, have you seen Mac?

363
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:20,472
She and parker just left
wearing workout stuff.

364
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,880
Maybe they're going to the stairmaster.

365
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:27,921
Hey, looking for me?

366
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:29,842
Am now.

367
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:33,013
So thanks to the stone-age printer

368
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:34,363
In the coach's office,

369
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:37,702
It doesn't look like stealing
new pages is a viable plan.

370
00:17:38,146 --> 00:17:41,893
However, there might be something
to your theory on that coach, beacause

371
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:44,380
while I was snooping around
the locker room,

372
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:46,712
I ran into him, and...

373
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:48,911
What's that?

374
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:52,213
I don't remember leaving you
a really bad painting.

375
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,382
It's Larry.

376
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:57,382
Art show Larry?

377
00:17:57,436 --> 00:17:58,820
Well, I told you we went out last year.

378
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:00,982
Yeah, but you didn't tell me
he was stalking you.

379
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:02,861
I really thought he'd moved on.

380
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:08,332
"Seriously, drop that meathead.
You know you're still my muse".

381
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:11,280
Meathead? I thought he liked me.

382
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,600
He more hates you.

383
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,901
Enough to steal his playbook?

384
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,463
You had it at the art show, right?

385
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:25,413
I just don't think it's the guard, man.

386
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:28,690
He don't feel like a thief.

387
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,363
Look, he reads comics.

388
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,532
He drives a V.W. Bug.

389
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,682
No, this is our guy.

390
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:37,531
Eli, that's the owner.

391
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,541
Not him, the truck. The driver.

392
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:45,841
I  read the file. The guy's been there
for years with a spotless record.

393
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:47,590
- Why would he...
- Steal shoes?

394
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:51,313
He picked up a habit, a nasty one.

395
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:52,433
Check him out.

396
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,752
Scrawny guy, sniffles a lot,
always eating candy...

397
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:57,622
Heroin.

398
00:18:58,447 --> 00:18:59,752
And, here, check this out.

399
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:01,860
He's off-loading the truck.

400
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:04,081
Yeah, but... but check the difference.

401
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,093
Here he's straining, right?

402
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,021
Then here it's no problem.

403
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:10,440
- It's easygoing, like...
- Like it's light.

404
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:11,760
Empty.

405
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,880
Eli, that's...

406
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:17,730
that's some fine detective work.

407
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,562
Yeah, man, I knew it.

408
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,951
Once I saw the guard, I was like,
"this can't be the guy".

409
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:26,110
And then I was taking a look
at the pictures.

410
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:27,541
Have you slept yet?

411
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:28,891
Not yet.

412
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:39,702
A couple lost their adult son
a few years ago to a car accident.

413
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:42,982
Now they think their grandson is being
abused by their daughter-in-law.

414
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:46,350
Think you can get a few hours'
sleep and go back on stakeout?

415
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:48,002
I'll go right now if you need me to.

416
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:51,641
I like the hustle, but the kid's
in school till 3:00.

417
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:01,190
What do you think?

418
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:03,801
Um...

419
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:06,692
feels kind of...

420
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,123
uh...

421
00:20:08,245 --> 00:20:10,821
Let me guess. You're an art major.

422
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,883
Interested amateur.

423
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:16,311
It just looks like
you're having muse trouble.

424
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,272
Yeah, like your muse
isn't your muse anymore

425
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:23,140
because she dumped you...

426
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:26,780
for, like, a meathead.

427
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,613
Um, I don't know what
you think that's about, but...

428
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:33,302
I'm busy, so...

429
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:35,001
Yeah, me too.

430
00:20:35,187 --> 00:20:36,213
So let's cut the crap.

431
00:20:38,425 --> 00:20:40,493
Did you steal Kurt's playbook, Larry?

432
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:44,150
There's something I can use,
a book full of football plays.

433
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:47,303
Maybe if it got your romantic
rival kicked off the team.

434
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,533
I see, so he can spend
more time with Trish?

435
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:52,982
Great theory. You are clearly a genius.

436
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,690
If he's off the team,
he loses his scholarship.

437
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:56,663
He's gone.

438
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,481
And Trish is alone and ready to cry

439
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,242
on your bony-ass,
paint-spattered shoulder.

440
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:05,663
Look, whoever you are,
I'm not a criminal mastermind.

441
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:08,372
I'm just a painter.

442
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:13,281
Yeah, well, so was Hitler.

443
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:22,101
Let me see your backpack.

444
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:24,411
It's on my chair. What's up?

445
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:28,083
Just had a little chat
with our friend Larry...

446
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,883
Enormous tool, by the way.

447
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:31,700
Trish totally traded up.

448
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:34,702
- Uh, thanks. What's...
- Sure.

449
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:37,940
Anyway, everything Larry touches
is smeared with oil paint.

450
00:21:38,026 --> 00:21:40,283
He's got motive and opportunity.

451
00:21:41,948 --> 00:21:45,532
So all we need is a single
smudge in the bag.

452
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:48,823
Come on, Larry, please be guilty.

453
00:21:55,315 --> 00:22:00,062
You said Pop walked onto
the Hearst football team, right?

454
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:09,090
So if you lost your scholarship,
it could, theoretically, go to him?

455
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:10,830
Pop couldn't. I mean, he's my...

456
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:13,622
Then how did it get in there?
You never opened the bag.

457
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:15,383
Even if he did he would know
to just trash it.

458
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:16,971
There's no way we would prove it.

459
00:22:17,055 --> 00:22:20,531
So we blackmail him.
That's the beauty of blackmail.

460
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:22,372
If I call him and he shows,
he's guilty.

461
00:22:22,587 --> 00:22:24,891
Get him to confess on tape,
we force him to take the fall.

462
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:29,240
Please, I've only
done this a million times.

463
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:32,673
So, how did people blackmail
each other before e-mail?

464
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:34,590
30 years ago, I'd be here all night

465
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,590
cutting letters from a magazine
and getting glue everywhere.

466
00:22:37,676 --> 00:22:39,500
Now it's just one button.

467
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:43,861
And I'm ready for
my official boyfriend visit.

468
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:51,300
And last but not, by no means,
least, Thorsten Veblen.

469
00:22:51,365 --> 00:22:52,433
Enjoy.

470
00:23:01,705 --> 00:23:03,011
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

471
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:05,531
<i>I don't think I'll be able
to make it tonight...</i>

472
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,710
<i>Come on, do it. Come on.</i>

473
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:09,821
<i>...'cause it looks like
I'm getting lucky.</i>

474
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:12,071
<i>Hey, I'll see you tomorrow, babe.</i>

475
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:16,752
Now, here's a moral dilemma.

476
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:18,490
You have a cellphone tracker

477
00:23:18,685 --> 00:23:20,401
Which cost your dad
hundreds of dollars.

478
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:21,761
You went through the trouble

479
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:24,580
of activating your gps chip
in your boyfriend's phone,

480
00:23:24,777 --> 00:23:28,441
so is it a waste of your dad's
hard-earned money and your time

481
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:30,410
If you don't use it?

482
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,640
Hey, guys, hey. Good to see
you guys. How are you?

483
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:38,883
Looking good. Looking good.

484
00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:41,932
Angela, that is a sharp-looking
jacket. Good to see you.

485
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:46,300
Yo, we're running low on vodka.

486
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,022
Can you do something about it?

487
00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:51,050
Whoo-Hoo! Oh, nice!

488
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,591
That's what I like to see,
everybody having a good time.

489
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:06,352
And you, my friend,

490
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:08,683
appear to be in the proverbial
catbird seat.

491
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:16,280
Is that what they're calling
the toilet these days?

492
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:19,693
'Cause that's what I think I'm in.

493
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:32,720
What are you doing here?

494
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:34,531
I was about to ask you
the same question.

495
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:38,090
First, let's start out
with where exactly here is.

496
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,912
My room. Mercer. Mercer Hayes.

497
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:43,453
Just Veronica.

498
00:24:43,706 --> 00:24:46,442
So this is why you stood me up?

499
00:24:46,507 --> 00:24:48,220
Are you playing,
or is your seat... It's free.

500
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:49,833
Unlike me, apparently.

501
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:52,701
Veronica, it's not like I promised.

502
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:55,273
Wait, how did you find me?

503
00:24:55,348 --> 00:24:58,501
Easy, I just followed the pungent
smell of money going to waste.

504
00:24:58,756 --> 00:25:00,733
So, what was it, a bug, a tracer?

505
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:02,300
Relax, I just traced your phone.

506
00:25:02,408 --> 00:25:03,550
Can you maybe move this outside?

507
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:05,673
Hey, m-M-Mercer,

508
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,543
You got a spread
on this weekend's game?

509
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:10,441
I d-D-D-Do.

510
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:14,302
You must hate when people do that.
It's us by four.

511
00:25:15,587 --> 00:25:17,331
Yeah, so if you don't mind.

512
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:26,173
You know, as adorable as it is
when you do it to criminals,

513
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:28,233
the surveillance thing
is starting to bug.

514
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:29,920
You said you'd come by.

515
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:30,970
Might come by.

516
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:33,363
And then on your message
I heard all this partying,

517
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,000
and I wanted to know what was going on.

518
00:25:35,595 --> 00:25:37,820
While I appreciate your interest,
Big Brother...

519
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:39,591
Wow, a "1984" reference.

520
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:41,490
Did you read that in weight lifting?

521
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:44,600
You know, your dad was half right.

522
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:47,303
You have a thing for bad boys, but...

523
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:49,270
you don't want to reform them.

524
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:51,130
You just get off on judging them.

525
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:52,673
Which reminds me...

526
00:25:52,757 --> 00:25:55,650
Can I borrow your copy
of "101 brooding comments"?

527
00:25:55,695 --> 00:25:57,031
I only have the cliffs notes.

528
00:25:57,775 --> 00:26:00,270
Look, I got to run,
so to save you the trouble,

529
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:02,462
I'm surfing in Mexico
with Dick and Mercer this weekend.

530
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:03,730
I'll fax you the coordinates

531
00:26:03,858 --> 00:26:05,711
So you don't incur
cell-tracking charges,

532
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:07,212
And I'll keep a journal
of my bad thoughts

533
00:26:07,296 --> 00:26:09,722
In case you want to stick my face
in a cage of rats when I get back.

534
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:14,231
Sorry, "1984" is the only book I read.

535
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:26,100
<i>The most tender place in my heart</i>

536
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:30,070
<i>Is for strangers</i>

537
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:32,883
<i>I know it's unkind</i>

538
00:26:32,987 --> 00:26:38,332
<i>But my own blood is much too dangerous</i>

539
00:26:39,418 --> 00:26:41,160
I got fired off a job today.

540
00:26:41,237 --> 00:26:42,612
What? What hap...

541
00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:46,311
Weevil?

542
00:26:47,456 --> 00:26:49,402
I sent him on surveillance
the other night.

543
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:52,502
He did great, really great.

544
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:55,983
I sent him on another one last night,

545
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:57,722
a child-abuse case.

546
00:26:58,537 --> 00:27:01,273
A couple's son died in a crash,
and they suspect

547
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:04,212
the daughter-In-Law's hitting their
grandson, so they want custody.

548
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:05,310
What did he do?

549
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,490
Weevil finds out it's not the
daughter-in-law who hit the kid,

550
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:08,542
it's the new boyfriend.

551
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:10,443
- So Weevil...
- Hit the new boyfriend.

552
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:11,820
Repeatedly.

553
00:27:11,936 --> 00:27:13,823
The daughter-in-law realized
what he was doing there.

554
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:14,852
Lawyers got involved,

555
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:18,683
The grandparents lost their chance.
I lost the job

556
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:22,180
and my chance to protect
the kid from further abuse.

557
00:27:22,636 --> 00:27:24,061
Oh, my god.

558
00:27:26,837 --> 00:27:28,641
Dad, it won't happen again.

559
00:27:31,588 --> 00:27:33,172
He really needs the work.

560
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:34,541
So do I, honey.

561
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:37,471
He's got to go.

562
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:49,463
So, is he mad?

563
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:52,131
Actually...

564
00:27:54,157 --> 00:27:57,221
...I asked if I could be
the one to talk to you.

565
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:01,511
He said he has to let you go.

566
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:03,192
It's not personal.

567
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:05,663
He likes you. He said you're a good...

568
00:28:05,755 --> 00:28:08,771
Don't sugarcoat it,
all right? I get it.

569
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:12,570
I'd fire me.

570
00:28:13,997 --> 00:28:15,483
Man, I just...

571
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:18,200
I really dug this stuff, you know?

572
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:21,833
I actually thought I was okay at it.

573
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:24,631
I'm really sorry, Weevil.

574
00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:26,500
It's all right. Listen uh...

575
00:28:27,187 --> 00:28:29,322
do you know anybody else
who's hiring ex-cons,

576
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:32,052
because if I don't get a job in a week,

577
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,601
I'm going back to the joint.

578
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,790
I wish I did.

579
00:28:37,878 --> 00:28:41,930
But, actually, if you can still
borrow tools from your uncle,

580
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:46,090
I can get you two grand
to fix the dean's car.

581
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:52,901
Can I check that out?

582
00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:54,410
Guilty conscience, eh?

583
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:56,781
No, actually, somebody told me

584
00:28:56,826 --> 00:28:58,551
I needed to come down
here and check it out.

585
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,801
Me. I left you the message.

586
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:04,203
You. So, what's this about?

587
00:29:04,215 --> 00:29:05,953
You said that you knew
I'd done something wrong.

588
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:08,963
That sound in your head, Pop,

589
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:12,161
It is the beating
of this hideous heart!

590
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:16,251
But, seriously, I'm giving you
the chance to come clean.

591
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:17,750
I know what you did to Kurt.

592
00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:19,703
There's no sense trying to deny it.

593
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,912
Good. You're doing great.

594
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:25,393
Now we just need to figure out

595
00:29:25,436 --> 00:29:27,741
how you can set things
straight with Kurt.

596
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:31,021
I mean, I assume you trashed it, so...

597
00:29:31,076 --> 00:29:32,693
no, I've still got it.

598
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:34,200
You do? Yeah.

599
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:35,990
Do you want me to give it to you?

600
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:38,680
Well, yeah, that would be a good start.

601
00:29:42,196 --> 00:29:44,651
I mean, I don't really
get the third degree.

602
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:47,341
It's just a lousy sociology assignment.

603
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:49,392
I didn't think it would be
that big of a deal.

604
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:50,523
Wait.

605
00:29:50,628 --> 00:29:53,532
So when you broke into Kurt's bag,
you were stealing homework?

606
00:29:53,596 --> 00:29:56,103
I was behind, and I thought

607
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:58,352
it's not like either of us
would get caught, so...

608
00:29:58,438 --> 00:30:01,071
when you swiped this,
did you see a playbook in his bag?

609
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:04,983
Yeah, which is actually against
the rules, but Kurt's cool.

610
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:06,732
And I was stealing his homework.

611
00:30:06,925 --> 00:30:09,451
What time did you stop
playing "Guitar Hero" that night?

612
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:11,933
I don't know, 1:00-Ish?

613
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:14,282
Whenever his girl showed up
and kicked me out.

614
00:30:14,488 --> 00:30:15,641
Trish?

615
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:25,101
Veronica! Guess who just got
his own radio show?

616
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:26,300
Me.

617
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:29,372
I do feel like you had
something to do with it, though...

618
00:30:29,585 --> 00:30:32,373
You know, you helping
the boss's boyfriend.

619
00:30:33,108 --> 00:30:34,701
Well, it's a good thing
you got the show

620
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:37,572
because I'm about
to make Trish real unhappy.

621
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:40,743
Trish, did you talk to Kurt yet?

622
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:41,823
No, what's up?

623
00:30:48,768 --> 00:30:50,872
My boyfriend has
a weight-lifting class,

624
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,360
and I was meeting him
by the stadium, and I saw Kurt.

625
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,511
I think he turned himself in.

626
00:30:55,965 --> 00:30:56,710
What makes you think...

627
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:58,340
Coach Fry had him running the stadium,

628
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:01,232
yelling like a maniac
about him losing the playbook

629
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:04,901
and how he's gonna be running
the stadium steps every day.

630
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:07,940
You were right, Trish.
That guy really has it in for Kurt.

631
00:31:07,997 --> 00:31:10,121
But he didn't get kicked off?

632
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:13,490
I'd say getting kicked off
would have been a bargain.

633
00:31:17,057 --> 00:31:19,271
30 minutes...
That should be about right...

634
00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:21,820
30 minutes for Trish
to come apart at the seams.

635
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:26,970
What is she doing in there?

636
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:33,333
Redecorating?

637
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:40,383
I took Kurt's playbook.

638
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:41,591
You don't say.

639
00:31:42,355 --> 00:31:44,201
And now it's gone,
and if I don't find it,

640
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:45,632
Kurt is gonna keep getting tortured.

641
00:31:45,797 --> 00:31:48,802
Well, the good news is
I lied about that.

642
00:31:49,258 --> 00:31:51,821
You wanted your boyfriend
to lose his scholarship

643
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:55,002
just so, what, you two could spend
more time together?

644
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:56,301
No.

645
00:31:56,845 --> 00:31:58,912
I wanted him off so he
wouldn't be miserable.

646
00:31:59,495 --> 00:32:02,220
That coach treats him
like a piece of meat.

647
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:06,861
Kurt... Kurt absolutely lived
for that team.

648
00:32:07,078 --> 00:32:09,341
And when he wrecked his knee for them,

649
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:10,351
how did they thank him?

650
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:12,132
They made his life hell.

651
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:15,452
Trish, you can't quit for him.

652
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:17,873
We need to get that book back.

653
00:32:18,007 --> 00:32:21,802
Fine. But it's gone,
and I have no idea where it could be.

654
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:30,950
Think about it. We know who has it.

655
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:41,453
Where's the playbook, Larry?

656
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:44,783
Get off me, you dumb goon!

657
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:46,800
Where's the playbook, Larry?
Where's the playbook?

658
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:48,363
You're entering a world of pain, Larry.

659
00:32:49,196 --> 00:32:51,782
It... It's under the couch.

660
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:04,042
Cool. Let's go.

661
00:33:04,326 --> 00:33:06,442
Uh, I don't think it's cool, actually.

662
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:10,833
I saw him sniffing around
Mercer's casino sports book

663
00:33:11,106 --> 00:33:13,253
checking the spread on saturday's game.

664
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:15,523
Sounds like pretty good odds, huh?

665
00:33:15,938 --> 00:33:17,252
Your roomie swipes a playbook

666
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:20,272
from his ex-Girlfriend's
meathead new boyfriend,

667
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:22,880
so why not pass it along
to the other team

668
00:33:22,955 --> 00:33:25,071
and then bet the farm against Hearst?

669
00:33:25,195 --> 00:33:27,272
You gave Sonoma state the playbook?

670
00:33:27,346 --> 00:33:28,911
Larry was in on it, too.

671
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:31,540
No one will know it was you, Kurt.

672
00:33:31,586 --> 00:33:33,620
Just turn in your pages
tomorrow like everyone else.

673
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:35,503
And just let the team
get their asses kicked?

674
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,662
After what they did to you?
What do you owe them?

675
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:40,981
I guess you don't know me that well.

676
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,061
I can't believe you got
so much done that fast.

677
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:51,541
Well, only one of
those dents is serious.

678
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:53,770
The windows and paint
will take another day or so.

679
00:33:54,327 --> 00:33:55,491
It's not so bad.

680
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:57,851
So, hey, the dean's a pal of yours?

681
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,461
You actually made friends
with somebody?

682
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,930
Actually, he wants me expelled.

683
00:34:02,036 --> 00:34:04,852
That sounds more like it.
I didn't figure him to be so uptight.

684
00:34:04,908 --> 00:34:07,002
He'd outlaw women wearing pants.

685
00:34:08,265 --> 00:34:09,540
Why would you say that?

686
00:34:09,605 --> 00:34:12,321
I figured with the cool car
and the badass tunes,

687
00:34:12,368 --> 00:34:13,281
he'd be a cool guy.

688
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:14,951
Badass tunes?

689
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:16,810
This was in the cd player.

690
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:26,961
Okay, so here's the deal.

691
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:28,691
You can go ahead and expel me

692
00:34:28,748 --> 00:34:30,771
because I'm not giving up the name,

693
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:34,263
or we can drop the whole thing
and I can make your problem

694
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:38,362
with the lilith house and the
lampoon and the car go away.

695
00:34:44,006 --> 00:34:46,833
So you can make all this go away.

696
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:49,480
You a big fan of The Transplants?

697
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:51,233
I don't know what that is.

698
00:34:51,486 --> 00:34:54,251
It's a band. Your son knows.

699
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:59,440
I even read they had a show
the other night. Did he go?

700
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,140
He's 15. He's not allowed.

701
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:03,061
I think he did anyway.

702
00:35:03,327 --> 00:35:06,632
I think he took your car
and snuck out, blasting his cd.

703
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:07,911
Then, when he dented it,

704
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:09,810
knowing you'd murder him
if you found out,

705
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:11,902
he trashed it to make it
look like feminists did it.

706
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:17,411
See, this dent is way too deep.

707
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:19,180
A baseball bat couldn't have done that.

708
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:21,380
And there was paint
chipped off on the inside.

709
00:35:22,146 --> 00:35:23,952
And I'm betting
if you check your garage,

710
00:35:24,047 --> 00:35:27,363
you'll find you have a can of spray
paint that matches the graffiti.

711
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,333
I see.

712
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:32,731
So I guess we're even.

713
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,803
Actually, you still owe me
'cause I got your car fixed for free.

714
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,881
For free? By whom?

715
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:41,831
By the hard-working
and responsible young man

716
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:44,191
you are going to hire
to fill this maintenance position.

717
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,500
I wrote his name and number on there.

718
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:47,072
He's expecting your call.

719
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:54,182
Hey, Mercer,
you pack your shark repellent?

720
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:55,760
My what?

721
00:35:56,366 --> 00:35:57,852
Veronica, right?

722
00:35:58,126 --> 00:36:00,062
Ooh, do not eat that. Trust me.

723
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:01,761
And what about sharks?

724
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:03,720
Watch out for them in the water.

725
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:05,563
You're going on a surf trip, right?

726
00:36:06,616 --> 00:36:07,663
Mexico?

727
00:36:08,158 --> 00:36:09,292
Right, Mexico.

728
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:11,232
Yeah, well, no one said
anything about surfing,

729
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:13,882
but, um, yeah, I'll get you a piñata.

730
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:20,502
Now, maybe people would say

731
00:36:20,566 --> 00:36:22,411
they'd never install a tracking device

732
00:36:22,477 --> 00:36:23,911
in their significant other's car,

733
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:26,402
but I think that's only because
they don't know how.

734
00:36:36,575 --> 00:36:39,923
Hey, Trish, did Kurt talk to you?

735
00:36:39,988 --> 00:36:41,282
Kurt's gone.

736
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:43,720
He packed his car
and headed back to Kansas.

737
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:45,730
They yanked his scholarship.

738
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,732
So he told them about the playbook?

739
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:52,222
He said he owed it to his teammates.

740
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:55,572
I don't understand boys or football.

741
00:36:56,035 --> 00:36:57,560
Me, neither.

742
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:00,451
But, hey, if guys like Kurt
are that into it,

743
00:37:00,496 --> 00:37:03,250
It can't be all bad, I guess.

744
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:06,043
So you broke up?

745
00:37:06,085 --> 00:37:07,943
He said he needed some time to think.

746
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:10,930
I had all the grants
lined up for him. He just...

747
00:37:11,585 --> 00:37:14,633
He said he knows my heart
was in the right place.

748
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:16,982
He just can't get over what I did.

749
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,353
I think I blew it, Veronica.

750
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:21,901
I went momentarily crazy.

751
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,683
And it's gonna cost me the guy I love.

752
00:37:34,515 --> 00:37:36,252
So, I'll let that be my defense,

753
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,351
a case of momentarily crazy,

754
00:37:38,538 --> 00:37:40,110
because when you think about it,

755
00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:43,613
no one wants to know what college
boys do with themselves in Mexico.

756
00:37:43,705 --> 00:37:46,060
So, we'll just put this
behind us for now.

757
00:37:46,895 --> 00:37:47,842
Yes.

758
00:37:48,356 --> 00:37:49,500
Goodbye.

759
00:37:50,057 --> 00:37:51,601
Peace in our time.

760
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:04,201
Better?

761
00:38:04,795 --> 00:38:05,911
Much.

762
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:15,622
If the eight e-mail reminders
I've received are correct,

763
00:38:16,058 --> 00:38:18,192
It's time for the premier
of Piz's radio show.

764
00:38:18,437 --> 00:38:19,261
<i>...and, finally,</i>

765
00:38:19,317 --> 00:38:20,963
<i>congratulations to our football team,</i>

766
00:38:21,018 --> 00:38:23,193
<i>who outlasted
Sonoma state this afternoon</i>

767
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:25,261
<i>in a 24-17 scorcher.</i>

768
00:38:25,328 --> 00:38:28,410
<i>Now stay tuned
for "But we were just talking".</i>

769
00:38:28,926 --> 00:38:30,643
Looks like larry
and his stuttering roommate

770
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:32,580
Really are starving artists now.

771
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,820
<i>Our inaugural episode is devoted</i>

772
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:38,283
To my personal favorite
amendment, old number one.

773
00:38:38,545 --> 00:38:41,512
Our guests...
The heads of the lilith house

774
00:38:41,706 --> 00:38:44,222
and the editors of the hearst lampoon.

775
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:51,532
You can actually hear the smiles.

776
00:38:52,857 --> 00:38:54,670
All right, let's flip a coin,
see who goes first.

777
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:59,072
<i>And it's the head of a white,
slave-owning patriarch,</i>

778
00:38:59,277 --> 00:39:00,833
<i>which means we'll go with the gents.</i>

779
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:02,352
The problem is simple.

780
00:39:03,117 --> 00:39:04,620
Feminists aren't funny.

781
00:39:04,837 --> 00:39:07,031
Should I wait for the rim shot,
or can I respond?

782
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:09,360
Can you say "rim shot" on the radio?

783
00:39:09,587 --> 00:39:12,841
Please. If I say mr. Hartman here
is an idiot, that's one thing.

784
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:15,892
But I say he's an idiot and should be
strung up and beaten to death.

785
00:39:16,068 --> 00:39:18,462
Is that different? I mean,
do words matter anymore?

786
00:39:18,768 --> 00:39:21,360
She makes a good point.
I mean think about it.

787
00:39:21,535 --> 00:39:22,951
This may not be

788
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:26,212
Burning-Movie-Theater-Dangerous
speech, but it is...

789
00:39:26,346 --> 00:39:27,430
You bastards.

790
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:30,221
- You bastards!
- Uh, we'll be right back.

791
00:39:30,628 --> 00:39:32,710
You said you'd do it, and you did.

792
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:34,692
It was Claire.

793
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:37,382
They raped Claire...

794
00:39:37,436 --> 00:39:39,573
"The blonde in the middle".

795
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:42,522
Are you happy? Are you happy now?

796
00:39:44,227 --> 00:39:45,180
Hi.

797
00:39:46,188 --> 00:39:49,621
I'm looking into Jack London
and mercury poisoning.

798
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,742
Third floor, aisle nine.

799
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,991
Is this the help desk?

800
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:07,022
'Cause I need a little help.

801
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:12,962
Let me guess. You have this
pathologically suspicious girlfriend,

802
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:15,501
and you hope maybe there's a guidebook?

803
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:17,803
No, it's more like, uh...

804
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:24,082
...what's beyond pathological?

805
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:30,751
I'm sorry, Logan.

806
00:40:31,756 --> 00:40:35,173
I spent my formative years
watching people

807
00:40:35,237 --> 00:40:38,350
while they lied to, cheated on,
and betrayed each other.

808
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:41,120
So the trust thing,

809
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:43,633
It doesn't come naturally.

810
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:47,272
But I'm trying to act unnaturally.
I swear.

811
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:53,102
So there's that.

812
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:58,032
I thought you were in Mexico.

813
00:40:58,245 --> 00:41:01,071
Yeah, well, us bad boys
usually love Mexico, but...

814
00:41:03,408 --> 00:41:05,300
I was feeling a little reformed.

815
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,412
And I don't even think Mercer surfs.

816
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:12,042
And I always feel bad
about those poor donkeys.

817
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,353
Are you free this weekend?

818
00:41:19,178 --> 00:41:20,713
There's a film festival...

819
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:25,223
Incomprehensible foreign movies
of three-plus hours.

820
00:41:27,297 --> 00:41:29,150
Is this the help desk?

821
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,211
It sounds nice.

822
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,253
But let's find you that guidebook,

823
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:45,352
Which I think is on the dark,
lonely top floor.
