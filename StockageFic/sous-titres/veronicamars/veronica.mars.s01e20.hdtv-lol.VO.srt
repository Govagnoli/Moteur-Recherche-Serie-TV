1
00:00:00,205 --> 00:00:01,910
Previously on Veronica Mars…

2
00:00:01,972 --> 00:00:02,883
You think I killed Lilly.

3
00:00:02,945 --> 00:00:03,728
Duncan, calm down.

4
00:00:03,805 --> 00:00:06,298
Why, do you think I'm going to have another episode and kill you too?

5
00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:08,162
You haven't seen Duncan, tonight, have you?

6
00:00:08,223 --> 00:00:10,420
He's missing. His parents think he may have run away.

7
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,564
You didn't want them dating either.

8
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:17,209
Yeah, I probably wish Mom would've found a guy who wasn't my best friend's dad.

9
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:19,391
I know Lilly loved you.

10
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:20,864
Well, it's just not like I loved her.

11
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,729
I don't know, I don't have to feel guilty anymore.

12
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:24,251
Feel guilty about what?

13
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,045
What are we doing?

14
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,062
No idea.

15
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:45,199
Later.

16
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,846
Uh-oh, someone's got her eye on that Miss White Trash title.

17
00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:57,048
Yeah, you know you got a solid effort in the talent competition,

18
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,055
but I'd like to see that car up on some cinder blocks.

19
00:00:59,096 --> 00:01:00,252
Guys, come on, huh.

20
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:05,746
I know. Guys, come on, the talent is making a grilled cheese sandwich on the engine block.

21
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:10,702
Guys, come on, you can't put your car up on blocks in the yard if you don't have a yard.

22
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,866
You know, I think I can do both sides of this little act now.

23
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:23,426
So, how 'bout next time, you don't bother. I got it covered.

24
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:34,609
So that's it?

25
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:39,508
I mean just like that you flush a two year relationship down the toilet?

26
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:42,665
No, Tad, it's…

27
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:47,127
We've been going out since I was a freshman and I just feel like-

28
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,381
What did I do wrong?

29
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:51,780
Nothing. It's just… you're graduating in a month and...

30
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:55,519
And what? What, you don't trust me? What with college and all that?

31
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:58,648
Tad, I just can't imagine doing the whole long distance thing.

32
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,219
But it's only for a year.

33
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:05,763
No, it's four years at the Academy and then four years of the Navy and I don't know.

34
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:11,800
Look. Look, just listen to this, please?

35
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:13,351
I don't want another mix.

36
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,697
It's something I wrote for you on my guitar.

37
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:19,737
Look, a song isn't going to make it better, Tad. It's over.

38
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:23,889
Before you go,

39
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:25,733
there's something you should see.

40
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,443
You're not gonna change my mind.

41
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:39,096
I don't even remember doing it.

42
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:45,773
I must have been wasted. I would never do something like that.

43
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:47,652
It's totally disgusting.

44
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:50,784
You mean, you two having sex?

45
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:52,617
Worse.

46
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:57,123
I'm skinny-dipping in some hot tub and…

47
00:02:58,863 --> 00:03:00,011
I have this…

48
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:02,340
popsicle and I…

49
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,205
Do you think he's serious?

50
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:07,747
I don't know. When I said I wanted to break up, he was just…

51
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,162
but I can't take the chance. I need you to get me that phone, Veronica.

52
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,482
You can do that, can't you?

53
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:14,864
Oh, yeah.

54
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:16,554
Bank on it. 

55
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:04,554
What? I blockaded the door.

56
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:06,243
I hung an "Out of Order" sign.

57
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:07,683
No, this is wrong.

58
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:11,521
I mean a boy in a girl's bathroom, it's just-

59
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:13,304
- So wrong, it's right? 
- Yes.

60
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:18,045
I'm sorry about Dick and those guys.

61
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:19,695
Dick and those guys don't bother me.

62
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:22,792
Besides, you and I have to keep up appearances

63
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,947
because Duncan is gonna come home some day…

64
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:30,297
and I don't want him to hear about us, this, from someone else.

65
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:36,180
I am beyond tardy for my physics class.

66
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:39,811
If I remember right, time travel is not yet possible.

67
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,341
So try petty corruption.

68
00:04:44,388 --> 00:04:46,647
Tardy excuse slips. Date-stamped.

69
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:47,760
Untraceable.

70
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,485
I know people.

71
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:55,212
It's clear.

72
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:58,187
Good luck in physics.

73
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,485
Remember,

74
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:03,164
force equals mass times acceleration…

75
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,270
…light is a particle that can exhibit properties of a wave…

76
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:10,664
I'd learn more staying here with you.

77
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:13,075
I have things to do.

78
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:19,741
Like cool down.

79
00:05:22,195 --> 00:05:23,762
I made a promise to Carmen.

80
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:27,310
Thank god for disposable cell phones.

81
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:30,489
No offence but you look odd.

82
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:33,121
I just watched our parents cuddle on the couch last night.

83
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:35,845
My eyes… they burn.

84
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,472
Any idea what our parents do Mondays and Wednesdays

85
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,919
from six to ten that requires an overnight bag?

86
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:43,627
As far as I'm concerned, they play bingo at the VFW.

87
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,839
That's my story, I'm sticking with it.

88
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,630
Best way to deal with things like this? Pretend they don't exist.

89
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:50,837
Do you mind calling this number halfway through sixth period?

90
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:51,859
Sure, all right.

91
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,761
- They don't exist? 
- Deal.

92
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,126
Hey, you mind helping me with a bump and bait here?

93
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,837
So I was all no way and he was like, yeah, way and-

94
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:03,964
I'm so sorry.

95
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:04,998
Watch what you're doing.

96
00:06:07,654 --> 00:06:08,762
Okely-dokely.

97
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:11,322
He did not say that.

98
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,232
Excuse me! What do you think you're doing?

99
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:20,928
Okay, ciao for now.

100
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:23,993
This is like study hall, right?

101
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:30,122
I  was excused from gym class for, um, personal reasons.

102
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:33,015
Are you not familiar with the school's cell phone policy?

103
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,814
All right, all right, take a pill.

104
00:06:38,802 --> 00:06:40,460
You can pick this up after school.

105
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:44,024
We can it symbiosis.

106
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,588
That literally means living together.

107
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:53,209
Tad, I believe your bag is ringing.

108
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:05,456
What? Give me a break, it's not even on.

109
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:09,399
I  know you know the policy Mr Wilson, because you just saw a demonstration.

110
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:11,887
I'm an equal opportunity confiscator.

111
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:28,164
Ms Dunne?

112
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:32,900
I volunteered to separate the recycling from the cafeteria trash this afternoon.

113
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:34,840
Can I be excused from class early?

114
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:43,391
Hi! I'm here to get my phone back.

115
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:45,280
Consider this a warning.

116
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:49,487
Next time, I'm keeping it and you'll just have to gossip with your friends with two cans and string.

117
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:53,118
I'm not sure what that means but I'm totally warned, I swear.

118
00:07:58,388 --> 00:07:59,278
Ah, yep.

119
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:04,991
Wait, this isn't mine.

120
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:10,931
Veronica Mars.

121
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:16,251
Hey, honey, how's school?

122
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:19,701
You know. Mean kids and different teachers.

123
00:08:19,856 --> 00:08:21,171
Crumbling infrastructure.

124
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:24,888
So, why are you smiling?

125
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:26,645
'Cause I'm savouring the irony.

126
00:08:26,727 --> 00:08:29,993
Imagine the Mars family sending our heir, Veronica,

127
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:33,751
to an Ivy League college with money from the bounty on the Kane heir.

128
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,490
For information on the whereabouts of Duncan Kane.

129
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:39,440
Fifty grand? Not bad.

130
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:43,484
Money for nothing. That's your first two years right there.

131
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:46,023
It might not be as easy as you think.

132
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:47,503
Come on, honey, Duncan Kane?

133
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:50,264
A sheltered rich kid who has maids fold his underwear?

134
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,998
I think I'll be able to track him down.

135
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:54,784
I'm only worried about beating the other pros.

136
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:59,064
Yeah, he's a big fish in a very small barrel.

137
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:01,753
What is it?

138
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:05,009
You know that entertainment lawyer you've been looking for all year?

139
00:09:05,716 --> 00:09:06,509
Y eah.

140
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:10,400
Well, I was telling Meg about how hard the guy's been to find

141
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,407
and all the tricks you use if you want to disappear

142
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,161
and Duncan was sitting right there, listening.

143
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:22,177
But, looking on the bright side, all those other professionals probably won't find him first.

144
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,959
What did you tell him?

145
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:28,101
Use cash, don't use a credit card, don't use your own car, you know.

146
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:28,995
The basics.

147
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,677
I might have mentioned something about recycling passports on eBay.

148
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:42,052
But, come on, Dad, with your expertise and my can-do spirit, we can do it. Family project.

149
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,874
I have a friend who can play the eBay angle, might be able-

150
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,060
Hello, Mr Mars.

151
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,317
Hey, Veronica. How's school?

152
00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:56,029
Hi, Miss Fennel, it's fine.

153
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,854
We'll be back around eight or so.

154
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:03,827
Where you going?

155
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:04,795
Out.

156
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:08,052
Why don't you get started on that passport thing?

157
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:21,030
So. Did it work?

158
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:22,009
Success.

159
00:10:22,224 --> 00:10:24,979
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

160
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:28,670
You didn't watch it, did you?

161
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,195
You saved my life, Veronica.

162
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:37,789
Look, Carmen, just because we got the phone, doesn't mean the video's dead.

163
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:42,858
You gotta know it's impossible to destroy a digital file with any kind of certainty.

164
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,357
Tad isn't really a think ahead kind of guy.

165
00:10:54,512 --> 00:10:55,438
That felt good.

166
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:57,317
Justice is served.

167
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,970
It's just a message from Top Gun.

168
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,670
That's Tad.

169
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:17,407
Oh my god.

170
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:23,491
So the thing is figuring out if any passports were sold

171
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:26,839
on any of these auction sites and shipped anywhere near Neptune.

172
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:31,467
Man, Veronica. Have you ever asked for help for anything normal?

173
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:33,147
What fun would that be?

174
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,354
All right, well, I'll get back to you.

175
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:36,726
Thanks a zillion, Mac.

176
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,205
So Carmen's back with Tad.

177
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:44,206
It's either that or he sends the video to the whole school.

178
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:48,660
Now that's a shame. Neighbourhood girl like that, wasting her assets on a white boy.

179
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:51,328
Isn't that that chick you had a crush on in eighth grade?

180
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,616
Too bad you ain't rich. And white.

181
00:11:57,177 --> 00:12:01,169
Get marooned. Great. Another island-centric prom theme.

182
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:04,141
Another year of double digit IQed jocks laughing at their own jokes

183
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:07,934
about getting laid as freshman hula girls put flowers around their necks.

184
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:11,189
I don't see anybody forcing you to buy tickets, queer-bait.

185
00:12:11,286 --> 00:12:13,732
I'm sorry, am I giving away your best material, uh?

186
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:17,897
Isn't the, uh, gay prom next Friday in the Dog Beach men's room?

187
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:19,929
So I guess I'll see you there, sailor.

188
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:23,539
What'd you just say to me, Boy George?

189
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,122
Come on. The Navy? "Cover my back, wingman!"

190
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,322
"The rear admiral wants us to pound away with the ten-inch gun!"

191
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:35,023
I mean, isn't just joining the Navy alone gay enough to get you thrown out of the Navy.

192
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,115
The prom is supposed to be for traditional couples, man.

193
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:44,315
Oh, come on. What's more traditional than fairies and fat chicks?

194
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:51,523
Now why would Carmen want to dump such a charmer?

195
00:12:51,765 --> 00:12:55,574
One day and I already feel like I need a long hot shower.

196
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,181
I don't know how long I can keep this up.

197
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,408
What you need is an exit strategy.

198
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:02,912
You know what's going to happen, Veronica?

199
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,071
I gonna end up a downloadable national joke.

200
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:09,982
You know, right up there with Paris Hilton or that "Star Wars" kid.

201
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,808
I'll be the video that everyone emails their friends, you know,

202
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:18,066
just google popsicle girl and there I'll be for the rest of human history.

203
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:21,025
And I can't stop him.

204
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:26,207
Unless you had something that would ruin Tad back.

205
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:30,323
You  know, get your own A-bomb and it prevents him from launching a first strike.

206
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:32,121
Mutually Assured Destruction.

207
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:35,091
You're not gonna find any dirt on Tad, if that's what you mean.

208
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:39,274
Beyond his penchant for amateur underage pornography?

209
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:40,870
Leave that to me.

210
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,640
I just need to know that you're willing to get your hands a little dirty.

211
00:13:46,885 --> 00:13:50,666
If it makes you feel any better, he didn't really leave you much of a choice.

212
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:53,405
Tad used to be different.

213
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,921
I mean, he was the first boyfriend I ever had. He was the first guy I ever slept with.

214
00:13:57,987 --> 00:14:00,906
First guy who got you drunk and took dirty pictures of you.

215
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:03,117
You still want to date him?

216
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,400
Then let's get this over with.

217
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,028
What do I do?

218
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:12,580
You invite Tad for a romantic afternoon on the Neptune boardwalk.

219
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:23,536
What are you doin' here? You miss me?

220
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:25,396
Alternator trouble.

221
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:30,895
Think your uncle can return the LeBaron to all its original glory?

222
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:33,494
He could get it ready for Daytona if you pay him enough.

223
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,040
That won't be necessary.

224
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:36,971
Come 'ere.

225
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:41,011
The word is the Kanes are offering a nice little reward to find Duncan.

226
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,396
You pick up some leads when you broke into the Kane house

227
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:46,756
or were you just covering your tracks?

228
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,382
You used me.

229
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:53,079
Yeah, well. We're always owing each other favours, aren't we?

230
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:55,055
Don't give me that look.

231
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:59,412
If you really thought I'd hurt Lilly you'd have a homing device on my ass already.

232
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:04,614
I just heard something I thought might be worth, say, uh, 10% of your finder's fee.

233
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:05,921
Ten per cent?

234
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,116
Depends on what that something it.

235
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:12,064
How 'bout a certain spoiled white boy bought a crapped out Impala

236
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:14,205
from my uncle's friend a few weeks back.

237
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:18,562
Eight per cent, if it pans out and you throw in that alternator.

238
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:19,733
All right.

239
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:21,598
Hey, Dad, you got a pen?

240
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:30,025
A '69 Impala. California license plate 6GU C788.

241
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,243
And he bought it for eight hundred cash a couple weeks ago.

242
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:35,289
Right.

243
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:36,702
Bye.

244
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:39,016
It's always business with you.

245
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:48,264
So the place is ours.

246
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:54,064
Dad's at class and Trina's at an extremely important purse store opening in Beverley Hills.

247
00:15:54,343 --> 00:15:55,876
Your Dad is taking classes?

248
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:58,902
Yeah, exploring the world outside himself.

249
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:01,324
All part of the new Aaron Echolls.

250
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:03,357
Spanish, ceramics, Tae Kwan Doe

251
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:06,654
and today, glass blowing with Silvio Pirelli,

252
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:08,718
master of Old World crystal.

253
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:12,545
Nice, huh? Just two lessons.

254
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:14,574
And he made a bong?

255
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:16,510
An urn for my mom.

256
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,696
You know since there was no body and thus no ashes, he filled it with sea water,

257
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:24,201
'cause she jumped into the ocean, get it?

258
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:28,015
At least it gets him out of the house.

259
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:37,548
Hey, do you think this thing…

260
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,421
will ever get more normal?

261
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,393
What,  like will we ever hang at the mall and

262
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,405
hold hands and buy each other teddy bears with hearts that say "I wuv you bear-y much"?

263
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,217
Yes, exactly that.

264
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:57,092
Except I want my bear won through some sort of demonstration of ring tossing ability.

265
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:00,527
Well, secrets are kinda hot, too.

266
00:17:09,354 --> 00:17:10,285
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:15,099
Well, I didn't realise you had company.

268
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,593
Hello, Veronica.

269
00:17:20,178 --> 00:17:21,217
I thought you were out.

270
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:24,770
Yeah, well, Silvio cancelled so I, grabbed some swordfish,

271
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:27,689
I thought I'd try that Lime Tequila Marinade.

272
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,029
You know, uh, I think I'll get out of your guy's hair, uh,

273
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:34,556
there's chips if you're hungry.

274
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,710
Blue corn, really good.

275
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:40,756
Oh my God.

276
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:43,930
Did I just get caught by my dad making out on the couch?

277
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:45,670
Yeah, you got caught by your dad.

278
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:50,647
I got caught by the star of "Breaking Point" and "Beyond the Breaking Point".

279
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:52,092
That's weird.

280
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,524
Um, and I have lipstick on my teeth.

281
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:08,297
Logan! Look who showed up.

282
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,702
- Dick and, um… 
- Ah, Kes.

283
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:12,396
- Beaver. 
- Beav!

284
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:14,722
This is why you couldn't surf?

285
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:17,107
You had something to do on the couch?

286
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:20,559
I'm sorry, dude, I just…

287
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:24,958
Dude, you got a chick here?

288
00:18:25,699 --> 00:18:27,046
No, that's Trina's.

289
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:28,961
She's without her lip gloss.

290
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:31,060
It's possible she's suffering out there.

291
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:34,875
Oh, right, and, uh, I'm supposed to take that to her.

292
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:39,991
Yeah.

293
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:43,968
Actually I was-I was going to go with you.

294
00:18:44,044 --> 00:18:47,111
Dude, no way! You already blew us off in the water.

295
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:51,223
We got business to discuss. This weekend. Mexico.

296
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:53,328
Annual surf and chick fest.

297
00:18:53,414 --> 00:18:55,037
Beav talked to these cheerleaders…

298
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,238
Yeah, it turns out they have a retreat outside Rosarito

299
00:18:57,296 --> 00:18:59,481
and they just got second in this regional contest.

300
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,238
Beers, waves and weak-willed cheerleaders right next door.

301
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:05,037
Sweet.

302
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:09,175
Looks like Logan is gonna be stuck for a while.

303
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:12,256
Ride home?

304
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:21,820
So, how are you Veronica?

305
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:23,801
Embarrassed.

306
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:26,192
Uncomfortable.

307
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,492
Ohh, don't be. I was a teenager once.

308
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:32,362
The thing I really want to ask…

309
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:35,086
how's Logan.

310
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,734
I think he's…

311
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,605
coming to terms.

312
00:19:40,938 --> 00:19:42,357
He was such a good kid.

313
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:45,956
When Lilly died, he became…

314
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:46,966
Difficult?

315
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,357
Well,

316
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:52,730
maybe it's in the genes.

317
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:56,448
I can be difficult from time to time.

318
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:02,074
But whatever, I don't know if you guys are serious or, um,

319
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:06,059
casual or, or just talking but

320
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,476
your secret's safe with me, you know?

321
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:14,860
Look, I just appreciate whatever you're doing to help him through it.

322
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:16,154
Sure.

323
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:22,130
Thanks.

324
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:23,923
Veronica.

325
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:26,723
I'm glad you two are together.

326
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:30,267
I like what I see in him when he's with you.

327
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,913
The talk with Dad.

328
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:39,841
I guess that means my relationship with Logan is officially off the ground.

329
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:44,135
Just in time for Tad and Carmen's relationship to crash and burn on the boardwalk.

330
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:50,101
Jeez! How much vodka did you put in this thing?

331
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:01,283
Hi.

332
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:17,809
How much do you love me?

333
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:31,818
I don't know what it is about you Carmen that makes me feel plumb loco.

334
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,081
Do you wanna try something really crazy?

335
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:38,414
I want you to go talk with Seth.

336
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,446
Why do you need fashion advice?

337
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:48,787
I heard from that drama chick, Gina that he has the best X in school.

338
00:21:49,193 --> 00:21:52,351
I don't know, I thought, maybe on prom night,

339
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,243
you'd wanna experiment with me after the dance?

340
00:21:57,507 --> 00:21:59,744
This is why I love you.

341
00:22:01,643 --> 00:22:02,523
Be right back.

342
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:10,946
Hey, Seth, hey…

343
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:31,544
All we need now is a soundtrack.

344
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,422
Be natural.

345
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,199
Be intimate

346
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,351
and let Tad do the talking, he will tie his own noose, guaranteed.

347
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:44,760
Home stretch, girlfriend.

348
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,487
Hey, Tad. I had such a great time today.

349
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:49,854
Me too, baby.

350
00:22:49,998 --> 00:22:52,711
I wish I had you here right now though in my bed.

351
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:58,168
I can't wait until after prom for our little, ah, erotic experiment.

352
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,410
I had no idea that you'd be so into dropping X together.

353
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:02,643
Are you kidding me?

354
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,829
I've always been curious.

355
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:08,034
Yeah, I was just always worried about my parents, you know,

356
00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:09,669
or the Naval Academy.

357
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:12,187
They'd kick me out if they ever found out.

358
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,309
Well you sure you're ready for me? 

359
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:15,849
Big time.

360
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:17,706
Nighty night.

361
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:20,333
So how was that?

362
00:23:20,978 --> 00:23:23,016
That was a little scary.

363
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:26,958
So remember, we'll meet for lunch tomorrow?

364
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:29,569
And don't forget Tad.

365
00:23:32,283 --> 00:23:33,052
Hi honey.

366
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:36,292
Good news, it's Chicken Kiev night and this time-

367
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:38,632
Next time. I gotta run.

368
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,941
The mystery bag. On a Tuesday?

369
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:44,315
My own dad has lost total libidinal control.

370
00:23:44,428 --> 00:23:45,329
Are you sure?

371
00:23:45,422 --> 00:23:47,623
There are some important teen issues we could discuss.

372
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:49,308
Ooh, the car Duncan bought?

373
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:50,736
Just got a tip.

374
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,780
It was spotted outside Tijuana.

375
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,981
Yale, baby.

376
00:24:01,502 --> 00:24:03,874
- He's in room what? In the middle? 
- Mucho.

377
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:05,743
- Gracias. 
- Andale.

378
00:24:13,403 --> 00:24:14,611
Room service.

379
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:17,596
It's about time you came home, Dunc-

380
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:20,207
Duncan, what are you…

381
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,706
The, uh, car out front, the Impala?

382
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,782
Eh, Impala, si. Is yours?

383
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:32,285
It's a bust, sweetie. The car was abandoned outside the bus station,

384
00:24:32,356 --> 00:24:36,206
a case of beer in the seat and a sign in Spanish saying: Free Car.

385
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,201
A decoy.

386
00:24:38,337 --> 00:24:40,468
Maybe Duncan's smarter than I was giving credit.

387
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:42,642
Well he did ace his PSATs.

388
00:24:43,088 --> 00:24:44,988
So I'll see you at home for dinner?

389
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,970
Raincheck, honey. Alicia and I-

390
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:49,847
Are going out, right. I'll see ya when I see ya.

391
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:52,688
You busy?

392
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:55,833
Still working on that passport thing.

393
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,877
Check it out.

394
00:24:57,036 --> 00:25:01,389
I just found Mr Heinrich's posting on the Neptune Swingles site.

395
00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:05,417
Ooo,  Larry, bowm-chicka-bow-bow.

396
00:25:06,517 --> 00:25:07,531
What do you need?

397
00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:09,569
Ah, along the same lines.

398
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:16,320
How long does it take you to create a highly incriminating, thoroughly libellous, sexually explicit website?

399
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:19,732
Uh... forty-five minutes, give or take?

400
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:24,674
I'll get started on it as I'm done reading about how Mr Heinrich's interests

401
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:29,452
include horseback riding on the beach, hot tubbing with special friends and

402
00:25:29,556 --> 00:25:31,114
"sensual" charades.

403
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:34,698
Thanks Mac. That's a mental image I'll carry with me to the grave.

404
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,649
Is that my math teacher?

405
00:25:37,008 --> 00:25:39,900
Here's the ammo. Seth here will help you with the rest.

406
00:25:47,939 --> 00:25:49,097
What are you doing here?

407
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:50,965
I'm here to offer you a deal.

408
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:53,391
I want my cell phone back.

409
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:54,938
Course.

410
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:03,033
Next order of business, you and Carmen are broken up, effective immediately.

411
00:26:03,284 --> 00:26:04,809
Whoa, what about yesterday?

412
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:06,166
The boardwalk?

413
00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:07,937
My tattoo?

414
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:09,698
It's called pretending.

415
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:11,620
I don't love you anymore.

416
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:13,628
And you can't blackmail me into it.

417
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:16,207
Look Carmen, I swear, I never wanted to hurt you.

418
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:18,302
You made me do it.

419
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:20,421
And look, if you make me do it again-

420
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:21,747
She'll hurt you worse.

421
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,350
What's that?

422
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:29,131
It's Seth'S web page devoted to your forbidden love.

423
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:30,819
Beautiful song you wrote for him.

424
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,805
It's a bunch of crap.

425
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:42,494
You guys just faked that with Photoshop.

426
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:43,866
No one's gonna believe this.

427
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:49,164
Hey, Tad.

428
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:53,772
I can't wait until after prom for our little, ah, erotic experiment.

429
00:26:53,932 --> 00:26:56,057
Why didn't you tell me you were into guys?

430
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:57,566
Are you kidding me?

431
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,707
I've always been curious.

432
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:02,748
Yeah, I was just always worried about my parents, you know,

433
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,401
or the Naval Academy.

434
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,142
They'd kick me out if they ever found out.

435
00:27:06,235 --> 00:27:07,418
Seen enough?

436
00:27:08,155 --> 00:27:11,278
Whatever, who cares about what this school thinks about me.

437
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:12,958
I'm gone in a month.

438
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:17,904
Actually, I was able to get the email addresses of every Plebe at Annapolis.

439
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:23,679
On press of a button and each of your new classmates will have the link to this very special website.

440
00:27:23,756 --> 00:27:26,500
The navy's got that don't ask, don't tell thing.

441
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,808
If we tell, they're gonna ask.

442
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:30,755
Mutually assured destruction.

443
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:32,326
Think hard, Tad.

444
00:27:35,414 --> 00:27:36,422
Look, Carmen.

445
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,690
I don't ever want to speak to you again.

446
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:46,898
Ah, mass transit.

447
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:50,216
But why take the bus when you can drive your very own rustbucket?

448
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:52,136
I had my dad's driver pick it up.

449
00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:55,280
Full of fresh stolen parts, ready to go.

450
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:05,786
Wow, I'll just try to keep this little gesture in mind this weekend

451
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:10,445
when you and Dick and the Beaver are off getting blasted and scamming cheerleaders.

452
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:12,088
Yeah... yeah.

453
00:28:12,303 --> 00:28:16,579
Actually, I had to tell Dick I'm not available, 'cause I have other plans.

454
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:20,413
There are cheerleaders with low self-esteem available domestically?

455
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:23,343
Are you free Friday? Maybe we could go out.

456
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:27,096
Here? In Neptune?

457
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:28,918
What about our little secret?

458
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:34,484
Well, I thought we'd try a practice run in Catalina Island.

459
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:38,897
So what do you think about us skipping school on Friday for a little ride on Dad's boat?

460
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:40,526
Dinner and a movie?

461
00:28:41,897 --> 00:28:43,116
I'll pencil you in.

462
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:44,387
So it's, uh...

463
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:46,464
what is the word?

464
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:47,539
A date?

465
00:28:48,508 --> 00:28:50,867
Nice of your dad to let us use his boat.

466
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,921
Yeah, yeah, I think he actually likes you.

467
00:28:54,034 --> 00:28:56,080
When he heard that stuff about your parents, I think he felt-

468
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,589
What? What stuff?

469
00:28:57,831 --> 00:28:58,747
Logan!

470
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:00,580
What the hell, man?

471
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:04,436
Just, uh, there was something in the paper he saw, I don't know.

472
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:07,754
So tennish, Albacore Club, slip five.

473
00:29:23,171 --> 00:29:24,379
Oh my god.

474
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:28,009
Seeking Lianne Mars. Please contact this number immediately.

475
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:30,379
Legal proceedings have begun in your name.

476
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,414
I know what entrapment is.

477
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:37,880
Actually, Loretta, I don't think you do.

478
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:41,264
Yeah, it's Cliff.

479
00:29:41,874 --> 00:29:43,937
Yes, I'm always available for you.

480
00:29:44,028 --> 00:29:45,289
This is entrapment.

481
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:49,462
Oh, and if that's Tamara, tell that bitch she can beg all she wants, I'm testifying.

482
00:29:49,528 --> 00:29:51,791
Miss Cancun, please, you're not helping yourself.

483
00:29:52,002 --> 00:29:53,374
Veronica, what do you need?

484
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:57,417
Why would someone place a notice of legal proceedings in the classified section?

485
00:29:57,571 --> 00:29:59,752
Well, it could be anything. Could you be more specific?

486
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:03,516
Like, say, a man seeking the whereabouts of a woman.

487
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:07,483
Could be child support, uh, civil suit, divorce.

488
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:09,302
You just sign right here dear.

489
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,654
Divorce?

490
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:17,760
"Screw you, pig." Nice. Okay, like a big girl now?

491
00:30:18,144 --> 00:30:20,723
Yeah, California law, you have to run a notice for seven days

492
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:23,880
before you can file for divorce on grounds of abandonment-

493
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:27,346
I gotta run, V.

494
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:38,926
One, two, three,

495
00:30:39,097 --> 00:30:42,546
four, five, six.

496
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:45,700
One more day before whatever is happening happens

497
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:50,205
and Lianne Mars returns clean and sober to a home that no longer has a place for her.

498
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:53,891
Classifieds.

499
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:56,574
Hi. This is Veronica, Keith Mars' assistant

500
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,447
who placed a legal notice in your paper at the start of the week.

501
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,758
Well, Mr Mars' legal situation has changed

502
00:31:01,812 --> 00:31:04,004
and he won't be needing to run the ad tomorrow.

503
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,929
Good thing you called, we're an hour from deadline.

504
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:09,759
Uh, if you could just confirm Mr Mars' address, credit information

505
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:12,679
and Mr Mars' account password, we'll take care of that for you.

506
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:14,474
Account password.

507
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:17,669
Of course, they have to have something sensible like a password

508
00:31:17,807 --> 00:31:20,496
to prevent people like me from doing what I'm trying to do.

509
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:21,254
Miss-

510
00:31:31,254 --> 00:31:34,381
I might feel a little uncomfortable about tracking my dad's cell phone

511
00:31:34,448 --> 00:31:36,250
if he hadn't done it to me first.

512
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,853
A hotel. Great.

513
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:42,501
Suddenly I'm feeling a little queasy.

514
00:31:43,187 --> 00:31:46,347
I'm sorry. We have no one under Mars or Fennel staying with us.

515
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:49,480
And trying all the Mr and Mrs Smiths is out of the question?

516
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:50,541
Thanks anyway.

517
00:32:21,312 --> 00:32:22,929
Okay, Dad, I get it.

518
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:24,101
You're happy.

519
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:30,128
Good morning.

520
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:33,435
It is good, isn't it.

521
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:35,734
Hey, Carmen!

522
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:37,905
Hi.

523
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:39,897
I was wondering if you were hungry.

524
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,870
No.

525
00:32:41,054 --> 00:32:43,440
'Cause I thought you might want to suck on my popsicle.

526
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:47,024
Tad pressed the button.

527
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:52,590
What if somebody catches us?

528
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,433
No one is gonna catch us.

529
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,451
No way!

530
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:58,810
Man you really did miss out. That Carmen is freaky.

531
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:02,743
Hey, what's wrong with you, man, where'd this come from.

532
00:33:11,644 --> 00:33:12,594
Hey.

533
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:16,910
I saw your car was still in the lot.

534
00:33:17,724 --> 00:33:20,939
I was waiting for the rest of school to leave so that I could…

535
00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:24,974
sneak home without being assailed with any frozen desserts.

536
00:33:25,158 --> 00:33:27,805
Although, I'm sure my parents have already seen the video by now,

537
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:30,892
so I'm not exactly sure where I'm planning to hide.

538
00:33:32,086 --> 00:33:34,130
Somewhere they don't have computers.

539
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:36,152
I can't believe he did it.

540
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:37,760
Imagine my surprise.

541
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,120
You know what? Screw it.

542
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:47,594
I'm still glad that I dumped that idiot loser… crapface.

543
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:52,014
I'd rather the whole world think I'm trashy

544
00:33:52,075 --> 00:33:55,373
than have a guy like Tad think he can push me around.

545
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:56,925
At least now it's over.

546
00:33:57,595 --> 00:33:59,903
No more waiting for the bomb to drop.

547
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:02,234
That's right.

548
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:04,281
No more waiting.

549
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:05,950
Time to strike back.

550
00:34:09,032 --> 00:34:11,183
Mutually assured destruction.

551
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:12,406
The honour's yours.

552
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:31,489
Thanks anyway.

553
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:33,931
You can't let him get away with it.

554
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:37,065
Tearing Tad down isn't gonna make me feel any better.

555
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:41,304
Carmen, I can't stress enough-

556
00:34:41,386 --> 00:34:45,277
Sorry, Veronica, I guess revenge just isn't my thing.

557
00:34:50,552 --> 00:34:52,799
What if somebody catches us?

558
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:55,175
No one is gonna catch us.

559
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:04,523
It's all fun and games until one of you gets my foot up your ass.

560
00:35:16,254 --> 00:35:17,528
Oh my god.

561
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:20,595
I remember those stars and Chinese lamps.

562
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:24,573
In fact, they're about the only things I remember from that night.

563
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:26,139
A year and a half ago.

564
00:35:26,555 --> 00:35:28,548
Shelly Pomeroy had a party.

565
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:39,161
Could it be the night Carmen gave her boyfriend a sex show

566
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:41,879
in the hot tub that she can't remember was the same night

567
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,630
that I was drugged and raped in a guest bedroom?

568
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:52,023
I know I should have told you.

569
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:55,248
No. Your life is your business.

570
00:35:55,438 --> 00:35:58,751
I just felt after a year of not knowing I wanted options.

571
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,961
If I ever decided to move on,

572
00:36:02,181 --> 00:36:06,409
serving notice is just a first step and if I think I might take another…

573
00:36:11,965 --> 00:36:13,952
No more surprises, I promise.

574
00:36:14,053 --> 00:36:16,948
I just want you to be happy, Dad,

575
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:20,757
and I realise that may involve surprises.

576
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:28,650
Roberto Nalbandion.

577
00:36:29,507 --> 00:36:31,272
Who's Roberto Nalbandion?

578
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:33,172
I have no idea.

579
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,953
Okay, forgive me if as of yet, I'm unimpressed.

580
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,767
I don't know who he is but I do know that someone purchased

581
00:36:38,814 --> 00:36:43,428
his Argentinean passport off of eBay and had it shipped to the airport at Marriott.

582
00:36:43,582 --> 00:36:44,990
Dad, this is Mac.

583
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:47,273
She knows her way around a computer. Mac, my dad.

584
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,204
- Hi. 
- Hi.

585
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:50,727
So. Argentina.

586
00:36:50,883 --> 00:36:52,879
Roberto Nalbandion.

587
00:36:53,536 --> 00:36:54,600
It's great.

588
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:03,745
So, the bounty on Duncan, what's my share?

589
00:37:04,028 --> 00:37:04,870
Eight,

590
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:06,550
ten.

591
00:37:06,805 --> 00:37:09,792
Ten, but you drive a hard bargain.

592
00:37:09,975 --> 00:37:11,194
I meant percent.

593
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:12,356
You'll get your cut.

594
00:37:12,888 --> 00:37:13,855
New question.

595
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:18,484
Is there anyway to figure out when a video was recorded on someone's cell phone?

596
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,050
Sure, every MPEG has an embedded time stamp.

597
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:23,088
Okay. Carmen's video.

598
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,033
I've got it up on the screen.

599
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:26,114
Sure. No problem.

600
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:38,258
It says the image was captured at 3:23am, December 7th 2003.

601
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:41,095
I can't believe that butthead sent it out.

602
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:46,926
What, does that date mean something?

603
00:37:47,012 --> 00:37:47,694
Nothing.

604
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:51,268
Only that Carmen and I don't remember the same night.

605
00:37:52,697 --> 00:37:54,493
No, I just have a meeting.

606
00:37:54,974 --> 00:37:57,801
Well, you have until 5:30 to decide chicken or fish

607
00:37:57,868 --> 00:37:59,948
otherwise you lose your right to complain.

608
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:00,874
Bye Keith.

609
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:08,702
You wanted to see me, Mr…

610
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:09,859
Clarence Wiedman.

611
00:38:10,617 --> 00:38:12,563
I'm with security here, Mrs Fennel.

612
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:14,877
I wanted to talk to you about Keith Mars.

613
00:38:15,256 --> 00:38:15,979
What?

614
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:18,767
I know you've been seeing Mr Mars for the past couple months.

615
00:38:19,484 --> 00:38:21,215
What you may not know;

616
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:27,016
he is a man with a known grudge against the Kane family and this company.

617
00:38:28,061 --> 00:38:32,383
I'm gonna have to ask you to stop seeing him if you wanna avoid problems with your job here.

618
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:38,404
Look, Mr Weed, or wh-whatever your name is.

619
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,976
I have been a perfect employee since the moment I stepped through that door

620
00:38:42,038 --> 00:38:46,713
and I have never done anything to raise questions as to my dedication to my job.

621
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:51,689
The idea that you can tell me what I can and can't do with my personal life…

622
00:38:52,262 --> 00:38:53,563
Well, Clarence…

623
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:56,907
Mrs Fennel. You know what this is?

624
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:03,374
This is an electronic eavesdropping device.

625
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:05,181
A bug.

626
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:10,087
I found it in that houseplant which has been in my office for the last several weeks.

627
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:12,412
You know who delivered it?

628
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:17,516
Your son, Wallace.

629
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,304
Like I said.

630
00:39:22,036 --> 00:39:25,846
You really might want to reconsider your relationship with Mr Mars.

631
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:31,268
An hour early to school is pretty brown-nosey, but even at Neptune

632
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:34,796
yachting is not a recognized excuse for a late English report.

633
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:38,687
How's it hangin', Tad?

634
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:42,444
Let me guess: uncomfortable?

635
00:39:45,124 --> 00:39:48,005
I guess you and Carmen got those bikers to put me up here.

636
00:39:48,604 --> 00:39:50,970
I had nothing to do with putting you up here.

637
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,800
But I might be convinced to help you get down.

638
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:57,048
What do you want from me, bitch?

639
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:59,597
You destroyed my life.

640
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:02,198
You took away the only person that I ever loved.

641
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:04,503
I don't recall forcing you to send that video.

642
00:40:04,598 --> 00:40:06,842
No, she did. She left me.

643
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:08,726
And what good did sending it do?

644
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,251
Who's gonna wanna touch her now?

645
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,917
You know, if I can't have her, no one can.

646
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:18,311
You are so lucky she has a better soul than I do

647
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:20,641
because I would have taken you down with me.

648
00:40:21,556 --> 00:40:24,670
So what are you gonna cut me down if I apologise, is that it?

649
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:26,462
Nope.

650
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:29,704
I just want a simple answer to a simple question.

651
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:34,020
Who gave you the rohypnol the night of Shelly Pomeroy's party.

652
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:37,604
Yeah, I know. You roofied your girlfriend.

653
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,476
"Class" with a capital "K".

654
00:40:40,747 --> 00:40:42,093
I don't remember.

655
00:40:42,313 --> 00:40:45,411
In about five minutes, people are gonna start showing up for school

656
00:40:45,483 --> 00:40:49,195
and unless you want your little business to be the first thing they see,

657
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:51,391
you're gonna tell me who gave you the roofies.

658
00:40:52,676 --> 00:40:54,269
There weren't any roofies.

659
00:40:56,014 --> 00:40:57,361
It was GHB.

660
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,394
It was Logan Echolls. He gave it to me.

661
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:10,392
Oh, thank you.

662
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:11,503
This might sting a bit.

663
00:41:13,828 --> 00:41:16,520
Look, Veronica. Come back here.

664
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:18,881
Veronica, please!

665
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,331
Don't do this.

666
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,457
Oh, this isn't over, Veronica Mars!

667
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:04,734
