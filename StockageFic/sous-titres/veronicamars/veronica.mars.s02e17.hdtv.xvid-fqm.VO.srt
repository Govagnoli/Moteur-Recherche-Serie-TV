1
00:00:00,538 --> 00:00:02,792
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:05,199
Why don't you do me
a favour and drop that knife.

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,945
You told the police
you couldn't identify the guy.

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,532
-I lied.
-Of course you did.

5
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:10,730
So how are we gonna
figure out who did it?

6
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:13,251
The one that did it is in business
with the Fitzpatricks.

7
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:15,030
Molly? Were you dating Felix?

8
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:16,997
My uncles and cousins
didn't know about us.

9
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:18,714
You killed Felix,
didn't you?

10
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:20,530
Before you think about
spreading it around,

11
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,740
I think you should see something...

12
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,413
that night you nearly
kicked curly's head in.

13
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:25,997
If we did our work right,
the stadium implodes.

14
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:28,410
I told you to take
that crate to section 11!

15
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,860
Is it just a coincidence
that Danny Boyd works here,

16
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:33,895
or do I add his name to the list
of bus-crash suspects?

17
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:36,294
All righty, citizens,

18
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:39,061
the big moment has finally arrived.

19
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:42,183
One lucky student will spend a week

20
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:45,502
interning at the mayor's office
as his honorary deputy,

21
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:47,387
and as a grand finale,

22
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:51,392
this lucky patriot will push
the plunger for the demolition

23
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:54,767
of old Shark field on saturday.

24
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:56,524
The grand-prize winner

25
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:59,911
of Woody Goodman's
freedom essay contest is...

26
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:02,246
Logan Echolls.

27
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,201
I'm sorry,
did someone say my name?

28
00:01:06,202 --> 00:01:07,374
For those interested,

29
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,445
the winning essay will
be on the board all week.

30
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:31,939
"Freedom"

31
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:33,172
That's what it's all about.

32
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:37,315
"But talking about it and being it...
that's two different things."

33
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:39,811
Phew. You came up all deliberate-like.

34
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:41,296
I figured you wanted
to be first in line

35
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:43,403
to ask me to the Sadie Hawkins dance,

36
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,285
not recite my prize-winning essay.

37
00:01:45,286 --> 00:01:46,629
Neither, actually.

38
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,063
I'm quoting "Easy Rider," which you may
remember making me watch last summer.

39
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:52,950
That's funny.
It sounds a lot like my essay.

40
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:54,515
Yeah, weird.

41
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:12,296
Sure, I mean, who doesn't use
algebra every day of their life, but

42
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:14,714
Felix, algebra 2?
Come on.

43
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:16,992
What am I still doing
even showing up here?

44
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:21,143
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:23,101
It's all coming back to me now.

46
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,693
Three months till summer,
then senior year.

47
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:28,920
After that,
v*monos, baby.

48
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:30,655
I got to pass the deuce first.

49
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:32,219
This will be your third try, right?

50
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,716
How bad you want out of here?

51
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:34,824
I got to graduate.

52
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:38,514
I know my grams is holding on just long
enough for me to cross that stage.

53
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:40,283
Right.

54
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:43,016
Okay, what kind of
grand plans you got, huh?

55
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,784
Miss James gave me some info
on trucking school.

56
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:48,125
Those guys make $40 an hour.
You know that?

57
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,700
That's enough to get married,

58
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:51,461
settle down,

59
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,267
crank out a couple shorties.

60
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:54,960
Wait, Felix, Felix.

61
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,081
Hold on, doggy.

62
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:59,871
Before you get all minivan on us,
you got to get a woman.

63
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:03,862
You ain't had a girlfriend longer
than a weekend, far as I know.

64
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:16,193
I heard the FBLA won the drawing
to host the Sadie Hawkins dance.

65
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:17,868
Dances are the best fund-raisers.

66
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,019
The band made, like,
3 grand at last year's.

67
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:22,696
This face right here...

68
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,490
my over-the-moon face.

69
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,878
Thinking of asking some special boy?

70
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,266
I'm flying solo
for the foreseeable future.

71
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,709
I'll be working it,
though...

72
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:33,703
You work it,
girlfriend.

73
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,009
...Taking keepsake couples photos.

74
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:42,516
What about you?
Anyone on your radar?

75
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:44,271
Well, I've got a dilemma.

76
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:49,485
I'm torn between this sweet band dork
and this all-hands nubian prince.

77
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:53,668
Ooh, tell me more about this band dork.

78
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:56,541
Oops.

79
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:58,383
You'll lose that hand.

80
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:00,560
Don't get between a man and his cake.

81
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:06,362
Uh, excuse me, guys.
I believe I'm getting the nod.

82
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:08,982
I need your help.

83
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,590
Ah, if I had 50 bucks
every time someone said that.

84
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:14,216
Look, I know it's
a drag being you, and...

85
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:17,153
No, seriously, I'm gonna need 50 bucks
if you expect me to keep listening.

86
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:21,769
Well, I'm banking on curiosity
getting the better of you.

87
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,087
All right, tell me.
Damn my curiosity!

88
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:42,182
Thumper killed Felix.

89
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:43,953
Okay.

90
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,939
If you know Thumper did it,
what do you need me for?

91
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:48,941
Well, I can't prove it...yet,

92
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:51,732
and Thumper has something on me.

93
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:53,511
There's this video on his cell.

94
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,014
Do go on.

95
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:56,732
I didn't exactly
tell you the whole truth

96
00:04:56,784 --> 00:04:59,221
about how I handled
the Curly situation.

97
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:00,155
Shocker.

98
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:02,889
I think that's scout's honor.
I mean, your fingers are...

99
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:04,476
Wait, not important,
moving on.

100
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:07,231
Which parts did you skimp on?

101
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:09,007
We did get an anonymous call...

102
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:11,184
not just me,
some of my boys, too...

103
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:12,421
all saying the same thing...

104
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:14,974
Curly sent the bus off
a cliff to take out Cervando

105
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:17,250
for hustling Lee and Fitzpatrick
out of a few grand.

106
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:20,100
It wasn't me.

107
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:24,352
I didn't kill your friend.
Those kids...

108
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:25,417
That's not what I hear.

109
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:27,227
I hear you took out
the bus to get Cervando.

110
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:30,864
It wasn't me.

111
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:32,835
I know who did it.

112
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,269
Yo!

113
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,297
You told me you didn't believe
Curly caused the bus crash.

114
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:49,195
I don't.

115
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:50,692
But you beat him anyway?

116
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:51,979
No, I saved his life.

117
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:54,797
My boys wanted to send him
off a cliff behind the road hog.

118
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:58,293
Don't suppose you noticed whether
Curly had my name written on his hand

119
00:05:58,294 --> 00:05:59,468
while you were...

120
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:00,801
...saving his life.

121
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:02,092
No, but...

122
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:04,686
the cameo he was wearing
looked a lot like you.

123
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,913
Thumper's gonna go down for what
he did to Felix one of two ways...

124
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,519
either the law's gonna handle it,
or I will.

125
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:15,859
If you want it done right,
then help me get the proof.

126
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:20,000
<i>A long time ago,</i>

127
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:23,166
<i>We used to be friends but I</i>

128
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:26,564
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

129
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:30,206
<i>Come on, now, sugar!</i>

130
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:32,590
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

131
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:36,185
<i>Just remember me when</i>

132
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:38,575
<i>We used to be friends</i>

133
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:40,826
<i>A long time ago</i>

134
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:43,380
<i>We used to be friends</i>

135
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:47,991
<i>Veronica Mars 2x17
Plan B</i>

136
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,101
How's your dad doing?

137
00:06:57,954 --> 00:06:58,925
Fantastic.

138
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:02,085
So good, in fact, they took him
off suicide watch yesterday.

139
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:05,795
Banner freakin' day in the Cook
household, let me tell you.

140
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:06,869
Is he getting better?

141
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,006
Slowly.

142
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:10,662
He's in no hurry.
Once the doctors clear him,

143
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:13,810
he moves from his guarded hospital
room to a cell at county jail.

144
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,642
So how you doing in that
great big house all alone?

145
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,673
Ah, the things you don't know about me.

146
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:25,347
When my mom started getting
wrinkles around her eyes

147
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:28,588
and she could see the end
of her modeling career coming,

148
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,370
her new career became
landing a wealthy man.

149
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,986
Single, wealthy men like to travel.
They like to party.

150
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:36,777
They don't like kids hanging around.

151
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:39,054
I was pretty much alone from age 11 on.

152
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:43,575
Being alone now kind of feels like
being back to normal.

153
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:45,202
Well, we should hang out.

154
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:48,755
Even superman would leave his fortress
of solitude from time to time.

155
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:50,797
I'd like that.

156
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,698
This is study hall.

157
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:56,912
Do you two know
what we do in study hall?

158
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,064
Give me a minute.
I think I know this one.

159
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:16,793
What are you doing?

160
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,155
No, I'm just standing here,

161
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:21,140
wondering what I've done
to make you ashamed of me.

162
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,212
It's the age thing,
isn't it...

163
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:29,342
No, me and my full blush of youth
and you and your advancing years.

164
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:33,677
I'm standing in the middle of the
hallway holding your hand, dorkwad.

165
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:37,246
You don't really want
to go to that thing.

166
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:38,769
Well, you know,
I'd like to be asked.

167
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,422
Fine.

168
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:45,433
Do you want to go
to the big dance, Cassidy?

169
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,400
Was that so hard?

170
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:49,620
Yes.

171
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:52,962
And if the dance blows half
as much as I'm guessing it will,

172
00:08:52,963 --> 00:08:56,160
we can cut out early and go straight
for the good stuff.

173
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:57,715
Oh, my.

174
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:00,336
I'm talking about Neptune's
best Pizza Quest '06.

175
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:02,677
You, get your mind out of the gutter.

176
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:09,122
Hey, I need a second.

177
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:12,398
I'm sorry, I can't be late
for my first day.

178
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,277
But call the county Courthouse,

179
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:17,308
ask for the assistant to the honorary
deputy mayor.

180
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:18,995
I need you to do something for me.

181
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:23,186
Veronica, ask not what
Logan can do for you,

182
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,748
but what you can do for Logan.

183
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,284
That's gonna get old real soon.

184
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:28,022
Let me know when that time comes.

185
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:29,455
Until then, you know me.

186
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:32,168
I'll just be speaking softly
and carrying a big stick.

187
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:35,183
God, you're a pest.

188
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:38,198
Tell me everything you remember
about the night Felix was killed.

189
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:40,568
You do know I've been cleared
of all charges, right?

190
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:44,192
The whole dead-Felix business
has lost its intrigue for me.

191
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,157
Once something stops
being important to me,

192
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:47,282
my memory gets a little fuzzy.

193
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:50,092
Wait. Who are you?

194
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,870
The murder is still unsolved.

195
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:54,522
And yet, somehow,
I sleep like a baby.

196
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:55,911
If Thumper did do it,

197
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:57,920
he's about to get away
with killing Felix,

198
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,930
framing you, taking over
the P.C.H. Bike club,

199
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:02,922
and cornering
the high-school drug trade.

200
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:05,327
We should invite him to speak at FBLA.

201
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,857
Follow the bouncing ball...

202
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,023
not my problem.

203
00:10:11,954 --> 00:10:14,863
You don't remember anything about
the guy who stopped and helped you...

204
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,317
the 911 caller?

205
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,560
Mexican dude driving a truck.

206
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:22,879
Oh, his truck had a bumper sticker.

207
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,508
It said, "how's my driving?
Call 1-800-eat..."

208
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:27,293
something.

209
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:28,777
Thanks.

210
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:32,878
Well, run along, deputy dog.
Go serve your community.

211
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,780
I think it was a San Diego
seafood truck.

212
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:39,888
I'd probably know him if I saw him.

213
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:44,953
father Fitzpatrick has blown
this way out of proportion.

214
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:46,069
<i>What do you intend to do about that?</i>

215
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,833
More law enforcement,
for one.

216
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,905
Property values will bounce back.

217
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:55,418
Excuse me.

218
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:57,642
Sir, your intern
from Neptune high school's here.

219
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:02,019
I got to run. Listen, the voters
will decide, okay? Got to go.

220
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,072
Bev, get some guys
from the newspaper over here.

221
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:09,239
Me with a high-school kid...
good P.R.

222
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,585
Lord knows I can use some.

223
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,524
Mr. Goodman,
Logan Echolls.

224
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:21,342
It's good to meet you, sir.

225
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:22,554
Aaron's son, right?

226
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,343
Great essay,
powerful stuff.

227
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:26,458
It came from the heart.

228
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,725
Cancel that last request I made.

229
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:30,509
All right, then.
First thing's first.

230
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,461
Let's make it official.

231
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:33,255
Bev, you got that bible handy?

232
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,838
-Your left hand, please.
-Yes.

233
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,382
That burns.

234
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:42,631
Just kidding.

235
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:43,779
I, Logan echolls,

236
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:46,319
do solemnly swear
to faithfully execute

237
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:48,717
the office of
honorary deputy commissioner

238
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,334
of Balboa County, California.

239
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:51,358
I do.

240
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,349
Now if you'll excuse me.

241
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:54,003
Where are you going?
I'm going to fire the sheriff.

242
00:11:57,523 --> 00:12:01,336
Let's save personnel changes
till after you've warmed up a bit.

243
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:04,215
Now,I'm sure you're aware
that I've introduced a bill

244
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,892
proposing the
incorporation of Neptune.

245
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:06,983
I'm glad you brought it up.

246
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:08,679
I'm backing the plan.

247
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:11,721
In fact, I'm throwing
my considerable weight behind it.

248
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:15,045
I say we take it a step further and
erect a wall around Neptune proper

249
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:16,484
keep the riffraff out.

250
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,357
You want me to visit some of
the local community centers,

251
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:20,092
-...sell them on it?
-Not quite yet,

252
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:21,354
but I appreciate the offer.

253
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,394
For now,

254
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:26,113
we just need this mail separated into
pro- and anti-incorporation piles.

255
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:29,035
Uh, isn't Beverly here a bit
more suited to this kind of thing?

256
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:30,600
I've got a letter opener
you can borrow.

257
00:12:30,703 --> 00:12:32,959
Beats pulling the drive-through shift
at Woody's burgers, right?

258
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:35,388
I wouldn't know... you're the one
who's served 20 billion.

259
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:44,299
Hello.

260
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:46,466
I believe Woody's expecting me.

261
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:50,022
Mister Goodman ?
Your 4 o' clock is here.

262
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:52,375
Logan?

263
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:56,806
That's honorary deputy county
commissioner Echolls to you.

264
00:12:57,332 --> 00:12:58,789
Keith, that you?
Come on in.

265
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:03,875
Keith, I want you to drop
your other cases

266
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:05,549
and focus all your energies toward

267
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:08,025
clearing the greatest shark
to ever put on a uniform.

268
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:10,689
Terrence broke into
his ex-girlfriend's family home.

269
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:14,123
The journalism teacher
who died in the bus crash...

270
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:15,174
that give you pause?

271
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:16,420
Not a moment's.

272
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,233
You know something
that makes you so certain?

273
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:20,202
I know the quality of his character.

274
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:26,653
Um... there's something you gentlemen
should probably see.

275
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:30,260
This DVD was in the stack of mail.

276
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,697
No return address.

277
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:35,068
That's inside my house.

278
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:37,556
I figured.
Watch.

279
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,857
Well, I don't know.
All the kids at school...

280
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:50,957
-Keith.
-Yeah, I'll look into this, as well.

281
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:56,303
So I'm guessing this goes
in the anti-incorporation pile.

282
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:03,926
So this is staking out, huh?

283
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:06,154
It looks sexier in the movies.

284
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:10,022
Did you hear anything from Hannah?

285
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:12,160
Does deafening silence count?

286
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:14,132
You know, I'm not sure,

287
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:17,224
but I think when they start
shipping your girlfriends off,

288
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:19,019
you're officially a bad boy.

289
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:24,363
Her dad and your dad should
get together and go bowling.

290
00:14:27,771 --> 00:14:28,957
There he is.

291
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:32,881
Excuse me.

292
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:35,835
Hi, um,
sorry to bother you.

293
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:38,371
We were hoping to ask
you about an incident

294
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:40,629
we think you witnessed last may...

295
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:43,286
on the Coronado bridge.

296
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,452
You might remember
helping my friend here.

297
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,883
If there was an incident,
I would remember it.

298
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:50,643
So your route has to take you
across the Coronado bridge.

299
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,998
You got the wrong guy.

300
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:53,682
-This is the guy, right?
-Yeah, that's the guy.

301
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:55,876
You know my schedule, huh?

302
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,252
You know where I live?

303
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:58,761
43rd and Euclid.

304
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,634
I got P.C.H.Ers riding up and
down my street day and night.

305
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:06,632
Now, if I was on the bridge that night
and if I saw what went down,

306
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:10,287
a guy like me who's got a wife
and a 5-year-old daughter

307
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:12,182
might think he's better off
keeping his mouth shut.

308
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:15,915
Well, covering your own ass has made
the last seven months of mine hell.

309
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,254
That's one way of looking at it.
Now, here's another.

310
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:21,962
If it was me who stopped, chased off
the bikers, and called 911,

311
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:24,811
then I guess I'd be
the guy who saved your life.

312
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,347
I was planning on sending
a fruit basket from prison.

313
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:30,338
A rich, white son of a movie star
getting convicted in Neptune?

314
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:32,994
I'd say your future's safe.

315
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:44,123
You find a witness?

316
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:46,890
Yeah, I found out he's as good
as no witness at all...

317
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:48,783
not a big fan of the P.C.H.Ers.

318
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:51,950
Yeah, their popularity's really gone
downhill without me.

319
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,219
By my count,
we got bupkes.

320
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,259
Count again.

321
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:57,829
I got another angle...
Molly Fitzpatrick.

322
00:15:58,061 --> 00:15:58,924
What's she know?

323
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:01,488
The Fitzpatricks were using
their plastic surgeon

324
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:03,266
to pin Felix's murder
on Logan.

325
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,982
You know what that says to me?

326
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,940
That we need tougher immigration laws?

327
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,457
No. Thumper did the deed, but
the orders came from his supplier.

328
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,899
My guess... it was a condition of them
doing business together.

329
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:14,729
Why kill Felix?

330
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,631
A while back, I found out Felix
and Molly had a thing.

331
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,192
It got serious...
sneaking around,

332
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:22,423
talking about a lifetime
of trucking their brains out.

333
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:24,184
Good Golly,
miss Molly.

334
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:25,488
They were in love.

335
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:28,063
Molly said if her family found out,
they'd kill them both.

336
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:29,642
Maybe they found out.

337
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:31,499
Maybe they were told.

338
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:36,153
This serves as a preemptive apology

339
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:38,072
for the conversation that's
about to take place.

340
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:41,345
Okay.
And...

341
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:46,848
Beaver and I occasionally,
you know, make out.

342
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:48,192
Mmm...

343
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:51,073
I made out once,
back in the day.

344
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:54,182
I think he had me pinned up
against a woolly mammoth.

345
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:57,986
So not that I'm an expert
in this sort of stuff, but

346
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,849
four months, typical high-school boy...

347
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,848
there should be some
under-the-bra action, no?

348
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:08,901
Let me consult my idiot's
guide to Wanton behavior.

349
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:12,393
Basically you're asking me because
I'm the sluttiest person you know?

350
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:15,681
Um, "slutty" is your word choice.
Mine was "worldly." Mmm.

351
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:18,922
So four months and nada?

352
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,952
-Hand holding, kissing.
-With tongue?

353
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:22,629
-Some tongue.
-Ass grabbing?

354
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:25,257
Helped me brush the dog hair
off my pants once.

355
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:26,859
So this is bad, right?

356
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,871
-Not so much bad as...
-It's weird.

357
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:32,473
Out of the ordinary, but
not necessarily in a bad way.

358
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:35,265
Okay, Veronica,
I really like him,

359
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:36,811
and we have so much fun together.

360
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,122
Then don't sweat it.

361
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:40,132
Yeah, but it's weird,
right?

362
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,264
Yeah, that's what I thought.

363
00:17:50,963 --> 00:17:52,079
What's this?

364
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:55,323
It was supposed to be
your future, wasn't it?

365
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:57,780
I found it in Felix's shop locker.

366
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,779
It must have been you
Felix was talking about

367
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,026
when he went on about driving
a semi, settling down,

368
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:05,012
and shooting out some rug rats.

369
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:09,990
Can't say for sure, 'cause he never
mentioned you by name.

370
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,201
It's too bad your family put him
in the ground, huh?

371
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:16,744
Felix got stabbed on the bridge.

372
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:18,648
Nobody in my family was even there.

373
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:20,738
It was Logan Echolls
or it was a P.C.H.Er.

374
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:22,434
It doesn't much matter to me which...

375
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:24,466
Same scum,
different wardrobe.

376
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:26,368
You know that plastic surgeon
dr. Griffith?

377
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:29,032
-Yeah.
-Strange, isn't it?

378
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:32,656
That the key witness was some guy
under your uncle's thumb?

379
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:37,700
What pisses me off is that I think
loving you cost Felix his life.

380
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,277
It seems to me you never
gave a damn about him.

381
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,718
-I loved him.
-No, I loved him!

382
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:45,151
And you know how you can tell?

383
00:18:45,577 --> 00:18:48,928
'Cause I'm the one who cares enough to
keep trying to find out who killed him.

384
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:55,163
Ooh, my god look at that girl, Charlie?

385
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,531
Did you see that ?

386
00:18:57,877 --> 00:18:59,752
Did you just check that girl out?

387
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:01,586
I was admiring her sweater.

388
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:04,479
Her second-skin,
rack-magnifying sweater?

389
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:06,108
I love the fabric.

390
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:07,964
It would be a good color on me.

391
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:09,430
I got news for you.

392
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,071
There's not a bad color for you.

393
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:15,109
I think you should ask her
where she got that from.

394
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,024
Oh, you think so, huh?

395
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:19,120
Anytime a hot girl wants
to wear a tight sweater

396
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:20,345
with a zipper down the middle,

397
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:21,685
I'm on board.

398
00:19:22,564 --> 00:19:23,826
<i>Ask her,
ask her, ask her.</i>

399
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:26,052
Hang on a sec,
Wallace.

400
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,486
Hi, Charlie. I'm Jackie.

401
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,474
Would you like to go to the dance
with me this weekend?

402
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,079
Uh...yeah.

403
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,404
Okay.

404
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:45,098
Hey, buddy.
I wouldn't.

405
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:20,687
Hey, there.

406
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:22,933
Bet I know what you need
right about now.

407
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:25,449
Come on.
Follow me.

408
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:28,719
You mind giving me a spot?

409
00:20:34,947 --> 00:20:35,927
One...

410
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:39,846
...two...

411
00:20:40,554 --> 00:20:43,144
so are you excited about
the demolition ceremony?

412
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,751
I'm nervous, actually.

413
00:20:47,022 --> 00:20:49,235
Someone's gonna have to walk me
through it step-by-step.

414
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:52,970
Now, uh,
push down, right?

415
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:57,668
I need...

416
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:05,618
Whoo, thank you.

417
00:21:09,656 --> 00:21:11,060
You know, looking at you

418
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:14,172
reminds me of the good old days
when I was young and ripped.

419
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:18,067
Bet you have some fun
with the ladies, huh?

420
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:21,720
Uh, the ones that survive.

421
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:30,263
<i>[Wild Seeds - "If I Were A Storm"]</i>

422
00:21:31,736 --> 00:21:33,581
Molly, get me a beer.

423
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,891
Okay.

424
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:39,146
Okay, you ready to lose
all that legitimate paycheck?

425
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,272
If I was you, Liam,

426
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:44,612
I'd save that smack
till I was behind the 8.

427
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:47,382
Oh, that is gonna hurt!

428
00:21:47,814 --> 00:21:51,030
Molly! You hear me, girl?
Bring me another beer.

429
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:53,045
What the hell's wrong with you tonight?

430
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:57,164
Sorry, uncle Liam.
I just... had a crap day.

431
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:02,356
Aw. Come tell
cousin Danny all about it.

432
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:04,260
I'm just pissed off
about Logan Echolls.

433
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:06,123
He's supposed to be in jail for murder.

434
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:08,911
What happened with
dr. Griffith's testimony?

435
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,288
Why did he lie?

436
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,042
Since when do you give a rat's ass
about dr. Griffith

437
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,428
or some dead biker?

438
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:20,097
Just... dr. Griffith...
I never trusted him.

439
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:21,232
You sure that's it?

440
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:24,794
You sure you're not pining...

441
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:26,571
over that half-breed cholo?

442
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:27,617
Don't call him that.

443
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:29,477
Why?
It's the truth.

444
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:32,337
Don't you dare cry for him.

445
00:22:33,263 --> 00:22:35,330
After all the things
he said he did to you?

446
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:37,815
You were his whore.

447
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:39,882
He did not care about you.

448
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:41,499
You were just a dumb, blond...

449
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:44,893
piece of tail he shot his mouth
off about to all his buddies...

450
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:47,811
how he plugged the good ship Molly-pop.

451
00:22:49,397 --> 00:22:50,446
Shut up!

452
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:52,692
Shut your mouth!

453
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:56,410
You should be glad he's dead.

454
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:59,648
If your dad wasn't in prison,

455
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,637
he'd have done it himself.

456
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:07,945
We take this to the sheriff,

457
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:10,922
Thumper might decide he wants
to show off his phone video

458
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:12,525
of you dispensing justice.

459
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,214
I'll risk it.

460
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:16,358
It'll be worth it to me

461
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,765
to see him go down for killing Felix.

462
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,930
So after all this,

463
00:23:19,974 --> 00:23:23,842
it looks like Felix got himself killed
bragging about his sex life.

464
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:25,048
Thumper made it up, okay?

465
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:27,759
You want to make a guy
like Liam lose his mind,

466
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:31,520
call a girl in his family a whore or
say that she'll let you do what any...

467
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,325
Eli.

468
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,417
Veronica.

469
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:40,274
Don't tell me...
lab report.

470
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:41,341
History exam.

471
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:42,972
Roman history.

472
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,812
Man, that Caligula.
Whew!

473
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:51,137
Sheriff will be in in a minute.

474
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:52,345
He's just running a little bit...

475
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:54,544
-Sacks!
-I guess he's here.

476
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,084
Someone took my parking space again.

477
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,876
Yeah, we got a letter.

478
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:02,192
The new deputy commissioner needs it.
I guess he's handicapped.

479
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,709
You, out.
Look up Eli Navarro.

480
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:11,785
There's got to be something outstanding
we can book him on.

481
00:24:11,998 --> 00:24:13,984
Oh if I did it ?
It's outstanding.

482
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,419
Still picking winners,
huh, Veronica?

483
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,547
I told you, when I start
picking losers, it's all you.

484
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:25,623
We were just in the neighborhood,
thought we'd drop by,

485
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:27,131
solve a murder case for you.

486
00:24:27,182 --> 00:24:30,282
Well, bonus points
for bringing the perp along.

487
00:24:31,163 --> 00:24:32,413
So who's the deceased?

488
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,047
Eduardo Orozco killed Felix.

489
00:24:35,478 --> 00:24:36,324
Thumper.

490
00:24:37,828 --> 00:24:39,854
He's got such a cute nickname.

491
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,236
He's dealing on campus
for the Fitzpatricks now.

492
00:24:43,572 --> 00:24:45,485
Here's proof that
they're working together.

493
00:24:45,773 --> 00:24:47,629
Liam Fitzpatrick practically confesses

494
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,795
to orchestrating Felix's death
on this tape.

495
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:53,276
<i>...How he plugged
the good ship Molly-pop.</i>

496
00:24:53,862 --> 00:24:55,278
<i>You should be glad he's dead.</i>

497
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:57,305
<i>If your dad wasn't in prison,</i>

498
00:24:58,068 --> 00:24:59,335
<i>he'd have done it himself.</i>

499
00:25:00,756 --> 00:25:04,529
Imagine how helpful that recording
would be if it was obtained legally...

500
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:06,739
not to mention an actual confession.

501
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,513
Note the absence of a silver platter.

502
00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:13,759
This was more to steer you in the
right direction than to, say,

503
00:25:13,857 --> 00:25:15,028
do your job for you.

504
00:25:16,008 --> 00:25:17,662
Actually, it was doing
your job for you.

505
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:21,311
Getting admissible evidence seems like
the least you can do.

506
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,844
There's less I can do...
trust me.

507
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:34,321
An 09er could come in here with
tea leaves and a ouija board,

508
00:25:34,377 --> 00:25:35,691
and they'd send out a S.W.A.T. Team.

509
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:37,708
It's time for plan "B."

510
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:39,116
Not just yet, dirty Harry.

511
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,191
In case you haven't noticed,
I ain't no mick cop.

512
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,960
Uh, okay.
Dirty Sanchez?

513
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:48,634
Just give me a few more hours.
There's a woman I can talk to,

514
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,254
and luck might be a lady tonight.

515
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:53,056
Patience ain't one of my virtues,
Veronica.

516
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:00,912
You got something for me already?

517
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,655
I might.
I need to get your input.

518
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,621
So you'll notice here when the camera

519
00:26:11,622 --> 00:26:14,493
passes by your living-room window
that it's dark outside.

520
00:26:14,544 --> 00:26:15,264
Okay.

521
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:18,574
And then here,

522
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:22,622
our mystery videographer
happened to get a shot of your clock.

523
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,852
It was approximately
5:30 in the evening.

524
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:28,476
All right.

525
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:30,426
So what does that mean?

526
00:26:30,427 --> 00:26:33,713
It means that this video had to be shot
in november or december

527
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:35,292
when the days were short,

528
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,332
long before you went public
with the incorporation initiative.

529
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:41,748
I think we've been barking up
the wrong tree.

530
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,522
Now, I guess my next question is...

531
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:46,325
got another tree?

532
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:50,619
Can you think of another reason someone
might have for wanting to rattle you?

533
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,087
Let me think about this.

534
00:26:56,722 --> 00:26:57,779
I'll get back to you.

535
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:58,830
Take your time.

536
00:26:59,814 --> 00:27:02,122

aren't easy to recall.

Veronica, this is my friend Charlie...
and his mom.

545
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:27,446
Hey, Charlie, how did you snag
the sexiest girl in school?

546
00:27:27,703 --> 00:27:30,204
She asked me,
and I said yes.

Ah, well, we always want the bad boys.

-Cheeky monkey!

Hi, welcome to the Sadie Hawkins

00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:46,247
This is cool, huh?

552
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,280
It would have been cooler
to have, like, a date,

553
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:51,160
but, actually, I'm kind of proud
of myself that I came alone.

554
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,759
It's kind of huge for me,

Hey, I'm having a moment here.
Use your imagination.

561
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:57,193
I'm 17 years old,
and my mom decides that last night

562
00:28:57,248 --> 00:28:59,716
was the perfect opportunity
to give me the sex talk.

563
00:29:02,137 --> 00:29:03,608
Wallace?

564
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,190
Yeah, my lecture was one word...

565
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,374
Don't.

566
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:11,916
So, my dad likes having you at work.

567
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,009
He says you've got potential.

568
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,016
I think that was the word.

569
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:18,734
Well, "potential" was the word,
but "underachiever" is the sentiment.

570
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:19,907
Ha ha.

571
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:23,046

572
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:24,054
Are you nervous?

573
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,799
What if you push the plunger
and nothing happens?

574
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,545
You mean, like,
if there were total silence?

575
00:29:30,547 --> 00:29:31,744
Let's try to imagine it.

576
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:43,654
I'm so sorry.
It's time to get charlie home.

577
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:46,962

I'm getting thirsty.
You want something to drink?

581
00:30:07,258 --> 00:30:08,054
Sure.

582
00:30:15,205 --> 00:30:17,195

584
00:30:20,144 --> 00:30:22,222
Yeah. I'm fine, why?

00:30:22,911 --> 00:30:24,069
Well, you blew out of there so fast.

586
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,474
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

587
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:28,186
Wow, that's really sweet of you to...

588
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,871
Easy, boy.
Don't you have a date?

589
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:36,376
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

590
00:30:36,684 --> 00:30:38,265
So are you saying you don't
have feelings for me?

591
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:39,731
Wallace,

592
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:41,468
the girl you're trying to make
me right now

593
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,800
is the girl that I'm trying
really hard not to be.

594
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:46,768
So knock it off.

595
00:30:56,085 --> 00:30:57,208

596
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:57,991

00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:00,751
-What are you...
-You were kissing her. Kate saw you.

00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,279

599
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:07,254

I was messed up.

Look, I'm so sorry.

604
00:31:16,696 --> 00:31:17,545

00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:09,508
Oh, sure.

694
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:16,604
Thanks.

695
00:36:16,946 --> 00:36:18,505
Now you can get back
to important business,

696
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:19,707
like clearing Terrence's name.

697
00:36:19,732 --> 00:36:20,690
Right.

698
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:22,149
Thanks, Keith.

699
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,679
Veronica... such a good kid,
coming in on your lunch period,

700
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,876
helping your dad.

701
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:27,828
-Bye, everybody.
-See you, Woody.

702
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:32,363
Can you hold my calls for a while?

703
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:48,468
Okay, you win.

704
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,370
Smart move talking to my wife.

705
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,284
Just so I've got this straight,

706
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:56,032
you saw one P.C.H.Er
stab another P.C.H.Er

707
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:57,941
and put the knife
in the Echolls kid's hand?

708
00:36:57,942 --> 00:36:59,383
Yeah, that's what I saw.

709
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,021
Could you identify the guy
if you saw him again?

710
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:04,338
I couldn't make out faces,

711
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:07,304
but the one that did the stabbing
took off on a red motorcycle

712
00:37:07,354 --> 00:37:09,264
with some kind of black spider
on the side.

713
00:37:09,724 --> 00:37:10,950
I know the bike.

714
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,177
Sacks, issue a warrant
for Eduardo "Thumper" Orozco.

715
00:37:15,178 --> 00:37:16,498
I want him tracked down now.

716
00:37:27,252 --> 00:37:29,237
She brings it on herself.

717
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:32,629
She'd have friends if she didn't act
like she's the most important person

718
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,655
wherever she is.

719
00:37:33,656 --> 00:37:35,244
Jane, Jackie didn't kiss me last night.

720
00:37:37,398 --> 00:37:38,389
I kissed her.

721
00:37:39,545 --> 00:37:40,938
She must have been coming on to you.

722
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:44,302
She wasn't.
I just kissed her out of nowhere.

723
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:46,761
I'm sorry.

724
00:37:47,024 --> 00:37:49,350
I don't want to hurt you,
but I got to be honest.

725
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:54,119
I still have feelings for her.

726
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:03,929
I broke up with Jane.

727
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,640
So, are you gonna ask me to sit down?

728
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,083
No.

729
00:38:14,234 --> 00:38:15,943
You can't sit here,
Wallace.

730
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:17,428
Do you not see that?

731
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:19,130
Why not?
I'm free now.

732
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,002
You know I like you.

733
00:38:21,322 --> 00:38:22,621
There's nothing stopping us.

734
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:25,428
If you sit here, it proves
that I'm the man-eating bitch

735
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:28,028
who snatched you from one
of the sweetest girls in school.

736
00:38:28,312 --> 00:38:29,778
I won't have that.

737
00:38:31,696 --> 00:38:33,135
Now go.

738
00:38:33,731 --> 00:38:35,145
Please, Wallace.

739
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,179
Leave.

740
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,497
Is it me?

741
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:54,937
No, it's the tater tots.

742
00:38:56,972 --> 00:38:58,303
Are you not attracted to me?

743
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,043
Wait, what?

744
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:02,532
Why don't you want to,

745
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,375
you know, like,

746
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:06,328
do stuff?

747
00:39:06,768 --> 00:39:08,206
Can we please not talk about this here?

748
00:39:08,286 --> 00:39:09,932
We have to talk about it sometime.

749
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:13,011
I get nervous, too.

750
00:39:13,826 --> 00:39:15,483
Like when we're just
hanging out, it's...

751
00:39:15,534 --> 00:39:17,218
totally comfortable and cool,

752
00:39:17,284 --> 00:39:19,557
but then it feels like
there's all this pressure, and...

753
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:21,783
I don't know what I'm doing,
neither.

754
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:23,611
I know what I'm doing.

755
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,696
I'm not saying you don't.

756
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,492
Well, you know,
it sounded like you were.

757
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:30,654
I'm saying I don't.

758
00:39:31,174 --> 00:39:35,177
So if you don't either,
or you feel nervous or...

759
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:36,821
we have to stop talking about this.

760
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:39,061
Veronica says that all guys
move at different speeds

761
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:40,499
and that this could just be...

762
00:39:40,575 --> 00:39:42,067
You talked to Veronica about me?

763
00:39:42,068 --> 00:39:43,374
No. I mean...

764
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:44,235
What did you say to her?

765
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:46,089
Nothing.
It was more about me.

766
00:39:46,132 --> 00:39:49,433
I wanted to make sure that
I wasn't doing something wrong.

767
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,712
Well, you weren't.

768
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:53,639
But you are now.

769
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:58,321
Good luck getting laid.

Hey Wood.
Woody?

780
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:54,386
Yeah. Pardon me.

781
00:40:54,992 --> 00:40:57,404
There's a motorcycle chained up
inside the stadium.

782
00:40:57,452 --> 00:40:58,652
It's gonna get turned into dust.

783
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,698
Is everyone out?

784
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:02,074
We've blown the horn a dozen times.

785
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:03,544
I had the boys do a walk-through.

786
00:41:03,801 --> 00:41:05,784
How long would it take to unlock it
and get it out of there?

787
00:41:06,123 --> 00:41:08,445
Uh... 20, 30 minutes.

788
00:41:09,638 --> 00:41:11,237
Then someone's losing a motorcycle.

789
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,199
This field has seen a long
and storied history.

790
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:15,525
Dad!

791
00:41:16,364 --> 00:41:18,278
Hurry up!
They're about to blow up Shark Field.

792
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:23,701
...11th inning in a 9-8 victory
for a packed house of 50,000 fans.

793
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:53,275
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

794
00:41:54,486 --> 00:41:57,391
It's been a long, long time
since my last confession.
