1
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:11,535
Wake up!

2
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:18,923
I've spent the last forty minutes listening to Logan dry-heave so you can buy a deformed pinata?

3
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,863
Dude, everything was closed. It was the cheapest souvenir I could find.

4
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,433
I'll say it one more time.

5
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,678
Juanita, from the Hot Tamale: Ay, ay, ay.

6
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:36,619
Whoa, what'd I tell you about drool on the leather? Dad's very strict about the car.

7
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,889
He's the only one allowed to dry-heave in it.

8
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:45,467
Alright.

9
00:01:46,547 --> 00:01:48,027
Have we had our fill of Tijuana?

10
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:49,137
- No. 
- Yes.

11
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,660
- No, no thanks. 
- Senor?

12
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,530
These border checkpoints, man, they always freak me out.

13
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,630
Maybe you shouldn't volunteer for the full-cavity search.

14
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:11,489
Morning.

15
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:12,558
Morning, sir.

16
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,630
You, ah, fellas have a good time in Mexico?

17
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:16,665
Yes, sir.

18
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:21,126
You wanna go ahead and hand over your contraband?

19
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:28,595
It works sometimes. Pop the trunk.

20
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:35,800
Anybody else hungry?

21
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:37,787
- Sure. 
- Yeah.

22
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:42,037
I can't believe you're calling me a wuss. I'm serious. You're the guy that can't close the deal.

23
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:43,761
Dude, what are you talking about?

24
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:46,583
I'm talking about that girl. That girl, Esmerelda.

25
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:50,290
The deal was closed back in VIP, my brother, make no mistake.

26
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,120
No way.

27
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,659
Did you wash your hands?

28
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:55,897
Thank you.

29
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:58,360
I got this, boys, let's roll.

30
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:01,422
Settle something for us, partner.

31
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:06,870
Didn't Luke look scared last night when that senorita started working her milkshakes on him?

32
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:10,542
That's great. That's adorable, You're a good man, thank you.

33
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:14,064
I wasn't scared. I was concerned.

34
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:16,813
Ah, yeah. You never saw a girl take a shot glass like that before.

35
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:20,679
Isn't this where we parked? Tell me that this isn't where we parked.

36
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:25,380
Please, someone tell me that you can see my father's car and this heart attack I'm having now is for nothing.

37
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:30,392
I don't know. Maybe it's like Brigadoon.

38
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:33,577
Come back in a hundred years and it'll be right back in this spot.

39
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:34,483
Troy!

40
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:37,105
Did you lock it?

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,557
Did I lock it?

42
00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:44,592
What's your problem? It's not even your ass on the line.

43
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:46,527
Yeah I know.

44
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:48,830
This just...

45
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:52,001
really sucks, man.

46
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:54,023
Wow, man, that's profound.

47
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:58,246
My parents come back in five days. If the car's not back before my dad is,

48
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,626
I'll be singing hymns and doing rosary beads faster than you can say The Passion.

49
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:07,775
Dude! Where's your car?

50
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:10,888
Sorry.

51
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:15,170
Ah, your monkey's gonna have to ride in the back.

52
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:16,420
Nice car.

53
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:19,250
That must have been a huge cereal box.

54
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,870
Now let's let that go. Cherish these moments,

55
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:26,843
because they will probably be the last ones that we spend together.

56
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:30,356
Hey. I don't mind dating a guy that rides a bike.

57
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,703
How do you feel about dating a guy who's being sent to Catholic school in Albuquerque?

58
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:15,856
Thanks for the ride.

59
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,172
Does this mean you're gonna play nice now?

60
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:21,861
Walk in front of the car. We'll see.

61
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,906
Can I stay in your guest house? I just don't wanna wake my parents up this early.

62
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:32,543
- I have a brilliant idea. 
- Does it involve a time machine?

63
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:37,039
Why don't I make some phone calls and see if I can track down the car?

64
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:41,447
I appreciate it, but I think this is even beyond your superpowers.

65
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,166
Haven't you heard? I've got friends in low places.

66
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,788
Look, I can't report the car stolen because my Dad thinks it's still safely tucked in the garage.

67
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:53,158
Which means I can't get the anti-theft homing device activated.

68
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:56,082
It's probably on a cargo ship to Jamaica.

69
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:59,927
And my dad is going to send me away. Then he's going to track me down and he's going to kill me.

70
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:01,760
Not if he doesn't find out.

71
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:04,127
Let's go back to your house.

72
00:06:04,582 --> 00:06:06,839
And take my mind off my problems?

73
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:09,215
And get details on the car.

74
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:12,768
Model, license number, VIN...

75
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:16,205
How do you make VIN sound so hot?

76
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:21,084
You're going to find Troy's stolen car over the internet?

77
00:06:21,477 --> 00:06:25,497
You'd be surprised what one can find with a few nimble keystrokes.

78
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:29,189
Alright, then, Velma, why don't you see what you can find on, say, me?

79
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,529
It's Daphne, thank you very much.

80
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:34,360
What's that?

81
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:40,219
If you're a P.I. with a password, this is the gateway to many-a skeleton-filled closet.

82
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:43,286
Arrests, divorces, bankruptcies.

83
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:48,600
Rut-roh! Somebody got their license suspended last year!

84
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,927
I got it back. Bet you it doesn't say that!

85
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:55,596
Well, if I'm Daphne, what does that make you? Fred?

86
00:06:55,995 --> 00:07:01,826
Oh, no. If I gotta be one of those white boys, I gotta be Shaggy all the way, baby.

87
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:03,520
Shaggy's got mad flava.

88
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:07,680
Aw, you still have a subscription to Mad Magazine?

89
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:10,110
You're all about the flavor.

90
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:12,712
- Hey, guys. 
- Hi.

91
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:18,093
Hey, help me out. So, for my Dad's birthday, I'm thinking... rock climbing?

92
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:19,851
Because he loves heights?

93
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:22,998
Not so much, but keep thinking outside the box. I like it.

94
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,287
And don't wait on me for dinner. I'll probably get take-out from the Italian place.

95
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,478
Luigi's? Will you get me some lasagna?

96
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,681
Some lasagna?

97
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:33,717
I'm just saying, the last time we went to Luigi's, you ate your weight in manacotti.

98
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:36,492
And now your birthday will be spent skydiving.

99
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:38,208
Alone.

100
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:44,249
Hi,  buddy! Hi. We'll go out in a minute.

101
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:50,828
Hi, Keith, it's me. I might be a little late for dinner since I came into work--

102
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:54,940
Oh. Wait a minute. I'm sorry, I was gonna call your cell.

103
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:05,027
Hi, you've reached Rebecca James and the counseling office at Neptune High School. I'm away--

104
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:10,342
You know those people who can predict when change is coming in their life?

105
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,663
I'm not one of them.

106
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,395
Change has a way of just walking up and punching me in the face.

107
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,740
I love the effort.

108
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:21,161
I mean, look at this guy. He's really working. You're pushing through the pain, man.

109
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:27,475
Nobody's kicking sand in your face. You look a little tired there, Tiger, so I'll tell you what.

110
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,131
Tell  me where my package is and I'll help you lighten that load.

111
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:36,005
It's in a friend's car. I'll have it for you tomorrow.

112
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:42,241
Okay, I'll tell you what. You got until nine a.m., otherwise I'm gonna hunt you down

113
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:47,553
and the closest thing you're gonna come to playing baseball is me shoving a bat up your ass.

114
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:01,649
- Morning, honey. 
- What'cha doin'?

115
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:04,930
I figured I'd put the rest of your mom's stuff in storage.

116
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:07,413
I don't think we need the reminders anymore, you know?

117
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,251
Yeah.

118
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:12,129
You wanna take a look?

119
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,299
Not so much, no.

120
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:19,671
Well, I'm gonna leave it here for now. I've got an eight o'clock.

121
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:28,642
So, you and Miss James, huh? I wouldn't have pegged that one.

122
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:35,232
Well, we only went out a couple of times. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

123
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:40,931
So don't. I get it. Companionship. Needs. Yada, yada, yada. It's fine.

124
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:43,512
I'm sorry you didn't hear about it from me first.

125
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:46,250
Don't sweat it. You know how many things I don't tell you?

126
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:48,154
I'm kidding.

127
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:52,421
It's cool. Just next time, could you shoot for an actual teacher?

128
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:55,344
Because this has no potential benefit to my grade point average.

129
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,577
Sure you feel okay about this?

130
00:09:58,052 --> 00:09:58,948
Yes.

131
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:00,230
Good.

132
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:01,651
I like her.

133
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:03,568
Cool.

134
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,676
Have a nice day.

135
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,423
Peace.

136
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,294
The best way to dull the pain of your best friend's murder

137
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:34,106
is to have your mother abandon you as soon as possible.

138
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:37,556
It's like hitting your thumb with a hammer, then when it's throbbing so badly

139
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:41,083
you don't think you'll survive, you cut the damn thing off.

140
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:45,794
When my dad implicated the much beloved Kane family in Lilly's death,

141
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,502
I was willing to stand by him and lose everything else.

142
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:51,960
Mom? Wasn't.

143
00:10:56,332 --> 00:10:58,376
A safety deposit box key?

144
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,320
Thanks everybody! Don't forget, interviewing exercise tomorrow.

145
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,170
Hey. You're helping Troy find his dad's car, right?

146
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,270
You're sweating on me.

147
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,258
Look, I need your help.

148
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:25,487
There's kinda more to this car thing than the car.

149
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:30,961
There was a pinata full of steroids in the backseat.

150
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:34,924
I did a run for Hank Zigmund. He owns the Zig-Zag Sports Club.

151
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,301
I wanted to get pumped for Varsity baseball. I was pretty much down for whatever.

152
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:45,154
Including shrunken testicles and acne scars. Well, speaking for the women of America: good plan.

153
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:48,241
Wait. What did Troy and Logan know about this?

154
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:49,695
Nothing. I swear.

155
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:54,412
Yeah, alright. Logan knew, but he wasn't in on it.

156
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:57,798
It doesn't matter, anyway. I don't help dealers find their lost products.

157
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,530
Look, don't think of it like that, alright?

158
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:05,088
Think of it like you're saving my life, okay, the guy is built like a truck!

159
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:07,285
He will break one of my limbs.

160
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:12,968
If I were to help you, you would have to return the steroids and get your money back

161
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:15,410
and then return the cash, not the drugs.

162
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:18,293
Yeah, I'll do whatever.

163
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:23,972
I'll figure something out. Just lay low.

164
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:28,888
Hi, may I help you?

165
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:33,511
Hi. My mom died last year, and I just found this.

166
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:48,124
All this time, I've been thinking mom bolted because she couldn't handle losing everything.

167
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:50,956
Maybe she just couldn't handle losing me.

168
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:07,434
Looks like they used a 300mm on this one. Not bad. Definitely the work of a pro.

169
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,499
A pro who knew my schedule quite well last year.

170
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:14,694
Judging by my lack on an eight man, twenty-four hour security detail,

171
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:18,806
I'm guessing Dad hasn't had the pleasure of viewing this little slideshow.

172
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:21,158
Hi!

173
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:22,381
Hello.

174
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:25,438
- Hey. 
- Hi.

175
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,845
- I thought-- 
- I'm guessing I'm early.

176
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:29,249
- No, it's fine. 
- Am I? I'm sorry. I guess I'm just anxious.

177
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:30,271
- Hi. 
- Hi.

178
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,089
Hi.

179
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,761
Umm, Veronica, Rebecca wanted to stop by.

180
00:13:35,658 --> 00:13:39,283
And just say hello. Outside of school.

181
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:42,421
I'm sure this is a little weird for you. So...

182
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:49,195
Well, this is a little weird, but you two dating isn't. Um, I'm fine. No worries.

183
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,891
- Well I thought-- 
- And I agree.

184
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,351
--that if you had the chance to talk, things would seem a little less awkward.

185
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:59,543
And are you starting to see the Catch-22 inherent in the plan?

186
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,153
As a matter of fact, I am.

187
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:08,382
Okay, well, um, is there anything I can do that would make things easier for you?

188
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:11,035
Can you get me out of fifth period bio?

189
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:17,255
So far it's been a whole lotta brick walls, but I talked to my buddy Earl yesterday at the impound yard.

190
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:21,075
What do I love more? That you have a buddy named Earl or that he works at the impound yard?

191
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:23,912
I'm guessing both. No sign of the Beemer.

192
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:27,388
But he can get you a great deal on a Good Times van.

193
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,818
I'll pass that onto my dad when he gets back. Maybe it'll take his mind off of loading his gun.

194
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:35,642
- I dig this song. 
- Yeah, me too.

195
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:37,126
Here's a thought.

196
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:43,103
If Tijuana was Logan's idea then stealing the car could've been the master plan.

197
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,903
It was more of a meeting of the minds, if you will.

198
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:51,207
Ah. So what was on the menu for this night of grand debauchery?

199
00:14:51,802 --> 00:14:57,213
Let's see. From eight to nine, we brainstormed on how to overthrow Kim Jong Il.

200
00:14:57,404 --> 00:15:00,306
From  nine to ten, we deleted the records of the black voters of Florida.

201
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,759
And after that was all donkey shows.

202
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:04,721
- So the usual? 
- Pretty much.

203
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,734
Anything else?

204
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,396
If you wanna ask something, you just ask.

205
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:18,613
Okay. Did you meet anyone odd, or were you followed? Did you see any suspicious activity?

206
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:21,428
How about all of the above? Have you ever been to Tijuana?

207
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:24,289
I'm not looking for DNA samples.

208
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:28,694
It's just the more information I have about the car, the better chances of you finding it.

209
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:31,234
I know.

210
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:32,790
Sorry.

211
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:49,559
So you think they're going to turn the Beacon system on just because you ask sweetly?

212
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:51,264
Well, we've tried everything else.

213
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:54,762
Just watch a master at work, alright? This is what I do.

214
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:00,558
Hi!

215
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,223
Um, I'm the personal assistant to Lawrence Vandergraff. He's freaking out.

216
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,545
He thinks his device is broken and he wants to run a diagnostic on his BMW.

217
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:11,505
Here's the VIN number.

218
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:13,472
Please tell me you can do this.

219
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:16,215
Pretty please? Cherry on top?

220
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:19,166
It's not really procedure...

221
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,822
Well, can it be our little secret?

222
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:26,892
I've worked for the guy for two weeks and he already thinks I'm a ditz.

223
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:31,686
Okay then. Super Roger to the rescue.

224
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:40,598
Roger. What are you doing?

225
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,852
Um, a simple diagnostic. This young lady works for--

226
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:46,477
Has the car been reported stolen?

227
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:48,115
Oh, not exactly.

228
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:51,521
We never activate Beacon unless the car is reported stolen.

229
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,224
Hey, can you pick me up tomorrow?

230
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,481
- Yeah. 
- Good, good.

231
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,977
You better run, you punk bitch!

232
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:52,632
Time for a chat?

233
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:57,230
Well. You'd think if hell froze over, maybe it would be on the news.

234
00:17:57,521 --> 00:18:00,615
I just wanna hear more about the steroids you bought last weekend.

235
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,427
You mean the steroids Luke bought.

236
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:07,379
Wow, you suck at this Nancy Drew stuff. You should get a new hobby.

237
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,191
So you knew he was doing it.

238
00:18:09,374 --> 00:18:11,413
You actually think that I would tell you anything?

239
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,242
I guess we're done here, Officer.

240
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,991
What's up, T?

241
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:28,659
Hey Gorgeous.

242
00:18:29,636 --> 00:18:30,762
That guy bothering you?

243
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,006
What guy?

244
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:48,929
Alright, where is your sister?

245
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:52,453
- I don't think we have one. 
- Oh, hi! Um...

246
00:18:58,123 --> 00:19:02,643
- You didn't give Backup human food, did you? 
- Oh, no, no! I just found his happy spot, that's all.

247
00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:07,088
So, um, another case of bad timing. Your dad went out for groceries,

248
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:09,149
'cause I'm making dinner for both of you tonight.

249
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:14,287
- So, uh, how was your day? 
- Fine. How was yours?

250
00:19:14,373 --> 00:19:19,504
It was excellent, thank you. I know you guys like Italian food, so I am making fettucine

251
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:21,518
and for dessert, guess.

252
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:25,999
- No idea. 
- Waffles and ice cream. That's your favorite, right?

253
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:29,641
I put this sauce on top of vanilla ice cream...

254
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,716
So, when are we gonna cook for your boy?

255
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:34,450
We're Mars women. Should we play to our strengths?

256
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:36,717
And who says there's a new boy?

257
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:40,614
Don't even try that. No, wait a minute. Let me guess. Um...

258
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,589
Garret Fisher? Kenny Houseman?

259
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:45,780
- Have we met? 
- Thank you!

260
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:51,146
- Um... Travis Kittlemeyer. 
- Ooh, I think he'd rather be dating Kenny Houseman.

261
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:54,117
- Okay. Then Boris-- 
- Okay!

262
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,825
It's Duncan Kane.

263
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:00,532
The waffle's burning.

264
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:06,942
Oh! Oh, god, I am so sorry! It just slipped out of my hands.

265
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:07,900
It's alright.

266
00:20:09,365 --> 00:20:11,976
- Hey, how's it going in here? 
- Look at this. I'm a klutz.

267
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:15,771
Oh, that was ancient anyway. Don't even worry about it.

268
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:19,079
I really appreciate you doing this, but I actually can't stay for dinner.

269
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,070
- Really? 
- Why not?

270
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,388
I told a friend I'd meet him at the Sac and Pac. It's a school project.

271
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,341
Oh. Well, I'll ask first next time. Make sure you're available.

272
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:30,860
Thanks for cooking. I'll try the pasta when I get home.

273
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:32,084
Which won't be too late.

274
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:33,615
Have a good night.

275
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:50,219
Angel. How's business?

276
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:58,719
This is Veronica. She's the girl that got me out of juvie. I told you about her.

277
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:02,581
Look, she's looking for a car. A green BMW 740i.

278
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:04,007
Should've come through here a couple days ago.

279
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:18,354
Ya, I hear you.

280
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:22,882
Alright.

281
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:27,065
Did you ask him about the pinata?

282
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,811
Oh yeah, one more thing. Uh, did you happen to see a pinata?

283
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,505
- So, the car-- 
- Was chopped.

284
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:41,674
Your uncle won't say for who, but the papers are in order. Blah, blah, blah.

285
00:21:41,793 --> 00:21:45,319
Please tell me you know where Mario lives, because we need to get that pinata right away.

286
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:47,414
Baby, I'll buy you a pinata.

287
00:21:48,243 --> 00:21:50,507
Will you buy me a pinata full of steroids?

288
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:53,210
I've only been here once.

289
00:21:53,748 --> 00:21:56,563
Uh, maybe that one. Where the balloons are.

290
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:05,468
Yeah, this has to be it.

291
00:22:07,654 --> 00:22:09,365
Stop! Stop!

292
00:22:26,617 --> 00:22:29,077
Sorry. Sorry.

293
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:40,224
- Am in trouble? What? God! 
- We need to talk.

294
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:42,575
Alright. But does it have to be next to the feminine hygiene machine?

295
00:22:42,683 --> 00:22:47,362
Get over it. Look, I found the pinata and it is not full of steroids.

296
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:50,951
You're out of options. If you want Ziggy off your back, you're gonna have to buy him off.

297
00:22:51,777 --> 00:22:54,593
Veronica, you don't understand. If I go to him without any steroids,

298
00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:57,480
cash or no cash, he's gonna hurt me. Bad.

299
00:22:57,587 --> 00:23:00,722
Well. You let me worry about that. You worry about getting the money.

300
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:04,822
Yeah,  how? You think I've got eight grand stashed away in my other wallet?

301
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:05,960
Figure it out!

302
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,372
Mom, what are you doing here? Where are we going?

303
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:25,236
I just thought it would be nice to spend some time together. I thought we could go visit Aunt Sheryl.

304
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:27,343
In Palm Springs? Mom, I can't go to Palm Springs.

305
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:30,069
I have a history test next period and a Spanish project due.

306
00:23:30,146 --> 00:23:33,303
Honey, please. Don't make this hard. Just come with me, okay?

307
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,297
Three days later, she was gone.

308
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:41,306
At the time, I thought it was just one more on the growing list of odd things my mom was doing.

309
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:43,983
I chalked her nerves up to the vodka.

310
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:46,497
But now I think she really was scared.

311
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:58,177
People rarely cut all their ties, even when they try.

312
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:01,453
If she's out there and these untraceable, disposable cell phones

313
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:04,572
I'm sending to Mom's closest friends and family reach her,

314
00:24:04,674 --> 00:24:07,198
maybe she'll realize it's safe for her to call me.

315
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:09,492
It's my version of a message in a bottle.

316
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:20,071
One more hour and this might actually constitute a walk of shame.

317
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:25,190
Let's say I'm gonna play the dad card and go to bed.

318
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:26,932
That alright?

319
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:29,063
Actually, I need your help.

320
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:30,976
What's up?

321
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:35,902
Troy got his dad's car stolen on his way back from Tijuana,

322
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,069
and we're trying to find it before his dad gets back

323
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:42,011
so he's not shipped off to boarding school in Albuquerque.

324
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:45,729
He's important to you, isn't he?

325
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:47,136
Yes, he is.

326
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:52,252
And I need you to do some of that voodoo that you do so well.

327
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:59,742
I'll be nice to your boyfriend if you be nice to my girlfriend.

328
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,675
Veronica.

329
00:25:06,062 --> 00:25:06,778
Deal.

330
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:09,502
Good morning.

331
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:15,546
Good night.

332
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,447
- Can I help you? 
- James Anderson, head of security for L.T. Vandergraff.

333
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:27,537
- Sorry, I'm not sure I-- 
- Do you know who Mr. Vandergraff is?

334
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,649
You will when you're named in the lawsuit he'll file against your employer.

335
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:32,745
Now I know you value him as a client.

336
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:36,503
He really values this car, so we need to run a drill.

337
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,502
You look like a smart lady, do yourself a favor and turn his system on now.

338
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:46,712
This is insane.

339
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:50,035
I mean, two thousand bucks with four bids?

340
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,077
These people have no idea what a Barry Bonds ball's worth.

341
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:57,035
No, it's classic bidding strategy. They'll wait 'til the end of the auction.

342
00:25:57,128 --> 00:25:58,382
Try hitting refresh.

343
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,850
Classic bidding.

344
00:26:01,612 --> 00:26:04,367
See, there you go. $2800, we're almost there.

345
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,071
No, we're not almost there!

346
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:12,816
I can't do this. I mean, you have no idea what I went through to get this ball.

347
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:16,523
You have no idea what it's going to be worth when he retires.

348
00:26:16,795 --> 00:26:20,123
Luke. A ball, or your life.

349
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:22,406
You do the math.

350
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,455
- It's a ball! 
- Yeah.

351
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:30,010
What are you doing after school?

352
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:32,698
Wanna come over and play detective?

353
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:35,120
How are you so laid-back about all this?

354
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:38,105
I mean, if we don't find this car, we're done.

355
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:42,042
This? Over.

356
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,848
Does that not scare you?

357
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:48,714
Yes, it does. It's scares the hell out of me.

358
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:50,300
Then why do you seem so--

359
00:26:51,515 --> 00:26:54,285
Let's just say that you've been told you have seventy-two hours to live.

360
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,873
How do you spend them?

361
00:26:56,231 --> 00:26:59,011
You can dig through medical texts looking for a miracle cure,

362
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:01,961
or you can make those seventy-two hours the best three days of your life.

363
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:04,489
And I choose sexy fun time.

364
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,148
Well, I choose a miracle cure.

365
00:27:07,255 --> 00:27:08,520
I don't get something.

366
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:12,847
Why are your parents sending you off to prison school in Albequerque?

367
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:16,783
Seriously. What's wrong with a good old-fashioned grounding?

368
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,200
I'll get them to call you. Get some parenting advice.

369
00:27:20,654 --> 00:27:21,679
Happy to help.

370
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:30,471
Remember, start with light, easy questions first. Let your subject get comfortable.

371
00:27:30,604 --> 00:27:34,091
So, Ms. Mars. How do you respond to the rumors that your boyfriend

372
00:27:34,157 --> 00:27:36,988
hooked up with strippers in Tijuana last weekend?

373
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:41,038
Ms. Banks. Have you decided which parent you're going to live with after the divorce?

374
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:45,945
And if I may, a follow up: can you believe your father's choice in mistresses?

375
00:27:48,243 --> 00:27:51,844
Veronica, I need to speak with you after class, please.

376
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:54,700
You look ready for a fight.

377
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:58,412
I get that a lot. I guess it's just my usual expression.

378
00:28:01,407 --> 00:28:03,538
How do you think Ashley's going to sleep tonight?

379
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:07,378
I didn't tell her anything she didn't already know, deep down.

380
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:08,310
Maybe.

381
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:13,416
But sometimes the lies we let ourselves believe are for our own good.

382
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:19,538
You coming?

383
00:28:19,995 --> 00:28:22,299
In a minute. Research.

384
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:28,449
Poor Ms. Dent. She can't see the big picture yet.

385
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,216
Love is an investment. Information is insurance.

386
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:37,159
With someone who's heart has already been crushed, I say you can't be too careful.

387
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,513
Hey, there you are.

388
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:55,539
I wanted to ask you a favor.

389
00:28:56,057 --> 00:29:00,367
I know you got something planned for my birthday, but I was hoping it would be fine

390
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,511
if, you know, before we went to do whatever you got cooked up that we go to Rebecca's house

391
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:06,933
and have her cook us dinner because she's a great cook.

392
00:29:07,284 --> 00:29:08,858
I think you should look at that.

393
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:25,970
- Did you know she was still married? 
- I did.

394
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,478
I'm still married, Veronica.

395
00:29:29,595 --> 00:29:32,539
And that she was arrested for passing bad checks?

396
00:29:35,763 --> 00:29:37,496
When she was twenty-one.

397
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:42,211
What were you thinking, Veronica? I'm your father.

398
00:29:42,392 --> 00:29:45,013
What made you think you had the right to do something like this?

399
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,141
What are you talking about, have the right? This--this is what we do.

400
00:29:48,217 --> 00:29:49,964
This is how we survive.

401
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:51,785
I was trying to protect you.

402
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,174
Protect me?

403
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:55,864
I'm an adult, Veronica!

404
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:01,680
You have let her into our life like it's no big deal!

405
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:05,688
Oh, it's a big deal! It's a huge deal.

406
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:10,681
Makes me feel good about myself, wanted in a way that I haven't in a long time,

407
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:15,380
and it makes me wake up with a smile on my face. And we didn't ignore your feelings.

408
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:18,893
We tried to make you feel comfortable, but you chose to be snotty!

409
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:22,379
Mom is still out there somewhere!

410
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,795
Do you even care if she ever comes back?

411
00:30:25,882 --> 00:30:29,446
You didn't care until I started dating! You've been hard on your mom for months!

412
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:31,597
You can find anybody!

413
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:34,357
If she were a criminal,

414
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:38,863
you'd make a couple grand tracking her down and you'd have her back in a week!

415
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,929
Well, maybe I don't care to find her. Have you ever considered that?

416
00:30:45,473 --> 00:30:46,523
And here.

417
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:50,418
I've turned your boyfriend's security system on.

418
00:30:51,204 --> 00:30:52,482
There's the code.

419
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:12,503
You sure you're alright?

420
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:15,288
Would you stop asking me that? I need to concentrate.

421
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:18,686
The signal is weaving all over the place. It's weird.

422
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:20,368
You think they know that we're onto them.

423
00:31:20,491 --> 00:31:24,955
Maybe, but it looks like it's going in between buildings. I don't get it.

424
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,671
It says this is the street.

425
00:31:34,418 --> 00:31:38,790
Seems like an unlikely place to hide a stolen car, here in mansion-land.

426
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:40,875
You think it's in a garage?

427
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:46,565
No, the signal's still moving all around. It's right on top of us.

428
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:56,087
Please tell me that that dog is not supposed to be the BMW.

429
00:31:57,903 --> 00:31:59,524
Think your dad will notice?

430
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:04,116
Yeah.

431
00:32:10,214 --> 00:32:11,372
You want some breakfast?

432
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:13,462
No thanks. I'm just gonna grab an apple.

433
00:32:18,017 --> 00:32:19,083
That's for you.

434
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:22,779
It's everything you may or may not wanna know about Troy.

435
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:28,002
You can open it, you can throw it out, it's your choice.

436
00:32:44,945 --> 00:32:46,978
I just don't know how to say this.

437
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,124
Keith, just pull the band-aid off.

438
00:32:56,266 --> 00:33:00,050
The furrowed brow and the pauses are killing me.

439
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:04,818
I can't see you anymore.

440
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:11,699
Okay.

441
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:17,894
I can't do this to Veronica. She's not ready to see me dating yet. I'm sorry.

442
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:21,951
I'm sorry, but she's having a really hard time.

443
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,964
- Can you do me a favor? 
- Of course.

444
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:39,527
Can you just tell me it's another reason? Like... like a crappy one?

445
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:48,120
Your being a good father isn't really something I can bitch about to my girlfriends over margaritas.

446
00:33:58,718 --> 00:34:02,042
Hey, Sexy. Give me a kiss? Make all my troubles disappear?

447
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:04,627
All your troubles? That would take a lot of kissing.

448
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:07,403
I'm just glad we weren't dating when you were kicked out of those two schools

449
00:34:07,438 --> 00:34:10,496
for drug possession and trafficking. My lips would've fallen off.

450
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,404
Huh. Well good morning to you, too.

451
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:16,917
Although, back then, Shauna was doing most of the kissing, wasn't she?

452
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:21,059
You remember Shauna, don't you? You were kicked out of Pembrooke in Connecticut with her

453
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,467
for marijuana possession and then out of St. Mary's in Boston. You crazy kids never learn,

454
00:34:25,534 --> 00:34:30,352
and yet now I'm supposed to believe that you knew nothing about Luke picking up steroids in T.J.?

455
00:34:30,608 --> 00:34:33,738
- What are you talking about, steroids? 
- Don't even--

456
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:36,251
Look, I don't know anything about Luke and steroids.

457
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:39,338
Yeah, I got busted in Boston with some dope, big deal.

458
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,600
You got busted for drug possession and trafficking!

459
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:46,462
Yeah. So? That was two years before we even met, what does that have to do with us now?

460
00:34:46,512 --> 00:34:48,340
Because you never told me about it!

461
00:34:51,484 --> 00:34:52,734
Maybe I would've.

462
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:54,352
You ever think of that?

463
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:58,910
Maybe after I'd known you for more than a month I'd tell you my deep dark secrets.

464
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:00,670
Or is that too much of a character flaw?

465
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,932
Waiting for the girl to like you before you tell her the things you're not so proud of?

466
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:10,123
I don't have to tell you that. You're Veronica Mars.

467
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,224
You know everything.

468
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:25,062
Hey.

469
00:35:26,488 --> 00:35:27,511
I got it all.

470
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:31,663
Eight grand. And a little slice of my soul.

471
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:33,692
Woe is you.

472
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:43,516
I'll see you again bright and--

473
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:46,046
- Hey! 
- Talk to you later, alright?

474
00:35:46,598 --> 00:35:49,609
Is that Hummer downstairs with the Z-MEISTER plates yours?

475
00:35:49,692 --> 00:35:51,092
Abso-damn-lutely.

476
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:54,177
Wow. Cool, I guessed right.

477
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:55,800
So, um...

478
00:35:56,964 --> 00:35:59,195
- You here to get pumped? 
- Not exactly.

479
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:00,987
I'm here to settle Luke's account.

480
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:04,863
- Why don't we step in my office? 
- Oh, that's okay. I'd rather talk out here.

481
00:36:05,002 --> 00:36:06,937
- Well, I wouldn't. 
- Well, he would.

482
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:12,364
You know, darling, unless you're blind, you're gonna have to take your doggy outside.

483
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,590
You can try explaining that to him because he never listens to me.

484
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:17,392
- You don't understand-- 
- Hold on one sec.

485
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,774
Yeah? Oh, hey Wallace.

486
00:36:23,338 --> 00:36:24,495
Not much, you?

487
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,715
No, not at all. No.

488
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:29,374
Piece of cake.

489
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:31,350
Yeah, thanks.

490
00:36:33,516 --> 00:36:36,855
Here's the eight grand you fronted Luke. You two are square now.

491
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:41,611
I'm take the eight grand, but we ain't square, you see.

492
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:44,607
The little bitch let me down and I'm gonna have to make him pay.

493
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,661
Remember this moment. 'Cause you're gonna regret it.

494
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:51,746
Toodles!

495
00:37:24,113 --> 00:37:26,225
I can do better, I swear, just give me another chance.

496
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:30,105
You've used up all your chances. You've gotta learn discipline and respect.

497
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:33,235
Dad, please. I'm sorry. I--

498
00:37:34,156 --> 00:37:37,962
It's too late for apologies, Troy. You've made your bed.

499
00:37:44,068 --> 00:37:45,016
Yeah.

500
00:37:46,036 --> 00:37:47,490
Wow. That's some cake.

501
00:37:47,654 --> 00:37:49,307
- Isn't it, though? 
- I love it.

502
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:55,809
Did you ever notice that everything you make just tends to lean a little to the left?

503
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:58,181
I do that on purpose.

504
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:02,621
- What time is Rebecca coming? 
- She's not.

505
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:08,386
Oh! I already cancelled the birthday surprise...

506
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:12,370
I was gonna take you to see Santana at the Bowl.

507
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:14,279
I'm not seeing her anymore.

508
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:19,015
Dad, you don't...

509
00:38:21,704 --> 00:38:25,837
Sorry. I obviously know nothing about relationships.

510
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:28,253
But you can bake and that's important.

511
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:31,668
It's your birthday. You should be happy.

512
00:38:32,406 --> 00:38:34,018
And what better way to spend it?

513
00:38:34,453 --> 00:38:36,019
No, you should--

514
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:39,241
I should be able to do whatever I want because it's my birthday.

515
00:38:39,405 --> 00:38:42,508
I just wanna have a piece of cake with my daughter. That's all I want.

516
00:38:47,229 --> 00:38:50,055
Well, happy birthday, Pop.

517
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:51,167
Thanks, Kid.

518
00:38:53,378 --> 00:38:54,761
Don't forget to make a wish.

519
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,094
Good one.

520
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:16,179
Let's keep this between us, alright?

521
00:39:46,304 --> 00:39:49,196
- Hello. 
- Hey, baby, it's Shauna.

522
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:53,649
Can you feel the heat yet? I am getting so close, baby,

523
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:56,030
your panties oughta burst into flames any minute now.

524
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:59,445
Troy, what's with this girl calling me? You gave her my number?

525
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:01,278
Oh, whoa. What girl?

526
00:40:01,478 --> 00:40:03,251
Some girl named Veronica.

527
00:40:04,677 --> 00:40:07,251
You didn't tell her you'd be seeing me soon, did you?

528
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:09,604
She caught me off guard! What was I supposed to--

529
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:20,589
Sorry we didn't get a chance to say goodbye, but just wanted to wish you good luck

530
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:23,869
at your new school and leave you something to remember me by.

531
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,707
It took me a while to figure out where you stashed the steroids,

532
00:40:26,784 --> 00:40:29,134
but there was only one place you were alone, right?

533
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:32,027
In case you're wondering, the former contents of the package are somewhere

534
00:40:32,093 --> 00:40:34,418
between my toilet and the Pacific Ocean.

535
00:40:34,524 --> 00:40:37,260
Say hi to Shauna for me. She sounds like a keeper.

536
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:39,866
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

537
00:40:56,717 --> 00:41:01,069
Mr. Zigmund? You wanna go ahead and turn over your contraband?

538
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,382
Step out of the car, please.

539
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:29,338
Hello, sweetheart. First of all, I miss you so much.

540
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:31,401
More than you could possibly imagine.

541
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:34,996
You know what, I did get one of your letters, but I won't tell you which one

542
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:37,510
because I don't want you to try and find me.

543
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:42,657
Veronica, you listen to me, I know you have a million questions,

544
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,671
but everything will make sense when the time is right. I promise.

545
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,488
I'll be in touch soon.

546
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:53,594
Trust me, okay?

547
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,145
I love you.

548
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:59,748
And could you tell your father I said happy birthday?

549
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:11,941
