1
00:00:00,456 --> 00:00:02,554
Previously on Veronica Mars.

2
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:03,827
I didn't stab him, Veronica.

3
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:05,916
There is something that 
you need to know about your dad.

4
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,209
On the subject of the bus crash, 
back in '89, then-deputy Mars

5
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,827
pulled Ed Doyle over 
for driving under the influence.

6
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:16,463
Had a D.U.I. appeared on his record, 
he would have never been hired

7
00:00:16,598 --> 00:00:17,453
by the school district.

8
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:18,635
The bus was sabotaged.

9
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:21,651
If that sound is an explosion, 
not only were those kids murdered,

10
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:23,190
but the guilty party is still at large.

11
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:25,992
You're dying, abel. 
You didn't kill Lilly Kane.

12
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,302
You're just somebody's patsy.

13
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:28,852
So, Abel Koontz has a daughter.

14
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:32,378
Mrs. Delongpre just finalized her 
father's settlement with Kane Software.

15
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,463
A week ago, I imagined this all differently.

16
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:39,581
Keith Mars was supposed to ride 
his projected lead to a resounding victory,

17
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:42,578
and me and Wallace were supposed 
to sneak some champagne

18
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:46,044
before making slightly tipsy 
crank calls to former sheriff Lamb.

19
00:00:46,123 --> 00:00:49,061
Instead, I'm riding out a nail-biter, 
while Wallace is off

20
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:51,130
finding himself with his dad in Chicago.

21
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:55,091
Instead of a best friend, I've got 
an e-mail address that won't write back.

22
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:55,685
Don't worry.

23
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:57,868
The polls are open 20 more minutes.

24
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:00,370
We own the straggler vote.

25
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:05,287
You're out of cocktail wienies, 
and I'm out of cocktail.

26
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:06,916
We're out of gin.

27
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,124
I'm not particular.

28
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:12,468
Our latest results now show 
Don Lamb nosing ahead by a percent.

29
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:14,762
Whatever it is, make it a double.

30
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:17,931
...Between Don Lamb and challenger 
Keith Mars is neck and neck,

31
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:21,988
as it has been all night. 
We show that the incumbent is edging...

32
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:23,244
Are you the sheriff?

33
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:25,307
Looks like it's going to stay that way.

34
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:29,182
I have information about 
that mexican kid who got killed.

35
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:31,098
Felix Toombs?

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,339
Yeah. I'm the one who made 
the anonymous call from the bridge.

37
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:39,555
Dude.

38
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:41,678
My stepmom?

39
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:43,988
I am a total piece of crap.

40
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:46,104
Better you than the cable guy, I guess.

41
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,692
And I'd be lying to say if I never perved
on your mom while she was prancing

42
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,947
around the pool in that 
hardly-there bikini of hers.

43
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:55,803
Great. So, no hard feelings?

44
00:01:55,954 --> 00:01:57,302
No, she gave me a few.

45
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,935
So, Woody Goodman is officially 
the balboa county supervisor,

46
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,724
the position historically referred to 
as "the mayor of Neptune."

47
00:02:06,897 --> 00:02:09,134
And we're officially 
calling the sheriff's race.

48
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,208
Don Lamb holds onto his 
seat in a real nail-biter.

49
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,147
And I'm officially calling life unfair.

50
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:17,451
Well, we'll get 'em in 2010, folks.

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,185
Thanks for all the good work.

52
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,842
Ah, look on the bright side.

53
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:27,131
49% of Neptune still likes you.

54
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,671
This wasn't how it should have gone.

55
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:33,328
Veronica, we did all we could.

56
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:37,800
It wasn't even a contest until Lamb decided 
to make you a scapegoat for the bus crash.

57
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:41,253
All we had to do was release 
the tape of the bus explosion.

58
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:42,033
No.

59
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:44,233
It was the best thing for the investigation.

60
00:02:45,837 --> 00:02:48,852
The best thing for the investigation 
would have been a competent sheriff.

61
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:53,512
Honey, it's over.

62
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:55,902
Go on to your boyfriend's party.

63
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:58,696
I've got Cliff to keep 
me company. Right, Cliff?

64
00:02:58,939 --> 00:02:59,526
Right.

65
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:02,950
I promise to hold his hair back 
if he has to make sick in the toilet.

66
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:05,319
You even know where your dad went?

67
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:07,277
Let's just say I'm not 
at liberty to discuss.

68
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,615
Our lawyers say if he ever 
sets foot on U.S. Soil,

69
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,866
he's looking at 10 to 15 at club fed.

70
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:18,572
So, you're all alone? What's that like? 
Is it cool? Or, I guess, weird?

71
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:19,731
It's tough.

72
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:22,083
You know my real mom's 
got a new family up in Frisco,

73
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,926
so I'm pretty much the man of the house.

74
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:25,835
I'm just trying to take 
care of Beav and stuff.

75
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,370
Excuse me.

76
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:28,491
Hey, Veronica.

77
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:30,994
Hey, Gia, have you seen Duncan?

78
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:33,840
I'm sorry about your dad. It's such a drag.

79
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:36,041
That other guy seems like a total knob.

80
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:36,538
Yeah.

81
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,731
Congrats on your old man.

82
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:41,765
I guess that makes you, like, 
Neptune's first daughter.

83
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,972
Are you ready for all the 
parade waving and ribbon cutting?

84
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,044
I thought I'd go 
more bush-twins style --

85
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:49,890
you know, public drunkenness, 
sluttiness, and minor scandals.

86
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:53,589
Speaking of which, 
what do you think about Dick?

87
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:55,714
Uh...

88
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,499
Casablancas, I presume?

89
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:02,315
Um...well, what can I say?

90
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:05,212
Dick is just... Dick.

91
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:12,587
Deputy Sachs? Now, that's ballsy --

92
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,228
busting the mayor's kid's 
party on election night.

93
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:17,788
What is he doing here?

94
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:19,679
The sheriff would like 
to have a word with you.

95
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,133
And I'd like to be the cream filling 
of an olson-twins sandwich, but --

96
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:24,539
will you come with me, please?

97
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,731
If I'm under arrest, then do me 
the courtesy of making it all official-like.

98
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:32,159
Oh, yeah.

99
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:34,432
Logan echolls...

100
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,501
that's more like it.

101
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,140
...You're under arrest 
for the murder of Felix Toombs.

102
00:04:39,283 --> 00:04:41,046
Ooh, I am having the weirdest déjà vu.

103
00:04:41,426 --> 00:04:43,284
You have the right to remain silent.

104
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:46,504
Anything you say can and will be 
used against you in a court of law.

105
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,949
You have the right to an attorney.

106
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,681
If you cannot find one, 
you will be appointed one by the court.

107
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:57,154
Douche chill!

108
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,711
Sheriff lamb, please.

109
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,684
Hey, Keith.

110
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:03,458
Just a sec.

111
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,885
Keith Mars on the line.

112
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:10,417
I got to take a message.

113
00:05:10,864 --> 00:05:14,826
Just, you know, "good race" and all that, 
the usual pleasantries.

114
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:16,839
I'll pass that along, Keith.

115
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:19,421
I'm sorry. Things are just 
a little busy here right now.

116
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:21,679
Following up that lead 
on the bus crash, I hope.

117
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,866
They're checking out the front end, 
the brakes, everything.

118
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:26,384
They brought up the bus?

119
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,181
In a night of bad surprises, 
I have one more I'd like to prevent.

120
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:33,688
Great. Apparently we've hired 
a wino to guard our door.

121
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:38,011
Um, I don't think you're allowed to --

122
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,749
Veronica Mars.

123
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,003
Abel Koontz?

124
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:51,264
I need your help.

125
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:53,624
I'm trying. I just -- let's sit down.

126
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:57,735
No. It's my daughter 
Amelia. She's missing,

127
00:05:57,968 --> 00:06:01,477
and I need your help 
to find her before I die.

128
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,283
Abel Koontz, bloated and 
reeking from rotgut wine.

129
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:10,971
Surprise!

130
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:16,516
<i>A long time ago,</i>

131
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:19,247
<i>we used to be friends but I</i>

132
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,836
<i>haven't thought of you lately at all</i>

133
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,310
<i>Come on, now, sugar</i>

134
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:28,123
<i>bring it on, bring it on,</i>

135
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:32,127
<i>yeah just remember me when</i>

136
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:37,132
<i>we used to be friends a long time ago</i>

137
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:39,521
<i>we used to be friends</i>

138
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:48,940
Amelia signed the settlement 
papers with Kane Software...

139
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:51,065
last spring.

140
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:56,632
And what was the going rate 
for taking the fall for murder?

141
00:06:57,603 --> 00:06:59,309
$3 million.

142
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,801
It was for Amelia.

143
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:04,803
You don't think making herself 
scarce was part of the settlement?

144
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,758
I need you to find her.

145
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,514
Why should I help you?

146
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,112
Because I'm begging you.

147
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:20,755
I missed her 21st birthday, 
and I won't live to see her 22nd.

148
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,325
Please? What are you doing?

149
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:29,150
Broke or not, there has to be 
a hospital that'll take you.

150
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:31,674
Hi. I need to bring someone in.

151
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:32,954
Where is your E.R. entrance?
-- Forget about me.

152
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:35,241
Will you help me find my daughter?

153
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,130
Thank you.

154
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,888
Only because you begged.

155
00:07:40,515 --> 00:07:41,368
Come on.

156
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:42,494
Number four, step forward.

157
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:45,969
Oh, wow, I'm stunned.

158
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:47,733
You like me.

159
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:49,794
You really like me.

160
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:54,496
Well, first I'd just like 
to say the other, uh, nominees

161
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:57,871
are all such wonderfully gifted criminals.

162
00:07:58,213 --> 00:07:59,749
And I want to thank my agent...

163
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:02,103
...and my publicist

164
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:04,246
for always shooting me from the left side.

165
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:07,165
You might want to get a lawyer.

166
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:08,909
What? For this charade?

167
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:14,346
Just get me the first sober
public defender you find in the hall,

168
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:17,148
put the bail on my black amex, 
and call me a limo.

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,967
Actually, buddy...

170
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:22,186
it's kind of hard to get bail 
without a hearing.

171
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:24,140
And even if you make it before a judge,

172
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,207
I draw a lot of water in town,

173
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:30,162
and I got this feeling you might 
just get declared a flight risk.

174
00:08:30,713 --> 00:08:31,604
Hmm?

175
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:36,631
Amelia held up her end of the deal with 
Jake Kane and vanished completely.

176
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:39,305
Her paper trail dried up on may 27th.

177
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:43,085
But it's been my experience 
that personal ties don't dry up so easily,

178
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,454
and last I saw her, she was tied pretty 
tightly to a certain boyfriend.

179
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,620
Hi. Are you mike?

180
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:58,371
I don't know where she is.

181
00:08:58,694 --> 00:09:00,855
The last place I saw her was in Ibiza.

182
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:04,932
You mean like "there's Tara Reid 
passed out on the beach" Ibiza?

183
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:07,835
Yeah. I'd just finished finals, 
and she came up and said,

184
00:09:07,836 --> 00:09:09,436
"hey, I got a whole bunch of money."

185
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:11,087
Oh, a patent settlement.

186
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:12,922
It was complicated.

187
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,724
Well, we went to Europe,

188
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,644
ended up in Ibiza.

189
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:19,352
We met fun people. We went 
to the beach every single day,

190
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:22,194
tracked down all these cool 
parties on this website.

191
00:09:22,368 --> 00:09:22,842
It was cool.

192
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:24,644
I'm sensing an "until."

193
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,335
One night we're at this club 
one of these places

194
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:30,475
that drop this foam crap on you at midnight.

195
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,519
So, we're there.

196
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:33,506
We're hanging out.

197
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:34,967
They drop the foam...

198
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,857
and that was the last I saw of her.

199
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,249
Did you check under the foam?

200
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:42,727
I had to call my parents to fly me home.

201
00:09:43,313 --> 00:09:44,811
It basically kind of sucked.

202
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:47,038
Well, at least you got to go to Europe.

203
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:49,047
And all I got was this lousy t-shirt.

204
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,913
So you're not... worried?

205
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:53,673
She ditched me. Whatever.

206
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:56,645
The girl's got three million bucks 
to keep her company.

207
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,715
If she's really in trouble, 
she took all my phone cards.

208
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:02,852
She could call me, but... 
I kind of doubt that's gonna happen.

209
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:05,942
Okay, boyfriend ditched in Ibiza.

210
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:09,336
Maybe Amelia's old roommate 
got the behind-the-scenes on that.

211
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:11,784
God. She really went to Ibiza?

212
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:13,263
Or maybe not.

213
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:16,924
Did she contact you? Anything 
about where she might have been?

214
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:19,028
No, she just, you know, left.

215
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:23,183
Ibiza. That is so weird.

216
00:10:23,393 --> 00:10:24,665
Weird? How so?

217
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:26,904
Well, she's hardly 
the "girls gone wild" type.

218
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:29,163
I practically had to put a gun to her head

219
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,707
just to get her to do the greek
booze cruise last year.

220
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:33,399
Or maybe it's true what they say --

221
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:35,667
money changes people.

222
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:39,072
Ibiza. I'd follow up in person,

223
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,318
but dad's pretty conservative 
about fact-finding trips abroad.

224
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:48,979
The calling cards Amelia took --

225
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,239
did you jot the numbers down anywhere?

226
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:56,037
So, the thong stays in the closet, 
and I hit the big Ibiza website.

227
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:59,169
It's time to see if any 
of the party people of europe

228
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,012
know where Amelia Delongpre might be.

229
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:11,382
So, my tax dollars at work.

230
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,763
Where were you? Getting thirds 
at the "crazy girls" lunch buffet?

231
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:18,950
They discontinued the buffet
some health-code thing.

232
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:20,905
Okay. My name is Cliff.

233
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,637
I'll be your "if you cannot 
afford an attorney" attorney.

234
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,401
So, what are you trying to prove?

235
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:29,463
Um, my innocence?

236
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:31,984
No, I mean with this 
poor-little-rich-boy stunt.

237
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:34,868
Having me represent you 
doesn't make you look innocent.

238
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:36,993
It makes you look like an arrogant jackass.

239
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:39,951
If the witness' story holds, 
you are going to trial.

240
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:40,865
Mm-hmm.

241
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:43,040
The guy's lying.

242
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:46,997
June 27th -- you gave testimony 
saying you couldn't remember a thing.

243
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:50,639
Now, he comes forward saying 
he saw you, bloody knife in hand,

244
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,391
ranting like a maniac over a dead body.

245
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,029
And what exactly did I say, huh?

246
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,704
"The -- expletive, 
racial expletive -- had it --

247
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,129
maternal expletive -- coming."

248
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:02,367
But wait, there's more.

249
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,493
You then threatened 
to use your father's money

250
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:05,843
to have said witness killed.

251
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:07,438
Now, true or not, Logan,

252
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:10,209
the Echolls name won't
buy you a lot of jury love.

253
00:12:10,324 --> 00:12:11,196
Not to men--

254
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:15,751
It's Cliff.

255
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,720
Cliffy, I need a quick favor.

256
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,831
No can do. I am right in the middle --

257
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:21,048
Cliff, come on. You owe me.

258
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:25,348
I owe you? Who un-confiscated 
all your fake college I.Ds?

259
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:28,329
Who got the Lincoln out of your ex's name?

260
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:31,194
Well, who helped put that lien 
against "Lee's wok and doughnut"?

261
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,722
And who proved that 
stripper was color-blind?

262
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:38,573
Okay, who am I calling
and what am I giving them?

263
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:41,471
World Telecom. I texted you 
the number I need run.

264
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:45,492
Nothing melts an operator's heart
like an overwrought Fred Macmurray.

265
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:47,373
You're a stud, Cliff.

266
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:48,097
Right.

267
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,285
Just...

268
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:54,318
World Telecom.

269
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:58,881
Hello? My... My daughter's disappeared.

270
00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:02,049
She left her husband and ran 
off with some wild girlfriend.

271
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:04,072
I think they got into 
some kind of trouble, but

272
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:05,686
I'm sure it's not her fault.

273
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,785
The police said they were headed 
to mexico, but no one's seen them.

274
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,799
I just need to know if she's okay.

275
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,839
Please, could you tell me
if she's used her card?

276
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,585
What's the number, sir?

277
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:21,878
Uh, 0922... 3346.

278
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:23,208
Isn't that "Thelma & Louise"?

279
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,430
Uh, yes. I have the information.

280
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,348
Can you e-mail that?

281
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:28,001
What's the address, sir?

282
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:30,111
Vmars@aol.Com.

283
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:31,350
Yes, certainly.

284
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:31,960
Thank you.

285
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:32,476
Good luck, sir.

286
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,252
Bless you.

287
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:37,087
That daughter of yours 
sounds like a real handful.

288
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,090
This is what I'm good at. 
Marquee murder cases?

289
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:43,094
Nah.

290
00:13:43,796 --> 00:13:45,067
Now, Lamb wants to keep you here,

291
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:48,293
supposedly to ease community tensions, 
but really 'cause he's mean.

292
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,735
Do the smart thing --

293
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:52,658
put daddy's money to work 
and get a real lawyer...

294
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:54,518
or three.

295
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:02,301
So Cliff comes through again,

296
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,677
but the calling-card records 
aren't telling me anything

297
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,624
I don't already know.

298
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:09,228
Ibiza... Ibiza, Ibiza...

299
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:12,243
Neptune? Last week?

300
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:27,205
So, uh... when do I get my conjugal visit?

301
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:29,560
It's up to your new roommate.

302
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:35,494
Logan?

303
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:46,068
What are you doing here?

304
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:49,444
Come on, pops.

305
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,669
Jail's where they put accused murderers.

306
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:55,177
You remember that crap from the summer. 
Why are you here?

307
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,742
They transferred me out 
of county this morning.

308
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:02,594
I guess our sheriff has 
a soft spot for family, huh?

309
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,188
Well...

310
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:07,657
...At least I know what 
it takes to get a visit out of you.

311
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:11,937
Those special times with your emancipation 
paperwork don't really count.

312
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:13,912
I just need a little time to work through

313
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,850
how you bashed my girlfriend's skull in.

314
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:21,181
Look, Logan... 
I made an unforgivable mistake,

315
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:23,641
but I am not a murderer.

316
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:26,085
Oh, so you merely plowed my girlfriend

317
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:27,756
and taped it for your home collection.

318
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,542
I don't expect any sympathy from you.

319
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:31,631
That's good.

320
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:33,190
You have no idea.

321
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:35,581
You have no idea what 
actually happened that day.

322
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:37,254
Pop, I have a pretty good idea.

323
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:39,322
No, Keith Mars got it partly right.

324
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:41,696
Yeah, okay, Lilly and I fought.

325
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,467
I followed her home but not to hurt her. 
I swear to god.

326
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:47,198
Duncan found us.

327
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:50,628
He must have heard everything
because he was furious.

328
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,763
He was out of his mind. 
He was ranting and raving.

329
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:55,243
So, Duncan killed Lilly?

330
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:57,665
Wow.

331
00:15:58,104 --> 00:15:59,107
All I know is I got out.

332
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:01,569
The next thing, it was all over the news.

333
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:07,570
So you tried to kill another girl, 
also a girlfriend of mine.

334
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:10,297
What, to maintain your innocence?

335
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,232
I-I-I just snapped.

336
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,453
Logan, I lost it.

337
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:16,988
But...

338
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,418
You don't believe me.

339
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:26,650
Why should a jury believe me?

340
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:31,659
Maybe my life is over.

341
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:35,343
It may be.

342
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,725
But you shouldn't throw 
yours away just to spite me.

343
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,972
Come on, Logan.

344
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,035
Let me help you.

345
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:44,510
Let me call some guys down at the firm.

346
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:45,517
They gave me a lawyer.

347
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,973
A real lawyer, not some public servant

348
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:50,192
with a mail-order diploma and a $300 suit.

349
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:53,539
Two for $500, actually, 
but your point remains valid.

350
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:55,505
You -- you got bail. Let's go.

351
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:00,808
Bail? How? You said --

352
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:03,462
Judge Bloom and I shvitz at the same gym.

353
00:17:03,728 --> 00:17:05,811
I'll be billing you for a case of cohibas

354
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,745
and a 4-handed thai massage.

355
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:10,116
There's also the matter of a $200,000 bond.

356
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:14,870
So, chip, how about you thank me 
by taking the old block's advice?

357
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:16,501
Get a new lawyer.

358
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:24,329
Well, you're kind of winning me over.

359
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:27,703
Being a private eye is all about 
connecting the dots.

360
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:31,018
Sometimes that's difficult. 
Sometimes it's not.

361
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:34,876
When a girl goes missing after
taking hush money from Kane Software,

362
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:38,835
then unexpectedly reappears to use 
the pay phone across the street,

363
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:41,260
there's only one person to talk to.

364
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:47,150
Where have you been?

365
00:17:47,324 --> 00:17:49,822
Sorry, someone just called and said 
they were towing my car.

366
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,025
What are you the head of again?

367
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:57,656
This is it.

368
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:00,628
I would have thought 
that helping your billionaire boss

369
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:03,645
cover up his daughter's murder 
would have snagged you a better office...

370
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,368
or at least a plaque.

371
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,487
What are you doing here?

372
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:09,026
I am looking for someone.

373
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:10,082
Maybe you've seen her --

374
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:11,544
Amelia Delongpre.

375
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:14,044
Why would you think I'd know anything
about her whereabouts?

376
00:18:14,182 --> 00:18:16,736
Maybe because you're the person
who bribed her to disappear.

377
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:21,625
If you mean track her down at 
the motel where you hid her

378
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,956
so she could sign paperwork
for a legal settlement --

379
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:26,136
or maybe because she popped up last week

380
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:28,298
to make a call from the pay phone 
across the street.

381
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:30,062
Not to me.

382
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:33,145
And what business is it of mine
where she makes her phone calls?

383
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:37,028
I have no further interest
in Amelia Delongpre.

384
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,071
Now, if you'll excuse me, 
I have to get back to work,

385
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,301
and you have to get back 
to minding your own business.

386
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:43,835
Or do I need to, uh --

387
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:46,186
No need to call yourself to escort me out.

388
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:47,722
You know I know the drill.

389
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,255
If you drink it, you get a shirt.

390
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,194
Why do I want a seÑor shrimp shirt?

391
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,506
It's a shrimp, and he's saying, "eat me."

392
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:59,037
It's awesome. We got to go.

393
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:02,699
Yeah, bro -- make sure you bring 
cigarettes and toilet paper, okay?

394
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,400
You're talking about visiting 
your buddy Logan in jail, right?

395
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,660
Uh, we were talking about seÑor shrimp.

396
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:11,747
Well, you might want to drop in anyway,

397
00:19:11,923 --> 00:19:14,739
'cause now they got a witness 
to your boy killing Felix,

398
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:15,987
and they're going to hold him.

399
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:19,349
Jail can be a scary place 
for such a sensitive boy.

400
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:20,228
Wait.

401
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,487
Did I miss a state proposition or something?

402
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,957
Is it now a crime to kill a mexican?

403
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:26,815
That guy needs an ass-kickin'!

404
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:29,003
I think it would make him a better person.

405
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:32,704
Hey, why the long face?

406
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,811
Somebody rip down your J-Lo calendar?

407
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,245
You didn't hear?

408
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:38,761
Logan made bail in like two minutes.

409
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:40,313
Walked out.

410
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:41,555
Damn, man. You see?

411
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,284
These white boys get away with everything.

412
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:45,658
We should have done something
about that guy months ago.

413
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:46,656
Seriously, bro.

414
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:48,737
People are saying stuff, man.

415
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:51,189
What do you mean, "stuff"?

416
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:52,594
I mean my little brother

417
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:58,207
the other day asked me if it's true that 
P.C.H. stands for "Panty Club for Homos."

418
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,871
Yeah. Heard it at school.

419
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:05,675
Maybe it is time we did 
something about Logan Echolls.

420
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:07,980
Hey.

421
00:20:08,363 --> 00:20:08,902
Hey.

422
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:10,415
Ew.

423
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:13,928
So, which is a better place
chasers or seÑor shrimp?

424
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:16,614
For what? Watching sorority girls stumble?

425
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:18,232
M-bomb is getting us new fake I.Ds.

426
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:20,515
He got him. I saw them.They're awesome.

427
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:22,292
But I guess we're all from Rhode Island,

428
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,932
so remember -- we're tourists.

429
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,153
You disapprove.

430
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:29,605
No, it's awesome. I just left something.

431
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:30,136
I'll see you in class.

432
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:37,352
Dawn, it's Veronica Mars.

433
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:40,220
So, when you and Amelia 
went on the booze cruise last year,

434
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,706
she was only 20. 
She must have had a fake I.D.?

435
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:46,027
Her cousin. And what's her cousin's name?

436
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:47,859
Margot Schnell.

437
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:52,532
Bingo. Rented a car at 
the San Diego airport last week.

438
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,827
Best thing about two days in jail --

439
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:02,904
two days worth of "Ellen" 
on the tivo, that sweet feeling.

440
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:06,648
What's your address again?

441
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,303
That's going to mess up your tivo.

442
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:42,334
Hi. I'm hoping you can help me.

443
00:21:42,826 --> 00:21:45,262
Well, the good news is 
that's just what I'm here for.

444
00:21:45,448 --> 00:21:47,848
Looks like I totally got the right guy.

445
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,976
Okay, here's my thing.

446
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:52,561
My friend -- she rented 
the coolest car from you guys,

447
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:54,967
and some of us were going up 
to see the Staind show,

448
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:57,019
and I wanted to find out what it was

449
00:21:57,178 --> 00:21:58,908
so that I could rent one 
for us to road-trip.

450
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:01,069
Okay. What's the name?

451
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:02,323
Margot Schnell.

452
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:04,269
"Margot" with a "t," Schnell is --

453
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,031
It means "fast" in german.

454
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,069
Wow. You speak german?

455
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:10,403
Jawohl.

456
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,647
Okay. That's a Lesabre.

457
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:18,229
What do they call 
that awesome color? It was...

458
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:22,026
White? That's called white.

459
00:22:22,027 --> 00:22:22,657
Yup.

460
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:25,115
Yeah, that particular car 
is rented right now,

461
00:22:25,272 --> 00:22:29,135
but I can get you
a regal with moonroof in teal

462
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:32,498
for $250 a week, 
not including tax and liability,

463
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,646
which would be a great way 
to go and see Stain...

464
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:37,751
"...D." "Staind."

465
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:40,547
Oh, gosh, that is... more than I thought.

466
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:46,468
Um...you wouldn't happen
to have anything more like...$40.

467
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:47,121
No.

468
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:49,680
Oh.

469
00:22:55,335 --> 00:22:57,557
This routine used to be a tag-team number,

470
00:22:57,736 --> 00:23:00,659
but with Wallace still A.W.O.L.,
now it's a one-woman show.

471
00:23:01,221 --> 00:23:04,073
...I'm here. I'm doubly here.
There's two of me.

472
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:05,435
I've got places to be.

473
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:07,637
I want you to lock up 
and take care of all those files.

474
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:19,260
You have to help me.

475
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:20,194
What's the problem?

476
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:23,958
Well, to begin with, 
my colleague is an unbearable nazi

477
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:26,864
who couldn't find his own ass 
with a mirror and a miner's hat,

478
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:28,949
kind of like that guy, you know?

479
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:31,750
Long story short, 
I'm doing this big presentation,

480
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:33,856
I'm about to crush him for the promotion,

481
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:37,963
and I realized I left 
my laptop in the rental,

482
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:39,523
and I'm totally screwed.

483
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:40,452
You have to help me.

484
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:41,837
Do you remember the car?

485
00:23:42,074 --> 00:23:43,987
It was a white Lesabre. 
I turned it in last week.

486
00:23:48,131 --> 00:23:50,024
Well, it's rented out now. 
I mean, it could be anywhere.

487
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:54,809
You don't have a number, no... um...Onstar.

488
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:57,602
Don't you have some sort of 
special button or something?

489
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:59,213
We're not really supposed to do that.

490
00:23:59,323 --> 00:24:02,357
The world is not supposed 
to be totally unfair, either, but...

491
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,251
this jackass can't win.

492
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:17,108
Hi, I'm calling from San Diego.

493
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:20,600
I'm trying to locate a car. Code is 92347.

494
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:25,810
They're not getting a signal, 
which usually means they're in a garage.

495
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:26,683
Is there anything?

496
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,247
Has there been activity on --

497
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:30,159
oh, can you give me that?

498
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:35,240
They did a remote unlock, 
which means they have gps coordinates.

499
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,727
Okay, thank you very much.

500
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:42,898
Okay. So, two days ago, 
they were right here.

501
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:44,548
Waverly, California?

502
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:47,537
Thank you so much. 
Please call if you know anything else.

503
00:24:47,645 --> 00:24:49,045
I hope your boss gets canned.

504
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,765
Yours, too.

505
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,221
So, what'd you find?

506
00:24:58,312 --> 00:24:59,748
I'm sorry. What?

507
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,710
You brought up the bus.

508
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:04,986
I want to know if your forensic guys 
found any evidence of an explosion.

509
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,352
Look, Keith, when you called 
on tuesday night to concede --

510
00:25:08,496 --> 00:25:10,260
I'm sorry I missed the call, by the way --

511
00:25:10,414 --> 00:25:13,399
I figured you were conceding 
your involvement in this case.

512
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:16,144
If I didn't turn over that 
voice mail Veronica found,

513
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:18,209
that bus would still be 
on the bottom of the sea.

514
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:21,019
Keith, we're on it.

515
00:25:21,662 --> 00:25:23,531
Maybe you should worry
a little less about the bus

516
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:24,883
and a little more about your daughter.

517
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:27,162
What's that supposed to mean?

518
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:30,845
She didn't tell you? 
And you two seemed so close.

519
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:31,407
Tell me what?

520
00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:36,541
It was a couple weeks back.
We had Veronica down to the station.

521
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:40,737
Right, something about... 
her name written on a guy's hand,

522
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:42,833
a guy who washed up on the beach.

523
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:45,741
Forget it. She said it was nothing, so...

524
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:49,869
you know kids these days.

525
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:57,524
Okay, so now I know two things --

526
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:03,301
where Amelia was two days ago and why 
I've never heard of Waverly, California.

527
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:18,411
Actually, there's no "o" in "naughty."

528
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:20,870
It's "knotty," with a "k," like in pine.

529
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:22,960
I-I-I-it'S...research.

530
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:27,628
"Knotty school girls"?
What will they think of next?

531
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:31,121
You want a room? It's 30 bucks a night.

532
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:32,687
Actually, I'm looking for someone.

533
00:26:32,956 --> 00:26:35,650
Well, if it's me, congratulations.

534
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:38,529
Otherwise, unless you 
get lucky at the gas 'n' sip,

535
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:41,422
your options are pretty limited around here.

536
00:26:41,644 --> 00:26:45,209
It's a friend. She probably passed 
through here in the last couple days.

537
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,504
Have you seen her?

538
00:26:46,657 --> 00:26:49,940
Yeah. Yeah, she got 
a room a couple of days ago.

539
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,342
Can I see the room she stayed in?

540
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:57,724
Like I said... room's $30 a night.

541
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:14,589
You've got millions of dollars,
and you've been partying all across Europe.

542
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:17,406
What brings you here?

543
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,594
Hey, dad.

544
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:33,379
Where are you?

545
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:34,642
What? I'm --

546
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:35,936
Where are you right now?

547
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:42,168
I'm... shopping in a funny 
little art gallery downtown.

548
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:43,292
Show me.

549
00:27:44,403 --> 00:27:45,836
Dad, I don't know how I'm supposed to --

550
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:48,636
Take a picture, 
send it to me, then I'll relax.

551
00:27:48,756 --> 00:27:53,108
And when you come home, you can 
tell me about the dead guy on the beach.

552
00:27:55,428 --> 00:27:56,902
How could you keep this from me?

553
00:27:59,705 --> 00:28:00,937
I didn't want you to worry.

554
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,060
About what? What did you find?

555
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,832
The guy on the beach is David Moran,

556
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:09,555
A.K.A. "Curly."

557
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,440
He knew Aaron Echolls from way back.

558
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:14,986
He knew how to make a bus crash.

559
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,003
What do you mean?

560
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:19,269
He was a stunt man on 
a movie called "The Long Haul."

561
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,127
It was Aaron's first big hit.

562
00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:24,536
You really think --

563
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,217
I don't know. I don't know.

564
00:28:28,282 --> 00:28:33,254
But if it's true, if... Aaron is 
really trying to take out a witness,

565
00:28:33,406 --> 00:28:35,546
then that means all those
kids died because of me.

566
00:28:37,811 --> 00:28:43,313
And trying to figure it out is the only 
thing keeping me from going insane crazy.

567
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,108
Otherwise I'd just obsess
about it 24 hours a day.

568
00:28:46,211 --> 00:28:47,977
Yeah. Yeah, I know the feeling.

569
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,760
It's called being a parent.

570
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,175
You send me that picture, 
and we'll talk when you get home.

571
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:20,379
Is this what they imagined 
when they invented all this technology?

572
00:29:20,665 --> 00:29:22,598
A digital leash for a nervous parent?

573
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,357
And speaking of technology,

574
00:29:26,443 --> 00:29:29,261
my bluetooth connection
is detecting Amelia's palm pilot.

575
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:32,033
"Maximum range, 30 feet."

576
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:38,751
Sorry to interrupt the research.

577
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:41,293
Is there anyone staying
in the room past mine?

578
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,578
Rooms...are...$30.

579
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:07,141
Can I see the room this side of mine?

580
00:30:56,776 --> 00:30:58,940
I thought I told you
to mind your own business.

581
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,767
My father knows where 
I am and what I'm doing.

582
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:07,301
He knows --I'm guessing that was her?

583
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:08,968
Amelia?

584
00:31:09,082 --> 00:31:10,492
In the ice machine?

585
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:13,303
Wait.

586
00:31:21,997 --> 00:31:24,235
I wasn't entirely up-front 
with you the other day.

587
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:27,685
Amelia signed her papers 
and disappeared just like I said.

588
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:30,470
I considered the matter settled until --

589
00:31:30,614 --> 00:31:32,752
Until she made a call from
the pay phone across the street.

590
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:35,090
No, that was the second 
call to arrange for the pickup.

591
00:31:35,447 --> 00:31:39,440
The first call was to extort an additional
quarter million from Kane Software.

592
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,366
She wanted more money? 
She got three million bucks six months ago.

593
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:45,965
I gave her the money -- marked bills --

594
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,493
under the condition that she disappear 
until the Kanes' legal issues were settled.

595
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:53,454
But a week after she's 
supposed to be on the plane,

596
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:55,872
marked bills started showing up here.

597
00:31:56,816 --> 00:32:00,860
So, you did find someone at 
the gas 'n' sip, and now you need a room?

598
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:04,873
Was anyone else in here two nights ago? 
Did you see anyone with her?

599
00:32:04,984 --> 00:32:07,290
Why? Is he missing a friend, too?

600
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,887
Answer the question, 
or I'll break all your fingers.

601
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:12,889
J-just the guy she come in with.

602
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:14,692
What? You didn't ask.

603
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:16,460
What did he look like?

604
00:32:16,556 --> 00:32:19,828
Brown hair, medium size, t-shirt.

605
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:23,735
Thank you.

606
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:25,842
You're welcome.

607
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:27,138
That description rings a bell?

608
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:28,557
Yeah.

609
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,502
I need you to take me to this person.

610
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:32,327
What about --

611
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:33,632
no, I'll deal with the cops.

612
00:32:33,737 --> 00:32:36,583
I need a better handle
on this before things go too public.

613
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:45,202
Just two chairs?

614
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:48,809
Where's my lawyer going to sit?

615
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:50,474
Oh, it's an unofficial visit,

616
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:53,876
just me and the guard 
who'll deny I was ever here.

617
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:54,974
Ah.

618
00:32:56,787 --> 00:33:01,214
Well... in that case, I hope 
you won't mind carrying the conversation.

619
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:02,356
Have it your way.

620
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,180
You look good. What do you got going on?

621
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,899
Some weights? A little cardio?

622
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:10,699
Well, I got a lot of free time.

623
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:14,766
I just got my psychology degree.

624
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,591
And now I'm reading the russian masters --

625
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:21,362
Tolstoy, Turgenev... you know.

626
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:25,058
So, did you come out here 
to talk self-improvement?

627
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:27,885
I'm here because of my daughter.

628
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:30,610
Oh, now that's funny. So am I.

629
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:34,017
So, did you come here 
today to thank me, Keith?

630
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,044
You know, for your 15 minutes?

631
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:39,954
'Cause if it wasn't for me, no one 
would have bought that hack book of yours.

632
00:33:45,365 --> 00:33:46,906
I guess you didn't come to thank me.

633
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:51,614
Maybe -- maybe you just 
came here to gloat, hmm?

634
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:57,035
No, that doesn't seem like you much, either.

635
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,142
Why did you come here, Keith?

636
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:07,545
Former employee of yours shows up dead, 
sabotaged school bus goes over a cliff,

637
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:09,931
and I start to worry 
about Veronica's safety.

638
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,332
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

639
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:13,231
You think I had something 
to do with the crash?

640
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:17,474
Whoo. Whoo-hoo, you are priceless, Keith!

641
00:34:17,977 --> 00:34:21,710
You know, they give enough press, you'd 
find a way to put me on the grassy knoll.

642
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:25,957
Truth is... I don't care 
if you're behind the crash or not.

643
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:30,372
I just want you to know that if anything 
happens to my daughter in, say, the next...

644
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:34,810
70, 80 years, you're the one 
who's going to pay for it.

645
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:40,163
Now, did you come all the way out here
just to give me that tough-guy speech?

646
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:43,869
No, I came all the way out here 
to show how easily I can get to you.

647
00:34:44,846 --> 00:34:48,775
So just... file that away.

648
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:03,562
Hey, what's going on?

649
00:35:05,915 --> 00:35:08,733
What are you doing? You said 
you were going to ask him some questions.

650
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:13,361
I'm going to ask you some 
yes or no questions. You understand?

651
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,493
Do you understand?!

652
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,812
Have you seen Amelia Delongpre
in the last two weeks?

653
00:35:18,835 --> 00:35:21,121
Did you conspire with her 
to blackmail Kane Software?

654
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:23,968
He doesn't know. If he falls, 
he's going to break his neck.

655
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:27,819
Did you conspire with her 
to blackmail Kane Software?

656
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:31,013
Did you kill Amelia Delongpre?

657
00:35:32,613 --> 00:35:35,438
Wow. Where'd you learn 
that interrogation technique?

658
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,728
Harvard.

659
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:40,589
That's a pretty convincing hysterical 
routine you got. Where'd you learn that?

660
00:35:40,665 --> 00:35:44,083
Watching cheerleading-tryout results. 
Do you think he did it?

661
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:46,249
Nah. No one's that good a liar.

662
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:49,481
Another sweet thing is 
I'm in constant video contact

663
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:50,720
with Martha Stewart, right?

664
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:52,872
It's kind of like a 
"Dick Tracy" kind of thing.

665
00:35:52,957 --> 00:35:54,206
What the hell is this, man?

666
00:35:58,209 --> 00:36:00,090
Esta...una...

667
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:03,241
What is their word for "paper"?

668
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:04,859
Uh, "papero"?

669
00:36:06,776 --> 00:36:09,279
Okay, I'll translate. 
Just don't tell the ESL teacher

670
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:10,112
I helped you cheat.

671
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:13,872
That's an eviction notice.

672
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:15,369
You bought my grandmother's house?

673
00:36:15,436 --> 00:36:16,066
That's right.

674
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:18,610
Su casa is mi casa.

675
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:21,377
But in my defense, 
Weevil, I do need a new one.

676
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:26,658
You might have heard my former domicile 
was, uh, burned quite unexpectedly.

677
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:28,630
If you kick my family out --

678
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:30,197
have it your way -- we'll all live together

679
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:32,636
in one big, wacky sitcom family.

680
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:35,745
On second thought, I'm kicking you out.

681
00:36:35,924 --> 00:36:37,154
And on third thought,

682
00:36:37,257 --> 00:36:39,549
I wouldn't live in that roach motel
if you put a gun to my --

683
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,624
hey!

684
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,207
I was enjoying that.

685
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:45,473
Not as much as I'm going to enjoy this.

686
00:36:45,649 --> 00:36:47,467
Teacher: Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

687
00:36:47,725 --> 00:36:50,089
Break it up! Come on, guys.

688
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,802
School is not the place 
for this kind of thing.

689
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:55,045
You hear that? 
School is a place of learning.

690
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:57,439
You might want to think about 
what prison is a place of.

691
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:09,462
I usually digest a week like this
with a little help from Wallace.

692
00:37:09,553 --> 00:37:13,202
I still do, but now the conversation
is a bit flat and one-sided.

693
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:17,354
"Dear wallace, me again, 
with the latest news you've been missing.

694
00:37:17,484 --> 00:37:22,429
Keith Mars loses sheriff's race by a nose. 
Logan echolls jailed for" --

695
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,864
Are you Veronica?

696
00:37:31,977 --> 00:37:33,633
Yes.

697
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:36,520
I saw your post on the Ibiza forum.

698
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,026
Is this the girl you're looking for?

699
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,224
That's her, but actually, 
um... she's been found, but thanks --

700
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:49,076
tell me she's not still with her boyfriend.

701
00:37:49,181 --> 00:37:50,756
The guy next to her in the picture?

702
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:51,846
Yeah.

703
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:56,562
He seems cool, but I've never seen a guy lie 
right into your face and you'd never guess.

704
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:03,985
Palm Tree Lodge.

705
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:05,120
Hi, remember me?

706
00:38:05,185 --> 00:38:05,646
The blonde?

707
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:07,519
Holy crap. You know the cops have just --

708
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:10,389
I know. I'm guessing you're 
on e-mail right now. What's your address?

709
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:13,417
Nightman122@aol.Com.

710
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:20,527
The guy in the white buick, 
the night the redhead was there.

711
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:21,547
Is that him in the picture?

712
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:27,106
Yeah, that's him, but he didn't have that 
beard thing and his hair was a lot shorter.

713
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:35,250
Hi, it's me again. Amelia's boyfriend
did he have a little beard thing right here?

714
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:36,155
Yeah.

715
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:37,801
Do you remember his name?

716
00:38:40,411 --> 00:38:41,235
Clarence Wiedman.

717
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:43,244
The killer -- his name is Carlos Mercado.

718
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:44,018
Good.

719
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:46,242
Some of the marked bills 
showed up at caesars palace.

720
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,025
Now we have a name and a place.

721
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,329
All you need, but...
he's a diplomat's son, Clarence.

722
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:53,338
He'll be extradited to Argentina.

723
00:38:53,385 --> 00:38:54,980
That depends on what happens at the casino.

724
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:56,667
What are you going to do?

725
00:38:56,794 --> 00:38:58,060
You know the drill, Veronica.

726
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,862
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

727
00:39:03,636 --> 00:39:05,649
So, I did what Abel Koontz asked.

728
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:09,472
But how do you tell a dying man that 
the daughter he was looking for is gone,

729
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:13,722
that the millions he sacrificed his own
life to give her only led to her death?

730
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:15,956
Excuse me, nurse.

731
00:39:16,116 --> 00:39:18,713
Abel Koontz -- how's he doing?

732
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,964
A day or two, if he's lucky.

733
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:26,846
Thank you.

734
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,835
Answer -- you don't.

735
00:39:32,832 --> 00:39:34,289
She's trying to make it.

736
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:37,559
They just had an early snow this year, so...

737
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,072
she's just waiting for a helicopter.

738
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:43,425
But she's happy?

739
00:39:46,198 --> 00:39:46,904
Yeah.

740
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:51,347
Hoofing the Himalayas isn't exactly 
my idea of a good time, but...

741
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:54,061
she seemed to love it.

742
00:39:57,865 --> 00:40:01,948
In a family full of well-intentioned lies, 
one more won't hurt.

743
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,736
At least at the end of the day, I get to
curl up with my adorable, honest boyfriend.

744
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,465
It's the sweater, isn't it? 
Chicks can't resist argyle.

745
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:23,515
Please let go of me.

746
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:25,156
Ever the tease.

747
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:29,841
What is he doing here?

748
00:40:30,145 --> 00:40:31,158
Oh, didn't you hear?

749
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:33,683
I'm out a house. I live here now.

750
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,014
Sorry I didn't tell you.

751
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:48,434
Anyone in there?

752
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:09,495
