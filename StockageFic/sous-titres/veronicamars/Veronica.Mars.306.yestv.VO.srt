1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,088
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:02,143 --> 00:00:04,184
Hi. Do you remember me, by any chance?

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,209
- Harmony, right?
- Right.

4
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:07,160
What's your problem?

5
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:09,464
Just that I'm officially
failing mechanical engineering.

6
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:11,752
Call this number.
It's a tutor.

7
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,586
They raped Claire...
"The blonde in the middle"

8
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:19,549
I have the ATM photo from that night.

9
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:21,124
The guy who did this to me?

10
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:23,320
I have no idea of who this is.

11
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:24,880
- Is Wang Yi here?
- Why?

12
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:26,365
Because he raped this girl.

13
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:29,388
Claire? I doubt it.
She's Wang's girlfriend.

14
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:32,292
Dean O'Dell, give me a chance to explain.

15
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:34,890
I don't care what kind of point
you're trying to make.

16
00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:36,831
Fake a rape, then bring in your lawyer?

17
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:40,030
What universe do you live in?
Have you gone completely insane?

18
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:41,613
So, is this what you wanted?

19
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:44,312
You think this is what I wanted.

20
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:45,842
<i>Angela, get them in here.</i>

21
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:52,082
If you examine it closely,
dean O'Dell, the facts are still...

22
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:54,190
The facts are miss Mars' story here,

23
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:57,001
and she has the notes and evidence
to back it up, I believe.

24
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:59,563
We have photos. We have witnesses.

25
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:01,073
We have the boyfriend who helped.

26
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:03,321
There's no question Claire
lied about the rape,

27
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:05,670
and the Hearst charter's
quite clear about this.

28
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,803
You want to challenge
the charter, that's fine.

29
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:09,160
We have lawyers, too,

30
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:11,590
and they're a lot scarier
than you, Mr. Davis.

31
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:12,961
Miss Nordhouse,

32
00:01:13,028 --> 00:01:15,742
you're expelled from Hearst college
as of this moment,

33
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,183
and so is your lawyer.

34
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:18,411
That's all.

35
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:24,551
Happy?

36
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:30,290
Madam editor,

37
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,972
why didn't I read this story
in the Hearst paper?

38
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:35,071
I found the facts fairly
simple to corroborate.

39
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:37,953
I felt I had a responsibility
to exercise some caution

40
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:40,383
with a story implying the rapes
might have been faked.

41
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,100
In case you haven't noticed,
it's a powder keg out there.

42
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,722
I noticed, but I didn't see much caution

43
00:01:44,827 --> 00:01:46,752
when you implicated the pi sigma house.

44
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:49,172
You're supposed to at least
pretend to be objective.

45
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,521
I'm afraid I'm gonna need you to step down

46
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:53,013
as editor of the Free Press.

47
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:54,642
It's a student paper. You can't.

48
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:57,892
I'm a devious old man, Nish.
You'd be surprised what I can do.

49
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:00,132
You're done there as of this moment.

50
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:03,232
You'll regret this.

51
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:07,490
And so will you.

52
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:12,783
David, sorry for the wait.

53
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:14,401
It's been a hell of a week. Come on in.

54
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:15,713
Mr. Fennel?

55
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:26,691
This is hardly the first time
we've caught an athlete cheating.

56
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:27,962
With Mr. Fennel,
I'll take some of the blame.

57
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:29,671
We usually don't take
athletes in the program.

58
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,002
It's just too demanding,

59
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:33,050
Especially with standardized test
scores as low as his.

60
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:35,162
If I'd paid closer attention to...

61
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:37,390
Oh! I'm sorry.

62
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:40,111
Pardon us. My important lunch.

63
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:41,961
There better be a cookie in there.

64
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:43,433
Oh, of course there isn't.

65
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:44,871
Why do you punish me like this?

66
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:48,093
Because I'm your wife.
That's what I'm for, remember?

67
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,741
Be merciful.

68
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:58,053
She probably ate the damn cookie herself.

69
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,561
So, what do you have to say?

70
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,133
I'm with her on the mercy thing.

71
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:07,092
The whole of human knowledge
right there online,

72
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:08,570
and these papers are thin.

73
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:10,603
Am I crazy to expect better?

74
00:03:11,337 --> 00:03:13,261
And if you're confused as to what better is,

75
00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:14,761
let me direct you to the front,

76
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:18,440
where I've posted our
only example of A-caliber work.

77
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:22,453
Nice job, Ms. Mars.

78
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:25,972
Well, this should make me popular.

79
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:29,941
All righty, that's all for today.
We'll see you next time.

80
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,623
Don't forget, read both chapters... Both.

81
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:36,292
Professor, I have the Columbia studies.
Maybe we can...

82
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:37,852
Just make copies for tomorrow, Tim.

83
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:39,160
Veronica...

84
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:42,400
you free for lunch?

85
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:46,561
Databases, chemistry, psychology...
that's where the action is.

86
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,100
Are you taking any psych?

87
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:50,343
Take Wagner's class. He's the best.

88
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:51,832
If you want a double major...

89
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:55,152
Double? I haven't even
declared one major yet.

90
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:56,970
Consider this a sales talk.

91
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,282
I not only think of you
as a very bright woman in general,

92
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:02,891
I also think that you're a natural
when it comes to criminal work.

93
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:04,773
I'm not saying this
to be nice or supportive.

94
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:05,671
I'm saying it because it's true

95
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,720
and because I want
someone like you in my program.

96
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:10,181
I think I should be your faculty advisor.

97
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:12,713
I think you're capable
of great work here, Veronica,

98
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:14,171
and I'd like to help you do it.

99
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:17,723
End of sales talk.

100
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:19,303
He sounds like a hell of a guy.

101
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:20,672
Not only is he smart,

102
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:22,630
but he's the biggest gun
in the department, so

103
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:24,913
him offering to be my advisor...

104
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:26,841
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

105
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,363
But I wish you would consult with me

106
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:31,400
before you start phasing
me out of your life.

107
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:32,163
Dad...

108
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:34,611
He's smart, huh?
Is he smarter than your old man?

109
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:36,570
You know, actually,
you two have a lot in common.

110
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:37,682
You'd like him.

111
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:40,592
Can I take him in a fight? Be honest.

112
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:49,053
Hello.

113
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:51,333
Keith, hi, it's Harmony.

114
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:55,381
Hi. Uh, is everything okay?

115
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:57,192
Oh, fine, fine, actually.

116
00:04:57,485 --> 00:05:00,863
I know that our
professional relationship is over,

117
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:06,121
but I enjoyed, you know, talking.

118
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:08,562
Uh, yeah, me too.

119
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:12,452
So, my husband has taken our daughter
to Orlando for a couple of weeks.

120
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:15,873
I've got passes to the noir festival
at the orient and no one to go with.

121
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:18,291
And I was thinking,
you're a guy with an interest in...

122
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:19,782
In... noir business?

123
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:21,011
Right.

124
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:25,072
And maybe you might want to,
you know, join me,

125
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:27,573
just grab a movie.

126
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:30,632
Keith?

127
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:37,230
I got a text message saying
you wanted to see me.

128
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:40,593
I think it was "needed",
not "wanted".

129
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,663
Ah, how did you get this number?

130
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:46,600
I don't give it out to anyone.

131
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:51,103
You're not the only one at this school
who has certain... gifts.

132
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:54,432
Gifts... That was my grandmother's term

133
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,642
for female...

134
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:58,683
just so you know.

135
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,230
What did you need to see me about?

136
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:04,782
You know, Hearst has a pretty strict
policy when it comes to plagiarism.

137
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,062
Yes. Did someone plagiarize?

138
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:09,211
You did.

139
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:11,093
One of your classmates turned you in.

140
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:12,830
There's a program we run to check papers.

141
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:14,392
It scans online for similar phrases.

142
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:16,001
I know how it works, but I...

143
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:18,180
Your paper lit up like a Christmas tree.

144
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:20,860
What?! I didn't copy my paper.

145
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:22,865
So I assumed, but...

146
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:26,848
well, that's your paper there.

147
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:35,020
There's no way. Someone is trying
to screw with me.

148
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,260
You think it's me?

149
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:37,740
You think I'm trying to get you
out of Landry's class

150
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:38,833
because I don't like you?

151
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,262
Wait, you don't like me?

152
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:42,123
This will have to come
to Landry's attention.

153
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:45,412
It's a bummer, since I know
that you and he are now close.

154
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:47,502
- So, how about I give you a choice?
- Choice?

155
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:50,002
Either you can tell him or I can.

156
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:52,171
Tell who what?

157
00:07:19,948 --> 00:07:23,410
<i>Hi, Infidelity</i>

158
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:29,421
Hey, pal.

159
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:31,593
Can you believe this?

160
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:33,033
Some lady threw her husband
out of the house.

161
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:35,650
Right now she's having
a garage sale of all of his stuff.

162
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:39,673
"London calling"... Vinyl...
Unscratched... 99 cents.

163
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,112
Awesome, right?

164
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:43,783
My would-be-mentor professor
just gave me three days

165
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:45,781
to prove I didn't plagiarize a major paper.

166
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:48,502
The universe is currently
aligned against me, so

167
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:49,493
nothing's awesome.

168
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,470
You know what?
You should come bowling.

169
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:53,223
Bowling?

170
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:56,903
You mean, like, just the two of us?

171
00:07:56,996 --> 00:07:58,090
Yeah.

172
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,902
And Wallace... You know, the whole gang.

173
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:02,283
Thursday nights are $1 night at fun bowl.

174
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,933
Will bowling take my mind off of the fact
that everyone's out to get me?

175
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:07,460
It worked for Nixon.

176
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:09,131
It'll be fun.

177
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:13,141
Dude, I don't get this sad-clown face.

178
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:15,460
I thought he let you drop the class.

179
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:17,553
I haven't decided if I'm gonna.

180
00:08:17,808 --> 00:08:19,140
What's to decide?

181
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:23,442
Two weeks after add/drops, he lets you
drop a class that's kicking your ass.

182
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:26,290
That's a gift. Take it and smile.

183
00:08:26,877 --> 00:08:30,063
Okay, okay, 5-On-5 scrimmage.
Let's go. Move.

184
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,393
Fennel, you run first team today.

185
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:34,942
Wait, coach...

186
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:36,692
You want to keep your starting job, Mason?

187
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,222
Start showing me something.

188
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:39,501
Let's go!

189
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:44,952
Apparently, if you look hard enough,

190
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:47,263
everyone looks like
they're hiding dark secrets.

191
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,610
So, if you're looking for
something specific,

192
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:51,941
you got to try the direct approach.

193
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:56,482
Hi, some of you might know
who I am... Veronica Mars.

194
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,291
Okay, so, I wrote that paper,

195
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:05,012
and now someone in this class
has accused me of plagiarizing it,

196
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:06,832
which I absolutely did not.

197
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,092
So, I was kind of wondering who it was.

198
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:15,142
So, is this silence like
it wasn't any of you

199
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:18,121
or like no one wants to face me?

200
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:22,770
Or like no one actually did it
and our weaselly T.A. is trying to...

201
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,531
I did it. Jeff Ratner.

202
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:30,333
Ratner. Um, have we met before?

203
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:33,631
We have, but you probably
don't remember, so whatever.

204
00:09:34,298 --> 00:09:37,752
- So, you reported me. Why...
- Why?

205
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:39,792
Maybe 'cause I'm a common-man kind of guy,

206
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,440
and I like it when some teacher's pet

207
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:43,320
who's destroying the curve for everyone

208
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:44,850
gets exposed as a cheat.

209
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:48,022
Yeah, you cheated. I caught you.

210
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:49,891
Deal with it.

211
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:01,982
Wallace?

212
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:02,942
Not here.

213
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:04,182
And you would be?

214
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:05,331
Evil Wallace.

215
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:07,251
And I know Veronica Mars doesn't hang

216
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:09,141
with the evil and morally bankrupt.

217
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,962
Evil Wallace wouldn't have
confessed and faced punishment.

218
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,232
Nope, you're regular Wallace.

219
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:17,402
Well, regular Wallace
has been given a chance

220
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,793
to drop mechanical engineering scot-free,

221
00:10:19,947 --> 00:10:22,152
which would mean giving it up as my major.

222
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:24,710
I mean, man.

223
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:28,601
This was the first thing I was ever into...

224
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:30,883
Figuring out how stuff works.

225
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:34,433
It's all I ever wanted to do.

226
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,873
You'll work it out. I know it.

227
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:40,202
That's also very regular Wallace.

228
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:43,281
Oh, by the way, who's the guy
you bought the test from?

229
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:47,853
So, this whole after-school-special
monologue here

230
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:49,921
didn't make much of an impression on you.

231
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:54,721
His name's Max. He's in Clark hall.

232
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:56,763
Why?

233
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,150
Hi, Max? I was hoping you could help me.

234
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:11,331
Well, I'm hoping I can, too.

235
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,110
Okay, so, you want a new paper
on modern forensics

236
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,941
but different enough
so that he won't guess who...

237
00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:22,642
No. This paper or
one like it is posted online.

238
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,060
I need to find it.

239
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:26,811
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you already have that paper.

240
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:32,840
I told you, my paper got zapped
by the plagiarism scanner.

241
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:34,932
I need to find out why and from what.

242
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:36,952
Okay, whatever.

243
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:38,141
Uh...

244
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:40,033
hmm...

245
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:42,921
ah, here you go.

246
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:45,041
That's my paper.

247
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,012
See, that's why I never
use these free sites...

248
00:11:47,096 --> 00:11:48,090
No security.

249
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,683
Checkers will catch you every time.

250
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:53,590
Posted last year?
Somebody must have faked that.

251
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:55,921
I wrote this paper by myself last week.

252
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,811
This must be a real Kafkaesque
experience for you.

253
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,131
Does it say who posted it?

254
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:04,003
Uh...

255
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:09,242
rory.finch@hearstcollege.org

256
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,481
That's not you, is it?
That might explain everything.

257
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,410
And pencils down.

258
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:19,651
Bring them up.

259
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:23,563
Thank you.

260
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:25,613
Have a good day.

261
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:30,981
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:32,092
What about?

263
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,033
I called time, and you kept writing.

264
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:35,791
I can't accept your test.

265
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:36,602
Yeah, I was just finishing my...

266
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:38,373
Time was called. I'm sorry.

267
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:40,402
So you keep saying, dude. Come on.

268
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:43,691
Do you have any idea who I am?

269
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:45,711
I don't, and I don't care.

270
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:49,243
Rules are rules for everyone,
no matter who they think...

271
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:58,602
That is classic.

272
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,723
It was a proctor.
The professor wasn't even there.

273
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,521
That is so awesome.

274
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:07,353
But I do not condone it in any way

275
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:08,860
and had nothing to do
with your decision to do it.

276
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,383
- Do what?
- Cheating.

277
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:12,670
I told him it was wrong and
he was gonna burn in hell.

278
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,092
You're gonna burn in hell, man.

279
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:15,780
I'll see you there.

280
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:17,250
You cheated?

281
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:19,490
I took 10 extra seconds on a test.

282
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:20,903
I thought you loved bad boys.

283
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:23,800
I do, but if that's your idea of bad,

284
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,063
you need to turn in your badge.

285
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,850
Hey, do you want
to go bowling tomorrow night?

286
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:30,743
Sure, unless it's some
"critical analysis of bowling" seminar.

287
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:33,410
No, it's just Wallace and his roommate
And some other guys.

288
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:34,493
Could be fun.

289
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:37,673
What?

290
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:42,100
Just Mac's had this project all week,

291
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,050
and Parker's all alone.

292
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:45,603
I think we should invite her along.

293
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:47,271
How very "Emma" of you.

294
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:49,540
Did you just make a Jane Austen reference?

295
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:53,913
It's official. The end of days are upon us.

296
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:57,870
Hey, Parker, what's up?

297
00:13:58,358 --> 00:13:59,423
Nothing.

298
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,650
I think I just ate something's beak.

299
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:03,510
Hey, do you want to come bowling
with us tomorrow night?

300
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:04,680
Bowling?

301
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:06,580
Why?

302
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:10,073
You know, hatchet burying, et cetera.
Plus, Nixon found it soothing.

303
00:14:10,468 --> 00:14:11,612
Look, if you don't want to go

304
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:14,843
because you'd rather
see me fed to bears, fine.

305
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,710
So, would you call that
an accurate depiction

306
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,061
of life as a private eye?

307
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,203
Pretty close.

308
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:27,731
I personally have never been hired
to locate a Maltese Falcon, per se,

309
00:14:27,878 --> 00:14:30,443
but there was the case of the maltese dog.

310
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:32,040
Ooh. Solid-gold dog?

311
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:33,151
Real dog.

312
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:37,681
This guy got some lowlife
to kidnap his ex-wife's show dog.

313
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:42,102
Not exactly how I imagined
the criminal underworld.

314
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:45,533
If they were all like Peter Lorre, my
job would be a little more interesting.

315
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:48,982
Thanks, Keith, for coming.

316
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,782
These days my husband
and I are just logistics.

317
00:14:52,197 --> 00:14:55,092
I can't remember the last time
I just hung out and talked.

318
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:59,662
Sure, it's great talking to someone
for whom "Bogart" isn't a verb.

319
00:15:02,337 --> 00:15:03,743
Well, good night.

320
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:14,052
The upside of landing Weevil
the maintenance job...

321
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:17,283
I get to babysit his keys while
he's away at his cousin's wedding.

322
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:20,711
So if I want to check
the Hearst e-mail files for Rory Finch,

323
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:22,442
I can do it on my own time.

324
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,740
Of course, he didn't bother
to label them, so...

325
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:45,501
Veronica?

326
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,972
Dean O'Dell, I'm so glad you're here.

327
00:15:55,217 --> 00:15:58,561
I lost an earring, um, at the meeting,

328
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:00,483
And I wanted to find it
before they vacuumed.

329
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:01,783
But it was...

330
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:06,503
Well, it's a good thing
you happened to show up.

331
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,952
Well, go ahead. Search away.

332
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,331
<i>McCall is starting to go straight back...</i>

333
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:19,002
You follow boxing?

334
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:25,352
I only follow sports that are done to music.

335
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:30,171
Wouldn't this be more comfortable,
say, at home?

336
00:16:31,517 --> 00:16:33,121
Kind of my little secret.

337
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:34,632
The wife's against it all...

338
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:37,952
The scotch, the cigars,
the televised violence.

339
00:16:38,357 --> 00:16:40,703
So, I kind of sneak it in
whenever she has a charity function,

340
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:42,970
a work function, whatever other functions

341
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,052
modern women seem to have all the time.

342
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:47,880
That's a haymaker.

343
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:53,070
So, if you run into her, you didn't see me.

344
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:55,551
Some things she just doesn't need to know.

345
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:57,273
Absolutely.

346
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:04,873
Now, I expect these formulas
to be memorized as soon as possible.

347
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:10,972
Mr. Fennel, I was under
the impression you dropped the class.

348
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:12,873
I said I'd think about it.

349
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,530
You sure this is a smart choice?

350
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:17,800
Probably not, but you've seen
my standardized test scores.

351
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:19,842
I'm not a particularly smart guy, right?

352
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,290
I'm taking a zero.
There are four more tests.

353
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:24,810
If I average C's or above
on all of them, I'll pass.

354
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:26,513
Even I can do that math.

355
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,232
Okay, there you go.

356
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:38,630
You're gonna ruin your eyes
with all that book learning.

357
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:41,370
I stayed in Winkler's class.
I took the zero.

358
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,821
I need to study.

359
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,983
I suspected that might happen.

360
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:51,871
So, you figure out what was up
with that plagiarism thing?

361
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:55,850
As a matter of fact, a paper
just like mine was posted online

362
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,751
by rory.finch@hearstcollege.org...

363
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,831
A Hearst e-Mail,

364
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:01,850
But there's never been
a student by that name.

365
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:04,130
The address was set up three days ago

366
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:07,912
from an I.P. Address at...
get this... the Neptune Grand.

367
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:09,543
After you turned in your paper.

368
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:13,210
So, you're off the hook. It's over.

369
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:16,142
Ah, my innocent and naive Wallace.

370
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,572
When I find out who did this

371
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:20,160
and I make them sing like
the proverbial fat lady,

372
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,630
that's when it's over.

373
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:25,182
Okay, you're Rocky.

374
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:27,191
Mechanical engineering is Mr. T.

375
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,943
"Eye of the tiger" is playing.

376
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:30,260
I'll see you later on.

377
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:31,453
Yeah.

378
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:33,400
What?

379
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:34,970
When?

380
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,601
Boom. I'm set.

381
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:42,443
Are you ready for a night of bowling, huh?

382
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:43,661
Fun, fun, fun.

383
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,153
Fun? I'm pretty sure
I won't ever be having fun again.

384
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:49,671
Ah, damn, that's tonight.

385
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:51,773
I'm sorry, man, but it's impossible.

386
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,521
No, dude, you have to go.
I invited Veronica.

387
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:56,502
I said there's a whole gang going,
including you.

388
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:57,561
So, if you're not there...

389
00:18:57,646 --> 00:18:59,212
It's gonna look like you asked her out.

390
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:01,771
Yeah, that sounds awkward.

391
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:05,220
But it's not my problem. This is.

392
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:08,560
Hey, dad.

393
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:09,742
Hey, honey.

394
00:19:11,157 --> 00:19:14,280
So, tomorrow's "Out of the Past".

395
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:16,103
It's one of my all-time favorites.

396
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:18,483
I've got a conference at the Neptune grand.

397
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,593
I don't think I'm gonna be free, but

398
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:21,652
I'd like to do something else.

399
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,672
Okay, well, keep me posted.

400
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:24,830
Bye.

401
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:29,551
So, for bowling,
"earnest, I'm really bowling"

402
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:33,142
or "I'm too cool for bowling,
and I'm only here ironically"?

403
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:37,120
When did crappy old shirts
with stupid stuff on them become cool?

404
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:39,691
I don't know why I ask you these things.

405
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:41,133
I don't either, frankly.

406
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,331
Were you just making a date?

407
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:45,593
Look at you, Mr. Noir secrets.

408
00:19:45,665 --> 00:19:47,672
No, I was just seeing
if Harmony wanted to see...

409
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:48,801
Harmony?

410
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,231
Harmony with the husband
who isn't cheating, Harmony?

411
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:52,400
Yeah, so?

412
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:55,362
So, you're going on a date
with a married woman.

413
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:56,893
It's not a date.

414
00:19:57,686 --> 00:19:59,581
We saw a movie, had a drink, and talked.

415
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,053
Which is a date.

416
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,583
That's all we did.

417
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:06,333
We're mature adults
who happen to be friends.

418
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:11,340
And I like the dumb shirt.

419
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:14,341
Hi, honey, I'm home.

420
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,913
Hey, moosetastic, hmm? What's that?

421
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,491
I'm so tired of explaining.

422
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:23,880
Hey, you've lived here a while.
Do you have any inside connections?

423
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,310
Inside connections like what?

424
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:28,750
Like someone on staff you're pals with

425
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:32,690
who might sneak you info
they maybe aren't supposed to?

426
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:39,291
There you go.

427
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:43,141
Your pal? Of course.

428
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:47,033
Hi, Tina. This is Veronica.
Veronica...

429
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:49,250
Hi. What's going on, Logan?

430
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:50,813
I got a little favor.

431
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:52,291
Anything.

432
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:56,501
I'm trying to find out
if a person was registered here...

433
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:58,533
- Someone named...
- Rory Finch.

434
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,470
This isn't illegal, is it?

435
00:21:01,746 --> 00:21:03,600
No, I'm just kidding. Hold on.

436
00:21:05,137 --> 00:21:06,560
Yeah, Rory Finch.

437
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:08,293
She stayed with us for a night a week ago

438
00:21:08,355 --> 00:21:11,002
and a few other times
over the last couple of months.

439
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:12,623
Always one-night stays.

440
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,972
Is there an address, credit-card number?

441
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:17,101
Post-Office box and paid in cash.

442
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:18,241
All I've got's a name.

443
00:21:19,157 --> 00:21:22,281
If I left my cell number, could you
call me if they check back in?

444
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,730
Sure.

445
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:25,232
Any friend of Logan's...

446
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:27,221
Girlfriend of Logan's.

447
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:29,653
Come on, boyfriend, let's bowl.

448
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:34,731
Hey, Veronica.

449
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:38,991
Cool shirt. I went the post-ironic route.

450
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,251
Hey, Piz. Where's...

451
00:21:41,415 --> 00:21:43,250
Oh, hey, uh...

452
00:21:43,377 --> 00:21:45,933
Logan... Her boyfriend. We met.

453
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:50,010
So, where's Wallace
and the rest of this gang?

454
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,672
Right, yeah, the gang.

455
00:21:52,117 --> 00:21:55,153
Well, Wallace had a crisis
so he can't make it, and, um...

456
00:21:56,555 --> 00:21:59,383
So, it's just...

457
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,440
Veronica. Hi.

458
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,102
Hey, Parker, how's it going?

459
00:22:05,136 --> 00:22:07,412
- You met Logan, right?
- Yeah, hi, sure.

460
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,631
- And you remember Piz.
- Yeah, hi.

461
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:14,001
So, um, where is everyone?

462
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:18,143
Hey, shoes. We need shoes.

463
00:22:18,268 --> 00:22:19,220
Yeah, let's get shoes.

464
00:22:19,446 --> 00:22:22,482
Darling, what size are those dainty feet
that I love so much?

465
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:23,552
Six.

466
00:22:23,835 --> 00:22:25,013
So, bowling, huh?

467
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:27,311
Is this something you do a lot...
You and the gang?

468
00:22:29,535 --> 00:22:32,292
- So, shoe size?
- A whole gang?

469
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:33,523
Well, Parker...

470
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:36,042
some people couldn't make it, but it's...

471
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:37,740
I can't believe you invite me out

472
00:22:37,777 --> 00:22:40,063
For the first time since I was raped

473
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:43,861
on some cheesy double-date
setup with that Piz guy.

474
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:47,391
It's not a setup, I swear.

475
00:22:50,815 --> 00:22:53,501
Size seven, but this is not fun.

476
00:22:56,136 --> 00:23:01,302
Yahoo! That's 2/3 of a turkey, bitches!

477
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,271
Hoo!

478
00:23:03,277 --> 00:23:06,212
Oh, you're in a deep hole,
Piznarski.

479
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:09,801
We're gonna totally humiliate you.
But you know, no pressure.

480
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:11,140
Refreshments?

481
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:12,691
10 martinis.

482
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,832
Anyone else? Dearest darling?

483
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:19,930
Come on, Piznarski, we're dying!

484
00:23:21,627 --> 00:23:24,291
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is fun.

485
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:28,472
Veronica, I'm sorry I was so grumpy before.

486
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:29,401
You're right.

487
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:32,681
It feels good to just be out in the world.

488
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:36,953
Oh, no! 7-10?

489
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:39,022
That's the worst spare in bowling!

490
00:23:39,075 --> 00:23:41,101
Whatever shall you do?

491
00:23:41,346 --> 00:23:43,342
Come on, Piz. We need that spare.

492
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:45,100
Don't blow it, Piz.

493
00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:50,583
So, what's the story with him?

494
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:54,032
Him? Nothing.
I've got a boyfriend.

495
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:55,542
No. No, no, no, no.

496
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,742
I mean, is he free?

497
00:23:58,807 --> 00:24:00,300
Free as in...

498
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:03,051
...as in he's cute, don't you think?

499
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,582
That went straight to hell.

500
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:12,132
- Find out what he thinks of me.
- What?

501
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:20,410
Oh, no more fun. Too exhausting.

502
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:23,400
Next time we'll get in some
weight training before we bowl.

503
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,533
Just the soap opera.

504
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:27,551
Parker wants me to find out
if Piz likes her.

505
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:29,100
What do I do? Pass a note?

506
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,050
Scribble it on his trapper keeper?

507
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,831
Hey, did you get an "A"?

508
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:36,593
Yeah, but the cheating kind of
cheapens the whole thing.

509
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:38,352
You're only cheating yourself.

510
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,381
Yeah, well, I got off easy. You know that...

511
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:44,102
...kid Horshack from that prison experiment?

512
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:46,812
He got caught doing two tests.
They busted him.

513
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:48,702
And guess who else.

514
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:52,990
That psycho guard that
was tormenting him so bad, Rafe,

515
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:56,713
yeah, he was taking his test for him.

516
00:24:57,715 --> 00:25:00,560
Can you believe that? People are crazy, huh?

517
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:04,991
Thank god. Real food.

518
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:09,091
Good evening, Mr. Echolls.

519
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:11,990
That voice... I recognize that voice.

520
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,332
Wait.

521
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:15,000
Have a good evening.

522
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,062
Excuse me.

523
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:21,290
Jeff Ratner... What a surprise.

524
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:27,092
You guys know each other?

525
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:30,203
You want to tell him, Ratner?

526
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,213
What's to tell?

527
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:34,250
This is the guy who's trying to get me
tossed out of Landry's class.

528
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,861
You should be. You cheated.

529
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,593
Now it turns out you work
at the Neptune Grand,

530
00:25:38,677 --> 00:25:41,801
which happens to be where
the fake paper was posted from.

531
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,430
Strange, huh, Rory Finch?

532
00:25:45,507 --> 00:25:46,463
What are you talking about?

533
00:25:46,526 --> 00:25:49,060
I don't "happen to work here".
I've worked here two years.

534
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:50,181
You've seen me a hundred times, but

535
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,661
you don't notice the little people

536
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:54,760
'cause you're too busy lounging
with captain moneybags here.

537
00:25:55,228 --> 00:25:56,581
That's admiral moneybags.

538
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,730
- I trust our steak's to your liking?
- Always.

539
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,880
Good night, then.

540
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:03,563
That's my girl, spreading sunshine
wherever she goes.

541
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:06,843
That boy doesn't know it yet,
but he's the living dead.

542
00:26:13,578 --> 00:26:14,602
Dude!

543
00:26:15,437 --> 00:26:16,301
Dude!

544
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:20,562
Hey, look, man, it's school policy

545
00:26:20,697 --> 00:26:22,291
that if you're dead,
I get to keep your stuff, so

546
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:24,412
if you are dead, just don't say anything.

547
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:30,980
Well, that's disappointing.

548
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:33,022
Oh, crap.

549
00:26:33,478 --> 00:26:37,053
Hey, I could have just left you there
and taken your iPod, so...

550
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:39,220
you're welcome.

551
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:46,812
Big shot!

552
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:49,221
On the left!

553
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,632
Coach.

554
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:55,370
I'm sorry. I missed my alarm.

555
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:56,372
Come here.

556
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:57,640
If it ain't Sleeping Beauty.

557
00:26:57,728 --> 00:26:59,210
Play the game, Mason.

558
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:03,201
You have a chance to start
this year as a freshman.

559
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,742
Don't blow it by staying up
all night partying.

560
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:07,460
You need to buckle down, Fennel.

561
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:09,800
- Now, go suit up.
- Okay.

562
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:12,110
Take a big shot!

563
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:15,631
Eight years ago,
I was sent to ask Brad Stark

564
00:27:15,698 --> 00:27:17,102
if he liked Suzy Doyle.

565
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,933
The two of them never spoke again.

566
00:27:19,188 --> 00:27:20,393
In the intervening years,

567
00:27:20,465 --> 00:27:21,791
I haven't gotten any better at this.

568
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:24,032
We'll talk later, all right? Bye.

569
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,193
Hey, Veronica.

570
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,392
Hey, Piz, thanks for bowling
the other night. That was fun.

571
00:27:28,466 --> 00:27:31,500
Good. Yeah, great.
Did Logan have a good time?

572
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:33,793
He did, as well. We both did.

573
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:37,103
So, everyone had a good time.

574
00:27:37,927 --> 00:27:39,433
I declare bowling a success.

575
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:42,520
And Parker had a good time, too.

576
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:44,410
Oh, yeah, good. She seems nice.

577
00:27:44,505 --> 00:27:47,760
You think so? The reason I ask is because...

578
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:53,672
I'm sorry. I'm having a traumatic-stress
flashback to the sixth grade.

579
00:27:55,098 --> 00:27:57,730
Parker thought you were cool...

580
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:01,710
...and also cute.

581
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:03,763
Oh.

582
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:05,260
Well...

583
00:28:06,247 --> 00:28:07,480
oh.

584
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:09,141
Oh, what?

585
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:12,513
No, she's really nice,
but she's not really my type.

586
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:14,501
Oh, you have a type.

587
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:16,321
Yeah, kind of.

588
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:18,251
And it's not her.

589
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:24,493
Okay, so, remember,
this was just a practice quiz,

590
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:27,830
but all this material
will be on your next exam.

591
00:28:27,935 --> 00:28:32,271
Mr. Fennel... 67... "D" plus.
That's a real improvement.

592
00:28:38,108 --> 00:28:40,212
Hey, Veronica, guess what I just found out.

593
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:41,521
Piz has a radio show.

594
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:42,970
- I know.
- Tonight.

595
00:28:43,047 --> 00:28:45,342
You know,
the station's right in student union.

596
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,711
- Let's drop by.
- It'll be late.

597
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:49,602
Oh, late schmate. It'll be fun.

598
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:52,583
Everybody's always saying that.

599
00:28:52,868 --> 00:28:56,862
Join us next time when we ask,
"why does everyone hate America?

600
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,612
Is the rest of the world crazy
or just stupid?"

601
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:03,340
Well, that's it for the Piz.
Stick around for Club Flush.

602
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,100
This is so cool!

603
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:13,343
Why didn't you say you had a radio show?

604
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:16,841
You know, I meant to mention it,
but I guess it just slipped my mind.

605
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:19,800
We were just in the neighborhood.

606
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,843
I always wanted to know how it all works.

607
00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:26,571
Maybe you could show me
what all this stuff is sometime.

608
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:29,742
The guy who does the club and house
show is supposed to start now, so...

609
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,191
What's everyone doing after?

610
00:29:32,255 --> 00:29:34,181
I could totally use Pizza.

611
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:35,541
You can have this.

612
00:29:38,255 --> 00:29:39,332
I only licked it a little.

613
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,111
Hey, Veronica.

614
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:43,092
Hey, Mercer. You're the club and house show?

615
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:45,202
The down-and-dirty clubbin'-est.

616
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:47,540
Hi, I'm Mercer.

617
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:48,311
Hi.

618
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:50,991
Well, I haven't eaten dinner,
so I could grab a slice.

619
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:56,792
Actually, we got to go.
We'll see you later, Piz.

620
00:29:57,486 --> 00:29:59,392
Nice meeting you, Parker.

621
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,112
Parker, are you okay?

622
00:30:01,187 --> 00:30:04,463
That guy Mercer. I just... His cologne.

623
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:05,983
I smelled it before.

624
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:07,153
Yeah?

625
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:09,622
It's, like, burned into my brain...

626
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:12,862
from the night I was raped.

627
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:17,552
I mean, I can't be sure, but...

628
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:21,060
I just got the worst...

629
00:30:21,105 --> 00:30:23,023
Vibe? Yeah.

630
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,433
He'll be in there for the next two hours.

631
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:26,360
I'll look into it.

632
00:30:26,438 --> 00:30:29,571
Because I've still got
24 hours with Weevil's keys.

633
00:31:11,855 --> 00:31:12,702
You want to know why?

634
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:15,671
'Cause I'll stick my foot so far up your...

635
00:31:16,776 --> 00:31:17,930
Hey.

636
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:22,392
Could someone let me know
when some girl is in my office?

637
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:24,893
What are you doing here?

638
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:26,420
I'm here about the rapes at Hearst.

639
00:31:26,516 --> 00:31:27,662
Already aware of them.

640
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:29,710
Thanks for coming by. I'm real busy.

641
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:31,181
This is sketchy, but...

642
00:31:31,246 --> 00:31:33,732
If it's Bigfoot, we checked.
He's got an alibi.

643
00:31:33,796 --> 00:31:37,320
Oh, rape humor. It never gets old.

644
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,280
I know one of the victims.

645
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:44,053
Yesterday she thought she recognized
the guy who raped her by his cologne.

646
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:47,340
And then I just happened to be in his room,

647
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:49,370
and I saw some clippers.

648
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:50,850
Does this man have a name?

649
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:52,240
Mercer Hayes.

650
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,593
The kid who ran the card room
that got robbed.

651
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:55,633
That's him.

652
00:31:56,775 --> 00:31:57,762
What?

653
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,942
We finally found the stolen cashbox, and...

654
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:03,960
along with all the money,
we found something interesting...

655
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:06,502
Two vials of G.H.B...

656
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:11,250
The same date-rape drug
the rapist used on two of his victims.

657
00:32:14,146 --> 00:32:16,670
Hey, how's my Diaper Dandy?

658
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:18,470
Here to get some extra work in?

659
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:22,683
Actually, coach, I got this class
that's killing me.

660
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:25,032
I could drop it, change majors,

661
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:27,402
but it's what I want to do for a living.

662
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,180
I think I need to take the semester off.

663
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:33,761
I'd be back by mid-season.

664
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:35,862
I know you don't have to keep me
on scholarship.

665
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:38,590
Keep the scholarship, Wallace.

666
00:32:39,485 --> 00:32:42,890
But you do realize you're
throwing away your chance to start.

667
00:32:42,987 --> 00:32:45,673
You probably won't smell
the court this year.

668
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:47,330
Are you prepared for that?

669
00:32:49,487 --> 00:32:53,523
I assumed after I called Ratner
on this Rory Finch thing it was over,

670
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:57,871
until my new friend Tina Callas
told me he just made a new reservation.

671
00:32:57,955 --> 00:32:59,052
You rang?

672
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:00,701
There you are, miss.

673
00:33:21,536 --> 00:33:22,571
What are you doing here?

674
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:24,933
Just grabbing a drink. Are you...

675
00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:26,880
2 martinis sir.

676
00:33:33,147 --> 00:33:33,970
What are you doing?

677
00:33:34,057 --> 00:33:37,040
Honey, I told you, it's completely
innocent. We're just friends.

678
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:39,502
"You think the other person's great

679
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:42,322
and you have a great time
doing stuff together" friends?

680
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:44,272
And there's nothing wrong with that.

681
00:33:44,595 --> 00:33:49,932
Unless your friend is a very
attractive, unhappily married woman.

682
00:33:50,018 --> 00:33:53,160
Veronica, I know a little more
about this than you.

683
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:55,172
Don't worry.

684
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:57,980
I worry.

685
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:05,383
Okay, number 906, behind which
lies the answer to everything.

686
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,171
- Veronica Mars?
- Mrs. O'Dell?

687
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:17,290
I was looking into a term-paper thing.

688
00:34:17,828 --> 00:34:20,920
I'm sorry. Wrong room.

689
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:27,440
So, now I'm actually confused.

690
00:34:27,638 --> 00:34:31,440
What does the dean's wife have
to do with the mysterious Rory Finch?

691
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:33,672
Oh.

692
00:34:35,447 --> 00:34:36,953
Veronica.

693
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,481
Professor, hi.

694
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:42,211
I got off on the wrong floor.

695
00:34:42,275 --> 00:34:43,310
Ah.

696
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:45,510
Well, nice seeing you.

697
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:46,581
See you in class.

698
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:53,770
Rory Finch?

699
00:34:56,236 --> 00:34:57,470
Perfect.

700
00:34:57,605 --> 00:34:59,313
Oh. Oh.

701
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,263
You know what they say about martinis.

702
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:04,451
Something involving breasts?

703
00:35:06,377 --> 00:35:08,181
One's too few, et cetera.

704
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:11,023
I'll have to settle for one
if I'm gonna make it home.

705
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:16,920
We don't have to worry,
I mean, if we don't want to.

706
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:18,383
What do you mean?

707
00:35:18,726 --> 00:35:20,282
I mean...

708
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:29,353
well, honestly,
I need to tell you something.

709
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:33,372
I wouldn't, but all alone at the house,

710
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:36,213
I've got a lot of time on my hands to think.

711
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:37,733
And one of the things that I think

712
00:35:37,797 --> 00:35:39,591
is knowing that I don't want to be

713
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:44,980
lying on my deathbed someday
just counting regrets.

714
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,021
I'm still not sure what you mean.

715
00:35:48,865 --> 00:35:55,493
I mean, I got a room here if...

716
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:01,970
If we think we might have use for...

717
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:03,653
Oh, no.

718
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:08,291
Harmony, I don't know
if that's such a good idea right now.

719
00:36:08,348 --> 00:36:10,852
Oh, no, Keith, I'm sorry. I've ruined...

720
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,223
No, you didn't ruin anything

721
00:36:13,665 --> 00:36:18,653
because I really, really,
really want to say yes.

722
00:36:18,735 --> 00:36:23,293
You are an amazing woman, and I just can't.

723
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:28,092
I don't want to be on my deathbed
counting regrets either,

724
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,872
but I just can't figure out
which I'd regret more...

725
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:33,553
Going up or not going up.

726
00:36:33,645 --> 00:36:35,523
So, I have to...

727
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:40,352
I'm sorry.

728
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:04,533
Oh, man. I totally didn't see that sign.

729
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:08,421
Are you okay?

730
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:09,721
Are you okay?

731
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:11,671
Yeah, yeah, I am okay.
I'm okay.

732
00:37:12,295 --> 00:37:15,211
Man, I'll get... I'll get some help.

733
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:57,052
Dad? This nutritious breakfast
isn't gonna eat itself!

734
00:37:57,145 --> 00:37:58,842
Come on. Up and at 'em.

735
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:04,081
Dad!

736
00:38:05,627 --> 00:38:07,281
Dad, come on.

737
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:23,031
Miss Mars! Do you need something?

738
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:24,842
Just to give you this.

739
00:38:26,546 --> 00:38:30,393
This proves that whoever posted
the paper I supposedly copied online

740
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:32,392
did so after I had already turned mine in.

741
00:38:32,706 --> 00:38:35,781
I didn't cheat, this proves it,
and that's the end of that.

742
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:38,391
Great. So, you're off the hook.

743
00:38:38,697 --> 00:38:40,402
Did you prove who did it?

744
00:38:40,756 --> 00:38:43,541
More process of elimination.

745
00:38:43,817 --> 00:38:47,580
But I'm still not sure why,
so I thought I'd ask.

746
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:49,461
Why did you do it?

747
00:38:50,257 --> 00:38:53,980
Why did you want me
to follow that trail to Rory Finch?

748
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:55,892
You could get in a lot of trouble, you know,

749
00:38:55,946 --> 00:38:57,780
- If I decided to...
- Let me interrupt

750
00:38:57,857 --> 00:39:01,853
and preface this entire conversation
with this.

751
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,901
I didn't do it,
and you can't prove that I did.

752
00:39:06,705 --> 00:39:11,273
Hypothetically, I can see where
one might think someone in my position

753
00:39:11,398 --> 00:39:13,661
would want to set up
this sort of treasure hunt.

754
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:16,672
I mean, after all, I was professor
Landry's protégé for three years

755
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:18,101
before you showed up...

756
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:20,463
His star pupil, right-hand man.

757
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:24,022
I got his dry cleaning,
ordered Chinese when we worked late.

758
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:26,291
I was like you.

759
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,053
"What a professor!

760
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,023
He's smart, charming,
such a great guy".

761
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:33,953
And then you find out he had
an affair with the dean's wife.

762
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:37,680
There were others before.
The dean's wife... That's recent.

763
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:44,673
A person in my position might have
thought he was doing you a favor.

764
00:39:45,038 --> 00:39:47,012
Since the professor thinks so highly of you,

765
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:50,420
It might be helpful to demonstrate
who he really is

766
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:53,981
before you go too far under his spell.

767
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:58,513
Do me a favor, will you?
Don't do me any more favors.

768
00:40:02,187 --> 00:40:03,373
What's this?

769
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:06,562
You have the same kind of
crazy press-clipping board

770
00:40:06,616 --> 00:40:08,702
every movie serial killer keeps.

771
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:11,370
You know, there's been
no DNA evidence so far...

772
00:40:12,165 --> 00:40:13,593
No semen, no hair.

773
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:14,830
Makes you wonder.

774
00:40:16,357 --> 00:40:17,272
Huh.

775
00:40:17,756 --> 00:40:19,810
You see something I don't?

776
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,290
Maybe.

777
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:25,292
You really thought Ratner did it?

778
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:28,841
Oh, crap.

779
00:40:30,785 --> 00:40:34,450
No, no. I did not put those in there.

780
00:40:35,987 --> 00:40:38,680
Hooke's law and a prismatic rod.

781
00:40:38,777 --> 00:40:41,310
Length "L" and cross-sectional area "A"

782
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:42,950
we treat as a linear spring,

783
00:40:43,155 --> 00:40:48,041
so extension is linearly proportional to
tensile stress by a constant factor...

784
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:50,980
The inverse of its modulus of elasticity.

785
00:40:56,068 --> 00:40:58,612
Ah, miss Mars, join me, would you?

786
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,790
Uh, sure, dean.

787
00:41:05,156 --> 00:41:06,432
I just don't want more kids coming

788
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,921
and giving me their ideas
about how to run the school...

789
00:41:08,998 --> 00:41:10,600
My biggest problem as dean.

790
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:15,693
I don't like college students...
Most of them, anyway.

791
00:41:16,165 --> 00:41:17,261
So, why do you eat here?

792
00:41:17,817 --> 00:41:19,873
This damn burger... I love it.

793
00:41:20,457 --> 00:41:21,960
If you see my wife, don't tell her.

794
00:41:22,017 --> 00:41:24,101
There's some things
she's better off not knowing.

795
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,411
Dean...

796
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:30,281
just some...

797
00:41:31,187 --> 00:41:32,873
Hey, I need to talk to you.

798
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:35,270
Sorry, I'll be right back.

799
00:41:36,975 --> 00:41:39,302
- So, what's up?
- I need your help.

800
00:41:39,428 --> 00:41:41,130
- What's wrong?
- It's Mercer.

801
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,601
Lamb just arrested him
for the rapes on campus.

802
00:41:43,697 --> 00:41:45,832
He didn't do it, okay? You have to help.

803
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,922
How do you know he didn't do it?

804
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:50,771
'Cause I was with him
the night of the rape this summer.

805
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:53,720
Where? Doing what?

806
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:57,770
I can't tell you, okay? But you have
to trust me. He's innocent.
