1
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:04,456
Veronica, there's something
you should know.

2
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:07,489
There's a video of you.

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,747
Dick got ahold of it somehow.

4
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:14,127
Am I singing karaoke?

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,764
It's you and Piz having sex.

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:25,258
Unless it's a video from the future,
that's not possible.

7
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:26,735
We haven't had sex.

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,133
Okay.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,420
Well, I mean, you were
naked and fooling around.

10
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:33,600
I assumed.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,277
And I thought you should know.

12
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:36,585
That you're crazy?

13
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:38,158
Oh, thanks, now I know.

14
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,112
I guess you should see this.

15
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:44,693
Why are you bruised?

16
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,023
What did you do?

17
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,512
I found Piz. We sort of had it out.

18
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,781
I knew you wouldn't let him
tape you like that.

19
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:54,342
Stop. Just stop.

20
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,602
I don't know why
you're involved with this

21
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:59,800
or what the hell is on this thing,
but it's not gonna be me.

22
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,700
Piz would never...

23
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:02,671
You need to go.

24
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:03,962
I was trying to help.

25
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:06,072
Leaving would be helpful.

26
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:17,811
Everything okay?

27
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:19,430
Yeah.

28
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:22,093
It was just Logan.

29
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:24,141
I'll meet you at home. I'll make dinner.

30
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:26,353
You can just walk in
and feast like a princess,

31
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:28,423
you spoiled brat.

32
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:39,563
<i>Perhaps a cheer?</i>

33
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,941
<i>Actually, it does.</i>

34
00:01:41,086 --> 00:01:42,281
<i>I was kidding.</i>

35
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:43,340
<i>Then no.</i>

36
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:46,173
<i>Did it involve me being naked?</i>

37
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:48,202
Slowly, bro.
You got to take it slow.

38
00:01:48,435 --> 00:01:50,383
How does walking make my ribs hurt?

39
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:53,831
You should see the other guy.

40
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:57,952
His hands, particularly...
I-I tore those things up.

41
00:01:58,656 --> 00:02:00,843
He didn't really give me a reason.

42
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:03,463
He sort of just burst
into the deejay booth

43
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:04,742
and started whaling on me.

44
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:06,723
He's got bruised ribs.
His eye's all jacked up.

45
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:07,720
Not... Not really helping.

46
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:09,430
Look, you didn't lose a fight, Piz.

47
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,073
It was a drive-by, man.

48
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:13,693
I guess he was pissed about that thing
that happened at the beach?

49
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:17,300
I think he still likes you.

50
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:18,711
He...

51
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:22,763
...saw a video of us fooling around.

52
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,671
Yeah, I'm on morphine.

53
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:26,311
What?

54
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:27,613
There's a video,

55
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,881
Taken right here
in this very room, of us...

56
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:34,791
Adam-and-Eve-style, getting familiar.

57
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:36,581
So, um, here's my question.

58
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:40,991
Is this a thing you do that
maybe you forgot to mention?

59
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:44,243
- Veronica.
- Just now is the time to come clean.

60
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:46,012
You really think I would do that?

61
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:47,971
No.

62
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:51,012
I just don't understand how it happened.

63
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:52,521
So there's an actual video.

64
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:56,220
Well, where did Logan get it?

65
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,662
I was about to go have
a talk with him anyway.

66
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:00,453
So maybe I can get some answers.

67
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,362
- Wallace.
- Oh, we're having a conversation.

68
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:03,683
I'll deal with him.

69
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:12,551
- Is he here?
- Who? Logan?

70
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,772
You know, I don't know if, um...

71
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:17,861
Just so you know...

72
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,041
The best way to show that you're
still in love with your ex-girlfriend

73
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:22,572
is to beat up her new boyfriend.

74
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:24,650
- Parker, you're...
- You're an idiot.

75
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:26,752
What?

76
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,513
"Parker, you're an idiot."

77
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:30,503
That's not what I was gonna say.

78
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:31,492
I know.

79
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,033
You were going for something nice.

80
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:34,671
The truth is that I am an idiot.

81
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:35,883
You're not.

82
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:39,032
There's just a lot to this
that you don't understand.

83
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:43,003
Like why I kept thinking
that I mean something to you

84
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:45,921
When it's always been Veronica?

85
00:03:48,175 --> 00:03:49,413
Wow.

86
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:52,642
You should have seen that expression.

87
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,282
It totally sold you out.

88
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,981
- Are you gonna listen to me?
- No!

89
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:59,062
I look at you, and I know you love her.

90
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:01,563
Piz videotaped them having sex

91
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:04,581
- without her knowing about it.
- Oh, god! Well, that's horrible!

92
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:06,913
Well, you must have been
devastated. I mean...

93
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,462
- Veronica had sex with someone else?
- She's your friend, too!

94
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:14,070
Aren't you angry for her?
Do you realize what this will do to her?

95
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:18,600
Do you realize that we just broke up?

96
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:24,151
Yeah, I didn't think so.

97
00:04:32,635 --> 00:04:36,332
What? Did he send up a flare?

98
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:38,891
He's all yours, Veronica.

99
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:41,712
Trust me... Not why I'm here.

100
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:46,333
You know, it doesn't
even matter anymore.

101
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:54,681
Where is he?

102
00:04:57,787 --> 00:04:59,173
You, don't leave.

103
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:01,623
We're having a little chat after.

104
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:06,871
He's having trouble breathing
because of his ribs.

105
00:05:07,178 --> 00:05:08,972
He got five stitches over his eye.

106
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,441
Only five?

107
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:12,161
You're a lunatic.

108
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:13,683
You didn't know he was taping you?

109
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:15,921
- Because he didn't!
- Oh, come on, Veronica.

110
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:18,071
Who else would have
or could have done that?

111
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,401
Here's what I know...

112
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,381
It wasn't Piz, and it could
not be less of your business.

113
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,142
Aren't we trying to be friends?

114
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:27,051
As your friend, I was angry
at what happened to you.

115
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:29,170
Someone's always supposed to pay, right?

116
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:31,002
Isn't that the rule we live by?

117
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,521
We tried to be friends,
and it didn't work.

118
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:36,922
This is the moment, Logan, right now,

119
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:41,053
where it's just done.

120
00:05:41,656 --> 00:05:44,750
You're out of my life forever.

121
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,148
Veronica Mars
"3x20 - The Bitch Is Back"

122
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,149
Raceman, BLue, www.forom.com

123
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:56,103
Dick, get out here.

124
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:00,802
What's up, V?

125
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:01,820
If you had to bet?

126
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:03,623
Look, from a guy's perspective,

127
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,782
the video just made your stock go up.

128
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:07,333
You looked great.

129
00:06:07,446 --> 00:06:09,791
Enthusiasm... always a plus.

130
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:13,150
It's like you're this
giant jackass piñata

131
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:15,590
Begging for someone
to beat the candy out of you.

132
00:06:16,815 --> 00:06:17,840
Where'd you get the video?

133
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:18,860
Someone e-mailed it to me.

134
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:19,772
Who?

135
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:23,483
- Get your computer.
- I probably deleted...

136
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,062
After all these years,
do you not instinctively fear me?

137
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:29,232
Maybe you should write yourself a note.

138
00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:43,630
Chip Diller.

139
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:45,611
You didn't know it was from Chip?

140
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,112
Well, see how many e-mails I get?

141
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,883
You forwarded it
to your whole address book?

142
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:53,343
It was instinct. I always forward porn.

143
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:55,502
When it's good.

144
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:01,472
You are going to be so popular in hell.

145
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,243
Veronica.

146
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,761
- Veronica.
- I'm a little busy.

147
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:10,470
Yeah, that figures.

148
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:14,271
Can you shiv me, please?

149
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,873
I didn't see the whole thing, alright.

150
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:20,191
Seriously, just bash me in the head
with your boot or something.

151
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:23,111
I don't know what you plan on doing,
but I'm offering my help.

152
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,073
Whatever you need, I'm in.

153
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:27,840
There's a good chance I'm going
to take you up on that.

154
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:44,203
And I'm back in high school.

155
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:46,481
Goody.

156
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:54,642
Chip.

157
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:56,701
Moment of your time?

158
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:57,981
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

159
00:07:58,108 --> 00:07:59,482
It's a cluster of morons.

160
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:01,451
Don't worry. They'll let you back in.

161
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:03,221
You know what I like about you?

162
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:04,683
You got spirit.

163
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:07,531
I want to talk to you.

164
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,153
That's what you're doing.

165
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:10,352
Could you put your head up your ass

166
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,070
before they stuck the egg in there,
or is this new?

167
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:15,113
What do you want?

168
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:16,771
Who sent you that video?

169
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,430
Don't know, don't care.

170
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:21,440
You don't care now.

171
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:22,970
But holy crap,

172
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:26,003
are you gonna care when I start
to get my revenge on.

173
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:27,722
You'll be doing all sorts of caring.

174
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,631
Hey, Veronica, wait up.

175
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:38,160
Domonick Desante...

176
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:40,440
That's the guy who sent me the e-mail.

177
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:43,953
So we're cool, right?

178
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,620
Right? Everything's cool?

179
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,432
Domonick.

180
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:55,770
Yeah?

181
00:08:55,878 --> 00:08:57,580
Where did you get the video of me?

182
00:08:58,297 --> 00:08:59,720
I don't know what you're talking about.

183
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:02,242
Your pubescent snickering
tells me differently.

184
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:03,952
Someone sent it to me.

185
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:05,322
You should tell me who.

186
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:07,842
Or I can assume
that it originated from you.

187
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:10,052
You can assume
whatever position you'd like.

188
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:12,993
I'm thinking choke hold...
you gasping for your last breath.

189
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:14,711
Shh, shh, shh, sweetheart, sweetheart.

190
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:17,892
You are so much hotter
with the sound off.

191
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:22,473
You'll really be better off
giving me that name.

192
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:24,112
Yeah.

193
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:27,630
Well, I guess I need to go
quiver in fear now, so...

194
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,073
See ya.

195
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,202
Okay, then.

196
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:37,993
Credit-card company
made some sort of mistake.

197
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:40,900
I have a ton of available credit
on that card... A ton.

198
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:43,110
I'll totally pay you back for dinner.

199
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:46,243
It's kind of funny, right?
It's like a cute little story we have.

200
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:48,883
Wh...

201
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:51,582
That yours?

202
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:54,612
You must have some bad karma.

[Daniel Powter - Bad Day]

* You're taking one down *

205
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,603
* You sing a sad...

206
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:18,680
Anxious to find out how far I'll go?

207
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:20,830
Or are you ready to give me that name?

208
00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:29,243
It was this guy, Gory, all right?
Gory Sorokin.

209
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:31,743
But seriously, you cannot
tell him that I told you.

210
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:45,100
Are you Gory?

211
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:46,352
Who wants to know?

212
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:49,683
Well, seeing as I'm the one asking,
I'm guessing me.

213
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:52,332
You do have nice pom-poms.
I'll give you that.

214
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:56,600
Are you coming in or what?

215
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:01,840
You're shorter in person.

216
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:05,781
Are you the one who planted the camera?

217
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,360
Does it really matter?

218
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:08,962
What do you think you could do about it?

219
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,780
Ask Domonick Desante.

220
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,071
I can make your life hell.

221
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:15,990
I don't think you can.

222
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:19,540
If you have proof
that I'm involved in some way,

223
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:20,852
maybe you should get a lawyer.

224
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:24,403
If you don't, maybe you should
just stay and have a drink.

225
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:26,042
Yeah.

226
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:28,280
I'm definitely gonna need a drink.

227
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:29,553
Perhaps 12.

228
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:31,091
I don't know...
How many does it usually take

229
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,043
For a girl to find you not gross?

230
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:42,343
You know what I noticed today?

231
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:45,560
Look really close
at the welt under my eye.

232
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:47,532
What? Is your eye okay?

233
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:49,710
Yeah, I was just pointing out
that this bright-pink part

234
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,662
Looks kind of like the virgin Mary.

235
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:54,251
I call this my miracle eye.

236
00:11:54,335 --> 00:11:56,893
- * My miracle eye *

<i>At the north quad newspaper stand.</i>

239
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,543

and that's where I picked.

You know, you're adorable

242
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:17,172
Do any of the fraternities
do a late-spring rush?

243
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:18,851
I don't think so.

Reading all about it?

254
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,611
A guy's got to keep current.

255
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:57,262
What are you up to?

256
00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:58,430
Just taking surveillance photos

257
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:00,621
of everyone who takes
a paper out of that machine...

258
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:02,170
You know, for kicks.

259
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:05,933
You aren't pledging any sort
of fraternity, are you?

260
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,390
You think I'd join a fraternity
without telling you?

261
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:10,420
I got to grasp
at the occasional straw...

262
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,640
nature of the business.

263
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:13,650
So, what are you doing
on this side of campus?

264
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,312
Don't you have lab in,
like, five minutes?

265
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:17,001
Are you grilling me?

266
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:19,801
I got to take this.

267
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:21,701
Hello?

268
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:24,430
You want what?

269
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,612
Come back for office hours.
We'll talk about this later.

270
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:27,841
Oh, mr. Fennel.

271
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:28,873
This is very strange,

272
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:30,522
but when I left my house this morning,

273
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,493
I found this taped to my front door.

274
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:38,543
You look okay to me.

275
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:42,050
Was this wardrobe change
more of an olfactory issue?

276
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,101
You tell me.

277
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:53,291
I dropped my salad.

278
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:56,910
Hm you can't really get vinaigrette
out with a wet paper towel.

279
00:13:57,106 --> 00:14:00,120
They're doing an article on me
for the Neptune Register.

280
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,590
The interview's
in a couple of days, but...

281
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:04,963
they've got a photographer
due here any minute.

282
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,051
And you thought
a photo of you in your boxers

283
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,510
would hurt your lead in the polls?

284
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:11,670
With clean pants,
it's a smooth cruise into victory.

285
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:15,750
And what a beautiful day
that will be for Mars, the family;

286
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:18,881
Neptune, the town;
Milky Way, the galaxy.

287
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:21,631
Sun will be shining.
Birds will be singing.

288
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:23,301
There'll be dancing in the streets.

289
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:24,863
So smile pretty.

290
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,552
Do you know what The Castle is?

291
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:36,983
I think I've heard something about it.

292
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:38,902
It's Hearst's version
of Skull and Bones.

293
00:14:39,598 --> 00:14:41,213
They tapped me to join.

294
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:43,620
So, this morning...

295
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,100
This morning,
I didn't think that The Castle

296
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,231
had anything to do with that tape.

297
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:49,602
Now I do.

298
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:53,112
This girl called me a few days ago
wanting to hang out,

299
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:54,213
and I brushed her off.

300
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:55,912
Basically, I lied and told her

301
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,130
I had to go to a study night
at my professor's house.

302
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:02,051
After I saw you today,
my professor gave me this.

303
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:04,632
It's a message from The Castle.

304
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,862
They knew where I was supposed to be.

305
00:15:07,445 --> 00:15:08,622
They bugged you?

306
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:10,763
Yeah, and it just makes sense
that it's the same device

307
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:13,013
they used to catch you and Piz.

308
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:14,720
Okay.

309
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:16,482
I'm gonna need names and...

310
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:19,143
I haven't met a single person...
Not even another pledge.

311
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:21,692
The person who tapped me,
he isn't even a member.

312
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:23,813
The whole rush process
is done in messages.

313
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:26,570
Well, they got one less guy
to torture in hell night.

314
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:29,342
Any chance you'd reconsider that?

315
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:37,720
I'm sorry. That's crazy.
That's way too much to ask.

316
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:42,181
It's not.

317
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:44,103
I can do it.

318
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,243
How am I supposed to get names?

319
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:49,140
I have a feeling there's no I.D. tags.

320
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:56,172
Just get their faces.

321
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:58,050
You know I can't draw, right?

322
00:15:58,826 --> 00:15:59,990
It's a camera.

323
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:02,483
Snap a few shots
of the guys when you can.

324
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:05,013
When I got tapped,
I went to the Hearst library

325
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:07,073
and looked up everything I could
on The Castle.

326
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,580
There wasn't much.

327
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:12,001
But there was this exposé.

328
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:17,271
And look who wrote it.

329
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,720
Thanks for meeting me.

330
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:28,881
Who doesn't love a good chat with
old friends about secret societies?

331
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:32,813
Our illustrious namesake
was a Yale Skull and Bones man.

332
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,750
He wanted Hearst
to have something similar.

333
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:38,003
So he started The Castle at Stanford,
where his son went,

334
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:40,250
and at Hearst, the school he founded.

335
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,951
So, what do they do?

336
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:43,682
That's the billion-dollar question.

337
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,940
Being tapped for The Castle, they say,

338
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:48,141
is a ticket to wealth,
power, and privilege.

339
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,442
They're treated like rock stars.

340
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:51,980
So who gets tapped?

341
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:53,400
Notable freshman males.

342
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:55,843
Future politicians and lawyers.

343
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:58,571
Engineers, journalists, athletes.

344
00:16:58,646 --> 00:17:01,900
Wealthy men making other
like-minded men wealthy.

345
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,863
And how do the ladies feel about that?

346
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:05,940
We're not happy.

347
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:08,641
A group tried to sue
for admission last year,

348
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,590
But they couldn't figure out
exactly who to sue.

349
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:13,431
No one knows who the members are.

350
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:47,822
<i>First corridor on your left.</i>

351
00:17:53,645 --> 00:17:55,291
<i>Keep going.</i>

352
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,882
<i>Go into unit 499.</i>

353
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:16,872
<i>Three, strip to your underwear.</i>

354
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:19,980
<i>Throw your clothes outside the door,
shut the door,</i>

355
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:24,151
<i>then put on the collar
and sit in the chair.</i>

356
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:42,500
<i>Three, what you do now
will dictate the course of your future.</i>

357
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:47,790
<i>All you have to do, is tell the truth,
and the world will be at your feet.</i>

358
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:51,271
<i>We have no secrets in The Castle.
It keeps us honest.</i>

359
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:55,161
<i>Lie to us, and one of your
brothers will pay the price.</i>

360
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,523
<i>Do you understand?</i>

361
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,711
I understand.

362
00:18:57,828 --> 00:19:00,901
<i>Tell us about Rashard Rucker.</i>

363
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:05,210
<i>What happened the night in Chicago
when you ran over the homeless man?</i>

364
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:17,182
<i>So your father committed
a crime for you.</i>

365
00:19:19,216 --> 00:19:20,432
Yeah.

366
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:21,881
Aah!

367
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,610
What? I answered.

368
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:29,630
<i>Yes. But someone else lied.</i>

369
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:34,301
<i>Did you get enough? You lie,
one of you brothers pays the price.</i>

370
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:36,112
<i>Final question...</i>

371
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,152
<i>What item were you carrying
in your pocket tonight?</i>

372
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:40,273
Just a pen.

373
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:45,473
<i>You want to try answering that again?</i>

374
00:20:03,756 --> 00:20:05,411
If you ever need a kidney,

375
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:08,462
I've got one with your name on it,
no questions asked.

376
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:14,111
They knew about the camera?

377
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:16,153
I said it was a pen.

378
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,193
Then I heard this scream.

379
00:20:19,335 --> 00:20:20,850
I wouldn't talk anymore.

380
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,310
So that voice on the box
told me to get out.

381
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:24,872
I'm so sorry.

382
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:30,330
I think I know who one
of the other pledges is.

383
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,721
The voice on the box
kept calling me "three."

384
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:36,171
Three... My basketball number.

385
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:40,123
But he slipped up one time,
and he called me "2,400."

386
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,430
2,400.

387
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:43,713
Meaning?

388
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:45,260
The first couple weeks of school,

389
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:46,993
there was a story in the free press

390
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:50,283
about that freshman who made
a perfect score on the S.A.T.

391
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:52,200
- 2,400.
- Yeah.

392
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:54,211
They ran a picture
of him with the story.

393
00:20:54,995 --> 00:20:57,793
He looked kind of like Josh Groban.

394
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,370
Is that him?

395
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:19,162
That's the guy.

396
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:22,511
I'll find him.

397
00:21:22,586 --> 00:21:25,963
I'll follow him, and he
will lead me to The Castle.

398
00:21:36,787 --> 00:21:37,722
Friend of yours?

399
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:39,280
Apparently not.

400
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:43,103
Oh, enough of the foreplay.
Get to the good stuff.

401
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:45,870
Hey, wait. Do I know you?

402
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:48,090
You look so familiar.

403
00:21:48,216 --> 00:21:49,233
Come on, man.

404
00:21:49,297 --> 00:21:51,851
What? I just think I've seen her
somewhere before.

405
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,321
Don't be a jerk.

406
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,931
Ow. You got me.

407
00:21:57,455 --> 00:22:00,073
It's a nice day.
Let's go eat outside.

408
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:02,031
Veronica?

409
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:10,890
Looks even more familiar from behind.

410
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:14,041
I promise you, Karma's going
to take care of that guy for you.

411
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:15,113
I know.

412
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:17,782
I'm gonna run him over with my "karma."

413
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,463
Dude, I saw that Piznarski guy today.

414
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:24,690
That's one messed-up polack, my brother.

415
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:28,310
Pound and explode, dude.
It's still a thing.

416
00:22:32,156 --> 00:22:33,550
I guess he didn't make the video.

417
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:35,740
Whoops. Your bad.

418
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,791
Still, it was a royal beatdown.

419
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,990
Sometimes a random ass-kicking's
a good thing.

420
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:41,363
Keeps everyone else in line.

421
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:58,371
<i>Oh, 2,400, how quickly
you're moving up in the world.</i>

422
00:22:58,447 --> 00:22:59,491
<i>Not a bad deal...</i>

423
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:01,820
<i>Drive into a parking lot
in your crap car,</i>

424
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,311
<i>Leave in a stretch limo,
and be chauffeured to a mansion.</i>

425
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:07,151
<i>So the front window's all curtained.</i>

426
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:10,251
<i>How best to get a view of the back?</i>

427
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,363
<i>I need faces.</i>

428
00:24:17,585 --> 00:24:19,331
Gory? You've got
that disc with you?

429
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,623
Of course.

430
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:24,072
Let me show you my office.
Take that off your hands.

431
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:27,981
That'd be great. I feel like Gollum
carrying this thing around.

432
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:30,473
I don't know what that means.

433
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:37,962
I like the look of the pledges.
You did well, Gory.

434
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:41,061
You're not gonna believe some of
the confessions we got this year.

435
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:43,091
Well, they get worse. Every year.

436
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:46,773
I noticed that we're down a pledge.

437
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:47,991
I washed him.

438
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:49,723
Caught him sneaking in a camera.

439
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:51,642
Check it out. There's the lens.

440
00:24:51,716 --> 00:24:54,201
Click it... It takes a picture.

441
00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:56,372
New age, isn't it?

442
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:59,153
It looks like we're done here.

443
00:25:06,597 --> 00:25:07,931
It's the only copy?

444
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,280
Of course.

445
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:22,462
I wasn't built to live
in the subdivision.

446
00:25:27,507 --> 00:25:29,373
Let's go back to the induction.

447
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,002
Nothing else was taken?

448
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:58,530
Just the hard drive?

449
00:25:58,977 --> 00:26:01,792
Which happens to be
the most valuable item in the house.

450
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,123
What was on it?

451
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:07,210
It's five years of programming
that will revolutionize the industry.

452
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:09,740
It's always something, huh?

453
00:26:10,477 --> 00:26:13,202
I'm surprised you don't have
a massive security system, Jake.

454
00:26:13,265 --> 00:26:14,441
It's coming.

455
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:16,942
Keith.

456
00:26:18,018 --> 00:26:20,590
Well, we've only been here for a month.

457
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:22,140
Could have been household staff.

458
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:23,452
No forced entry.

459
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:24,583
You mind?

460
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,570
This could be the entry point.

461
00:26:52,907 --> 00:26:54,470
Looking at a tiny thief.

462
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,292
Mr. Harvey, sheriff Keith Mars.

463
00:26:59,426 --> 00:27:02,621
I'm investigating a break-in
at the Kanes' house next door.

464
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,492
I happened to notice you had
cameras mounted in your backyard.

465
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:06,592
Come in.

466
00:27:10,656 --> 00:27:13,302
The security cameras
are all hooked up to a DVR.

467
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:15,742
We're looking at the backyard view
in real time.

468
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:18,983
But if you hit rewind,
you can go back up to three days.

469
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,091
There. That was something.

470
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:37,623
Is that a girl?

471
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:47,232
Mr. Harvey, you mind
if I take the DVR for evidence?

472
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:50,961
Excuse me.

473
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:56,593
Deputy Gills.

474
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:57,922
In the flesh.

475
00:27:58,027 --> 00:27:59,262
Check out the new digs, Keith.

476
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,780
This is what I do since you fired me.

477
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:05,342
There was a break-in
at the Kanes' last night.

478
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:09,050
I need to see a list of the plates
of any strange cars that came in here.

479
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:12,491
Sure thing. Let me check.

480
00:28:12,736 --> 00:28:14,922
What do you know? Nothin'.

481
00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:17,490
Quiet night here at Pemberton Estates.

482
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,343
Good luck on the case, though.

483
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:22,381
Hey, best of luck in the election.

484
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:27,261
Let me explain something, Veronica.

485
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:30,443
I own the most powerful
personal computer on campus.

486
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:34,013
There is no personal computer faster
or better than mine at Hearst.

487
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:35,951
And using this incredible
computer of mine,

488
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:39,720
it will take 20 years to crack
Jake Kane's password on this hard drive.

489
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:41,133
So how do we do it?

490
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:43,681
You're like Kirk in "Wrath of Khan."

491
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:45,562
You refuse to believe
in the no-win scenario.

492
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,592
You're like one of the nerds
from "Revenge of the Nerds"

493
00:28:47,677 --> 00:28:49,330
with your "star trek" references.

494
00:28:51,705 --> 00:28:54,391
There is a computer on campus
that might be able to crack it.

495
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:31,670
- Hello.
- Sir.

496
00:29:31,956 --> 00:29:33,911
I need to ask you about
a license-plate number.

497
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:45,893
Hello, lover.

498
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:48,012
Guess that's what you're looking for.

499
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:50,641
Thanks.

500
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:56,200
Here we go.

501
00:30:00,037 --> 00:30:01,100
Mr. Harvey.

502
00:30:02,828 --> 00:30:05,433
Mind if I talk to you about
the sheriff's visit earlier?

503
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:23,252
What do you know about
the break-in at the Kane mansion?

504
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:24,683
What happened to my room?

505
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:28,212
Did you steal five years
of Kane software product development?

506
00:30:28,277 --> 00:30:31,783
No. That's a crazy question.
Did you tear apart my room?!

507
00:30:31,856 --> 00:30:34,560
Yes. And I found this. Notice the rip?

508
00:30:35,365 --> 00:30:38,641
I found a blue thread on a loose screw
of the Kane doggy door.

509
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:41,830
Takes someone awfully small
to break in through a doggy door.

510
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,552
There are a lot
of blue sweaters in the world.

511
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:45,753
Spoken like a public defender, Veronica.

512
00:30:45,757 --> 00:30:47,290
If there is something going on with you,

513
00:30:47,358 --> 00:30:50,543
If you're in trouble,
now is the time to tell me.

514
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:53,750
<i>I could tell you,
but you'd never look at me the same.</i>

515
00:30:53,805 --> 00:30:55,670
I'm spending the night at Mac's.

516
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:00,293
Veronica Mars?

517
00:31:01,698 --> 00:31:03,013
Veronica Mars?!

518
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:03,883
Easy, Jake.

519
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,740
You find her, you get that hard drive,

520
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:09,222
and you arrange for it that I never
see that girl again in this lifetime!

521
00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:11,442
You sure that's our best option?

522
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:17,930
I want to return
the sheriff's department

523
00:31:18,015 --> 00:31:20,993
To a place where everyone,
regardless of zip code,

524
00:31:21,076 --> 00:31:22,240
Gets a fair shake.

525
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,141
Your opponent says
he wants to be sheriff

526
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,162
Because he always
wanted to wear a badge.

527
00:31:26,248 --> 00:31:29,022
- I'm excited about that, as well.
- Where is he?

528
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:30,830
It was your daughter, Keith!

529
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:32,990
Veronica's the one
that broke into my house

530
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,472
and stole my hard drive!

531
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,733
Believe you already know
the county prosecutor.

532
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,363
And what makes you think...

533
00:31:39,428 --> 00:31:41,651
Veronica's plates were registered
at the guard gate.

534
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:44,020
Her in and out times
match the time of the robbery.

535
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:45,263
She's small enough.

536
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:47,982
Plus, mr. Kane's neighbor
says his video footage revealed

537
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:50,080
a blond girl running through his yard.

538
00:31:51,858 --> 00:31:53,581
I'm gonna need that DVR, Keith.

539
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:55,210
I need it now.

540
00:31:56,808 --> 00:32:00,691
I'll happily turn it over as soon
as you bring me a judge's order.

541
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:03,630
You know what this looks like, Keith?

542
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:05,960
Like I don't kowtow
to the rich and powerful?

543
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:08,260
No. Not that.

544
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:11,110
We'll be back... soon.

545
00:32:28,517 --> 00:32:31,721
I'll talk to you in an hour
when I can make all this go away.

546
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:35,120
Couple hours at least.

547
00:32:36,318 --> 00:32:37,592
We don't have two hours.

548
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:40,401
There's a class scheduled
in here at 9:00 a.m.

549
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:46,013
<i>This is Veronica. Leave me a message.</i>

550
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:47,100
Honey...

551
00:32:47,205 --> 00:32:49,972
Things have really
hit the fan down here.

552
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:52,493
I'm pretty desperate to talk to you.

553
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:56,020
I'm waiting on your call.

554
00:33:58,316 --> 00:33:59,212
Veronica!

555
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:03,752
Eureka!

556
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,471
The names.

557
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:11,632
Hundreds of them.

558
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:13,981
This is more than one pledge class.

559
00:34:14,776 --> 00:34:16,921
Look, this guy's class of '39?

560
00:34:17,258 --> 00:34:19,033
Think we may have overshot.

561
00:34:20,796 --> 00:34:21,850
No.

562
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:24,311
This is a beautiful thing.

563
00:34:27,308 --> 00:34:29,681
Judge's orders.

564
00:34:30,725 --> 00:34:32,122
See? That wasn't hard.

565
00:34:32,395 --> 00:34:35,082
Leo, you mind pulling the DVR
from the evidence room

566
00:34:35,137 --> 00:34:37,921
and handing it over
to the county prosecutor?

567
00:34:39,296 --> 00:34:44,110
Confessions from every member
of The Castle since its inception.

568
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:45,992
20 years of transcriptions.

569
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:50,451
and we have 30 years of audio,

570
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:52,743
and 30 years of video.

571
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:54,141
Why do they do it?

572
00:34:54,238 --> 00:34:55,943
No one spills the castle's secrets

573
00:34:56,025 --> 00:34:58,733
because they know what they risk.

574
00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:01,881
Most of them aren't guilty
of putting that video of you out there.

575
00:35:04,195 --> 00:35:05,730
But this guy is.

576
00:35:06,026 --> 00:35:07,463
Gorya Sorokin.

577
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:11,480
So...

578
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:15,322
We figured we'd go up
to the mountain cabin,

579
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:17,152
Get loaded, and take the boat out.

580
00:35:17,596 --> 00:35:18,982
Parents didn't need to know.

581
00:35:19,057 --> 00:35:20,393
So we're getting high up on the balcony.

582
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:24,042
And I hear a car pull up, and I hide,
but I got a good angle.

583
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,030
And I see my dad
and uncle Lev get out of a car.

584
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:29,893
They open the trunk
and pull a couple bodies out.

585
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:33,013
They are bloody as hell.

586
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:36,640
And so they drag the bodies
into the workshop.

587
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:39,453
And the next thing,
I hear the power saw going.

588
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:43,342
I always wondered why my dad
put a woodshop up in the cabin.

589
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:46,101
So the next thing you know,
he and uncle Lev

590
00:35:46,155 --> 00:35:48,861
Are taking a couple hefty bags
down to the boat.

591
00:35:51,778 --> 00:35:54,941
Maybe I'll let Gory Sorokin
keep his secrets.

592
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:01,531
Hey, Nish. I've got a present for you.

593
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:02,760
You're transferring?

594
00:36:02,837 --> 00:36:04,092
A list.

595
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:06,963
The names of every member of The Castle.

596
00:36:07,018 --> 00:36:07,883
All men.

597
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:09,820
You think this will help
with that lawsuit?

598
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,040
Oh, my god.

599
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:18,623
Politicians. Tycoons. Celebrities.

600
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:20,372
This is gold.

601
00:36:20,856 --> 00:36:24,520
You're gonna make some
very powerful men very unhappy.

602
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:26,491
Won't be the first time.

603
00:36:32,805 --> 00:36:34,850
Hey. You need to walk away.

604
00:36:35,046 --> 00:36:37,301
Just... I need to apologize.

605
00:36:37,355 --> 00:36:38,952
Great. Apology accepted.

606
00:36:39,027 --> 00:36:41,540
Now go.
I'm meeting Piz, who, by the way,

607
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:44,351
is the one you should be apologizing to.

608
00:36:46,395 --> 00:36:47,910
I am sorry, Veronica.

609
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:50,383
I thought...
Well, you know what I thought.

610
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:52,671
I was hoping I'd see you.

611
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:55,310
I didn't want to carry
that around forever.

612
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,393
You left it behind in my room.

613
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:01,142
You know what?

614
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:03,240
I'm glad we caught you on hidden camera.

615
00:37:03,298 --> 00:37:05,430
And I'm glad it's such
a popular e-mail attachment,

616
00:37:05,465 --> 00:37:07,461
because you're a real bitch.

617
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:11,853
You know what you should do
with your sudden popularity?

618
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:14,560
Just lay back and enjoy it.

619
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:25,040
Logan, don't.

620
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:28,111
He's connected.
Connected connected.

621
00:37:28,217 --> 00:37:29,131
Oh.

622
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:32,711
Yeah, I was wondering.
Didn't seem like you to shrug it off.

623
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:34,972
Hey, so listen. Again...

624
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:36,383
I apologize.

625
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,511
I can be pretty dumb sometimes.

626
00:37:38,577 --> 00:37:41,682
It's a nice gesture,
but it's gonna take some time this time.

627
00:38:08,195 --> 00:38:09,813
You want to hear your friend apologize?

628
00:38:10,717 --> 00:38:13,060
I'm not interested in his apology.

629
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:16,581
But I would like my pen back.

630
00:38:20,446 --> 00:38:22,132
Whoever you are, you're gonna die.

631
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:23,623
Yeah, someday.

632
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,753
Ah, Piz. Just who I was looking for.

633
00:38:30,945 --> 00:38:35,083
Listen, man.
I am truly sorry for everything.

634
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,183
So are you like the butler now or...

635
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:51,291
I'm just saying.

636
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:53,940
Answering the door kind of
smells of being demoted.

637
00:38:53,995 --> 00:38:56,211
I like to deal
with the miscreants personally.

638
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:58,300
- Yes, you do.
- Look who dropped by.

639
00:39:03,156 --> 00:39:04,653
Veronica.

640
00:39:06,198 --> 00:39:07,860
Would you care for something?

641
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,172
Lemonade, mineral water?

642
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:12,820
I came by to bring this back.

643
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:17,922
Would you wait right there?

644
00:39:18,726 --> 00:39:20,401
I'm gonna call the sheriff myself,

645
00:39:20,495 --> 00:39:21,631
have him come arrest you.

646
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:23,400
Go ahead. I'll wait.

647
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:25,563
But the moment that happens,

648
00:39:26,148 --> 00:39:27,982
everything on this drive goes public.

649
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:32,463
There's no way you can know
what's on that drive.

650
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:34,383
Not in a day.

651
00:39:37,238 --> 00:39:39,640
Gabe Huntley. Class of '74.

652
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:42,203
Ran over someone one night in Tijuana.

653
00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:44,601
Gerald Cummings. Election fraud.

654
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:50,541
Then there's that steamy
boarding-school incident of yours.

655
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:54,960
And we leave my dad out of it.

656
00:39:58,986 --> 00:40:01,270
I'm afraid it's a little
too late for that, Veronica.

657
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:04,431
Clarence will see you out.

658
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:09,523
Good. You're home.

659
00:40:17,607 --> 00:40:18,980
Prepare for gumbo.

660
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:22,330
How do I find the time
to make gumbo, you ask?

661
00:40:22,948 --> 00:40:24,393
I make time.

662
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:34,741
You know I love you, right?
More than anything.

663
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:36,341
Of course, honey.

664
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:40,493
I never doubted.

665
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:44,383
Eat.

666
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,430
Dad?
