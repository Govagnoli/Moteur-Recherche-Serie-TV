1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,399
In 1987, I was "people" magazine's
"sexiest man alive".

2
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:09,188
I made a lot of money chasing people
around with my shirt unbuttoned.

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:11,840
If I wanted to do a movie,

4
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:13,944
the movie got made.

5
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:16,837
Then I got older.

6
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:20,467
I started getting cast as
the father of superstar tweens

7
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:22,254
who have no idea
of who I am.

8
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:23,916
It's a new age.

9
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:26,043
They're the ones who are
getting movies made today.

10
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:27,560
I'm just some old guy.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,732
Enter Lilly Kane...

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,433
this young, beautiful girl
who thought I hung the moon.

13
00:00:34,103 --> 00:00:36,027
It's a very powerful thing when

14
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:39,338
someone sees you as the person that you
wish you were.

15
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:44,871
Even if that person is 16
and dating your son?

16
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,376
I didn't claim that it was right.

17
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:49,013
I said it was powerful.

18
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:53,805
Mr. Echolls, did you have sex
with Lilly Kane?

19
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:56,354
No, no... we...

20
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:59,850
we fooled around a little,
for lack of a better term,

21
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:01,847
but I never had intercourse with her.

22
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:04,943
And you ended the relationship
on the day she was killed,

23
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:06,173
- correct?
- Yes.

24
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:08,324
Can you tell us what happened?

25
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:11,011
Lilly came to the house.

26
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:13,730
She wanted attention,
I guess.

27
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:16,350
I told her we had to stop.

28
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:17,924
She stormed out.

29
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:21,533
It wasn't until after she'd left
that I realized she had taken my oscar.

30
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:23,499
So I went to her house to get it back.

31
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:24,856
And did she give it to you?

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,000
No. She yelled a lot.
She threw an ashtray at me.

33
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:32,706
Then her brother, Duncan,
came out. He was enraged.

34
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:34,865
He was screaming at her about me,

35
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:36,486
I mean,
as though I wasn't even there.

36
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:40,817
I probably
shouldn't have left her with him,

37
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,480
but I panicked.

38
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,509
I mean,
as crazy as he was acting,

39
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,362
- I never would have imagined...
- objection.

40
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:52,185
Yes, I'm sorry, your honor.
So, after this argument,

41
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,607
that was the last time
you saw Lilly Kane?

42
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,572
It was the last time
I saw her alive, yes.

43
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:03,090
So, apparently, if you're handsome
and famous enough,

44
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:05,204
you can just lie under oath,
and that's cool.

45
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,044
It's all about the tapes now, honey.

46
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:10,583
That oscar trophy with Duncan's hair
is gonna create doubt...

47
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:12,100
reasonable or otherwise.

48
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,957
But if they believe you and Logan
saw Aaron having sex with Lilly,

49
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:16,946
they'll convict him.

50
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,409
Honey, when you get your chance
to testify,

51
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:22,890
it's important
you keep yourself in check, okay?

52
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:26,344
Aaron's lawyer is gonna use everything
in his bag of tricks to rile you.

53
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:28,082
But here's the thing...

54
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:29,912
I'm un-rile-able.

55
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,342
"Easygoing Veronica Mars"...

56
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:34,484
that's what the kids at school call me.

57
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,725
You sure you don't want to go over
your testimony with the lawyers again?

58
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:38,872
You know what I want...

59
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:41,653
more than anything in the world?

60
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,351
I want to be there, in court,

61
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:47,626
watching Aaron at the moment
the jury reads the verdict.

62
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:50,621
I want to see that smirk
wiped from his face.

63
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:54,926
I want to see his expression
at the exact moment he realizes...

64
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,701
 he'll never be a free man again.

65
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,091
"Easygoing Veronica Mars," huh?

66
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:06,423
You know how fat men
are sometimes called "tiny"?

67
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:12,122
That's for saving my life.

68
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:13,698
What do I have to do for a pie?

69
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:16,376
I'm kidding.

70
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,722
They're great. Thanks.

71
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:23,147
But I'm not sure
what I did qualifies as lifesaving.

72
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,413
- Sure, it does.
- Well, thanks.

73
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,585
I kind of have to get back to...

74
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:30,911
so, you are mad.

75
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:34,815
I knew that things were gonna be weird
because of that stuff with our dads.

76
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:37,249
I'm not mad, Gia.
I'm just trying to study.

77
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,870
We should study
for the health final together.

78
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,117
You want to?
Tomorrow night, my house?

79
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,640
I'll make flash cards.

80
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:47,410
Fine. Okay.
Tomorrow night.

81
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:53,166
Where'd these come from?

82
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:57,175
I saved someone's life.
Can't talk. Studying.

83
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:00,197
Well, not me, baby.
I'm cruising through this week.

84
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,846
Did he just call me "baby"?

85
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:02,672
Mm-hmm.

86
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:05,488
I got my scholarship to Hearst.
My grades are fine.

87
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:06,807
Good to go.

88
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:07,774
Do you want me to cry?

89
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:09,342
- I'm just saying...
- Because I'll cry.

90
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:12,104
I have to ace... ace...

91
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,127
all of my finals and hope
that Angie Dahl chokes on one of hers,

92
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:17,649
and that still doesn't guarantee me
the Kane scholarship.

93
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:20,542
Do you know how long
I've wanted to go to Stanford?

94
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:24,199
- Since middle school.
- Elementary, my dear Wallace.

95
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:28,066
any idea how long
I've waited to say that?

96
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:31,999
It's so funny that you're working so
hard to go to Stanford with Angie Dahl,

97
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:34,445
when Wallace, Mac,
and your dad will all be in Neptune.

98
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:38,537
Said the girl who's leaving all this
to go to France.

99
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:41,065
Ah, do you see
a plane ticket in my hand?

100
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,066
Seriously.
You might stay?

101
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:47,304
With dad's still in this mess...

102
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:49,261
Could  you guys tone down the adorable?

103
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,265
Western civ.
Isn't gonna learn itself.

104
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:54,196
I'm gonna need milk with those
cupcakes. Anyone want anything?

105
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:56,766
Uh, peace,
with a side of quiet?

106
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:02,340
- She...
- shh.

107
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:09,602
Veronica.

108
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:13,783
-  Got a minute?
- Not really.

109
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:21,042
I need your help with something.

110
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:24,048
Okay. This is a little weird
for me, you know?

111
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:25,209
Is this gonna make me nauseous?

112
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,162
I need your help with,
you know, algebra.

113
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:31,760
Like, the math?

114
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,897
To pass this year, I need to get
at least a "B" on the final.

115
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,733
I don't pass,
I don't graduate.

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,083
My grandmother wants to see me
walk across that stage at graduation.

117
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:43,780
And now, with her being sick
and everything...

118
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:46,567
I wish I could help,
but I can'.

119
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:49,445
I'm swamped with my own finals.

120
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:51,683
Yeah.

121
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:52,853
All right.

122
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:55,609
Sorry.

123
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:13,961
Look at this!
You're like animals!

124
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,264
Somebody's got to clean
this up, you know.

125
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,102
But not me.
That's right. They fired me.

126
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:28,324
I guess I'm good enough...

127
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,159
to drive an armored
troop-transport truck through Tikrit,

128
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,903
but not to polish the floors
at Neptune high!

129
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:37,853
Hey, anybody want to cut out of here?

130
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:40,959
I might try to jump snake canyon.
Who wants to go for a ride?

131
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,631
What, no one?

132
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,392
Where's my girl? Huh?

133
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:48,247
G- g-g-Gia!

134
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:54,789
Hey.
Who are you calling?

135
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:56,808
No one.

136
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:59,326
I said,
"who are you calling?!"

137
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:02,166
Don't cry.

138
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,763
A surpise!

139
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:45,417
<i>A long time ago,</i>

140
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:48,748
<i>We used to be friends but I</i>

141
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,239
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

142
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:56,184
<i>Come on, now, sugar!</i>

143
00:07:56,244 --> 00:07:58,350
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

144
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,782
<i>Just remember me when</i>

145
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,103
<i>We used to be friends</i>

146
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:06,427
<i>A long time ago</i>

147
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:08,982
<i>We used to be friends</i>

<i>Veronica Mars 2x21

149
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,527
Thomas Dohanic,
or "Lucky," as he was known,

150
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,907
was a very disturbed young man.

151
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,361
I've learned from
our sheriff's department

152
00:08:23,412 --> 00:08:25,150
that he just completed a tour in Iraq.

153
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:27,464
Is it true the gun he had
was filled with blanks?

154
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:28,526
Yes.

155
00:08:28,854 --> 00:08:29,973
That has been confirmed.

156
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:31,746
He was arrested
for stalking your family.

157
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:33,706
What was your relationship
with mr. Dohanic?

158
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:36,022
Honestly,
we didn't really have one.

159
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,496
He was a bat boy for
the Sharks back in his teens.

160
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:41,188
We had to let him go
after some of the players

161
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:43,048
complained about his job performance.

162
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,069
Why do you think
he took the gun to school?

163
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:46,464
Was he looking for your daughter?

164
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:47,717
I don't know.

165
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:52,009
I doubt we'll ever be able
to make sense out of the actions

166
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:54,637
Look at that.
His eyes are turning brown.

167
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:01,927
I'm thinking about getting you
some sort of giant hamster ball

168
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:04,702
so you can roll everywhere
in this protective sphere.

169
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:06,881
It would just draw attention to me.

170
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:10,351
Nobody likes a blonde
in a hamster ball.

171
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:14,115
So, I got into Lucky's apartment.

172
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,120
He sent a whole bunch of e-mails
to Woody,

173
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,557
all from different e-mail addresses.

174
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:19,746
What did they say?

175
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,775
Nothing.
There were attachments.

176
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:24,494
Lucky trashed the original files.

177
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:27,069
I'm hoping I'll be able
to get ahold of them at Woody's.

178
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:32,126
You really think Woody would keep
threatening e-mails in his inbox?

179
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:34,823
The way e-mail works on your
standard POP account, Veronica,

180
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:37,543
the e-mail remains on the server
for a period of time...

181
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:39,843
maybe a week, a month, longer.

182
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,731
And then when you log on
to your e-mail application,

183
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:43,780
the mail is pulled down.

184
00:09:43,856 --> 00:09:45,898
If you don't want people to see it,
you delete it.

185
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,305
Yes, but the e-mail
still exists on the server.

186
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:51,051
So, all one has to do

187
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:54,157
is find a seldom-used computer
and hope that that computer

188
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,775
hasn't downloaded
the incriminating e-mail yet.

189
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,839
And Woody must have six network
computers in that house of his.

190
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:02,235
So if you have his password...

191
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:03,425
Which I do.

192
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:06,219
I looked over his shoulder
once when he was signing on.

193
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:09,353
He should know. You never log in
with a Mars nearby.

194
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,311
Woody's got a Sharks dinner
tomorrow night...

195
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:13,430
a whole table reserved
for the Goodman family.

196
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:14,604
The coast should be clear.

197
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:16,254
Actually,  it won't be.

198
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:19,661
Gia is having
her number-one study buddy over.

199
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,390
So...

200
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:23,399
Veronica.

201
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:26,410
What? Why should you
break in when I'm invited?

202
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,066
Woody will be at the dinner.

203
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:30,386
And  we both know...

204
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:32,613
if it came down to it,

205
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:34,866
I could take Gia.

206
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,008
The password.

207
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:40,267
Give it.

208
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:43,284
You'll remember it.
It's "mr. Goodwood. "

209
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:47,699
I'm so not touching his keyboard.

210
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:51,286
Wallace literally sailed
over the table. Sailed.

211
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,428
Then he just slams into this guy,
just like, "bam!"

212
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,915
and tackles him to the ground.

213
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,258
Thank god he was there.

214
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,830
He was pretty freaked out after,
but he's doing okay now.

215
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:06,516
What?

216
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:08,487
I'm the one who's supposed
to keep you safe.

217
00:11:09,924 --> 00:11:11,533
I'm supposed to make your life easier,
and I've...

218
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,270
I've made it a circus.

219
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,206
Okay, no more pain-killers for you.

220
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:18,473
Hey, you're out of your mind.

221
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,992
My life is not a circus.

222
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,018
No, it's the best it's ever been.

223
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:28,426
There.

224
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:40,661
Hello, son.

225
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:44,014
You know, if you would have given Lilly
the performance you gave today,

226
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:45,601
she might have given you the oscar.

227
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,025
I wanted to talk to you
before you testify.

228
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:52,676
We both know the D.A.'s gonna ask
what you saw on those tapes.

229
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:56,880
I think it's in your best interest
that you don't tell him.

230
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,620
Because I want so desperately for you
to be free so we can be a family again?

231
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,390
Logan, the moment that you say
you saw those tapes,

232
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:06,808
you will be admitting
to destroying state's evidence.

233
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,668
I'm gonna win this, son.

234
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:12,017
And there's no sense
in you being convicted of a felony.

235
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,047
Oh, gee, dad,
you're always looking out for me.

236
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:18,242
Thanks for the advice.

237
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:39,684
I don't know.

238
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,192
Hey, Cassidy.

239
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:42,849
Who's Amber?

240
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:44,541
I have no idea.

241
00:12:44,782 --> 00:12:46,032
They keyed the wrong car?

242
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:49,304
How's Amber gonna know
that she's a bitch?

243
00:12:49,356 --> 00:12:51,310
No yeah... this is...
this is hysterical.

244
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:52,859
Do you know
how much this is gonna cost to fix,

245
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,585
not to mention
how long it's gonna take?

246
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:56,555
Hey, Veronica.

247
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:57,827
Hey...

248
00:12:58,314 --> 00:12:59,620
...You.

249
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,631
Hart.

250
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:02,740
I haven't said a thing.

251
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,839
Good for you.

252
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:09,602
Beav.

253
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:12,256
I think I know someone
who can help you.

254
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,998
Finals are so stupid.

255
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:16,406
We already learned this stuff.

256
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:18,723
Why do we have to try
and learn it all over again?

257
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,509
You know what we should do?

258
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:21,450
Take a break?

259
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:23,653
I was thinking more,
take a practice test.

260
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:26,399
The company that does
the textbook has one online.

261
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,213
You're really a good student,
Veronica.

262
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:32,633
It's kind of sweet.

263
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:35,112
Oh,  my god.

264
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,192
It doesn't look that bad.

265
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:40,305
No, I'm on myspace, and I used to have
like a thousand friends,

266
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:43,310
and suddenly, for some reason,
now I only have 900-something.

267
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:53,115
Oh, damn it.

268
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:54,434
What?

269
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:55,798
My computer just crashed.

270
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,742
Is there another computer I can use?

271
00:13:57,954 --> 00:13:59,487
We have, like, 80 computers.

272
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:01,576
There's one in the guest room
you could use.

273
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:06,860
No more cyber-friends, Gia.
Health test.

274
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:19,547
Lucky's e-mails...
Lucky's e-mails...

275
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:20,735
Lucky's e-mails...

276
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,242
"Kill incorporation or else. "

277
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:41,666
Or else what?

278
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:50,040
<i>We have to tell people what
Woody did to the three of us.</i>

279
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,600
<i>It's gonna come out some day.</i>

280
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:54,519
<i>A couple of the Sharks
had to know about it.</i>

281
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:55,861
<i>They'll come forward.</i>

282
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:58,287
<i>Things like this don't stay secret.</i>

283
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,645
<i>Damn right. Woody's a pervert.
He's sick.</i>

284
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:03,589
<i>What he did to us is wrong.</i>

285
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:05,268
<i>We were just kids.</i>

286
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:11,445
Come on.

287
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:24,186
Veronica.
What are you doing in here?

288
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,756
Hey, mr. Goodman.

289
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,799
Gia said I could use the computer.

290
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:37,544
I was taking a practice test,
and my laptop died.

291
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:39,567
I hope you don't mind.

292
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,353
Come on, Veronica.

293
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:43,500
Mi casa es su casa.

294
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,138
So, how did it work out for you?

295
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:55,298
Sorry?

296
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:58,593
Your practice test.
Are you as smart as you think you are?

297
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:00,849
I hope so.

298
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:04,772
I- I should get back to Gia.

299
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,466
Mm-hmm.

300
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:22,100
Gia?

301
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:30,041
Where are you going?

302
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:31,722
I have study fuel.

303
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:32,603
I have to go.

304
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:36,335
I get these headache things,
and I feel one coming.

305
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:41,795
It's the computer screen.
All that squinting...

306
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:43,295
it can't be good for you.

307
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,098
Hmm, well, thanks.

308
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:48,426
I'll see you tomorrow, Gia.

309
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,728
Do you hear those voices
in the background?

310
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,915
Are they speaking french?

311
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,508
<i>We have to tell people what
Woody did to the three of us.</i>

312
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,871
Three of us.

313
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,619
<i>A couple of the sharks had to know...</i>

314
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,373
Didn't it just sound like two guys?

315
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:08,204
Those gaps in the audio.

316
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:11,379
I think another speaker
was edited out of this recording.

317
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:14,629
"A couple of the sharks
had to know about it. "

318
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,557
Lucky was a bat boy for the Sharks.

319
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,845
And that's when he met Woody.

320
00:17:17,948 --> 00:17:20,366
Did lucky's e-mail say anything
about being molested?

321
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:21,569
It's hard to say.

322
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:24,827
It's a lot of crazy rambling
stream-of-consciousness

323
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,557
ranting about war
and the life of a soldier.

324
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,959
It's hard to make sense of him.

325
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:29,772
I'll help you.

326
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:32,005
Honey. 
I want you to go to bed.

327
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:33,884
You have a big day tomorrow.

328
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,548
Do you swear to tell the truth,

329
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,324
the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth, so help you god?

330
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:41,958
I do.

331
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:50,928
Miss Mars, you find wealth
and fame seductive, don't you?

332
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,536
- Objection.
- I'll back up.

333
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,274
Your past two boyfriends,

334
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:57,202
Duncan Kane and the accused's son,
Logan Echolls,

335
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:59,093
certainly fit that description,
do they not?

336
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:00,246
They do.

337
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:03,098
And  Lilly Kane was your best friend.

338
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:04,229
Yes.

339
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,773
You looked up to her.

340
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,104
Yes.

341
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:08,779
Emulated her?

342
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:10,106
To a degree.

343
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:12,137
Is that why
you propositioned mr. Echolls

344
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:14,996
upon discovering the tape
of Lilly and my client kissing?

345
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,228
You mean naked kissing
with Aaron on top gyrating?

346
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:21,363
That tape?

347
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:22,658
You watched the tape.

348
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:24,784
You found mr. Echolls
at the Kane party,

349
00:18:24,893 --> 00:18:26,566
and you told him that you'd
give him back the tapes,

350
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:28,188
but he had to earn them.

351
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:30,592
What exactly did you mean by "earn"?

352
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,578
I never said that.
I didn't proposition mr. Echolls.

353
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:36,115
He hid in my backseat.

354
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:39,516
Miss Mars,

355
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,810
you're how old?

356
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:43,410
18.

357
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:45,486
And you're currently
completing treatment

358
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:48,407
-for a sexually transmitted disease?
-Objection.

359
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:50,281
I'll allow it.

360
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:55,990
Should I repeat the question?

361
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:58,560
I've completed the treatment.

362
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:09,314
Are you okay?

363
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:11,220
Yeah.

364
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:13,442
I mean, you're okay.

365
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,271
Everything's okay?

366
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,030
Yeah, I'm fine.

367
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:29,032
Sheriff, judge Ferris
wants to see you A.S.A.P.

368
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:34,132
You wanted to see me,
judge?

369
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,729
There's been a development,
sheriff.

370
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:39,494
It seems mr. Lobo here
was struck by a bolt of lightning.

371
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,031
What, that he could cash old 
ladies' social security checks himself

372
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:43,425
and get rid of the slot machines?

373
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,879
I was with Terrence cook
at the time of the bus crash.

374
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,032
There's no way he could be responsible
for killing those kids.

375
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:53,216
Are you sure you don't want to take
another couple months to think it over?

376
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,045
My memory isn't what it used to be.

377
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:57,995
But I was watching
this nature program about sharks,

378
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,824
and I thought, "Sharks...

379
00:20:00,636 --> 00:20:02,529
My friend Terrence Cook
played for the Sharks. "

380
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:05,358
And I realized
I haven't seen him since...

381
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:08,729
well, that's when I went
and checked my appointment calendar

382
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:10,964
and saw it was the day
of that terrible accident.

383
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,424
If mr. Lobo takes the stand,

384
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:15,574
the jury will find out
about his... dealings.

385
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,464
However,

386
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:18,806
the jury might be
more inclined to believe either my...

387
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:22,418
corporate attorney
or my chief financial officer.

388
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:25,880
They were also with mr. Cook
on the night in question.

389
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:30,878
This is pointless.

390
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,804
No, okay, look. So, you know
quadratic equations, right?

391
00:20:34,856 --> 00:20:37,402
Do I look like someone
who knows quadratic equations?

392
00:20:37,507 --> 00:20:39,686
I'm just trying
to see what you already know.

393
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:42,054
Zero. You want your car fixed?
Teach me.

394
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,075
Okay. Okay.

395
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:45,030
All right look,
so this equation right here,

396
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:46,507
what do you think
that we should do first?

397
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:49,447
Am I a 5-year-old girl?
Huh?

398
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,289
Lay it out for me, dog.
Come on, make me understand.

399
00:20:52,347 --> 00:20:53,209
Okay, okay.

400
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:55,405
Okay,

401
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:57,264
Okay, so let's say
that you and your buddy

402
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:58,934
you wanna buy
a 12-pack of a certain item,

403
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,374
say, like, spark plugs for "x" dollars,

404
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,769
and you want to find out
how many of another item,

405
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:04,956
like, huh...

406
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:06,761
I don't know, like oil, right,

407
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,307
like oil that you can get
for the same amount,

408
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:11,788
except oil is "y" times as much as...

409
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,391
if this is your idea
of terms I'll understand,

410
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:16,277
I'm going to kill you.

411
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:20,290
Or myself.
It's a toss-up.

412
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,213
Screw it, man.
I'll just cheat.

413
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:24,657
No, but...
what about my car?

414
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:28,022
You know power buffers,
right?

415
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:30,895
Let's say your door panel
is a summer home, right,

416
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:33,598
and you need to clear out the south
lawn to make a tennis court,

417
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:35,843
- so...
- F-O-I-L.

418
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,042
That's all it is.

419
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,561
First, outside,
inside, last.

420
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,135
All algebra...
it's just the formula.

421
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,309
Now, can you teach me that?

422
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:45,771
You'll still fix his car?

423
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:47,310
That's the deal.

424
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:52,204
Okay, say you and your buddy
buy a 12-pack of spark plugs.

425
00:21:52,785 --> 00:21:53,972
I'm just kidding.

426
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:58,564
Here's the quadratic equation.

427
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,629
Hello? Hello? I'm trying
to reach Rick Pickett.

428
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,720
No, Rick Pickett.

429
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:13,684
He's a freshman.

430
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:16,085
Well, maybe you...

431
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,482
- Veronica.
- Yeah?

432
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,146
Can you fly to New York,
stop by N.Y.U. real quick,

433
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:26,110
find Rick Pickett,

434
00:22:26,163 --> 00:22:28,337
and see if he was one of
the bat boys Woody molested?

435
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:30,091
You know I don't fly coach.

436
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:38,651
So, there were three other bat boys
the year lucky worked for the Sharks.

437
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:40,910
Two are away at college.

438
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:42,960
One is backpacking through Europe.

439
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:45,178
I'm not doing any better
with Lucky's e-mails.

440
00:22:45,654 --> 00:22:47,592
What,
you can't understand...

441
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:51,144
<i>"Time is the timeliness of the present"</i>

442
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:52,196
<i>You should respond.</i>

443
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:53,863
<i>"I've left you so many presents,</i>

444
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:55,748
<i>if you don't find them,
they'll find you. "</i>

445
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,782
Wait.

446
00:22:57,058 --> 00:22:59,116
When I found lucky
in the janitor's closet with Gia,

447
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:02,450
he was showing her a scar he got
in Iraq from a "present"

448
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:04,029
left by the insurgents.

449
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:06,988
He called roadside bombs
"presents. "

450
00:23:08,578 --> 00:23:10,221
Oh, no.

451
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:14,125
Woody, we need to talk.

452
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:15,894
I'm a little busy today, Keith.

453
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:17,785
Do want to have
this conversation in private,

454
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:19,218
or shall I just start talking?

455
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:29,190
You need to call your family
and get them out of the house.

456
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,627
Then you need to call the bomb
squad and comb the place.

457
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:33,079
What are you talking about?

458
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:34,533
The e-mails Lucky sent you...

459
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:36,999
they reference "presents"
he's left for you.

460
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:38,880
He called bombs "presents. "

461
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:41,515
Tommy is dead, Keith.
It's over.

462
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:44,218
Wait, how did you...

463
00:23:45,355 --> 00:23:46,644
Veronica.

464
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,923
Most adults don't have their children
doing espionage work for them.

465
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:55,014
Most adults keep their hands off
of other people's children.

466
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:00,876
You should leave, Keith.

467
00:24:01,136 --> 00:24:03,182
I read Lucky's e-mails to you, Woody.

468
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,551
It's clear to me this is more
than simply a bat boy

469
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:08,120
who resented getting fired.

470
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:15,393
I'll put this plainly.

471
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:18,625
You are mistaken.

472
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:23,106
And if you share your theories,
slander me, I'll ruin you.

473
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:25,073
I'll ruin your family,

474
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:27,369
and you'll remember the moment
you walked through that door

475
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:28,945
as the moment you threw your life away.

476
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:32,185
I'm not a 15-year-old boy,
Woody.

477
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,353
You don't scare me.

478
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,844
All right. Stand back.

479
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,895
It's time to watch me
work my culinary magic.

480
00:24:44,131 --> 00:24:46,279
Wait, don't you want to put
on a little frilly apron first?

481
00:24:46,324 --> 00:24:48,081
- Jackie?
- Dad?

482
00:24:49,343 --> 00:24:51,484
What are you doing here?

483
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:52,794
They let me out.

484
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,557
Your old man is a free man.

485
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:03,209
I can't believe it.
How did this happen?

486
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:06,679
A witness came forward and verified
that I didn't use a cellphone

487
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:07,983
at the time of the bus crash.

488
00:25:08,203 --> 00:25:10,257
- So you get to stay?
- Right here.

489
00:25:10,723 --> 00:25:11,713
I'm gonna let you two celebrate.

490
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:14,391
Congratulations, mr. Cook.

491
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,803
No, tonight I get to hang with my two
favorite men in the whole world.

492
00:25:20,248 --> 00:25:22,182
What do you bet that'll be
the first of many

493
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:24,981
"I knew you were innocent
all along" gift baskets?

494
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:28,702
Hello?

495
00:25:30,148 --> 00:25:34,303
Out an hour, and you've some sweet
young thing waiting on you.

496
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,116
That's my Terrence.

497
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:37,709
This is my daughter.

498
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,462
Maybe you want to send her out
for ice cream or something.

499
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:43,701
Jackie? Let's go get started on dinner.

500
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:50,935
Isn't there something
you want to say to me?

501
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,890
"Thank you, mr. Lobo.

502
00:25:53,831 --> 00:25:55,111
How could I ever repay you?"

503
00:25:55,775 --> 00:26:00,305
Ah, forget it. I consider it
a business investment.

504
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:02,440
Leonard, as soon as I get on my feet,
I'm gonna...

505
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,939
On your feet?

506
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:07,215
You fixed a game, Cook.

507
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:09,574
Your sport-hero days are over.

508
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,258
You're a sideshow now.

509
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:12,832
But you're right.

510
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:14,421
You'll be on your feet...

511
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:18,273
standing at the entrance of my casinos,

512
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:21,388
glad-handing every bozo
with a wallet who walks in.

513
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,091
I don't know where you were
at the time of the crash,

514
00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:26,746
but I know where you'll be
from now on...

515
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:29,523
wherever I put you.

516
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,109
And if you work real hard,

517
00:26:32,287 --> 00:26:35,341
you'll have me paid off in a decade.

518
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:46,566
After a week of forced smiles
and the occasional 

519
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:48,423
"hey, it's time for business as usual"

520
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:50,303
ain't epic love grand?

521
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:52,481
Been to any good murder trials lately?

522
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:56,597
Uh... I have.

523
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,602
You give an excellent testimony,
by the way.

524
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,404
It was gripping.

525
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:04,108
I want to ask you about something.

526
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,433
How unlike you.

527
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:08,949
You never come to me out of the blue
with some random question.

528
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:12,279
Did Lucky ever tell you anything
about Woody Goodman

529
00:27:12,378 --> 00:27:14,847
or the time he spent
as a bat boy for the Sharks?

530
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,658
No, he never mentioned the sharks.

531
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:20,180
But there was this weird...

532
00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:22,698
 semi-baseball-related thing
that happened last summer.

533
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,453
Dude,
I think I got gangrene.

534
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:28,939
Yeah, uh...

535
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,703
so, I need a keg delivered
to the beach tonight.

536
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:34,158
You know,
they're doing something to me.

537
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:37,382
Or... or...
or I'm poisoning myself.

538
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:40,444
He was wearing
a catcher's mask? Really?

539
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:42,371
And I thought the weird part
was the foot-bleaching.

540
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:44,462
You know, he'd wear
the catcher's mask a lot...

541
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:46,573
whenever we were "going into battle. "

542
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:49,988
I thought it was an affectation.

543
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,198
Veronica told me she was
on her way home.

544
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:56,916
When she didn't show up
when she should have,

545
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,211
I drove the route I knew
she would have taken.

546
00:28:00,502 --> 00:28:02,630
I saw her car, stopped, got out.

547
00:28:02,873 --> 00:28:05,406
I heard a commotion
in the back of a nearby house

548
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:07,328
and went looking for Veronica.

549
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:08,996
Then I was jumped.

550
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:10,447
Well, mr. Echolls testified

551
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:13,815
that after Veronica lost control
of the car and crashed it,

552
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:16,613
they knocked on the door
of a nearby house,

553
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,983
asked the owner to call a tow truck,

554
00:28:19,613 --> 00:28:22,708
and Veronica and Aaron
waited on the man's porch.

555
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:24,252
You arrived,

556
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:27,187
saw your daughter
in a compromising position,

557
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,866
and started a physical altercation
with mr. Echolls.

558
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:34,056
And this version has been confirmed
by the occupant of the house.

559
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:36,378
Objection, the homeowner
has disappeared,

560
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:37,851
and despite being subpoenaed,

561
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:39,572
has never been questioned
by the prosecution.

562
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,883
Sustained.

563
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:44,879
Does you daughter
ever lie to you, mr. Mars?

564
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,726
I'm sure she's had occasion to fib.

565
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,968
She is a teenage girl,
after all.

566
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,517
Other than the occasional fib,

567
00:28:51,615 --> 00:28:53,880
would you say that you have
a close relationship?

568
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:55,669
I would say very close.

569
00:28:55,852 --> 00:28:59,078
So, you would expect to hear the
truth on what most people would call...

570
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,447
the "big issues. "

571
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:04,114
I would.

572
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:10,511
Are you aware that your daughter
was caught breaking into the home

573
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:13,153
of Stewart and Rose Manning?

574
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:14,853
No, I wasn't aware of that.

575
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:19,079
She was also named in a disciplinary
file of deputy Leo d'Amato.

576
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:20,453
Apparently, she managed to...

577
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,042
what's the word I'm looking for...

578
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,488
manipulate her way into the records
room while he was on duty.

579
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:26,241
Did you know about that?

580
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,779
If you thought I knew, you 
wouldn't be asking me, would you?

581
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:31,112
For the court record, Mr. Mars,
is that a "no"?

582
00:29:31,163 --> 00:29:32,513
Yes, it's a "no".

583
00:29:32,672 --> 00:29:35,949
Did your daughter have a personal
relationship with mr. D'amato?

584
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:37,373
Yes, they dated.

585
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:42,016
The county commissioner hired you to
investigate the stolen Echolls tapes.

586
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:46,074
Your report suggested that
Logan Echolls procured the tapes

587
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:47,787
due to the negligence of d'Amato.

588
00:29:47,838 --> 00:29:48,643
That's correct.

589
00:29:48,712 --> 00:29:50,676
Doesn't that stand to reason
that your daughter,

590
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:54,159
who clearly had this deputy
wrapped around her finger,

591
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,359
manipulated him, in whatever way
thet pretty young girls

592
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:59,705
manage to manipulate
older men, once again?

593
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:01,614
You want to be careful there,
mr. Lavoie.

594
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:05,445
She knew the tapes didn't show
what she said they showed,

595
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:10,300
so she convinced one "boyfriend"
to give them to another "boyfriend",

596
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:11,606
who she knew would destroy them,

597
00:30:11,658 --> 00:30:15,458
thus deflecting blame from yet
another "boyfriend", Duncan Kane.

598
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:18,283
Any more air quotes,
and I'll break those fingers off.

599
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:20,056
Bailiff,
have this witness taken.

600
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,086
I'm fine, your honor.

601
00:30:23,273 --> 00:30:24,325
Witness can be excused.

602
00:30:29,515 --> 00:30:31,926
Okay, you put another "x"
on that paper,

603
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:33,669
and we're gonna have a problem.

604
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:35,244
I'd put little smiley faces,

605
00:30:35,297 --> 00:30:36,998
but I don't know
if that's going to sell "wrong".

606
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:39,692
I told you you went too fast
on balancing equations.

607
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,273
I didn't go too fast.

608
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:42,524
You ploughed right through.

609
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:44,304
I didn't even understand
what you were talking about.

610
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,952
No surprise there.

611
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:47,208
What, are you saying
you're smarter than me?

612
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,483
No, I wasn't. Here's what
that would have sounded like...

613
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,636
I'm smarter than you.
You hear the difference?

614
00:30:52,688 --> 00:30:54,200
You don't really believe that.

615
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:56,237
Then why did I get it
tattooed on my hip?

616
00:30:56,668 --> 00:30:58,970
If this is what you need to do
to feel better about yourself...

617
00:30:59,164 --> 00:31:00,679
if I get you an "A," will you shiv him?

618
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,145
Hey, I got an idea.

619
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:06,194
How about you two geniuses go work out
your aggression in some coatroom

620
00:31:06,246 --> 00:31:08,282
and then come back here
and teach me algebra, huh?

621
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:26,039
So, I did a little digging.

622
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,923
Without breaking any laws
or putting myself in danger,

623
00:31:29,976 --> 00:31:31,102
and I did it at school,

624
00:31:31,152 --> 00:31:32,895
so you knew exactly
where I was at the time.

625
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:35,281
You understand
why I don't find this amusing.

626
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:36,313
I do.

627
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,279
So what did you find out,
Veronica?

628
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,582
Logan told me he once found 
Lucky in the janitor's closet

629
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:44,926
wearing only jeans and a catcher's mask
and bleaching his feet.

630
00:31:46,174 --> 00:31:47,931
This is who they hire
at my high school.

631
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:49,431
He was wearing a catcher's mask?

632
00:31:51,448 --> 00:31:52,302
Yeah.

633
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:53,989
Why, what are you doing?

634
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:57,624
I want to look at the surveillance
tape Lucky sent to Woody.

635
00:31:57,688 --> 00:31:59,487
I think I remember seeing something.

636
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,538
I don't understand.
What am I looking at?

637
00:32:01,591 --> 00:32:03,102
It's a painting behind the table.

638
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:04,871
That's a catcher's mask.

639
00:32:13,102 --> 00:32:14,813
Inga? Keith Mars.

640
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,119
Why is he filming the wall like that?

641
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,962
I need you to call the bomb squad.

642
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,808
There's a problem at the Goodman home.

643
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,230
Woody's little-league team
was called the Sharks?

644
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:25,638
-Oh, my god.
-I know,

645
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:29,435
but I think lucky may have hid a bomb
behind a painting in their dining room.

646
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,927
Dad,
you need to see this.

647
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:38,044
Okay, but you'll let me know?

648
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:39,697
Thank you.

649
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:44,079
That's Marcos Oliveras.
That's Peter Ferrer.

650
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:46,095
Two of the boys
who died in the bus crash

651
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:47,981
were on Woody's little-league team...

652
00:32:48,555 --> 00:32:49,573
the Sharks.

653
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:01,798
How long is this gonna take?
This is ridiculous.

654
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,266
They found something.
There was a bomb under your car.

655
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,401
They did a thorough sweep
of the house. It's clear.

656
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,939
Your stalker obviously meant business.

657
00:33:21,972 --> 00:33:24,541
Hey, late night, huh?

658
00:33:25,445 --> 00:33:27,609
I guess you're due
for a couple rowdy evenings.

659
00:33:27,713 --> 00:33:28,665
I was working.

660
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:31,669
So, what's this new job?
You haven't told me anything.

661
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:33,446
What kind of work
do they have you doing?

662
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,975
The kind of work I have to do, okay?

663
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:39,939
Well, when's your night off?
We still need to celebrate.

664
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:41,764
I can't make any plans right now,
Jackie.

665
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:44,611
Okay, that's fine.

666
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:47,259
It's not like we're pressed for time
or anything.

667
00:33:47,537 --> 00:33:49,357
I've decided not to go to Paris...

668
00:33:51,224 --> 00:33:52,636
at least not for a semester.

669
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:54,371
I don't think that's a good idea.

670
00:33:55,421 --> 00:33:58,996
I'm going to be working a lot now,
and traveling nonstop.

671
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:02,493
I don't know when I'm gonna be here,
and when I'm not gonna be here.

672
00:34:03,331 --> 00:34:04,965
-It's not fair to you.
-But I don't mind.

673
00:34:05,017 --> 00:34:06,736
It's not fair to either of us,
Jackie, alright?

674
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:12,397
I think it's in both of our best
interests if you just go to France.

675
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,734
<i>Woody's a pervert.
He's sick.</i>

676
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,711
<i>What he did to us is wrong.</i>

677
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:27,626
<i>We were just kids.</i>

678
00:34:29,557 --> 00:34:31,659
It's Marcos Oliveras and Peter Ferrer,

679
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:34,004
two of the kids killed
in the bus crash.

680
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:36,872
I verified Peter's voice
with his teacher, mr. Wu,

681
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:39,472
and I have tapes of Marcos
from a radio show he did.

682
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,098
Woody molested Marcos and Peter.

683
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:44,398
They were gonna come forward,
so he killed them.

684
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:46,701
-By putting a bomb on the bus.
-Yes.

685
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:49,288
Then he used the same type
of phone-activated bomb

686
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:51,502
on his own car to blow himself up.

687
00:34:51,794 --> 00:34:53,495
There was a bomb in Woody's car?

688
00:34:53,652 --> 00:34:54,646
You were right, Keith.

689
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,404
You thought Lucky
planted a bomb, and he did.

690
00:34:57,749 --> 00:35:00,225
Did you know that Lucky blew off work
the day of the crash?

691
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:02,610
Lucky is not responsible for this.

692
00:35:02,825 --> 00:35:04,950
You want to hear my theory
on the whole situation?

693
00:35:05,242 --> 00:35:07,394
You are trying to get me
to arrest the mayor.

694
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:09,835
You want to turn me into
a laughingstock again,

695
00:35:10,168 --> 00:35:11,239
and it ain't gonna happen.

696
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:13,318
Is your ego really that enormous

697
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:15,185
that you can take
the murder of eight people

698
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,503
and make it about you?

699
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:18,616
If you don't act on this,

700
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:21,662
Woody's gonna use all his money
and resources to disappear.

701
00:35:21,713 --> 00:35:23,587
You won't be a laughingstock.

702
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:28,112
You'll be the guy who let a child
molester and a murderer get away!

703
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:31,265
There was just some fuzz.

704
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,257
Static, no picture.

705
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:40,818
And then I saw Lilly,
wearing only her bra,

706
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:42,955
sitting on top of someone, writhing.

707
00:35:43,582 --> 00:35:45,040
I couldn't see who it was at first,

708
00:35:45,221 --> 00:35:47,472
and then they rolled over,
and I saw my father.

709
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:56,524
He climbed on top of her
and continued to have sex with her.

710
00:35:58,226 --> 00:36:00,689
He actually smiled at the camera
a couple times.

711
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:06,231
You're certain they were having sex?

712
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,377
Yes.

713
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,273
No further questions,
your honor.

714
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:10,639
Your witness, mr. Lavoie.

715
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,456
Mr. Echolls, you claimed
you destroyed the tapes.

716
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,306
You are aware that's a felony ?

717
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:19,320
Yes.

718
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,631
Were you granted immunity
in exchange for your testimony?

719
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:23,769
Yes, I was.

720
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,302
Thank you.

721
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:27,696
No further questions,
your honor.

722
00:36:45,576 --> 00:36:46,812
I need to talk to someone about this.

723
00:36:47,148 --> 00:36:48,130
This boy that was killed...

724
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:50,574
The night that he went missing,
my boys saw someone attack him.

725
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:52,989
They say they got a pretty good look.

726
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,952
You boys feel like looking
at some pictures?

727
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,871
Congratulations, Eli.

728
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:14,896
Oh, hell, yeah!

729
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,633
It was this guy.

730
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:29,745
Don... you got to see this.

731
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:34,368
Lucky wasn't at work
the day of the bus crash

732
00:37:34,472 --> 00:37:37,048
because he was in a padded cell
at a V.A. Hospital.

733
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:40,355
Sacks.

734
00:37:41,185 --> 00:37:42,532
I'll go pick Woody up.

735
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:44,054
Well, I guess you heard.

736
00:37:44,704 --> 00:37:45,404
About what?

737
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:48,001
The Echolls trial.
The jury reached a verdict.

738
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:53,553
I just took
my last high-school test ever.

739
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:54,849
Done. Over.

740
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:56,459
I'm out of here.

741
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,389
And you decided to celebrate
by torturing me?

742
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:01,213
What do you got?
One more?

743
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:02,874
Nothing like having your future rest

744
00:38:02,925 --> 00:38:06,107
on how much you know about the
ascendency rules of babylon.

745
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:09,755
Well, I got to go clean out my locker.

746
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:12,414
You got that salmon
I left in there for you, right?

747
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,302
You better enjoy this 'cause
this is as nostalgic as I get.

748
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:24,131
I just wanted to say it was worth
getting taped to a pole.

749
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,417
<i>[Adrienne Pierce - "Lost and Found"]</i>

750
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:27,544
I'm gonna miss you.

751
00:38:29,426 --> 00:38:31,029
And my stupid-ass face?

752
00:38:32,037 --> 00:38:34,010
<i><song playable online!></i>

753
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:39,232
I got to go grab my stuff,
then I'll pick up my lady,

754
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:40,852
do a little celebrating.

755
00:38:41,673 --> 00:38:46,598
<i>Sleeping with the television
and all the lights on...</i>

756
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,820
This conversation never happened.

757
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:50,889
Sure it did.

758
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:53,950
<i>...but we're both already gone.</i>

759
00:38:57,153 --> 00:39:01,934
<i>Stuck at the lost and found, we...
watch things disappear.</i>

760
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:09,806
<i>Looking for the missing piece, but...
it was never here...</i>

761
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,926
The verdict is in...

762
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:48,237
Afternoon, mr. Cook.

763
00:39:48,577 --> 00:39:49,481
I'm just picking up Jackie.

764
00:39:49,705 --> 00:39:50,670
She's not here, Wallace.

765
00:39:50,773 --> 00:39:53,710
Oh, well, she knows I'm coming,
so... you mind if I wait?

766
00:39:53,763 --> 00:39:55,503
Jackie left for France this morning.

767
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:57,251
She wanted me to give you this.

768
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,159
I'm sorry.

769
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,188
So, Lamb,
you got Woody in custody yet?

770
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,475
Woody's gone.

771
00:40:18,353 --> 00:40:21,051
He took his private plane.
There's no flight plan on record.

772
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:23,681
All rise.

773
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,134
Foreman, has the jury
reached a verdict?

774
00:40:35,306 --> 00:40:36,503
We have, your honor.

775
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,655
On the count of murder
in the second degree,

776
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:47,584
we find the defendant...

777
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,386
...not guilty.

778
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,731
On the count of aggravated assault,

779
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:56,326
we find the defendant not guilty.

780
00:40:57,728 --> 00:40:59,668
On the count of statutory rape,

781
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:03,302
we find the defendant not guilty.
