1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,276
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:03,995
Are you keeping a dead
rat in our freezer?

3
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:05,156
I found it on the bus.

4
00:00:05,223 --> 00:00:06,912
You checked out the bus
and didn't tell me?

5
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,503
I should've taken over this case.

6
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,802
You ever hit the clubs
in L.A. Veronica?

7
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:10,540
I'm 18.

8
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,153
I'm a bouncer.

9
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:12,659
You come up, I'll get you in.

10
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:13,548
Okay.

11
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,952
I thought you killed Felix.

12
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,643
I didn't.

13
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:16,767
It's down to 2 guys.

14
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:17,699
How we gonna figure out who did it?

15
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,288
The one that did it is the one who is 
in business with the Fitzpatricks.

16
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,364
Who are you?

17
00:00:21,382 --> 00:00:22,381
I'm your father.

18
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:24,864
You sent me in to arrest Carl Morgan,

19
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:26,225
A.K.A. Nathan Woods.

20
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,386
Chicago cop.

21
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:28,744
Why did you really come back Wallace?

22
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:30,411
Then you know my new
teammate was Rashard Rucker.

23
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,446
Rashard had a few beers but...

24
00:00:31,496 --> 00:00:33,113
He said he was okay to drive.

25
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:35,560
This wino staggered in front
of the car. He hit him.

26
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:36,646
Ernie Sayers,

27
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,672
Chicago statesman.

28
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:39,683
The homeless man was
a victim of a hit-and-run.

29
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:40,601
So what's the question?

30
00:00:40,652 --> 00:00:44,212
The question is what kind of man
were you planning on being?

31
00:00:57,493 --> 00:01:00,047
So, the manager's boyfriend
just dumped her

32
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:02,159
and she says this helps
with the stress.

33
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:02,986
What is it?

34
00:01:03,184 --> 00:01:05,353
A german chocolate nut-gasm.

35
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:08,287
I don't think that's gonna help.

36
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,432
Well, eat it anyway because
Rashard Rucker isn't just any guy.

37
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:17,638
You are about to implicate the
basketball phenom of the decade,

38
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:19,567
the second coming of Lebron James,

39
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:21,171
in a hit-and-run.

40
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:23,026
And all those people around him,

41
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:26,327
waiting for it to start
raining million-dollar bills...

42
00:01:26,684 --> 00:01:28,699
they might open
their newspapers tomorrow

43
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:30,929
and decide they don't like you.

44
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,210
I got to do the right thing.

45
00:01:33,616 --> 00:01:35,121
But, look,
you don't have to do this.

46
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:36,750
I'll be fine.

47
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,615
Please. Let me.

48
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:42,396
My boyfriend just fled the country
with his dead ex-girlfriend's baby.

49
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:44,138
I need a project.

50
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:47,200
Your reporter is here.

51
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:48,166
I'll send him over.

52
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:49,630
Don't let him misspell your name.

53
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:52,557
Keith.

54
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:54,454
Evening, Inga.
How's police work?

55
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:57,423
Don got some big bus
crash leads hidden away?

56
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,264
I know nothing.

57
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,079
Oh, okay.

58
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:03,873
I'm being audited --
no big deal --

59
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:06,553
but I was hoping you could
get me copies of

60
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:09,749
these old expense
and salary documents.

61
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,535
Goodness.

62
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:11,855
We have it,

63
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:13,850
but it will take me
awhile to dig this out.

64
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:17,930
I've got me a book
and a Bad Company album.

65
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:20,323
Take all the time you need.

66
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:24,165
You ever lose a card?

67
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,999
So? If somebody found it,
it's no good.

68
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,639
We change the codes.

69
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:31,367
You still need a card,
right?

70
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:33,424
Inga has the codes in a drawer.

71
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:35,526
She can just make
a new card right there.

72
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,695
No one keeps an eye on
the third floor evidence room.

73
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:01,935
The hard drive of the surveillance
camera is so undersized

74
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:03,889
that they have to dump the files
every couple days.

75
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:51,943
Bless you, Inga.

76
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:53,207
My pleasure.

77
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:54,692
How was your book?

78
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:58,460
Weird, but I expect it'll start
making more sense soon.

79
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:01,016
Hey.

80
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:03,767
Oh, you look better than I expected.

81
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:07,300
I figured you'd be covered
in eggs and rotten fruit

82
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,665
hurled by angry basketball aficionados.

83
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,823
Me, too,
but there's nothing.

84
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:13,204
I checked online, radio.
No word.

85
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:15,724
Maybe he's just a slow typist.

86
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:18,653
You should try that cobbler,
Molly.

87
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:20,015
It'll surprise you.

88
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,495
Thanks for the tip,
but I don't really like surprises.

89
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:25,418
And why are you sitting here?

90
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:29,521
Well, I was gonna start with
some small talk, but okay.

91
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:31,989
Were you dating Felix?

92
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:33,962
What? No.
What are you...?

93
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:38,527
Where did you get this?

94
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:41,827
Apparently, he was gonna get you
tattooed somewhere on his person.

95
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:43,162
And from your reaction,

96
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,226
I'm guessing it wasn't gonna 
be on his forehead.

97
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:47,973
Yeah,
it was kind of a secret,

98
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:49,672
and I'd appreciate it if it stayed...

99
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,798
Was he working for your family?
Was he dealing for them?

100
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:54,169
What? I thought you were friends,
but If you're asking me that,

101
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:55,170
you didn't know him at all.

102
00:04:56,835 --> 00:04:58,614
No,  I knew him.

103
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,181
My uncles and cousins
didn't know about us.

104
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,782
If they'd have known, they 
probably would've killed us both.

105
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:08,609
How did you guys even meet?

106
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,071
At church.

107
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:12,015
St. Mary's.

108
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,114
Of  course.

109
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:15,404
Only place the Micks and
the Spiks ever get together

110
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:17,555
without someone getting punched.

111
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:18,737
My uncle's a priest there.

112
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:20,616
Liam Fitzpatrick?

113
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,915
If that guy's a priest,
then I'm Buzz Aldrin.

114
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:24,566
His brother Patrick.

115
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,405
That's my family.

116
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:30,840
12 hoodlums, one priest.

117
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:36,381
You haven't touched your cobbler.

118
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:39,218
Yeah, I don't like surprises,
either.

119
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:48,126
Hello?

120
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:50,308
Wallace, you know what's
in this morning's paper?

121
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,275
Nathan?

122
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:54,744
Look I know what you said,

123
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,126
but I just couldn't pretend.

124
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:58,914
I had to do the right thing.

125
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:00,204
The right thing?

126
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:01,991
Son, do you know what it says?

127
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,741
No, but I know what I...

128
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,718
this is why I wanted you to keep quiet.

129
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:08,296
Rashard, and the other two kids in
the car, just came out saying

130
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,223
when the car hit the homeless guy,
you were driving.

131
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:18,128
<i>A long time ago,</i>

132
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,476
<i>We used to be friends, but I</i>

133
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:24,668
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

134
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,846
<i>Come on, now, sugar!</i>

135
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,257
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

136
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:33,752
<i>Just remember me when</i>

137
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:36,107
<i>We used to be friends</i>

138
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:38,295
<i>A long time ago</i>

139
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,661
<i>We used to be friends</i>

140
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:45,668
<i>Veronica Mars 2x12
Rashard and Wallace go to White Castle</i>

141
00:06:46,236 --> 00:06:48,936
So that's what happens when 
you try to do the right thing.

142
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:51,492
Just looks like I'm trying to
weasel out of my evil deeds.

143
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,344
No, the weasel is this basketball guy.

144
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,142
God,
I just want him smashed.

145
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,323
Hey, the paper's from the library.

146
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:00,807
The last thing I need is the
librarian turning on me, too.

147
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:03,344
And Rashard's cool.
It's not like he's not like...

148
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,359
Cool?

149
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,138
Um...are we thinking of the same word?

150
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,468
Because I don't remember, say,

151
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,333
Steve McQueen ever hitting
a homeless man in his hummer

152
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:13,921
and framing someone else for it.

153
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,691
No, he's got this uncle.
He's like his father,

154
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:18,216
manager, and enforcer.

155
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,741
These guys all lying?

156
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:21,407
That's got to be because of him --

157
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,432
Uncle Rucker --
paying 'em off or scaring 'em.

158
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:27,602
Look, he's coming here.

159
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:29,377
U.C.L.A. Is trying to recruit him.

160
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:30,960
If I could just talk
to Rashard alone...

161
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:32,627
We were friends.
I'm sure he...

162
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:33,565
Yeah, he'd say,

163
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:36,099
"Excuse me. You're standing
between me and my money."

164
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:41,689
Man, is there anybody you don't
think is corrupt deep down?

165
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:43,234
Yes, you.

166
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:45,140
And I don't want you suffering for it.

167
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,237
Because jail...

168
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,699
it's no fun.

169
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:48,592
What's no fun?

170
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:51,290
Um...jail.

171
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,954
Oh, I thought you were talking
about Mr. Wu's game-show quiz.

172
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:56,443
No, I was talking about jail.

173
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,330
So, Wallace, I haven't seen
much of you since Chicago.

174
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:01,714
How was it?

175
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,798
It was all right --

176
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,997
a bit complicated.

177
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,332
I left you a couple messages,

178
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:09,081
but when I didn't hear back,
I figured...

179
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,859
Yeah, I was just taking some time.

180
00:08:13,932 --> 00:08:16,147
But we should hang out...
the three of us.

181
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:17,533
I dunno, maybe this weekend?

182
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:21,730
I'm busy,
but you guys go ahead.

183
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:27,587
Right.

184
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,959
Uh...see you around.

185
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:33,468
You guys didn't work out
your stuff yet?

186
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,481
I'm just trying to figure out if I can
deal with someone like that

187
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,154
in my life right now.

188
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:40,233
Answer: no.

189
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,931
What you need in your life
right now is a good lawyer.

190
00:08:43,354 --> 00:08:44,395
Do you know a good lawyer?

191
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:47,744
I know a lawyer.

192
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:48,943
Right.

193
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:50,422
Got it, thanks.

194
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,863
So, it's called self-surrender.

195
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:55,610
At the negotiated time five days hence,

196
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:58,672
Wallace Fennel will turn himself in
to the Neptune sheriff's department,

197
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:01,520
who  will oversee his transfer
to the Chicago police.

198
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:03,032
What if I'm not there?

199
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,850
Then they'll issue a warrant.

200
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:07,126
You'll be arrested,
probably found guilty,

201
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:10,567
and end up "married" to some
enormous murderer named Tiny.

202
00:09:10,937 --> 00:09:12,698
My advice? Be punctual.

203
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,522
Or  prove your innocence.

204
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:16,769
Or that.
Suit yourself.

205
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:23,606
All right.
So that's good.

206
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:25,324
Good?

207
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:28,660
What... in the same way
that Rashard is cool?

208
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,991
Do you know what any words
actually mean?

209
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,707
I mean if I'm cleared
in the next five days,

210
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,748
I'm back on the team in time
for the Penn High game.

211
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:35,848
Penn High?

212
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:38,832
How can you even think
of the game right now?

213
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:40,659
Rival school,
biggest game of the year.

214
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,437
I can't help it.
I'm male.

215
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:45,725
Well here's a message
from the females: you're nuts.

216
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:50,840
So, let's see what's up for "bribe
Rashard into being a bruin" week.

217
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,907
You got his whole schedule.
How did you manage that?

218
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:54,463
Remember Tracy James?

219
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:55,947
You mean?

220
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:58,988
Yes,
those boobs named "Tracy James"

221
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:01,241
that went to Neptune and
are now a bruin cheerleader.

222
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:03,222
She says our best
bet is the booster dinner.

223
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:04,146
Booster dinner?

224
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,064
Can we get in?

225
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,286
No.

226
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:11,463
But she says it's not uncommon
to find certain slightly skanky girls

227
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:14,745
lurking outside in hopes
of meeting the big recruit,

228
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:17,067
and given that these
recruits are teen males,

229
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:18,121
often succeeding.

230
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,047
That happens.

231
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,903
So you think when I apply to coll...

232
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:21,705
No.

233
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,068
But it does seem like our best
bet to get you to see Rashard.

234
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:27,181
Veronica?

235
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:27,997
What?

236
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:31,792
You got my future in your hands.
Don't drop it.

237
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:36,592
I believe the correct response is,

238
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:38,673
"How can I be of service, Sir?"

239
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:41,481
Can you dig up the Murray file?

240
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:43,225
I guess now we need to destroy it.

241
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:45,373
What? They reconciled?

242
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,529
How?

243
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,060
Mystery of love would be my guess.

244
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:55,466
A million-dollar "sorry I banged
the maid" ring would be mine.

245
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:17,196
What? What, no, I don't want to see
the one where you can see his...

246
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:18,930
Take a look in the top right corner.

247
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:24,998
It's Terrence Cook and...

248
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:27,488
Miss Dumass,
the journalism teacher.

249
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,837
Who died in the bus crash.

250
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,549
When you met Terrence
the day the bus crashed.

251
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:33,264
What was he like?

252
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:35,486
Um, nice.

253
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:37,598
He signed stuff for people.

254
00:11:37,648 --> 00:11:39,370
The usual sports-star thing.

255
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:43,002
He also has some gambling issues.

256
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:46,509
Gambling issues like lost
50 bucks at the dog track?

257
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:50,480
Like owes millions to scary men.

258
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:54,606
And you know this how?

259
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:58,051
I don't know if this
will help the whole

260
00:11:58,104 --> 00:12:01,436
you-trusting-me thing
or ruin it even worse,

261
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:05,235
but during the election,

262
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:10,182
I did a thing you won't approve of
and now I have a tape you should hear.

263
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,056
Drugs,  murder, frame-ups,
st. Mary's church.

264
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:16,392
God, why didn't we think
of that sooner?

265
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:19,486
Seriously, man,
this has got to be it.

266
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:21,180
You're convinced of this why?

267
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,155
You met the Fitzpatrick family?

268
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:26,052
I found them scrappy but lovable.

269
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:28,530
So, out of 13 brothers and cousins,

270
00:12:28,593 --> 00:12:30,226
you got 12 hoods and a priest...

271
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,415
Fr. Patrick.

272
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,219
So, I was thinking...

273
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:33,920
Oh, damn.

274
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:40,587
What? You were thinking?
You want me to alert the media?

275
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:42,189
This concerns you, too,
jailbird.

276
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:44,634
You think I like sneaking over
here like this? Focus, man.

277
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:45,954
Okay, man, I'm focused.

278
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:48,199
Go ahead, think.

279
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:51,423
Okay, we got a Fitzpatrick
priest running the show

280
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:53,361
at a church where all
the P.C.H.ers go, right?

281
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:55,323
That's decent thinking for a novice,

282
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:58,897
but aren't priests supposed
to be good and stuff?

283
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:00,408
Before he took his orders,

284
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,356
Patrick Fitzpatrick was up to
his eyeballs in the family business.

285
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:06,691
He even did six months for assault
for beating up some stool pigeon.

286
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:07,948
Yeah, but in church?

287
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:11,993
Where are you gonna pass
packages of drugs and money?

288
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:13,547
You ever been to a catholic church?

289
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,527
So, Rashard,

290
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:32,641
any more questions
we can answer about the school?

291
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:37,273
Well, uh,
one question I had was,

292
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:38,828
you know, I mean,

293
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:40,286
hey, where's the party?

294
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:44,217
We figured wherever you were going.

295
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:45,348
Oh.

296
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:51,795
I was actually just going to my limo.

297
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:53,868
You know y'all is welcome
to come along.

298
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:56,723
Oh, gosh.

299
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:14,314
Okay, so, we're headed
to the Forum Suites hotel.

300
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,938
<i>This is how I roll!</i>

301
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:19,710
Yeah?

302
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:22,510
We're on our way and
everything is going perfect.

303
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:23,979
We'll see you there?

304
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,713
I'm moving.

305
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:26,165
Super. Bye, then.

306
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:37,578
Actually, we're in a hurry, so...

307
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,680
Hi.

308
00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:41,601
Hi, yourself. And bye.

309
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:42,496
Get out.

310
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,377
Whoa, hang on.

311
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,673
You don't say anything.

312
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:53,993
Forum Suites hotel.

313
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:56,845
What the hell are you doing?

314
00:14:57,617 --> 00:14:58,426
Nothing, man.

315
00:14:58,722 --> 00:15:00,678
They just a couple
nice girls who wanted...

316
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:01,484
First of all,

317
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:03,464
I ain't "man." I'm your family,

318
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,638
your management, and your brains,

319
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,183
so don't be cute with me.

320
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,203
Second,
those aren't girls.

321
00:15:09,271 --> 00:15:13,250
Those are leeches looking for a
big bag of money to latch onto.

322
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:14,146
Man, it ain't...

323
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:17,479
Uncle, it ain't like that.

324
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:19,343
<i>This is wallace.
Leave a message.</i>

325
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:23,008
Hi. We might need to make
a slight change of plan.

326
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:25,363
Give me a call the instant
you get this message.

327
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:28,101
I've been there.

328
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:29,585
I've seen this happen.

329
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:34,515
Some smiley thing filling out
a pair of jeans real nice shows up.

330
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,645
One wrong move and a lawsuit later...

331
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:39,860
There goes your shoe deal.

332
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:41,813
There goes 10 million bucks.

333
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:44,171
Just down in the garage.

334
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:50,945
I'm not saying don't enjoy
the fruits of your success.

335
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:52,742
You deserve the best.

336
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:54,999
Just don't be dumb.

337
00:15:58,924 --> 00:15:59,825
Right  between there.

338
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:02,692
Can I still go to the
Alpha Rho Nu thing thursday?

339
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,147
Yeah.

340
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:06,103
Just remember
you think with your brains,

341
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:08,883
not with this.

342
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:11,973
Damn, uncle!

343
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:17,466
Just forward a little more.

344
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:19,777
Ma'am, the passengers
won't be able to open their doors.

345
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:21,286
Rashard.

346
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:23,624
I tried to call you,
but your phone doesn't work down here.

347
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:24,547
What's going on?

348
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,420
Well, a funny thing happened
on the way to the Forum Suites.

349
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:30,156
Rashard.

350
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:32,635
No. Now, what the hell
is going on here?

351
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:36,642
I told you once. Now I'm telling
you with more force.

352
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:38,871
Do not mess with my boy.

353
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:42,167
I got that reporter on speed dial.

354
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,336
I'm glad to call him again.

355
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,014
Ma'am, do you want me to pull back,
so that the door is clear?

356
00:16:49,116 --> 00:16:50,196
Actually,
that's okay.

357
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:53,278
What I want is your name
and license number.

358
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,273
I'm sorry?

359
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:55,777
You're sorry?

360
00:16:55,778 --> 00:16:57,690
Well, you ain't the one
being kidnapped, Jack.

361
00:16:58,033 --> 00:16:59,822
Kidnapped?
You're not with them?

362
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,134
Hell no.

363
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,143
Are you gonna get us out of here

364
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:05,518
or do you want me to dig up
the chief of police's number,

365
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,003
which I got in here, too?

366
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:08,557
He's a big basketball fan.

367
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,273
Well,
it almost worked.

368
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,293
Any other ideas?

369
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:21,929
Yeah, a cheeseburger.

370
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,965
I'm late for my shift and
there's a drive-through on the way.

371
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:28,125
Oh, man,
the drive-through.

372
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,849
Right,
it's that thing they have

373
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,109
where we don't even have to leave
the soothing comfort of our cars.

374
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,440
The night of the accident,
like five minutes before,

375
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,298
we hit White Castle...
the drive-through.

376
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:42,981
Don't you see?

377
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:45,177
There's a witness right there !
The drive-through guy.

378
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:47,410
He saw Rashard at the wheel.

379
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:48,616
He got his autograph.

380
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:50,358
I mean, hell,

381
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,339
there might even be security
tape of Rashard driving.

382
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:54,159
We find that drive-through guy,

383
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:55,367
I got a witness.

384
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,850
What about my cheeseburger?

385
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:58,026
Rain check.

386
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:00,394
I'm heading back.

387
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,888
Get Nathan to find that drive-through
guy. Get us both off the hook.

388
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:06,461
<i>[Air Supply - "All Out of Love"]
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?</i>

389
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:09,509
<i>I can't be too late,
to say that I was wrong</i>

390
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,509
Great.
So I'm late. It's super busy.

391
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:12,426
I missed dinner,

392
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:14,961
and it's "make the karaoke
machine want to kill itself" night.

393
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:18,762
And, also, it seems,
"Veronica, I need a favor" night.

394
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:19,517
Excuse me?

395
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:21,162
Can I get some h--

396
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:24,789
Wow, so who you got to know
to get some help around here?

397
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:26,450
Veronica Mars, apparently.

398
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:27,409
Thanks, lars.

399
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:28,804
That was lars, everyone.

400
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:30,681
Next up -- Britt.

401
00:18:30,882 --> 00:18:32,621
Hey, thanks, Veronica.

402
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,866
Make it B17

403
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:46,873

little head of yours?</i>

405
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,278
<i>What goes on in that place in the dark?</i>

406
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,259
<i>Well I used to know
a girl and I would have sworn</i>

407
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:59,697
<i>that her name was Veronica</i>

408
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:03,660
<i>Well she used to have
a carefree mind of her own</i>

409
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:06,403
<i>And a delicate look in her eye</i>

410
00:19:07,158 --> 00:19:09,922
<i>These days I'm afraid
she's not even sure </i>

411
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,201
<i>if her name is Veronica</i>

412
00:19:12,332 --> 00:19:13,931
And how could I help you, sir?

413
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,863
I need a favor.

414
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:19,134
Ah, a favor...
one of our specialties.

415
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,247
I need you to bug the confessional
at st. Mary's church.

416
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:25,701
Um...I'm sorry,

417
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:27,153
that's not on our menu.

418
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:29,339
Maybe you should try
"You're Crazy" down the street.

419
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:31,238
It's not just for him.

420
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:36,687
Isn't this a very odd coincidence?

421
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:40,103
Or, wait... are you guys, like,

422
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:43,365
roomies now and he ate your peanut
butter and now you're not speaking?

423
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:46,246
Funny you should bring up
roomies, as I just lost one.

424
00:19:47,248 --> 00:19:49,579
I don't suppose you can help me
find where Duncan disappeared.

425
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,532
Ooh, sorry.
One favor per customer.

426
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:55,006
Uh, yeah,
can we stay focused here?

427
00:19:55,072 --> 00:19:57,219
'Cause if we're seen together
by the wrong people,

428
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:58,126
that would be bad.

429
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,486
So this is sneaking.

430
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:06,087
I've got a pantomime-horse
disguise you could use.

431
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:09,032
Do either of you have any
experience being a horse's ass?

432
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:11,170
I'm glad my misfortunes amuse you.

433
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,519
Look, that church is the only place

434
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:15,818
the Fitzpatricks and
the P.C.H.ers hang together.

435
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:17,483
And the priest is a Fitzpatrick.

436
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:20,322
It must be where they're
getting the drugs to the P.C.H.ers.

437
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:22,005
He's probably the one who killed Felix.

438
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:25,619
Look, Veronica,

439
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,649
can you just once save
my ass without comment?

440
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:31,114
<i>...steal her clothes</i>

441
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:32,331
<i>Veronica</i>

442
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,521
<i>Veronica</i>

443
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,019
No.

444
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:43,910
Because saving your ass with comment,
it just --

445
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:45,558
it works better for me.

446
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:47,737
I will not bug a confessional.

447
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:49,080
Video -- maybe.

448
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:50,055
But no sound.

449
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:51,577
<i>What did you mean by,</i>

450
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:52,514
<i>"it smelled"?</i>

451
00:20:53,202 --> 00:20:56,431
<i>Dude, it smelled like
the ass of something that died.</i>

452
00:20:57,554 --> 00:20:58,448
And you can't say what it was?

453
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,785
I'm not like
a professional smellologist.

454
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,963
It stank,

455
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:03,513
so I got a limo.

456
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:05,592
You ever heard of the name David Moran,

457
00:21:05,842 --> 00:21:06,956
sometimes known as "Curly"?

458
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:08,393
Curly? Sure.

459
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,240
He worked on my dad's aston martin.

460
00:21:10,298 --> 00:21:11,367
That guy's a trip.

461
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:13,494
<i>Were you aware of a bad smell?</i>

462
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:16,504
<i>Yeah, it was really bad.</i>

463
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:18,639
And then Dickie said
that we should get a limo,

464
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:19,741
and I think that was, like,

465
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,963
his first good idea ever, so...

466
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,089
The name Curly mean anything to you?

467
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:25,347
Curly? The mechanic?

468
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:28,084
Yeah, I met him,
you know?

469
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:30,315
But my dad,
he went to the shop.

470
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:31,791
He usually just took my brother --

471
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,794
cars being,
you know, man stuff.

472
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,066
Hey, honey, how was work?

473
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:41,332
Interesting.

474
00:21:41,971 --> 00:21:43,056
And how was your day?

475
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:44,779
Also interesting.

476
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,082
I had a thought about the rat.

477
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:50,335
That you could make his lips
and feet into hot dogs?

478
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:51,947
I think somebody beat you to that one.

479
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,540
You thought it was a sign,

480
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:55,941
a message to you: "you're a rat."

481
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:59,145
What if we were just being too...

482
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:00,630
fancy and sophisticated?

483
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:03,049
That'd be a first.

484
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,381
I mean too symbolic.

485
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:07,722
What does a dead rat do?

486
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,433
Besides smell?

487
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,164
A dead rat's only talent.

488
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,030
It smells bad enough

489
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:17,102
to drive anyone who could
afford another ride off the bus.

490
00:22:18,178 --> 00:22:20,263
I'm just saying keep in mind, honey,

491
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,687
you're not the only possible
reason that bus crashed.

492
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:29,153
It always was a weird coincidence.

493
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:31,661
The rich kids lived.
The poor kids died.

494
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:34,164
But why would someone
want to kill the poor kids?

495
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:36,037
Despite dad's best efforts,

496
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:38,769
I still feel like I'm the only
target that makes sense.

497
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:45,369
So?
The drive-through guy?

498
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:46,245
Guy.

499
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:49,259
Guy Abrutti.
That's his name.

500
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,342
Nathan tracked him...
26, caucasian,

501
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:52,964
worked at White Castle for a year.

502
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,049
That's great,
right?

503
00:22:55,894 --> 00:22:57,008
Why aren't you smiling?

504
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,822
Guy Abrutti hasn't come into
work for the last three days.

505
00:23:00,189 --> 00:23:01,213
Nobody's seen him since.

506
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,364
Surveillance video is gone,
and Guy's gone.

507
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:05,142
Uncle Rucker got to him.

508
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:07,288
Probably bought him off
just like the other guys.

509
00:23:09,184 --> 00:23:10,311
Got any other ideas?

510
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:23,801
Cconfession at st. Mary's
is 4:00 to 6:00,

511
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,766
tuesdays and wednesdays,

512
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:26,636
with bugging hours just preceding.

513
00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:28,735
Do I feel guilty? Yes.

514
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:31,380
Fortunately, that's what
this place was made for.

515
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:36,695
At least Weevil was right
about one thing.

516
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:41,143
Fr. Patrick Fitzpatrick does look
rather unecclesiastical.

517
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:44,740
Definitely the priest I want
on my side in a team knife fight.

518
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:09,233
I'm really sorry about this.

519
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:24,288
I'm going to hell.

520
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:26,087
It's that simple.

521
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:28,313
I am going straight to hell.

522
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:30,888
Confession hasn't quite started yet,

523
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:32,432
but what makes you say that?

524
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:35,965
Um...well,

525
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:40,646
I've done some things
that probably aren't quite,

526
00:24:41,182 --> 00:24:41,796
you know,

527
00:24:43,007 --> 00:24:44,007
on the up-and-up,

528
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:45,837
god-wise.

529
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:48,916
I see. Is there an example of this?

530
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:51,993
Sometimes, when I know someone is bad,

531
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:54,893
I do improper things.

532
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,339
Like what?

533
00:24:57,883 --> 00:24:58,982
Like...

534
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:03,529
trying to prove to the world that
they're bad and get them punished.

535
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:07,344
Yes, I know the feeling,
actually.

536
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,596
You do?

537
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,683
I wasn't always...

538
00:25:10,432 --> 00:25:12,970
on the up-and-up god-wise myself,

539
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:14,607
but I worked at it.

540
00:25:15,696 --> 00:25:19,376
There's a passage --
Romans 12:19.

541
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,794
"Vengeance is mine.

542
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:24,725
I will repay, sayeth the lord."

543
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:26,399
Yeah, I see now.

544
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,974
I guess I should just probably be
a better person. Thanks.

545
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:34,278
"Therefore if thine enemy
hunger, feed him."

546
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:36,172
If he thirst,

547
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:37,484
give him drink.

548
00:25:37,717 --> 00:25:39,274
"Be not overcome of evil,

549
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,472
but overcome evil with good."

550
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,809
That might be something
for you to think about.

551
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:16,484
Man, I practically peed
myself waiting on you.

552
00:26:16,537 --> 00:26:17,190
Where have you been?

553
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,245
Nowhere. But if god asks,
I was with you.

554
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:22,841
Are you sure Rashard is gonna be here?

555
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:24,493
I heard him talking in the limo.

556
00:26:24,937 --> 00:26:27,800
This frat party thing was at
the top of his to-do list.

557
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,459
All we've got to do is blend in,

558
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:31,083
ease through the door,

559
00:26:31,162 --> 00:26:32,340
and get you a moment alone with him.

560
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:33,350
So just hold it in.

561
00:26:34,534 --> 00:26:36,189
What fraternity did you say this was?

562
00:26:36,526 --> 00:26:37,876
Alpha Rho something.

563
00:26:38,427 --> 00:26:39,456
Alpha Rho Nu?

564
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:40,984
A black fraternity?

565
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:46,827
Part of us isn't blending in.

566
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,614
I'll just...
I'll be in the car, okay?

567
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:54,044
<i>[Namie Amuro - "Shine More!"]
English version, written by Sandra Pires</i>

568
00:27:08,406 --> 00:27:08,964
Rashard.

569
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:09,603
Rashard.

570
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:11,994
Can I talk to you?

571
00:27:14,053 --> 00:27:15,468
Yo, excuse me a sec, man.

572
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,383
Let's go.

573
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,247
What are you doing here, man?

574
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,602
You know what I'm doing here.

575
00:27:21,797 --> 00:27:23,927
Look, I'm just as freaked out
about what happened as you,

576
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,544
but there was a right thing
to do and a wrong thing to do.

577
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,300
And we picked wrong.

578
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:30,262
It was an accident, man.
End of story.

579
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:31,062
End of story?

580
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,652
Your uncle is about
to have me thrown in jail, man.

581
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,606
Yeah,
it was an accident,

582
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:38,189
but the truth is the truth
and you can't just walk away from that.

583
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:40,592
I'm telling you this
as your friend, Rashard.

584
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,662
I mean, we were friends,
right?

585
00:27:42,981 --> 00:27:43,754
Yeah.

586
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:45,673
I mean,
that's what I thought.

587
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,297
Right,
so can't we fig...

588
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:49,499
but then you got to try
to rat me out like that?

589
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:52,736
- Man, I don't even know...
- What? Rashard, it's not like that.

590
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,247
No? Okay, then what is it like, huh?

591
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:57,547
You know how hard I worked for this.

592
00:27:58,094 --> 00:27:59,361
You know how much I got on the line?

593
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:02,075
$50 million over the first 5 years,
if I read it right.

594
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,546
But I came to talk to you, man,
not your uncle.

595
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:06,013
Man, this is me, man!

596
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:10,087
Yo, and if you want
to mess with me, bring it on.

597
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:13,876
'Cause I'll hit you back
50 million times harder.

598
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:16,382
Why don't you just go home, man?

599
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:17,867
Get out of my life.

600
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:34,118
Wallace?

601
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:35,023
What are you doing here?

602
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:37,061
I'm at a party.
What does it look like?

603
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:38,933
What's wrong?

604
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,346
Stay away from this guy, seriously.

605
00:28:40,964 --> 00:28:41,628
What?

606
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:43,717
Yo, you know this guy?

607
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:44,679
Yeah, she knows me.

608
00:28:44,763 --> 00:28:46,557
She knows me well enough
to take my word and go.

609
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:49,696
God, Wallace, when did who I talk to
at a party become your business?

610
00:28:50,174 --> 00:28:51,578
Come on.
Jackie, let's just go.

611
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,648
So what? You own me?

612
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,712
It would've been nice if you returned
one of my phone calls

613
00:28:55,764 --> 00:28:56,784
when you were
in chicago,

614
00:28:57,122 --> 00:28:58,841
filled me in on this new development.

615
00:28:58,842 --> 00:29:01,613
Hey, Jackie,
is this guy bothering you?

616
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:03,520
Yes,
he's starting to.

617
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:05,664
Okay. Hey.

618
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,342
Hey, we got a party foul over here.

619
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:13,102
This little man here is messing
with my special lady friend.

620
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:15,681
Hey, man.
Watch out!

621
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:17,950
Hey, come on, man.
You don't even...

622
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,425
Now, how about
we enjoy this party, huh?

623
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:25,189
This party is kind of over for me.
You know what?

624
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,350
I do know a really
good club in hollywood.

625
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:31,444
We could have a really good time.

626
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:34,568
Yeah, well, my uncle told me

627
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:36,387
I got to stick around here
for awhile, and just...

628
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:39,933
Oh, is he here?
Maybe I can ask for his permission.

629
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:40,674
Okay.

630
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:49,881
You know what?
I call my own shots.

631
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:51,519
Let's go.

632
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:29,778
What the hell are you doing here?

633
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:30,932
Man, I came to talk to your nephew.

634
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:33,934
Look. He's a good boy
with a lot on his mind,

635
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,696
and he doesn't need a little rat

636
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:37,835
like you messing with his head.

637
00:30:38,495 --> 00:30:40,869
You want to talk to someone,
you talk to me.

638
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,360
Better yet,
you just keep your mouth shut.

639
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,071
You see what happens when you open it.

640
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:48,606
Now, where is he?

641
00:30:48,817 --> 00:30:50,946
Well, apparently,
he left with my ex-girlfriend.

642
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,345
But you're right, uncle Monte,
he is a good boy.

643
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:56,304
Where is she taking him?

644
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,405
You know,
this might actually be fun.

645
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:01,151
I know where she likes to go.

646
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,799
Place all metal objects here.

647
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:43,672
Have a good time.

648
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:50,465
Great.

649
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:52,625
Thanks, deputy.

650
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:53,470
No problem.

651
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:55,173
Are you sure you don't
want to stay awhile,

652
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:56,220
get a little crazy?

653
00:31:56,473 --> 00:31:57,476
Sorry.

654
00:31:57,676 --> 00:31:59,062
I have to get to church.

655
00:32:13,337 --> 00:32:15,033
It's always an uncomfortable moment,

656
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:17,942
seeing the facade come off
a supposedly good person.

657
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,608
For instance, seeing the priest
who quoted you Romans 12:19

658
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:25,410
in a rather pleasant voice distributing
drugs to his crime lord brother

659
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:26,364
through the confessional.

660
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:30,631
Wait...
where's the distributing?

661
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:32,933
There's supposed to be distributing.

662
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:39,149
First you make me come in early,

663
00:32:39,222 --> 00:32:41,296
which is something I never do,
and then you're late.

664
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:44,092
Fortunately,
I found this video online.

665
00:32:44,093 --> 00:32:46,323
This guy gets his whole head
stuck up an elephant's...

666
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:47,814
Fascinating,
I'm sure,

667
00:32:48,153 --> 00:32:49,819
but I think you'd rather see this.

668
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:54,573
So, father Patrick...
Scary-looking? Yes.

669
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:56,676
Evil? No.

670
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,929
Brother Liam,
on the other hand...

671
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:01,035
I had to watch it twice
to get how they worked it

672
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:02,578
but keep your eye on Liam's hymnal.

673
00:33:05,637 --> 00:33:07,891
So, the Lord giveth...

674
00:33:11,998 --> 00:33:14,163
and the stooge taketh away.

675
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,619
Thumper.

676
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:26,729
Why don't you call for pizza?

677
00:33:29,202 --> 00:33:29,830
Is this...?

678
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:31,564
Uncle monte rucker's super phone

679
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:34,525
in which his entire universe of
information is stored?

680
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:35,644
Yes.

681
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,823
If he's paying off Guy Abrutti,

682
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,372
there's got to be
a number in there somewhere.

683
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,361
The call log goes back four days.

684
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:44,458
Just e-mail all the numbers to your dad
and let the police work ensue.

685
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:47,436
Damn.
Up high, V. Mars.

686
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:49,592
Hey.

687
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:53,298
What?

688
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:56,623
Don't I get some?

689
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:03,934
How'd I do?

690
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,636
From what I heard,

691
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,320
ice bitch.

692
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:08,702
Oh, yeah, she was good.

693
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:10,071
Poor Rashard.

694
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:11,335
The kid never had a chance.

695
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:14,759
It's a dubious talent, but snagging
guys has always been a breeze.

696
00:34:15,793 --> 00:34:17,746
It's holding onto
the good ones that's tricky.

697
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,896
So, what do you think, Wallace?
Are you maybe free this weekend?

698
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,096
Hey, Wallace.

699
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:27,889
Are we still on for
tomorrow after the game?

700
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,316
Oh, yes, ma'am.

701
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:40,686
If I could control him,
I would.

702
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,041
Weevil,
what's up, man?

703
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:03,995
Here's what's up.

704
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:06,882
There's a traitor amongst us,

705
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:10,877
someone who signed up
with the Fitzpatricks

706
00:35:11,164 --> 00:35:13,039
to deal drugs and break the rules.

707
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:16,126
And I don't like it
when people break the rules.

708
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:18,682
Do I, Thumper?

709
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:21,678
You got anything to say?

710
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,799
Yeah... so what?

711
00:35:25,848 --> 00:35:29,084
So what if we want to make some money
selling dope to rich white boys?

712
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:30,640
Is that such a bad thing?

713
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,512
I don't think so.

714
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:34,912
What do you mean, "we"?

715
00:35:35,595 --> 00:35:37,026
Do you got a mouse in your pocket?

716
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:39,070
I mean "we," like the rest of us.

717
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:46,832
Right.

718
00:35:48,636 --> 00:35:52,202
The Fitzpatricks made
Felix's brother disappear!

719
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,500
The Reaper, your own leader!

720
00:35:55,548 --> 00:35:57,426
And now you want to go work for them?!

721
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:00,592
Let me make sure I got this straight.

722
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,332
Working with our enemies.

723
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,447
You've got a problem with that?

724
00:36:03,498 --> 00:36:04,505
You bet I do.

725
00:36:04,547 --> 00:36:06,332
Then you can tell us
what you were doing

726
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:08,807
meeting at the Neptune Grand with
Logan Echolls!

727
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,631
And you were gonna bust me up
for selling to an 09er last week.

728
00:36:14,118 --> 00:36:15,954
Hector's cousin works
maintenance there.

729
00:36:17,245 --> 00:36:18,140
He saw you.

730
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:21,374
all buddy-buddy with
the piece of trash who killed Felix.

731
00:36:22,278 --> 00:36:23,490
You're right,
there's rules,

732
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:25,358
like not selling out your brothers.

733
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,770
I'm not like you,
Weevil.

734
00:36:28,036 --> 00:36:29,262
I don't make good speeches,

735
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,880
so I'm just gonna say, "adios."

736
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:34,186
I hope that covers it.

737
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:36,882
Hey, hold on, man.

738
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:47,078
That's enough.
Let's get out of here.

739
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:07,860
Take Weevil's bike,
drive it into the ocean.

740
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:09,779
I'll pick you up and bring you back.

741
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:23,975
You lied all along,
didn't you?

742
00:37:24,672 --> 00:37:26,636
That night on the bridge,
you were there.

743
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,779
You killed felix,
didn't you?!

744
00:37:29,644 --> 00:37:31,818
That's an interesting theory,
Eli.

745
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,442
But before you think
about spreading it around,

746
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,745
I think you should see something.

747
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:39,326
Remember this?

748
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:44,034
That night you nearly
kicked Curly's head in?

749
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:46,257
So I'd keep my mouth shut...

750
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:48,726
'cause you probably don't want
this getting around to, say...

751
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:49,891
... the cops, do you?

752
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:52,328
I didn't think so.

753
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,329
<i>[House of Pain - "Jump Around"]
Jump around!</i>

754
00:38:02,544 --> 00:38:03,550
<i>Jump around!</i>

755
00:38:04,527 --> 00:38:06,745
<i>Jump up, jump up,
and get down!</i>

756
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:10,995
<i>Jump, jump, jump!
Everybody, jump, jump!</i>

757
00:38:11,566 --> 00:38:12,432
Come on, ladies,

758
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:14,058
don't be shy.

759
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:17,065
You want more champagne?

760
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:19,716
I'm on it... room service,
whatever you want.

761
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:20,994
Chicken fingers,

762
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:22,725
cake, fine cheeses.

763
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:23,936
Just name it,

764
00:38:23,962 --> 00:38:26,529
'cause you are very special ladies...

765
00:38:26,886 --> 00:38:28,738
and I'm on someone else's tab.

766
00:38:29,832 --> 00:38:31,320
See?! Pow!

767
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,426
I think it, it happens.

768
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,078
Greetings, kind sir.

769
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:40,134
Guy Abrutti?

770
00:38:40,582 --> 00:38:41,735
I need to know some things.

771
00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:45,210
Oh, did you get
this money from Monte Rucker?

772
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:46,805
Did you, uh...

773
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:49,957
take it in exchange
for your silence as a witness?

774
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:52,643
Do you remember Rashard Rucker

775
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:55,888
at the wheel of a red hummer
on the night of december 14th?

776
00:38:58,011 --> 00:39:01,083
<i>[Spoon - "I Summon You"]</i>

777
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:07,943
<i>Remember the weight of the world</i>

778
00:39:08,033 --> 00:39:10,498
<i>It's a sound that we used to buy</i>

779
00:39:12,496 --> 00:39:14,849
<i>On cassette and 45</i>

780
00:39:17,048 --> 00:39:18,458
<i>And now this little girl</i>

781
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:21,069
Open your mouth and you're
losing every one of those teeth.

782
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:30,230
You got time, don't worry.

783
00:39:30,422 --> 00:39:32,182
Hey, you made it.

784
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:35,006
You know, I read that article
in "Scientific American"

785
00:39:35,057 --> 00:39:36,920
about the pep-rally
effect and I thought,

786
00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:38,118
"hey, if it's science..."

787
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,557
Hey, I told you
everything would be good.

788
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:46,136
Hey there, Monte.

789
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,235
Yeah, I don't know
how I got this thing.

790
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,769
I just came across it.

791
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,861
Yeah, sorry to hear about
your legal troubles,

792
00:39:53,862 --> 00:39:56,283
but that can happen
when you open your mouth.

793
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,201
My advice? Keep it shut,
uncle Rucker.

794
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,606
Now, if you'll excuse me,

795
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,099
I've got me a pep rally.

796
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:06,367
Now, that was good.

797
00:40:06,419 --> 00:40:07,213
Yeah.

798
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,005
<i>Have you ever heard the name Curly
Moran who worked at Symbolic Motors?</i>

799
00:40:11,054 --> 00:40:12,539
My dad went there.

800
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:15,591
That guy Curly was the only guy around
who knew how to fix my Fiat.

801
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,325
And were you aware of
anything strange about the bus?

802
00:40:18,437 --> 00:40:21,425
Other than it smelled like
something gross and dead?

803
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:23,994
That's why you didn't take
the bus home? the smell?

804
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,825
Actually,
my dad told me not to.

805
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:30,355
I mean, he must've been totally
psychic because he was like,

806
00:40:30,356 --> 00:40:31,918
<i>"don't get on the bus."</i>

807
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:33,907
<i>And then those guys got a limo, so...</i>

808
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,438
I didn't see you come in.

809
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:39,583
Didn't I tell you to turn off the TV
if you're not watching it?

810
00:40:39,723 --> 00:40:42,439
I get lonely when you're out
with all your fancy friends

811
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,202
and I'm here by myself with nothing.

812
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:46,401
Did we win?

813
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:52,026
Yes, thanks to Wallace Fennel's
18 points and 10 rebounds.
