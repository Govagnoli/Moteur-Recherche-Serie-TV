1
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:13,283
What does the omnibus crime control

2
00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:14,900
And safe streets act make illegal?

3
00:00:14,935 --> 00:00:19,538
Electronic surveillance without
judicial authorization.

4
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:21,512
What was that?

5
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:23,993
I'm taking my p. I. Exam tomorrow.

6
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:25,710
He's ensuring his legacy.

7
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:27,897
He's nervous for you. That's sweet.

8
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:30,049
He should be nervous for himself.

9
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:31,680
I'm gonna beat his score.

10
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:35,159
Then I'm gonna dine on that
shared knowledge for a lifetime.

11
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:38,858
A passive infrared detector
would not be the best choice

12
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:40,920
Under which of the following conditions

13
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:42,788
A, overhead doors,

14
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:45,673
B, significant changes in temperature, c...

15
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,523
B. Why don't you bug Piz for a while?

16
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,234
So, Piz, what are you studying?

17
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:54,041
Apollo...

18
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:55,140
Bukenya.

19
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:57,351
Yeah, he actually goes to Hearst,
and he wrote this,

20
00:00:57,386 --> 00:01:00,783
uh, memoir, I guess you'd call it.

21
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:02,882
What could a college kid possibly have

22
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,248
To put in a memoir?

23
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:06,886
surviving spring break on 10 bucks a day?

24
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,193
He was a child soldier in Uganda.

25
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:10,815
He never knew his father.

26
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,853
The rebel army put a gun in his
hand when he was 6 years old.

27
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:15,063
Oh.

28
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:17,205
Somehow he managed to escape as a teenager

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,621
And get to the states.

30
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:20,881
I'm interviewing him on my radio show
tomorrow, and I'm just prepping.

31
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,107
The book's already been optioned as a movie

32
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:24,428
Middle six figures.

33
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:26,467
Plus, he's been booked on Oprah,

34
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:28,247
But Piz got him first.

35
00:01:31,148 --> 00:01:32,376
What?

36
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,182
It's just so refreshing to hear

37
00:01:34,217 --> 00:01:37,520
One of your gentleman callers
have more to talk about

38
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,778
Than how high the waves are breaking.

39
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:43,321
Hello, hello?

40
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:45,293
Uh oh.

41
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:47,195
What?

42
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,808
Dad likes you? Kiss of death?

43
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:53,014
What was the address?

44
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:54,859
Two of them?

45
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:57,397
We've just had our seventh home burglary

46
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:59,438
In the past 13 days.

47
00:01:59,473 --> 00:02:00,996
Seventh.

48
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:04,247
That's what the papers begin
referring to as a crime wave.

49
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:05,513
In six of the seven,

50
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:08,544
The burglars have also stolen
cars from the residences.

51
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:12,366
All the burglaries occurred
in our favorite zip code.

52
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:16,154
As you know, the residents...
are an impatient lot.

53
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:17,784
Now, the one car we recovered

54
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,521
Had switched plates with a car
in a supermarket parking lot.

55
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:24,331
Jerry will hand out printouts
detailing the hot spots.

56
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:27,088
Stolen goods might start popping up soon.

57
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,131
Kitsitz, horowitz,

58
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,219
Drop in on the pawnshops
and all known fences.

59
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:57,099
The job fair has everyone here

60
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,523
In a feeding frenzy.

61
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:01,027
Real jobs for overachieving seniors

62
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:04,009
And volunteer work for
everyone looking to fill a résumé.

63
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:05,974
Me, the job I'm waiting on,

64
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:11,012
I would have been better off
buying a lottery ticket.

65
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:13,060
Not long after I escaped,

66
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:15,039
I was at an evac hospital,

67
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:19,223
And a very kindhearted nurse
was trying to comfort me,

68
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:21,920
Telling me that what I did was not my fault

69
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:24,548
Because I was just a child.

70
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,116
What I have to live with today
is the knowledge that,

71
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:29,794
When my abductors coaxed

72
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:33,838
Or rather, brainwashed me into
an instrument of violence,

73
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:37,439
I was left with not just the ability,

74
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:39,903
But the appetite to kill.

75
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:43,550
My guest is Apollo Bukenya,

76
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:45,510
A Hearst student

77
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:48,678
Who miraculously escaped the LRA in Uganda.

78
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:51,811
Apollo, you dedicate "Soldier of misfortune"

79
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:54,326
To your adviser here at Hearst,

80
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:56,356
Professor Lisa Tonin, who is here with us.

81
00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:58,477
I owe her a great deal of gratitude.

82
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:00,529
There would be no book without her.

83
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:03,362
I understand she knew you
before you came to Hearst.

84
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:04,681
She did.

85
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:08,628
She actually read a short story
I wrote when I was 15

86
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:10,534
And called me.

87
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:13,134
She's been my friend and mentor ever since.

88
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,690
Professor Tonin?

89
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:16,345
Well, of course, I'm flattered,

90
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,079
But the truth is that Apollo has taught me

91
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:21,281
Much more than I have taught him.

92
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:22,749
Ahh.

93
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:26,676
You realize you're the radio host version

94
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:28,361
Of a rock star, right?

95
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:30,795
I don't know what the groupie procedure is

96
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,556
for this scenario,

97
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:35,094
But I might have to throw my panties at you.

98
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:36,920
Or I could autograph you.

99
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:40,070
I believe we have some
sharpies laying around.

100
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:43,426
So, I have news.

101
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:45,864
I got offered an internship
with Pitchfork Media.

102
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,035
It's pretty much the most highly regarded

103
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,171
Music review publication on the internet.

104
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,474
Piz, that's fantastic!

105
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:53,873
I'd work with the most important
critics in the business,

106
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,914
See bands when they're on
the verge of breaking,

107
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,916
Might even get to do a few reviews myself,

108
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:00,036
So I can really get my snob on.

109
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:02,477
Their offices are in New York,

110
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,999
Which could be cool, right?

111
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:07,430
Supercool, you lucky dog!

112
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:09,792
12 weeks in the big apple.

113
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:11,953
Everything's coming up Piznarski.

114
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:18,807
Sheriff?

115
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,739
Veronica's on the phone.

116
00:05:20,774 --> 00:05:22,706
Thanks.

117
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:24,423
Ninety-five.

118
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,131
You passed.

119
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,770
Yeah, I passed,

120
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:30,048
And I beat your score by 2 points.

121
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,321
But don't worry, dad.

122
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:34,286
I'll still lob in the token
call from time to time

123
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:37,217
Asking for advice, thereby
validating your existence.

124
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:38,359
Honey?

125
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:39,431
Yeah?

126
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:41,607
I made a ninety-seven.

127
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:48,228
It's beneath you to lie
to me in this, my finest hour.

128
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:49,372
Are you at your desk?

129
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:50,338
No.

130
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:52,353
Are you at my desk?

131
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:54,900
Yes.

132
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:56,557
Then this will be easy.

133
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:58,145
Pull out my middle drawer.

134
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,079
I had a feeling this moment would come.

135
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:02,582
You see it there?

136
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:04,654
Yep.

137
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,191
Sweetie, maybe you should go sit back down

138
00:06:07,226 --> 00:06:08,853
At the receptionist's desk.

139
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:11,310
Got to go. Duty calls.

140
00:06:14,294 --> 00:06:17,666
Mars Investigations.
Detective Mars speaking.

141
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:21,003
Yes, I believe I have discovered a son

142
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:22,317
I never knew I had.

143
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:25,855
Okay, and you'd like us
to track this boy down?

144
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,825
No, I know where he is.

145
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,941
I want proof he's, in fact, my son.

146
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,571
His name is Apollo, Apollo Bukenya.

147
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:38,786
Veronica Mars

148
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:41,787
3x18 - I Know What You'll Do Next Summer

149
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:45,488
Transcipt: vitac.com
Syncro: Camilla [VeronicaMars.it]

150
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,235
Vieni a trovarci!

151
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,824
veronicamars.it

152
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:12,353
There was no struggle,
no protest, no crying.

153
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:15,559
She just told me to go with the soldiers.

154
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:18,431
I can't imagine how afraid
for me she must have been.

155
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:21,884
I never saw my mother again.

156
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:27,072
So imagine what it'll mean
if I can reunite him

157
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:29,431
With the father he's never met.

158
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,648
What?

159
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,096
It's like the NBA.

160
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,053
Fatherless boy makes good,

161
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,941
The dough starts rolling in,

162
00:07:36,976 --> 00:07:39,397
And here comes long lost
daddy expecting a payday.

163
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:41,199
It's not the same thing.

164
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:42,851
The world is upside down.

165
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:45,045
Veronica Mars wants to believe in miracles,

166
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,202
And I'm the cynical one.

167
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:47,913
It's not like he can lie about it.

168
00:07:47,948 --> 00:07:49,554
There will be a paternity test.

169
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:53,052
So what are you gonna do?
Steal a dna sample from Apollo?

170
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,920
Kizza doesn't want me to steal anything.

171
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:57,397
He doesn't even want Apollo
told about the possibility

172
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,557
Until he's more certain
they're father and son.

173
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:01,498
So how are you supposed to prove it?

174
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:03,500
He e mailed me a pdf of a letter he has

175
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:05,432
From a woman he claims is Apollo's mother.

176
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:08,109
So if I can get a look at
anything Apollo might have

177
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:09,773
With his mom's handwriting

178
00:08:09,808 --> 00:08:11,225
Maybe you can make miracles happen.

179
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,973
So, how does it feel to be
a professional detective?

180
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:16,381
Great.

181
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,418
Know how much I'm making
on my first professional case?

182
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:20,675
Nada.

183
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,676
He's scraped just enough together

184
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,268
For a cheap plane ticket
if the news is good.

185
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:27,542
He had to e mail me
the letter from a kinko's.

186
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:29,781
I have to wait on his calls
from the pay phone

187
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:31,155
In his New York boardinghouse.

188
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,633
Yeah, that's not a guy looking for a payday.

189
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:35,701
Tell your roommate I came by

190
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:38,062
Hoping to kill time between classes,

191
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,840
Getting to second base,
then left unsatisfied.

192
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,863
He's a good guy, Veronica.

193
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,951
Try not to rip out his heart.

194
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,672
Tommy, I'm curious.

195
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:50,619
How is it that you found yourself

196
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,955
In possession of jewelry reported stolen

197
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,275
From two separate homes?

198
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:57,525
The owner of Brody's pawn

199
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,964
Said you were quite anxious
to unload said merchandise.

200
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,066
Don't answer that.

201
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:07,525
Can you tell me where you
were two nights ago

202
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,672
Between 9:00 and 11:00?

203
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:09,745
Don't answer that.

204
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:12,071
I was so fond of you when
I was a private detective.

205
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:13,209
Then I hope you'll understand

206
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,843
why you shouldn't expect my
vote in the upcoming election?

207
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:20,911
The break-ins were professional jobs

208
00:09:20,946 --> 00:09:23,550
Topflight security systems disabled.

209
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:25,811
Try not to be offended,
Tommy, when I suggest

210
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:28,038
That perhaps you are not
the leader of the crew.

211
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:30,076
You mind telling me who is?

212
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:34,804
Why don't you just put me back in my cell,

213
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,605
Let me know when the
bail Bondsman gets here?

214
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:41,606
Anxious to get back to
the River Styx, Tommy?

215
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:44,908
Mr. Shaw here works with the Fitzpatricks.

216
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,733
I got what I needed.

217
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:50,007
Deputy, take our friend back
to the cell he enjoys so much.

218
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,787
Hi, Apollo?

219
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:00,684
Um, I'm Veronica Mars.

220
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:03,020
I'm a reporter for the Hearst Free Press.

221
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:04,651
We met at your radio interview,

222
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:06,773
And I'm hoping to do a story on you, too.

223
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:08,594
You wrote the book

224
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:10,789
So people would know what's happening there.

225
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:11,896
I know.

226
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:14,537
Sure. I've got some time later today.

227
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,134
Does that work for you?

228
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,606
Mm hmm.

229
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:20,437
My point is that white flour
is essentially poison.

230
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:22,591
You'll see. Couple weeks,
you'll be home eating with us.

231
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,011
You'll feel like a new person.

232
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:25,535
I rely pretty heavily on my morning bagel.

233
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,012
Which is exactly why you
need to be without it.

234
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:29,414
Oh, and I was able to pull
a few strings and get you

235
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:31,952
That job in the mailroom
I was telling you about.

236
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:33,981
Parker. Elbows.

237
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:37,253
It's only for a few weeks but it's enough
for you to make some spending money

238
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:38,824
Before we leave for your aunt louise's.

239
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:42,163
Thanks, dad, but I was
thinking of looking for a job,

240
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:44,328
Like, at a daycare or something.

241
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,131
So you can spend the summer with a cold

242
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,299
And ruin everyone's vacation?
I don't think so.

243
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:52,430
So, Logan, what sort of
career are you pursuing?

244
00:10:56,884 --> 00:10:58,664
- Oh, sorry. Were you about to...
- Yeah.

245
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:00,854
Apollo, you've got a visitor.

246
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,808
Hi.

247
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,886
Come in. Take a seat.

248
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:13,319
Oh!

249
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:15,059
Please don't lead your story

250
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:18,049
On how I like to play Grand Theft Auto.

251
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:20,552
Make me sound less frivolous.

252
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:25,987
Sometimes we'd be sent on waves

253
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:28,818
where the tactic was to
overpower our enemies

254
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:31,313
Through sheer weight of numbers.

255
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:33,739
We were divided into two units

256
00:11:33,774 --> 00:11:35,948
And given drugs to ready us to fight.

257
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:38,123
I would make myself vomit up the drugs,

258
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:39,747
Then convince the two leaders

259
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,622
I was going to be in the other's unit.

260
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:44,850
Instead, I'd hide in the bush

261
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:48,310
And blend in with the returning fighters.

262
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:51,736
To stay alive, one had to think quickly.

263
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:53,162
What's that survivor slogan?

264
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:57,136
Outwit, outplay, outlast?

265
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:59,136
I was a survivor.

266
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:05,946
Now, Veronica, did you have more questions?

267
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:07,753
Um...

268
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:11,569
Uh...

269
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:17,604
Let's talk about the days
before your conscription.

270
00:12:18,268 --> 00:12:20,715
I really think they liked me.

271
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,162
Yeah, I don't really think

272
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:24,825
You survived the googling.

273
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:33,835
Is it wrong that I'd rather
be trampled by horses

274
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,177
Than spend the summer with my parents?

275
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:38,485
No, the horses are a much better option.

276
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:43,007
what else am I gonna do?

277
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:46,045
I didn't sign up for classes or
request any summer housing.

278
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,795
You could stay here.

279
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:52,453
I'm sorry. I'm a little stunned.

280
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:54,459
That is so sweet.

281
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:58,754
It's just moving in,
that's kind of a big step.

282
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:00,987
Oh, I meant you could stay here.

283
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:02,431
I'll be gone most of the summer,

284
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,208
So you'd have the whole place to yourself.

285
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:04,832
Where are you going?

286
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,811
Going to South America to surf with Dick.

287
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:09,589
For the whole summer?

288
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:11,437
You were going home to Denver.

289
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:14,220
Yeah, which is a two hour flight from here.

290
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:17,168
I thought we'd see each other.

291
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:20,823
I'm sorry. I've been planning
this thing with Dick for a while.

292
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:22,579
I don't understand where we're at

293
00:13:22,614 --> 00:13:25,853
if you're not gonna see me for three
months and that's cool with you.

294
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,810
It's not cool with me.
I just didn't think about it.

295
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:32,532
It's a surf trip, Parker.
It has nothing to do with us.

296
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:36,004
The day I was kidnapped,

297
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:39,043
My mother couldn't really
put up a fight for me

298
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:41,098
Without risking others' lives.

299
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:44,240
But later that night, she came to the camp

300
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:47,347
To beg my captors to give me back to her.

301
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:48,670
I wasn't there.

302
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:51,703
This is just what my best friend,
James, told me.

303
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:57,460
And when they saw that James knew my mother,

304
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:00,656
They made him shoot her.

305
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:08,304
I'm so sorry.

306
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:14,547
Do you have anything from her

307
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:18,586
Pictures, personal items, mementos?

308
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:21,554
The day I was captured,

309
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:25,367
My mother sent me to the market.

310
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:30,398
I carried the shopping list
in my pocket for years.

311
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,962
Do you still have it?

312
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,537
Do you mind if I move into better light?

313
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:04,172
A perfect match.

314
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,610
You're sure this doesn't
bother you to talk about?

315
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:12,751
Positive.

316
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:16,118
Logan's going surfing in South America,
for the whole summer.

317
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:18,920
Never mentioned it. The whole summer.

318
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:19,933
What is that?

319
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:21,328
Is that how he is,

320
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:24,255
Or is that just how he is with me?

321
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:27,811
It's kind of just... how he is.

322
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:30,870
Why is that not more comforting?

323
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,673
So, Mac's not around
to talk about this stuff?

324
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:41,242
Mac's fallen into the
black hole of new love.

325
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:43,769
She only comes up for air.

326
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,998
How you guys doing?

327
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:48,627
I'm wearing a different shirt,
just so you know.

328
00:15:48,726 --> 00:15:50,892
- Uh huh.
- Keep it.

329
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,226
I have to, have to, have to

330
00:15:59,261 --> 00:16:01,272
Go to my morning classes tomorrow.

331
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:04,010
Getting lost in the sex nap eat repeat loop.

332
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:06,713
I'm in the porn version of Groundhog Day.

333
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,437
Poundhog day?

334
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:10,785
When's the last time you went to class?

335
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:12,933
Uh, february.

336
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:14,482
Are you kidding?

337
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:15,646
Business has been booming.

338
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:17,847
My classes have kind of
fallen by the wayside.

339
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:21,022
So now begins the 11th hour cram session.

340
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:22,990
No, no, no, no, no, I'm done.

341
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,931
The countdown to my expulsion has begun.

342
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:28,837
Frankly, it's liberating.

343
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:45,439
You were just waiting for me
to start pulling out books?

344
00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:47,076
No, I'm just browsing.

345
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:49,652
Boning up on your south american culture?

346
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:52,321
Conversational portuguese, perhaps?

347
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:54,956
If you're gonna be that close to Rio...

348
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:57,566
How do you know about my trip?

349
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,282
Parker mentioned it.

350
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,291
Did my fan club meet today?

351
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:06,839
Thought you guys only met on wednesdays.

352
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:10,075
Look, she was bummed you
didn't tell her about the trip.

353
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,277
And you took turns sticking
pins in your Logan dolls?

354
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:17,370
No, I told her that's just how you are.

355
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,921
Crack her open. We're celebrating.

356
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,264
I was offered another internship.

357
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:34,297
People are just falling all over
themselves to not pay you.

358
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:35,452
It's a good feeling.

359
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,202
So, this one is at a radio station

360
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:40,960
Krac, right here in Neptune.

361
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:42,879
All right.

362
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,905
It's not glamorous as the Pitchfork gig,

363
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,501
And it's top 40, which makes my parts hurt,

364
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:49,783
But it's radio.

365
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,719
I don't know. Pitchfork is music I'm into.

366
00:17:52,754 --> 00:17:56,424
It's New York, which is good...

367
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:57,979
...and bad.

368
00:17:58,014 --> 00:17:59,922
What do you want to end up doing,

369
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:01,793
Like, in the long run?

370
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:03,594
I want to be in radio.

371
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:06,833
Then you should take whatever
internship will get you there.

372
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,198
Hello?

373
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:15,736
Kizza, good news. Can you catch the red eye?

374
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:23,918
Hi, Apollo, it's Veronica.

375
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:27,454
I've got something else
I need to talk to you about.

376
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,250
Yeah, Veronica, glad you called.

377
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:30,977
I wanted to talk to you, too.

378
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:33,939
Could you come meet me at the library?

379
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:39,428
Sheriff Mars, as I live and breath.

380
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:42,155
Liam. Thanks for stopping by.

381
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,027
Well, the deputy you sent asked so politely.

382
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:46,240
Please take a seat.

383
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,055
Okay.

384
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,666
Looks good.

385
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:53,242
I had one of your boys
in here earlier Tommy Shaw.

386
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:54,669
He was trying to unload goods

387
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:57,207
Stolen from this string of burglaries.

388
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:59,279
How is Tommy doing these days?

389
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:01,429
I don't think I've seen that boy

390
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:03,692
Since his mother's wake back in '05.

391
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,885
You're working on a third strike, Liam.

392
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,719
You might consider quitting
while you're ahead.

393
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:11,020
Keith, we both know my trip down here

394
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:14,028
Wouldn't have been voluntary
if you had anything.

395
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:15,331
Nothing yet,

396
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:18,169
But I'm gonna keep
picking off your flunkies.

397
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:19,640
Eventually, one of them

398
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:23,277
Is gonna trade me 10 years for your name.

399
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:24,942
And a word of caution

400
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:27,581
Don Lamb's no longer in charge here.

401
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:30,552
You speaking ill of the dead, Keith?

402
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,488
Wow, 'cause, from what I understand,

403
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:37,957
This crime wave doesn't let up,

404
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:40,168
You won't be in charge long either.

405
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:45,970
Course, maybe these robberies will stop

406
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:50,096
If I find out what happened
to Kendall Casablancas

407
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:52,102
And my money.

408
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,772
Kendall's dead, and I suspect
your brother buried her

409
00:19:57,807 --> 00:19:59,688
In a shallow grave in the desert.

410
00:19:59,895 --> 00:20:03,684
As for the money, it was never yours.

411
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:13,092
Wouldn't bother unpacking.

412
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:19,948
Veronica, glad you can make it.

413
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:22,803
There's someone I want you to meet.

414
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:27,634
This is Wilson Behan,
editor of the Free Press.

415
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:29,685
He requested an interview.

416
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,666
Hey, Veronica.

417
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:35,204
I don't remember assigning
you to do a story on Apollo.

418
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:40,944
Well...

419
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:45,214
I'm gonna let you two sort this out.

420
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,214
All right, I wasn't assigned
to you by the school paper.

421
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:57,481
The truth is, I work as
a private investigator,

422
00:20:57,516 --> 00:21:01,974
And I was hired by a man
who believes he's your father.

423
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,789
Who is he?

424
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:07,830
His name is Kizza Oneko.

425
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:10,400
He had this.

426
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:15,556
It's a letter telling Kizza

427
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:19,537
To take an opportunity
To leave Uganda for America.

428
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,540
The war had separated them.

429
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:23,001
Kizza says he left

430
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:25,701
Not knowing your mother was pregnant.

431
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:28,490
Recognize the handwriting?

432
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:30,717
The grocery list I showed you

433
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,875
My hometown paper printed it.

434
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,715
This Kizza person simply forged this.

435
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,414
We'll prove his paternity
one way or the other

436
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:41,861
With a blood test.

437
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,936
No, we won't.

438
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:54,268
It's not the ethics of what
Max is doing that bothers me.

439
00:21:54,303 --> 00:21:56,417
At least I can rationalize that away,

440
00:21:56,452 --> 00:21:58,532
'Cause I had it filed away in my head

441
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,994
As a college lark,

442
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:02,878
A unique way for a philosophy
major to make some extra cash.

443
00:22:02,913 --> 00:22:05,640
In its own way, it showed
all these qualities I admire.

444
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:08,075
He's dedicated, he's got
a keen business sense,

445
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,475
And, let's face it, he's
good at what he does.

446
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,902
Helps people cheat.

447
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:14,922
Yeah, that.

448
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:17,952
But today, when he said he was flunking
out of school and he didn't care

449
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:20,394
he was just gonna get an
off-campus apartment next year,

450
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:21,767
and keep doing what he does,

451
00:22:21,802 --> 00:22:23,860
It was like looking into a crystal ball,

452
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:25,459
And I didn't like what I saw.

453
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:26,566
What did you see?

454
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:29,020
Me falling completely in love with him,

455
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:32,112
Losing all reason, ending up
hosting candle parties

456
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:34,464
And selling family heirlooms on ebay.

457
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:37,111
I have the potential to go down that road.

458
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:38,277
No, you don't.

459
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:41,220
I do. Love makes me lazy.
It's a dangerous drug.

460
00:22:41,255 --> 00:22:43,980
Kills more brain cells than crystal meth.

461
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:46,248
How'your cell count these days?

462
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,446
Hmm, I can still do long division,

463
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:51,305
But I can't quite remember
all the continents.

464
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,129
So Pizneyland is the
happiest place on earth?

465
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,256
Happy enough.

466
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,803
There's no roller coaster,

467
00:22:56,838 --> 00:23:00,134
But I think I can do without
the adrenaline and nausea.

468
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:03,506
Hi, it's Veronica Mars.

469
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,905
I'm trying to track down Apollo.

470
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,487
I've left several messages on his cellphone.

471
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:11,035
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, he hasn't been around.

472
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,808
Any idea where he might be?

473
00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:14,420
Olympia's, maybe?

474
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:17,010
You know who might know is Zeke Molinda.

475
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:19,703
He's one of the guys from
the African Student Alliance.

476
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:22,361
Oh, wait, you know what? I don't think
they're even speaking anymore.

477
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:24,780
They had some sort of falling out.

478
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:27,019
Uh, have you checked with dr. Tonin?

479
00:23:27,054 --> 00:23:29,223
I mean, she's practically his mum.

480
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:31,669
That'll get me started.

481
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:33,733
Thanks. Bye.

482
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:35,698
You must be Kizza.

483
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:39,473
Yes, uh, I'm looking for detective Mars.

484
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:40,846
I'm detective Mars.

485
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:44,747
You're just a girl. You're a teenager.

486
00:23:44,782 --> 00:23:47,036
A girl, a teenager, and a private detective.

487
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:49,979
I'm a triple threat.
Barely fits on my business card.

488
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:52,888
You are the person who's
arranging a meeting with my son?

489
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:55,851
I am. Unfortunately,
your son isn't as available

490
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:57,159
As I thought he would be.

491
00:23:57,194 --> 00:23:59,994
I'm having a little trouble
locating him right now,

492
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:01,968
But I have several leads.

493
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:11,311
We've been pretty vocal supporters

494
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:12,877
Of your candidacy, Keith.

495
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:14,373
It's becoming more difficult.

496
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:16,709
There are others at the
homeowners association

497
00:24:16,744 --> 00:24:18,913
Suggesting we should bng in mr. Van Lowe,

498
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:20,879
See what he's all about.

499
00:24:20,914 --> 00:24:23,117
I appreciate the heads up, Carl.

500
00:24:23,152 --> 00:24:25,320
I think we're on the right track,

501
00:24:25,355 --> 00:24:26,577
But it may take some time.

502
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:29,282
The election's in two weeks.
You don't have time.

503
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:30,642
Here's the data you asked for, Keith.

504
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:37,231
What kind of home security
system you got, Carl?

505
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:38,499
Safehouse.

506
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:39,655
You might want to replace it.

507
00:24:44,124 --> 00:24:45,568
Hey, can we talk for a second?

508
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:46,574
I have a class.

509
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:49,010
I don't want to get into a whole thing.

510
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:50,385
There'no whole thing.

511
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,425
I want to talk to you about the surf trip.

512
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,888
Fine.

513
00:24:54,923 --> 00:24:56,792
Kissing is cheating,

514
00:24:56,827 --> 00:25:00,226
And what I don't know will hurt me.

515
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:02,552
You should come with me.

516
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:05,338
You want me to come to South America

517
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,756
With you and Dick?

518
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:09,835
I meant it when I said
that I didn't think about

519
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,339
Being away from you for three months.

520
00:25:12,374 --> 00:25:14,108
Now I have.

521
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:17,645
I have to process things.
It's just what I'm like.

522
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,250
Oh, my god!

523
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,258
Olympia, you wouldn't happen to know

524
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:30,858
Where I might find Apollo?

525
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:32,388
I know he's avoiding you.

526
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:36,567
Veronica, I think he should
meet the guy, get tested.

527
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:39,110
If I see him again,
I'll keep working on him.

528
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,629
I wish I could help you.

529
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:45,978
To tell you the truth,
I'm starting to worry about him.

530
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:48,611
Will you let me know if you find him?

531
00:25:59,454 --> 00:26:00,960
Hi, Zeke?

532
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:02,149
Yes.

533
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:04,863
I'm Veronica.
I'm trying to find Apollo Bukenya.

534
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,400
You're looking in the wrong place.

535
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:08,274
We don't talk anymore.

536
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:11,313
I heard. This is kind of last ditch.

537
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:12,778
Sorry to bother you.

538
00:26:12,813 --> 00:26:15,163
What do you need him for?

539
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:20,019
I'm doing a story on him.

540
00:26:21,922 --> 00:26:24,489
In that case, I've got your lead.

541
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:27,185
He didn't write "Soldier of misfortune".

542
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,798
His adviser did.

543
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:32,594
He knows it, and he knows I know it.

544
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:36,395
So Apollo told his adviser
the story of his life,

545
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,838
And she wrote the book?

546
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:39,193
Not exactly.

547
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:42,233
The stories in Apollo's book
are true for many others.

548
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,549
They simply didn't happen to him.

549
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,419
He was never conscripted.

550
00:26:53,591 --> 00:26:55,872
Zeke was Apollo's roommate freshman year.

551
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:58,201
He says Apollo told him all about his life,

552
00:26:58,236 --> 00:27:00,496
But until "Soldier of misfortune" came out,

553
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:01,723
Never included anything

554
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:04,400
About being a child soldier in the LRA.

555
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:06,625
So what should I do?

556
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:12,660
I don't know. Nothing?

557
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:14,508
I'm serious, Veronica.

558
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:18,374
It's a fact that there are
child soldiers in Africa.

559
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:21,418
There's this organization,
Invisible Children,

560
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:23,883
That sends volunteers over to Uganda

561
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:26,047
To help protect the kids there.

562
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:28,091
They have a booth up at the job fair.

563
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:30,927
There was a crowd around it
today about five people deep.

564
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:33,053
I think I'm missing the point.

565
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:35,991
Everyone is there because of Apollo's book.

566
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:37,900
If you expose his book as a hoax,

567
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:40,040
I promise you'll be killing a lot more

568
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,736
Than his literary career.

569
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,099
Hello?

570
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,770
Veronica, hi, it's Olympia.

571
00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:52,456
I just saw Apollo.
He's heading back to his room.

572
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:53,803
I think he's ready to talk.

573
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,574
No. No!

574
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,367
Are you kidding me?

575
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,258
What about the first check?

576
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:06,162
But I've already...

577
00:28:06,566 --> 00:28:09,066
So they're just gonna
pull the plug, just like that?

578
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:11,735
Fine, fine.

579
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,431
I have lawyers, too.

580
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:19,476
Sorry. Is this a bad time?

581
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:21,304
No. No, now is fine.

582
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:24,279
Just give me a second to take my
laundry out of the machine

583
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:26,188
Before someone steals it.

584
00:28:26,223 --> 00:28:28,166
I can wait.

585
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:32,953
Pull the plug, lawyers, checks?

586
00:28:32,988 --> 00:28:36,938
To whom, pray tell, was the
young mr. Bukenya speaking?

587
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:42,567
Hit redial.

588
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,964
Silver Pictures.

589
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,935
Looks like "Soldier of misfortune"

590
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,126
Won't be coming to a theater near you.

591
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:58,684
This man who claims to be my father

592
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:01,166
Olympia convinced me. I want to meet him.

593
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:02,882
I'll take the blood test.

594
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:06,139
I'll arrange it.

595
00:29:06,174 --> 00:29:08,004
Hello, son.

596
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:12,498
Dad?

597
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:14,386
What, they just let you in my room?

598
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:16,204
Well, I am paying for it, after all.

599
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:19,439
Really? I thought hundreds of saps
who invested in your company

600
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:20,809
Were paying for it.

601
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,841
I feel better about myself already.

602
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:25,809
I, uh...

603
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:27,613
I turned myself in.

604
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:30,213
My lawyer made all the arrangements.

605
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:33,608
I have a couple months
before my incarceration.

606
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:35,212
Tired of running, Dick.

607
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:38,208
I want to pay my debt to
society and get it over with.

608
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,915
And what kind of debt did
your lawyer negotiate?

609
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,175
A year.

610
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,211
That's exactly what this biker
I went to high school with got

611
00:29:46,246 --> 00:29:48,366
For stealing the huntington's lawn jockey.

612
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:51,222
It's good to be the king, huh?

613
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:54,539
I'll consider our societal flaws

614
00:29:54,574 --> 00:29:56,889
During my yard time in the big house.

615
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:03,962
I turn myself in at the end of august.

616
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:06,691
At least we have a few months before then.

617
00:30:06,726 --> 00:30:09,350
I've rented a room a couple floors down.

618
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:12,087
I want to spend as much
time as possible with you.

619
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:13,682
I'm gonna be gone most of the summer.

620
00:30:13,722 --> 00:30:14,903
I'm going on this surf trip.

621
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:17,987
Surf trip? I'm going to jail, Dick.

622
00:30:18,022 --> 00:30:20,274
I know. I'm sorry. I just

623
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:22,198
This is the only chance you
have to be with your father,

624
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:24,042
And you're talking about a surf trip?!

625
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:28,252
Silver pictures? What is silver pictures?

626
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:30,872
It's a company that makes movies.

627
00:30:30,907 --> 00:30:35,066
My point is, there's not going to be a movie

628
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,678
Of "Soldier of misfortune".

629
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:39,741
There's not going to be a big check.

630
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:44,219
I suspect Oprah may tear Apollo
a new one on national tv.

631
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:45,684
What does Oprah have to do with...

632
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,272
Mr. Oneko, if you tracked down Apollo

633
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:50,819
In hopes of finding financial security,

634
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:53,296
I'm urging you to simply walk away.

635
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:57,435
He needs people around
him who care about him.

636
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,497
If that's not you, I can't let...

637
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:02,538
Miss Mars, had it not been for the war,

638
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:05,689
I never would have left Uganda.

639
00:31:05,724 --> 00:31:07,510
I came to New York,

640
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:11,608
A place where I had no friends, no family,

641
00:31:11,643 --> 00:31:13,750
As a means of survival.

642
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:15,373
I'm still alive,

643
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:18,908
But I've been alone for 21 years.

644
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,820
I drive a cab.

645
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:23,885
I go to school,

646
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:27,933
But I am lonely.

647
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:32,916
If this is my son, please let me be there

648
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:35,130
To comfort him in this difficult time.

649
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:50,257
I don't think he's coming.

650
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:53,659
He'll be here.

651
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,194
You ever notice how the stained
wood around the window

652
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:01,465
Has the effect of shrinking the space?

653
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,702
I'm thinking something more of an eggshell,

654
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:05,372
Would really open it up in here.

655
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:07,107
I should probably write that down.

656
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,923
Anyway, what can I do for you, Keith?

657
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:10,982
I don't suppose, Vinnie, you've noticed,

658
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:12,972
But there's a criminal element in town

659
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:15,611
That would really love
to see you as Sheriff.

660
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:17,579
Oh, what can I say?

661
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:19,140
I'm a walking big 10 party.

662
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:21,323
Must be why the girls
from the secretarial pool

663
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,786
Gave me that nickname.

664
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:26,419
What do you know about
Safehouse Security Systems?

665
00:32:26,454 --> 00:32:27,887
Hey, Sacksy,

666
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:30,489
Mind running out and getting a latte?

667
00:32:30,524 --> 00:32:32,686
I can have him get you something, as well.

668
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:34,652
Safehouse?

669
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:36,602
Yeah, I did some consulting work for them.

670
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:40,038
You did. Did you know that all seven
homes that have been burglarized

671
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:41,400
Subscribe to safehouse?

672
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:44,111
Quite a co-inkydink.

673
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:45,911
You and the Fitzpatricks

674
00:32:45,946 --> 00:32:48,208
Are the prime beneficiaries
of those robberies.

675
00:32:49,486 --> 00:32:51,105
I think you're colluding with them.

676
00:32:53,107 --> 00:32:57,651
Well, Keith, you are certainly
entitled to your theory.

677
00:32:57,686 --> 00:33:01,572
Question is...

678
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:05,459
Can you prove it?

679
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:10,265
It's been an hour.

680
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,472
I'm so sorry, Apollo.

681
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:16,293
Sorry for what?

682
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:20,951
I expect nothing,
so I'm rarely disappointed.

683
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:30,879
So, did you tell this Kizza
person that I'm a fraud?

684
00:33:30,914 --> 00:33:33,080
And that I won't be coming into money

685
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:34,549
As all the articles say?

686
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:39,832
I told him there was that possibility.

687
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,084
Good.

688
00:33:45,296 --> 00:33:46,945
Thank you.

689
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,981
You did your part.

690
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:55,605
What do you mean, my part?

691
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,927
"Soldier of misfortune".

692
00:33:57,962 --> 00:34:00,959
The story is mine. I wrote every word of it.

693
00:34:00,994 --> 00:34:04,809
I needed to know whether this
Kizza gentleman would show

694
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:08,312
Regardless of my stature
and financial situation.

695
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:11,614
So, everything I told him was...

696
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,243
Disinformation,

697
00:34:13,278 --> 00:34:17,020
A plan to separate those I can trust

698
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,193
From those I can't

699
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:21,589
A plan like so many others.

700
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:24,892
Zeke is actually a very good friend of mine.

701
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:28,468
Take care.

702
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:33,351
Mars Investigations.

703
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,303
So Veronica, why is there
a detainee in my jail,

704
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:38,159
Named Kizza Oneko

705
00:34:38,194 --> 00:34:40,947
Who asks for his one phone
call to be made to you?

706
00:34:40,982 --> 00:34:42,716
Apollo, wait.

707
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,575
Why is he being detained?

708
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,929
He was picked up driving a rental,
With plates from a stolen car.

709
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,106
Apollo.

710
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,736
Mr. Oneko,

711
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:06,251
I'm happy we have this chance to meet.

712
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:07,629
As am I.

713
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,449
Overjoyed, in fact.

714
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,667
I'm not surprised your mother named you

715
00:35:13,702 --> 00:35:15,044
For the god of music.

716
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:19,019
She had a book of mythology
that she treasured.

717
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:26,057
I... I remember it well. It...

718
00:35:26,092 --> 00:35:32,092
It is the book she used
to teach me how to read.

719
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:37,251
Father?

720
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,792
Would you like to hear about your mother

721
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:54,125
As the young girl that I fell in love with?

722
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:11,699
You sure you want to do this?

723
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:14,745
It's quite a commitment,
and Africa's a long way away.

724
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:17,631
I'm positive.

725
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:18,875
Okay.

726
00:36:26,054 --> 00:36:28,381
I come with tales from the outside world.

727
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:29,786
Hey!

728
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:34,062
Oh, and, um, I brought these for you.

729
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:36,830
I was passing through the job fair,

730
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:39,291
And, um, apparently, there are careers

731
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:42,729
That a philosophy degree prepares you for,

732
00:36:42,764 --> 00:36:45,519
So just thought I'd grab them, just in case.

733
00:36:45,554 --> 00:36:48,274
I guess we need to talk about this, huh?

734
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:51,047
Yeah, maybe.

735
00:36:51,082 --> 00:36:52,741
Here's the thing.

736
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:58,444
I make about $1,500 a week
doing something I like.

737
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:01,092
I'm gonna be doing this for a while.

738
00:37:01,127 --> 00:37:04,202
Not forever, but for a while.

739
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:07,362
I hope that doesn't change things for you.

740
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,678
I wish that it didn't, but it kind of does.

741
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,923
Well, that sucks.

742
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:19,193
Yeah, but I'm not sure
how much it changes things.

743
00:37:19,228 --> 00:37:22,062
I want us to keep seeing each other.

744
00:37:23,151 --> 00:37:24,021
Well, great.

745
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:27,462
Just can't do the blissful
love shack thing anymore.

746
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:30,808
I need to get back to
my regularly scheduled life.

747
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:32,988
Is that cool?

748
00:37:33,023 --> 00:37:36,519
So, do you have to get
back to reality now or...

749
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,989
No.

750
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:41,532
No, I got a couple hours.

751
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,632
Good.

752
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:04,043
Son?

753
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:05,518
Just so you know,

754
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:08,353
The world doesn't stop because
you decided to show up.

755
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:10,448
Had I known it was interfering
with your surfing schedule,

756
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:11,521
I would have come sooner.

757
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,661
Like maybe for Cassidy's funeral?

758
00:38:13,696 --> 00:38:15,731
This is where he died, you know?

759
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:18,362
I walk by the spot he
splattered on every day.

760
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,089
You think I'm not sorry about Cassidy?

761
00:38:20,124 --> 00:38:22,959
What are you sorry for, dad? That he's dead?

762
00:38:22,994 --> 00:38:24,424
Of course.

763
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:26,163
You ever think he's dead because of us,

764
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:27,490
or that he killed those
people because of us?!

765
00:38:27,491 --> 00:38:28,372
Son...

766
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,920
We used to have contests to see
which one of us could make him cry!

767
00:38:30,955 --> 00:38:32,850
I can barely live with myself sometimes,

768
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:36,090
And it's so much easier
when you're not around!

769
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:41,411
Hey, listen, about our summer plans,

770
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:44,093
I know you're gonna think this is uncool,
but I kind of broke down and-

771
00:38:44,128 --> 00:38:45,982
I can't go.

772
00:38:46,017 --> 00:38:47,162
What?

773
00:38:47,197 --> 00:38:48,755
Yeah, the trip's not gonna happen

774
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,220
My dad's back,

775
00:38:50,255 --> 00:38:53,905
Wants me to spend time with
him before he goes to jail.

776
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,517
I get it, man.

777
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:59,711
Sorry for screwing up your summer,ou know?

778
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:06,694
Hey!

779
00:39:06,729 --> 00:39:07,935
I was just gonna call you.

780
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,619
I told my parents. They freaked out.

781
00:39:10,654 --> 00:39:12,618
It was the best feeling.

782
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:15,615
What's wrong?

783
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,842
The trip's off.

784
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:22,126
Dick's dad came back into town,

785
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:25,590
And now he can't go, so...

786
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:27,932
Oh.

787
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:30,204
So...

788
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,270
I guess we're not going, then?

789
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:36,899
He was footing half the bill for the house,

790
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,359
And it'd just be really expensive.

791
00:39:39,394 --> 00:39:43,262
And it was a thing me and
Dick were planning on together.

792
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:46,109
I understand.

793
00:39:46,144 --> 00:39:48,119
Yeah.

794
00:39:48,154 --> 00:39:52,491
I guess I'm going to Denver then.

795
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:56,969
Dad, check this out.

796
00:39:57,004 --> 00:39:59,413
I'm Vincent Vanlowe.

797
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:00,489
Aw, no.

798
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,221
I was born in Neptune.

799
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:03,884
I live in Neptune.

800
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:06,386
My friends and family live in Neptune.

801
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:10,478
That's why what happens
in our city concerns me so much.

802
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:12,498
There's nothing more important

803
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:14,448
Than the safety of our children...

804
00:40:14,483 --> 00:40:16,583
- Vinnie has kids?
- None that he's aware of.

805
00:40:16,618 --> 00:40:20,510
...and the security of our homes.

806
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:24,048
I'm Vincent Vanlowe,
and I'm asking for your vote.

807
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:28,401
Vinnie Van Lowe has been endorsed
by the Neptune Homeowners Association.

808
00:40:28,847 --> 00:40:31,703
Well, from the ridiculous to the sublime,

809
00:40:31,738 --> 00:40:34,560
Apollo and Kizza's blood test checked out.

810
00:40:34,595 --> 00:40:35,951
No surprise.

811
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:43,638
Hello?

812
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:45,347
Sure.

813
00:40:45,418 --> 00:40:47,334
It's for you.

814
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:53,324
Hello?

815
00:40:56,653 --> 00:40:58,227
Really?

816
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:01,087
That's incredible. Thank you.

817
00:41:05,474 --> 00:41:06,828
I'm in.

818
00:41:07,503 --> 00:41:10,810
The FBI has chosen me
for their summer internship!

819
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:12,862
Yes!

820
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:16,010
Talk about making up for
that crappy P.I. Exam score.

821
00:41:16,045 --> 00:41:18,232
You did it, honey.

822
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,384
My daughter the fed!

823
00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:21,986
Twelve fun-filled, pay-free weeks

824
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,466
Of schlepping coffee and office supplies

825
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:26,912
at the Federal Bureau of Investigation!

826
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:28,330
Ice cream!

827
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:33,384
I can't believe it!

828
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:35,131
It's in Virginia, right?

829
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,004
Yeah.
