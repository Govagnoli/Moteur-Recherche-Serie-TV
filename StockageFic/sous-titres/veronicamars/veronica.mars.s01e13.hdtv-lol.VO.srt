1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:01,876
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,458
You know, you'll never gonna be able
to come to terms with Lilly's death

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:06,424
if you keep all this pain bottled up inside

4
00:00:06,425 --> 00:00:09,548
I'll find closure when Lilly's
killer's rotting away in prison

5
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:10,862
No, Veronica was my friend too.

6
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:14,026
And if she hadn't ratted me out,
then Lilly and I would have staid together.

7
00:00:14,027 --> 00:00:17,152
These stories... They're tearing my family apart.

8
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:19,726
If you try to divorce me,
I will leave you with nothing.

9
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:25,006
- No house, no maid, and no friends...
- Right dad, you say another word
to her and I will kill you.

10
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:27,397
I cannot take this anymore.

11
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:31,099
<i>Requesting assistance for a possible
jumper on the Coronado Bridge</i>

12
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:37,484
No! Look, if they can't commit at least
10 millions, man, we go some place else.

13
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:40,513
Nice day...

14
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:44,042
It's always nice here, what's this ?

15
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:48,081
- A waiver for Bryce to drop PE.
- Drop PE?

16
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:50,867
His physic's teacher agreed to
sponsor for independant study

17
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:52,437
so he needs to drop the class.

18
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:53,792
Dropping PE...

19
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:57,268
You know that boy could stand to get
hit in the head with a dodge ball or two

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,904
Thoughen his ass huh ?

21
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:01,172
And why is this club bill so high this month ?

22
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:03,047
Yolanda took riding lessons.

23
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:04,574
Like on a horse?

24
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:08,296
First time I saw a horse I was thirteen,

25
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,174
the damn thing was on tv...

26
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:13,566
and the street was tough
and you lost a lot of homies

27
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:16,155
but this is Neptune and
her friends took them.

28
00:01:17,197 --> 00:01:19,380
you should talk to her when
she comes home from Gabriel's,

29
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,706
she's supposed to call if she stays over.

30
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,491
I'll do more than talk to her, allright?

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,971
Tell me this babe,

32
00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:30,273
how did a man like me end up with
National Black Velvet and Urkel, huh?

33
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,488
Speak of the devil.

34
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:35,918
What's up son? What's the matter?

35
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,534
It's Yolanda.

36
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:42,457
Something's happened.

37
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:45,130
Did she really leave a note on a blackberry?

38
00:01:45,554 --> 00:01:48,054
Yeah, talk about post-mortem...

39
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,977
How's Logan holding out?

40
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:54,784
He hasn't been in school since,
we're not exactly phone buddies.

41
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:02,223
Hey dad, how's the back holding up,
you remembered to take your pills?

42
00:02:02,627 --> 00:02:04,984
Shouldn't you be doing your homework
instead of nagging me?

43
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:09,649
Thanks.

44
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:11,581
Next time remember:

45
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:15,978
lift drunk combative bail jumpers
with you legs, not your back.

46
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:17,988
and use your heating pad...

47
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,604
and eat fiber.

48
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:25,748
That must suck to have tabloids creeps
in your face at a time like this.

49
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,940
Stop staring... It's just hair!

50
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,030
- Resisting the urge to touch.
- Well you keep resisting that urge.

51
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:37,316
Hey I'm, huh, looking for Keith Mars?

52
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:41,187
- Yeah, sure, in here... dad?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:51,298
You know who that is?

54
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:53,223
Should I know who that is?

55
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,628
If you're serious about your cred
with urban demographic.

56
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:00,142
I'm absolutly serious about my cred
with the urban demo!

57
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:01,667
Drive-by records...

58
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:05,543
reported to have held a man out of the window
in order to get him to sign a contract.

59
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:08,527
twice jailed, and emerged stronger each time,

60
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:13,266
The gansta rap impressario besides whom all
gansta rap impressario measure themselves.

61
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:17,410
That's Bone Hamilton.

62
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:19,479
How can I help you  Mr Hamilton?

63
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:22,584
My daughter's missing,

64
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:26,106
I need you to get her back.

65
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,021
Hamilton?

66
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:31,525
God, that's Yolanda Hamilton's dad?

67
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:33,283
I didn't know you knew her.

68
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:35,703
We used to be friends,

69
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:37,888
a long time ago.

70
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:08,539
<i>Season 1 - Episode 13
Lord of the bling</i>

71
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:12,334
Are you sure it's not just some
kind of teenage misbehavior,

72
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,876
- it's not uncommon for...
- Maybe your teenager,

73
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:17,712
but Yolanda she knew the rules,

74
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:22,065
and her friend Gabrielle tells me that she
was studying at her place till midnight.

75
00:04:22,915 --> 00:04:24,752
And my son, he finds a car up the block,

76
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:27,880
the doors open, the light still on
and signs of struggle.

77
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:32,189
We're not talking about teenager
misbehaviour, man, somebody's got her.

78
00:04:33,464 --> 00:04:35,983
Mr Hamilton, as much as
I appreciate the business,

79
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:39,712
- sounds like something for the police.
- Hey, hey, hey.

80
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:42,230
I don't like the police...

81
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,533
and the feeling is mutual.

82
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:50,923
and what I hear, sounds like
something you'd understand.

83
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:57,041
Any idea who might want to do this?

84
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:02,917
Uh, man, lets just say I got a couple of
big deals going down real soon

85
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:08,450
and there's some cats out here who
wouldn't mind seeing it screwed up.

86
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,629
It's a lot of ideas...

87
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:16,364
That's just Southern California,

88
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:23,502
now if you hear anything about New York,
Detroit, Atlanta, I got more lists.

89
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:29,641
I suggest you start
at the top, Sam Bloom.

90
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:32,034
Hey honey.

91
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:35,981
- What's cooking?
- Not quite sure myself.

92
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:39,607
Something that ends in -aroni. Any luck?

93
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:43,907
Nothing in the car, noone in the
neighborhood saw or heard anything.

94
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,483
So you figured you'd check
what's up with Nelly?

95
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:50,113
I'm reading up on my client,

96
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,192
and if you buy it, he's
the scariest man alive

97
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:55,585
who's also launching a line of casual wear.

98
00:05:57,251 --> 00:05:58,943
She's a senior at my school,

99
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:03,028
- I can ask around, background info...
- Sure, but be discreet,

100
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:05,940
client's a little sensitive, ok ?

101
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:09,862
Our client isn't the only one who's sensitive.

102
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:13,483
This isn't the first time I've had
the chance to help Yolanda Hamilton.

103
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:18,921
Wow, new student alerts.

104
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,213
Glad to see you guys are equal opportunity oglers

105
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:24,790
Hey I judge not by the color of the skin,

106
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,630
but the content of their sweater.

107
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,677
Good thing I'm not the jealous type.

108
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:40,056
dying to figure out what goes on behind
the scenes in the teacher's loundge.

109
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:43,338
- This isn't english? Mrs Murphy?
- Not even close.

110
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,474
- I'm Veronica, you're...
- new, Yolanda Hamilton.

111
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,855
Let me show you.

112
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,553
Master's champ, three years in a row...

113
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,005
I was good...

114
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:06,351
So you didn't tell me what this is
in regards to Mr Mars.

115
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,598
Trying to find someone Mr Bloom,

116
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,045
daugther of a former client
of yours, Mr Hamilton.

117
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:14,619
Yolanda come to her senses
and ran away from him ?

118
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,343
So you know Yolanda?

119
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:19,438
I did, our kids grew up together,

120
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,709
why would you think I know anything
about her disapearance?

121
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,055
He implied that there was some pretty
bad blood between you two, a grudge.

122
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:30,665
Bad blood, huh? That's one way to put it...

123
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:33,376
Hatred would be another way.

124
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:36,280
Oh, so he didn't fill you in?

125
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:41,128
When Bone was, as he's
fond of telling the magazines,

126
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,747
fighting his way up from the mean streets,

127
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:46,767
he didn't advertise the fact
that much of the success

128
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:49,868
was due to his cumfortably
uppermiddleclass jewish lawyer.

129
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:52,040
Everyone was making money.

130
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,360
Sounds like you were on good terms.

131
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:55,529
Sounds like it,

132
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,151
when he leave he didn't tell me he was
involve in some ingunious tax evasion.

133
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:00,740
I had to make a choice:

134
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:04,086
loose my practice to the IRS, or talk,

135
00:08:04,812 --> 00:08:08,644
I chose to save my practice.
Bone went back to prison.

136
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,671
I'm not sure i understand, sounds like
he's the one with the grudge.

137
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:16,617
Well, that's not the whole story.

138
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:23,157
About two months into his sentence,
I was leaving work,

139
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:27,343
a car pulled up, fired
ten shots into my car.

140
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:30,619
- He tried to have you killed?
- Well he denies it of course,

141
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,677
but that's when I realized the
real Percy Hamilton is, it's Bone.

142
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:39,130
I mean, we might have lost track
of time studying and all but...

143
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,499
One thing about having an ex cop for a dad

144
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,320
is that some boring sunday when you've seen all the reruns

145
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,837
he might kill time describing for instance

146
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:49,712
how to tell if someone's lying in an interogation.

147
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,491
Take Yolanda's friend Gabrielle here.

148
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,404
The indirect eye contact, the smile
that doesn't crinkle the eyes

149
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:59,084
... she's still at [...]?

150
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:01,417
She's missing, she's in danger,

151
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:03,820
quit lying and tell me what really happened.

152
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:11,662
We'd been sneaking out
to this club in LA, "Blender",

153
00:09:11,663 --> 00:09:13,767
the bouncer Marcel used to work for her dad.

154
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:15,916
I've beeing seeing this guy , he's older.

155
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,904
My parents would disown me if they'd knew.

156
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:19,463
How long did you stay at the club?

157
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,492
When Jimmy and I left it was
probably around midnight,

158
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:25,688
but Yolanda was still there,
but she had a car.

159
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:28,128
Thanks, hope she's okay...

160
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:29,340
You think I don't?

161
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,949
She's my friend, who are you?

162
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:44,524
Hey dad, something to check...

163
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:48,301
Who am I? I was Yolanda's
first friend at Neptune.

164
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:50,690
Hey new girl what you dad do?

165
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,239
He's one of the "Dixie Chicks",

166
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,522
and yeah, he makes more money than your dad.

167
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,301
Was that your real question?

168
00:09:57,302 --> 00:09:59,277
You guys are prepared for
the biggest blowout of all time?

169
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,491
- Where are your parents going this time?
- Nepal.

170
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:05,793
Sherpas lug their crap up and down
a mountain for two weeks
so they can take pictures of a yak.

171
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:09,479
while I take pictures of you yakking
in the confort of your living room

172
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:14,954
Happens twice a year, his parents leave town
he throws a big party and he gets busted.

173
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,640
You must be there.

174
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:19,769
You must.
I guess I must.

175
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:31,097
If you really want flowers, dying
seems to be the way to go.

176
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:34,667
Here's your costume.

177
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:38,353
You know, if it's not sad enough
I can order you a veil.

178
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:40,803
Do you remember that day,

179
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:45,156
we all went to the zoo on your 10th birthday?

180
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:50,005
We told you mom that...
we were all gonna get dressed up in

181
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:52,023
costumes of our favorite animal.

182
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,862
- Your remember her animal?
- Yes, a mermaid.

183
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:04,989
When she realized we'd play a trick on her
and no one else had gotten dressed up,

184
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:11,063
she wore that costume around
for the rest of the day anyway.

185
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:12,729
I remember that day.

186
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:18,632
On the way home I spilled a milk shake in the Beamer and you gave me a nosebleed.

187
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:23,103
You poured that milkshake out in the
backseat because we didn't buy you a monkey,

188
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:25,525
then when I went to grab you smacked
your head against the window!

189
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:27,241
I guess we just memored it differently dad.

190
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:32,005
It's fine.

191
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:35,090
- Have you heard from your sister?
- Yeah, she sent a telegram.

192
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:37,922
Heartbroken. Stop.

193
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:40,715
Can't make it back from Sydney. Stop.

194
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:43,701
Underwater scene shoot tomorow. Stop.

195
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:47,985
Entire crew said prayer for mom. Stop.

196
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:50,407
Love you. Stop.

197
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:51,954
- Logan...
- Stop.

198
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,438
Well there's no people like show people.

199
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:03,522
She did send a wreath though.
It's gorgeous.

200
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:07,060
tulips and  hyacinths... probably set you back hundreds/*...

201
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:13,112
- Your mom loved tulips.
- Yeah, it was an overwhelming gesture.

202
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,787
Don't get up.

203
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:27,079
- Where are you going?
- Marcel that doorman you called me about?

204
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,685
Number four on the enemy's list?

205
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,934
He was Bones' bodyguard until he paid
too much attention to Yolanda,

206
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:35,994
Bone had him fired after a symbolic
meeting between his boot, Marcel's...

207
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:39,062
Veronica, this a Mars' investigation
matter, I'm Mars.

208
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:41,652
- And who am I?
- Veronica, and you're staying!

209
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:44,537
Veronica MARS, and you're on painkillers,

210
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:47,720
and the bottle says don't operate
heavy machinery and a car is heavy.

211
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:54,311
Remember, you stay in the car.

212
00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:57,722
And remember, you watch your back,

213
00:12:58,798 --> 00:12:59,953
I mean that medically.

214
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:22,268
i just let her in man, that's it.

215
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:25,223
Bone fired you for being a little
too friendly with his daughter,

216
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:26,548
that didn't make you a litlle mad?

217
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,128
No it made me smart,

218
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,606
I got into enough trouble
looking at that girl.

219
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:35,714
if Bone got you after me, he must not
know who was here that night.

220
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,145
Who was here?

221
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:42,866
Where to, boss?

222
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:47,304
- Heard of rapper named Dimebag?
- Dad. I thought you read vibe?

223
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:49,253
'Shot my boo'? 'Thuggin'?

224
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:50,987
Lovely tunes, I'm sure.

225
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,655
But you might remember the guy
that Bone Hamilton supposely dangled

226
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:56,173
outside the window until
he signed the contract?

227
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:58,893
- That was Dimebag?
- Number two on the list.

228
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,599
He was here saturday night
with his bunch of dudes.

229
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:05,266
His posse, dad, the Eagles
had un bunch of dudes.

230
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:08,335
Well the posse is at the Duke Hotel.

231
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:11,398
- What's this?
- Clues.

232
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,996
Valet stubs, I figured even
kidnappers had to park....

233
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:18,206
I know, stay in the car.

234
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:24,602
Any luck?

235
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:28,428
Manager said Mr Bag is out of the town,
and that Dime wouldn't talk to me,

236
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:32,057
even if he were here, that is unless
Bone might be willing to beg.

237
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:34,188
- So what next?
- Plan B.

238
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:40,550
- What do you think, the T6 or the T9?
- T9.

239
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:41,776
- How do I look?

240
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:45,218
Like a humble drudge no one
would notice breaking into a room.

241
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:47,047
That'll do.

242
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,147
When I met yollanda I never imagined a
year later I'd be waiting in a hotel loby

243
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,969
while my dad bugged a
rapper's room trying to find her.

244
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,012
I thought a year later she and Lilly and I
would be hanging out like we did the
first month just beeing normal.

245
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:10,590
This being of course before
that word lost all meaning.

246
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:13,118
Are these platinium?

247
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:18,037
No wonder you don't talk about your dad,
he's 2-Pac and he's secretly still alive!

248
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:20,214
Just a producer, nothing interesting.

249
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:22,014
So how come he's never around?

250
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,907
He's away, on business for a little while.

251
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:29,510
excuse my little brother,
he's an eavesdropping little freak.

252
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:31,906
Ah, mine is worse.

253
00:15:32,713 --> 00:15:34,426
I'm doin... I'm doing a project...

254
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:36,293
Do it somewhere else, Bryce.

255
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,041
Ok for my next boyfriend,

256
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:42,913
Jude Law type or Collin Farrel type?

257
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:45,230
Next? What happened to Logan?

258
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:49,914
He's insanely jealous all the time
and that's getting on my nerves...

259
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:52,361
I know it's not cool to admit this but,

260
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:54,227
I like the jealous streak on a man,

261
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:56,186
keeps him in line...

262
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:57,918
All yours,

263
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,761
ditching his party this week end cause
I don't want him to get all crazy violent

264
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,589
everytime a boy undresses me with
his eyes, which happens all the time,

265
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,899
it's not my fault, I can't help it.
God made me fabulous.

266
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,550
Well if you're ditching that means Yollanda
and I will have to party for three.

267
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:15,505
Which means Yollanda will have to
be partying for two hand a half.

268
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,868
Oh but we're still going to that
fleet week thing in San Diego right?

269
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:23,320
It's the best! All these weird
angry bands playing

270
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:26,910
and hundred of cute sailors get
totaly wasted and fight on the sand...

271
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,858
You know I'm really glad I met you guys?

272
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:33,050
You should be glad...

273
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:35,051
We're the best!

274
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:40,036
And I can't wait for San Diego,
it'll be rockin' like dockin'

275
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:46,904
We got some problems here.

276
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,879
- What can I do for you?
- Yo, ya call that a penthouse?

277
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,954
A pent dog house maybe.

278
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:53,357
He's saying it's small.

279
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:58,922
Oh oh. It looks like Darius Bagley a.k.a
Dimebag and crew are arriving home early.

280
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:02,043
Not good, if they catch dad in their room....

281
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:06,031
- What we asked for was a big ass room!
- I'll get you switched right now!

282
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,288
Good news, they won't walk in on
dad bugging their room.

283
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:12,149
Bad news, he's bugging the wrong room.

284
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:15,372
Ok room 1411, our biggest?

285
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:18,494
You know you all can learn
a little something about VIP service.

286
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,555
Thank you so much... Sarah.

287
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:24,306
I'm Melinda you hospitality hostess,
I'm so sorry about the mix up,

288
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:26,135
the new help doesn't always quite get it,

289
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:28,918
but if you gentleman would follow me,
I could show you your room?

290
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:47,005
Ahhh, yeah!

291
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:49,377
Now this what I'm talking about, baby.

292
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:53,844
So you have your bathroom,
right back there,

293
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:57,632
and your television, if
you want to watch that.

294
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:04,124
Chairs, for sitting, uh, the phone
in case you need to make a call,

295
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:08,080
would be... just like that.

296
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:09,938
All right, it's cool.

297
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:12,923
I'll have them send up some
more... Is that crystal?

298
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:14,357
You're damn straight Melinda.

299
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:16,292
Enjoy your stay...

300
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:23,105
Where have you been? Didn't I say?

301
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:24,101
Bathroom brake.

302
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,600
How'd we do?

303
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:36,242
Think we're on business....

304
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:40,966
<i>- They give us this upgrading you just
watch golf like an old coot...
- Ten more minutes.</i>

305
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:41,967
Here, try this.

306
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:47,281
<i>Yo man that damn hospitality hostess
was lying about that crystal, man.</i>

307
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:50,241
<i>Man, she's hot, if you like the scrawny.</i>

308
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,533
Just... please...

309
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:56,622
- Did she leave the key for the minibar, man ?
- Don't ask.

310
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:56,841
- Now wait.
- Need some drinks.

311
00:18:58,016 --> 00:19:00,293
I'll get Mr Hamilton to beg.

312
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:05,354
I'm not scrawny.

313
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:07,660
I'm not.

314
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:16,799
Logan.

315
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:20,878
I have a pretty good idea what's
going through your head.

316
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:26,330
I know you blame me for your mother's death.

317
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:28,028
That's okay.

318
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:34,187
Our marriage had some very high highs
and some very low lows.

319
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:40,613
And I know that this hard act you're
putting on is just your way of coping.

320
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,758
But let's make a deal, all right?

321
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:46,124
From now on, we're gonna be team.

322
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:49,272
Our war's over now Logan.

323
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,187
It's what she would have wanted.

324
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:08,827
Logan!

325
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,565
Picture, man, huh?

326
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:16,820
Something real? Here's real for you!

327
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:19,196
Hey, that's a thousand dollar camera!

328
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,154
Logan! Enough!

329
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:21,660
You know what Mom would have wanted!

330
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:24,629
She would have wanted you
to not sleep with all her friends.

331
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,406
She would have wanted you to care
as much about her as your career.

332
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,445
So okay, Dad, let's be honest.

333
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:35,869
Maybe we both wished we'd been better.
But she's only gone because of you.

334
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:43,619
Who's gonna pay for my camera?

335
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:46,875
I'll tell you what.

336
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,162
I'll get on it just as soon as
I've buried my wife.

337
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:52,999
Hey everybody!
Enjoying the show, huh?

338
00:21:08,072 --> 00:21:10,195
They said you had PE this period.

339
00:21:10,196 --> 00:21:12,078
I dropped it for independent study.

340
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:15,959
Independent study of sand?

341
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,070
Civil engineering.

342
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:21,657
Soil erosion modelling in a...urban context.

343
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:25,682
- Cool. I'm...
- Veronica.

344
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:27,628
I remember.

345
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,972
Just helping my dad out with
some background info, you know,

346
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:33,612
see if we can track Yolanda down.

347
00:21:33,613 --> 00:21:34,971
Track her down?

348
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,168
Like she just gone lost or something.

349
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:42,179
Someone's got her.

350
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,812
One of the other low lives Bone
stepped on to get to the top.

351
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:49,024
Whatever happened to Yolanda,
it is his fault.

352
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,971
He is desperate to get her back.

353
00:21:52,017 --> 00:21:53,249
Then where's the police?

354
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,308
He's ashamed of me, you know.

355
00:21:55,309 --> 00:22:00,048
He's been in jail a third of my life
but I'm an embarrassment.

356
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:06,454
State Science Fair winner
two years straight but I'm soft.

357
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:10,630
Is that why you guys stopped being friends?

358
00:22:11,702 --> 00:22:13,547
You figure out our dad was in jail?

359
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:16,409
I didn't even know about that.
She never talked about your dad.

360
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,244
So, you just drifted apart.

361
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:21,788
It's too bad.

362
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:24,144
She really liked you guys.

363
00:22:24,498 --> 00:22:26,001
And I liked her.

364
00:22:28,758 --> 00:22:30,328
Girl is deadly at this.

365
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:31,516
You're letting her win.

366
00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:36,367
Yep, or maybe it's to let her get me
drunk and she'll take advantage of me.

367
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:37,526
Dream on.

368
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:40,417
Careful Logan, Lilly's just sick,
she's not dead.

369
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:43,363
Sick, my ass! She's jerking me around.

370
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:46,048
She look sick to you earlier D?

371
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,886
Hey, leave me out of this.

372
00:22:48,697 --> 00:22:52,809
We need to get you home.
Remember the last time, Homecoming?

373
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:56,153
Gotta go, yo.

374
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,493
Make like a tree, V.

375
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,107
So, Yolanda seems cool.

376
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:06,611
Oh is she? I've got a good eye.

377
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:09,900
Oh, shoot, my purse. I'll be right back.

378
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:12,848
Hey, if you guys are still
conscious, have you seen my...

379
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:19,772
They what?!

380
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,789
It was a one second look.
Let me ask Yolanda about it.

381
00:23:24,376 --> 00:23:26,757
I don't know a Yolanda, do you?

382
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:34,623
We know he has motive he was
at the club and he won't talk to me.

383
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:37,996
He's the best lead we have right now
and we need to know what he knows.

384
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:42,888
Percy, this isn't business,
this is your daughter.

385
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:46,146
Look, I... I know this is my daughter.

386
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:56,918
<i>Villa Marquis. May I help you?</i>

387
00:23:57,328 --> 00:23:58,536
Room 1411.

388
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,478
<i>One moment.</i>

389
00:24:00,366 --> 00:24:02,102
<i>Yo, what up? This is Dime Bag.</i>

390
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:05,724
It's me, Hamilton.

391
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:09,544
Whoa ho ho ho. Heard you got
a little personal problem.

392
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:13,320
Man, look, I...I'm just calling to see
if you know anything about Yolanda.

393
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:14,694
Yolanda, huh?

394
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:18,248
I may know a little something about that.
Why, what's up, what's the deal?

395
00:24:19,237 --> 00:24:22,301
Look, man, whatever you got against me
it's between me and you...

396
00:24:22,302 --> 00:24:26,197
<i>Bones, I just wanna hear you beg
and I'll tell you where she's at.</i>

397
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:30,964
This is like me holding you out of a window.

398
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:32,916
Damn man.

399
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:34,558
<i>Wait, now hold on, Bone.</i>

400
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,315
Saying "Damn, man" ain't begging.

401
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:40,740
Dime Bag.

402
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,043
This is my daughter.

403
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,200
<i>If you could help me get her back...</i>

404
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,363
- I'm begging.
- Beautiful.

405
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:55,906
You almost sound like
a little woman there, Bone.

406
00:24:55,907 --> 00:24:58,127
But you know what? To tell you the truth.

407
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:00,097
<i>I don't know nothin' about Yolanda.</i>

408
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:04,322
<i>I mean I may have seen her at the club
for a minute, now that was it. All right?</i>

409
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:09,661
So why don't you go back to crying
and leave me alone, you lil' bitch.

410
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:17,143
Wait, wait. Just Quiet.

411
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:19,849
<i>You should have heard this fool cryin'.</i>

412
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,487
<i>"Yo, Dime Bag, man, that's my daughter."</i>

413
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:26,971
<i>- Sounds like a little bitch.
- Hey! She is fine though, man.</i>

414
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:29,915
<i>I wouldn't mind having that locked away
somewhere, you know what I'm sayin'.</i>

415
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:33,779
<i>Man, who don't you think is fine.
I would be nice though, huh?</i>

416
00:25:34,347 --> 00:25:37,977
<i>Bones' little Miss Princess locked up
in a closet somewhere,</i>

417
00:25:37,978 --> 00:25:43,200
<i>available whenever, huh, I mean,
if that was possible, right?</i>

418
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:48,691
What you lookin' at boy?

419
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:53,984
Look at all these valet stubs.

420
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,748
Man, I thought being a private eye
was about shooting dudes

421
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:58,586
and making out with sexy widows.

422
00:25:58,587 --> 00:26:01,148
Sexy widows show up later.

423
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:03,162
Hey!

424
00:26:03,768 --> 00:26:04,592
What?

425
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:10,178
Bloom. My dad talked to a
Sam Bloom but...he's in a wheelchair.

426
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,544
Benjamin Bloom.

427
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:17,435
- Close but no...
- Hold the cigar, I'm not done yet.

428
00:26:18,936 --> 00:26:22,762
Sam Bloom Esquire has a son named Benjamin

429
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:25,832
who was at the club the night she disappeared.

430
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:28,101
I'll take that cigar now.

431
00:26:37,587 --> 00:26:39,060
- Thanks for coming out.
- Our pleasure.

432
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:40,484
It means a lot to the family.

433
00:26:42,924 --> 00:26:44,641
- Nice to see you.
- Logan.

434
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:46,976
- It's good to have friends around.
- I'm so sorry.

435
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:51,656
- My father thanks you.
- You're welcome.

436
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:52,671
My mother thanks you.

437
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:55,368
I thank you.

438
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:02,447
I am glad you're here.

439
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:03,839
Thank you.

440
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,923
...Aaron, this is a little awkward but, uh,

441
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:14,924
the studio's been calling non-stop.

442
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,359
They just can't wait any longer.

443
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:22,907
Now I know this is a hard time but we
don't want them looking for somebody else

444
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,673
and, uh, I think I should
just give them a call,

445
00:27:25,674 --> 00:27:29,512
- make the deal, just to make sure.
- Good god, Harvey,

446
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:31,871
- this is my wife's funeral.
- So Harve.

447
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,649
Hey.

448
00:27:35,204 --> 00:27:37,298
Do you think next time we have
one of these funeral things

449
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:39,201
that ICM will let us use the boardroom.

450
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:43,710
You know, so there's no travel,
no trailer size negotiations.

451
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:45,688
I don't know, it's just a thought.

452
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,333
Can I get you anything?

453
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:54,470
Mimosa? Finger sandwich? A tissue?

454
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:10,390
Look, I-I'm sorry, I...
this is an awful time but...

455
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:13,938
- but we don't want the studio
to move on somebody else-
- Harvey.

456
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:18,855
I don't know how many more ways
there are for me to say this but...

457
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:22,237
I don't want you negotiating
this deal for me.

458
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:28,148
In fact, I don't want you negotiation
any deals for me.

459
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:34,554
Are you firing me?

460
00:28:36,937 --> 00:28:38,764
No, I'm not firing you.

461
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:42,058
I'm out of the business. I'm done.

462
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:45,728
<i>Your health is critical!</i>

463
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:50,149
What are you doing?

464
00:28:51,624 --> 00:28:55,612
Trying to get this magic amulet
but it takes concentration
so if you could keep it down.

465
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:56,573
Logan.

466
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,879
It's your mom's funeral reception.

467
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:01,971
- Maybe we should-
- It is not my mom's reception.

468
00:29:02,811 --> 00:29:03,802
It's his.

469
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:07,476
So if you want to eat crab puffs
and discuss today's "Variety",

470
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:09,794
knock yourself out, man.

471
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:15,039
Thanks for coming, it really
means a lot to the family.

472
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:16,841
Logan,

473
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:23,134
I'm your friend, man and
I'm starting to get a little worried.

474
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,941
And now I'm dead.

475
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:32,420
None of this matters, man, don't worry.

476
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:37,743
What are you talking about?

477
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:43,219
You know Mom's dad
fought in the Korean War?

478
00:29:45,092 --> 00:29:46,652
Uh. Well he got this lighter in Seoul.

479
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,166
He held onto it even when he was captured.

480
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:54,499
He and his buddies escaped
and he had it engraved.

481
00:30:01,226 --> 00:30:03,752
And it was always in her purse.

482
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:08,276
But she left it on her dresser
the night she disappeared.

483
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:11,663
It's a sign.

484
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:19,294
You know, man, come on, I mean,
she hated all this, she hated him.

485
00:30:23,881 --> 00:30:27,642
They didn't find a body
because she's not dead.

486
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:33,354
She just escaped.

487
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:41,839
No! As far as I know, Ben doesn't
hang out at hip hop clubs.

488
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,463
Then why was he there?

489
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:46,846
He was at the club the night
Yolanda disappeared.

490
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:50,532
Well, I-I am sure that
there is some explanation.

491
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:53,314
Did you know that he received
a traffic warning last month?

492
00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:56,253
A neighbour had called that someone
was watching the Hamilton house.

493
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,497
How did he feel about the shooting?

494
00:30:59,562 --> 00:31:02,747
Outraged. What else could he be?

495
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,628
- Where is he now, Mr Bloom?
- He's at USC.

496
00:31:07,221 --> 00:31:11,284
But you won't find him there. He and
some friends are in Mexico hiking.

497
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:12,566
Can't be reached.

498
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:15,083
You hear from him, you let me know.

499
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,444
Hey Dad. Did you find Benjamin Bloom?

500
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:25,954
No, but his dad seemed squirrelly
when I asked how he was.

501
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:29,974
- How's your sorority speak.
- Like awesome! Why?

502
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:31,437
Hi, is Ben there?

503
00:31:31,438 --> 00:31:33,117
Oh, is this his roommate?

504
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:39,147
Cool. Um, hi, this is Lisa, I met Ben
last fall at this beach blanket bingo mixer.

505
00:31:40,513 --> 00:31:42,741
Yeah, it's a boring story. But, um,

506
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:48,325
I need to talk to Ben about
something involving crabs

507
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:51,886
and I heard that he was going
to Mexico with some of the guys.

508
00:31:53,574 --> 00:31:54,178
Oh.

509
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,910
Really?

510
00:31:58,012 --> 00:31:59,240
Uh, thanks.

511
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,994
- Crabs?
- No Mexico.

512
00:32:02,995 --> 00:32:06,401
Roommate said he's been acting kinda
weird but he left alone last week.

513
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:09,010
But he said he saw something on his desk.

514
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:11,808
A hotel confirmation number for Vegas.

515
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:17,146
Tom Decintio please.

516
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,239
Tom! Keith Mars. How's Vegas?

517
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:26,110
Yeah, yeah, I got someone here I need to
find and he might have blown your way.

518
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:34,046
Benjamin Bloom, licence 4-P-C-1-0-7-5.

519
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:37,013
Might be in one of the hotels.

520
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,572
Thanks.

521
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:49,110
You've been working overtime on this, kid.

522
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:53,384
You said she's a friend or something?

523
00:32:54,854 --> 00:32:56,475
Hmm, something.

524
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:59,507
What was that word again for almost friend.

525
00:33:02,892 --> 00:33:03,860
Veronica!

526
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:05,606
Veronica.

527
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:08,462
Can you talk to Lilly?

528
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:10,784
I heard what Logan said about that night

529
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:13,338
and it's totally untrue.
I didn't do anything.

530
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:14,865
I saw it, Yolanda.

531
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:19,096
We were just talking, you know,
and he just kissed me.

532
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:21,920
The story, I threw myself at him?

533
00:33:22,494 --> 00:33:23,872
I'd never do that.

534
00:33:24,494 --> 00:33:27,462
Please, make her understand.

535
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:29,348
I don't know, sometimes she's really-

536
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:33,739
Veronica! Come on. San Diego's waiting.

537
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,992
In or out, Veronica? In or out?

538
00:33:37,758 --> 00:33:40,534
I swear, he kissed me.

539
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:42,620
It didn't go anywhere.

540
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:45,978
I don't want to blow it here.

541
00:33:51,424 --> 00:33:53,374
You should have known better.

542
00:33:53,877 --> 00:33:58,544
Do I tell my dad that his fiercely non-
conformist daughter caved to peer pressure

543
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:01,843
and left a totally cool person
on her own in a new school?

544
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,932
Hey, we need to talk.

545
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,451
It came an hour ago.

546
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,746
They want a half million if I am ever
to see Yolanda alive again.

547
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:17,695
I know this is hard to believe but the
note at this point is very good news.

548
00:34:19,651 --> 00:34:20,584
This is strange.

549
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:22,171
Strange how?

550
00:34:22,747 --> 00:34:26,604
Well usually you get that ransom demand
and they give you the details of the drop

551
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:29,997
at the last minute so you can't
stake it out but this guy,

552
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:31,866
he gave it all. The time, the place...

553
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:34,951
That's 'cause he's stupid, man.
Look at the top.

554
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,677
"If you want little Miss Princess

555
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:38,966
- back home..."
- Yeah, that's what we heard on the bug.

556
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:40,931
"Little Miss Princess."

557
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:42,717
It's Dime Bag.

558
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:45,888
Hey, if I don't get my daughter back,

559
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,512
somebody's gonna die.

560
00:34:58,136 --> 00:34:59,397
That the money?

561
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:05,732
Five hundred plus the GPS tracker
and the dye pack you put in here.

562
00:35:06,997 --> 00:35:08,833
Bastards won't even make it a block.

563
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:10,820
Look, Mr Hamilton, I know we talked about this

564
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:12,471
but I think we should involve the police.

565
00:35:12,472 --> 00:35:14,873
And I've already told you
I have no use for the police.

566
00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:18,630
I have my justice right here.

567
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:23,210
Look. This is not the way to deal with this.

568
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:25,857
If you care about your daughter,
you'll go to the cops.

569
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:28,569
Hey. If the cops were so great,
why aren't you still one, huh?

570
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,734
Mr Hamilton. I can't be party to this.

571
00:35:30,735 --> 00:35:32,830
Then you've done you're bit.

572
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:35,245
Cheque's in the mail.

573
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:37,077
Load it up. Let's roll.

574
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:44,019
I thought that you were fired.
Why are we even here?

575
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,152
Trying to save the girl.

576
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:51,677
This is either the dumbest kidnapper
ever or the smartest.

577
00:35:53,512 --> 00:35:56,814
I mean, he gives the drop location in
advance and it's the worst spot possible.

578
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:00,906
There's no escape routes.
It's totally open to surveillance.

579
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:03,435
I mean, getting away with
the money will be impossible.

580
00:36:16,603 --> 00:36:19,078
Maybe not totally impossible.

581
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:26,736
Ah, Veronica... this is really
grasping at straws.

582
00:36:26,737 --> 00:36:29,235
Make yourself useful.
Get those things in a row.

583
00:36:33,011 --> 00:36:36,335
- Any signal yet?
- Yeah, take this right.

584
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,830
Yeah.

585
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:51,764
<i>Do you see the taxi up the street?</i>

586
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:57,544
Yeah, I see it. I got the money.

587
00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:01,975
<i>Go to the trash can on the corner.
You'll find a plastic football.</i>

588
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:06,318
I got it.

589
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:09,073
<i>You can keep your cash. Instead put
that quarter million dollar ring</i>

590
00:37:09,074 --> 00:37:12,524
<i>you like to wave at people inside the
football and throw it down the storm drain.</i>

591
00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:17,469
<i>I'm watching you. The cab won't stop
unless you've done this. Do it now.</i>

592
00:37:36,803 --> 00:37:39,721
All right, it's done.
Now what?

593
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,600
Hello!

594
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:45,250
Hello!

595
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:50,852
It's the car. Get that car.

596
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,414
Where is she?

597
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,340
Damn!

598
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,063
Hey, Bryce.

599
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:23,704
How'd you guys find me?

600
00:38:25,015 --> 00:38:28,901
Whoever did this was either
really dumb or really smart.

601
00:38:29,803 --> 00:38:31,324
You're really smart.

602
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,551
Yeah, so are you.

603
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:40,182
- So she was never kidnapped?
- No. She just ran off.

604
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:41,344
How do you know?

605
00:38:41,868 --> 00:38:44,672
She always thinks I'm not
around but I hear things.

606
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:46,962
Eavesdropping again, huh?

607
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:50,193
She was on the phone talking about
meeting someone at the club,

608
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,037
running off forever.

609
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,307
I rode in the trunk when
she left Gabrielle's for LA.

610
00:38:56,795 --> 00:39:01,285
Drove the car back, made it seem like
she'd been abducted and that was that.

611
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:03,563
God, Bryce, why?

612
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,135
Trust me. You would not understand.

613
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:08,427
But Yolanda, is she okay?

614
00:39:08,428 --> 00:39:09,909
As far as I know.

615
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,124
I think she tried to get my dad's attention.

616
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,894
I may have stolen some of her thunder.

617
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:16,185
So she's okay.

618
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:19,890
No kidding.

619
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,050
Thanks Tom.

620
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:40,569
Bryce! Where have you been?

621
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,734
Mrs Hamilton, Mr Hamilton, I think
there's something Bryce wants to tell you.

622
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:48,624
You lost your ring.

623
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,944
Your daughter wasn't kidnapped.
She's just run off.

624
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:57,017
Bryce here's the one who wrote the note.

625
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:00,669
Well, you can be mad, Dad.

626
00:40:01,694 --> 00:40:03,221
But you can't call me soft.

627
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:12,278
No. I guess I can't.

628
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,588
Bryce, my god, where's Yolanda?

629
00:40:15,432 --> 00:40:16,628
See for yourself.

630
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,289
She can see you. The pinhole at
the top of the screen is a camera.

631
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:27,410
<i>Ma? Dad.</i>

632
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,504
<i>Here's the good news.</i>

633
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,291
<i>I'm fine.</i>

634
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:33,626
<i> And I'm married now.</i>

635
00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:34,875
What?

636
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:37,692
<i>I'm Mrs Benjamin Bloom.</i>

637
00:40:38,297 --> 00:40:40,048
<i>Which is why I'm telling you from here</i>

638
00:40:40,049 --> 00:40:45,046
<i>because until you guys and the Blooms
just... get over yourselves and make up,</i>

639
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,055
<i>we're not coming back.</i>

640
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:49,828
Okay, look here baby girl.

641
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:53,586
How many times do I have to tell ya
that I didn't order that drive-by.

642
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:56,764
<i>You let everyone believe you
ordered it because it gave you cred.</i>

643
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:59,837
<i>Never mind it just turned me
and Bryce into gangster's kids.</i>

644
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,005
<i>Give us your blessing.</i>

645
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:06,508
<i>And, um, we'll come home.</i>

646
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:08,351
<i>After the honeymoon.</i>

647
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:23,026
<i>All right then, be like that.</i>

648
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:38,984
<i>Veronica? Is that you?
How did you...</i>

649
00:41:38,985 --> 00:41:42,379
I just wanted to say
congratulations on the marriage

650
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:44,688
and I'm sorry.

651
00:41:45,384 --> 00:41:46,983
I should have been a better friend.

652
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:51,067
<i>Veronica, if I had been in your position,
I would have done the same thing.</i>

653
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:02,335
Logan, what are you doing here?

654
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,226
I want you to find my mother.

655
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,442
