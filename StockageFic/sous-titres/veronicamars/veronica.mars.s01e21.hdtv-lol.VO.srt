1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,576
Previously on Veronica Mars…

2
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:04,153
I need to report a crime.

3
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:06,820
Is there anyone in particular you'd like me to arrest

4
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:10,276
or should I just round up the sons of the most important families in town?

5
00:00:10,322 --> 00:00:12,124
You know what this is? A bug.

6
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:13,773
I found it in that houseplant.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,602
You know who delivered it? Your son.

8
00:00:15,663 --> 00:00:17,548
Fifty grand? Not bad.

9
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,134
Money for nothing.

10
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:20,958
It might not be as easy as you think.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,290
Duncan Kane? I think I'll be able to track him down.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,290
I loved Lilly and Lilly loved guys.

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,660
It's okay. I don't have to feel guilty anymore.

14
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:29,804
Feel guilty about what?

15
00:00:32,544 --> 00:00:34,290
What are we doing?

16
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:37,388
Who gave you the rohypnol the night of Shelly Pomeroy's party.

17
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:38,806
It was Logan Echolls.

18
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:19,756
Buenos dias

19
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:23,953
I know.

20
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:28,593
Of all the countries under military dictatorship in all the world.

21
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:31,814
So did they give you the jet to take me back home?

22
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:33,815
Or am I supposed to click my heels?

23
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:36,315
It's a hell of a job you did with the fake passport, by the way.

24
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,519
Do you think I killed Lilly?

25
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:41,684
I don't know who killed your sister, Duncan.

26
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,911
I only know it wasn't Abel Koontz.

27
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:47,635
I know it wasn't me.

28
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:50,484
Randy just finished shaping it for me.

29
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:54,075
Double concave bottom with the sweetest little rocker through the tail.

30
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,037
Ooh and you dinged it your first time out?

31
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:56,734
What?

32
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,025
Dude, so not laughing. This is my child.

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,558
Okay, dude, the thought of you breeding… ahh.

34
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:05,027
Mazel tov.

35
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:06,691
Hey, Veronica.

36
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:08,652
Hey, will you stop for two seconds?

37
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,796
You see when they run away like that, it's kind of a hint they're not interested.

38
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:16,013
Look, you do not want to start with me today, paco.

39
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:18,508
Are you sure? It was in my day planner under goals.

40
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:19,701
How is this your business?

41
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:21,345
Well I'm just looking out for Veronica.

42
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,365
So if you think you're going to lay a hand on her the way you did Lilly...

43
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:26,271
Don't you even say her name.

44
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,691
Actually, she kind of liked it when I said her name.

45
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:32,563
You think she had any real interest in you?

46
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,094
You're a pork rind.

47
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:37,238
You're what people grab when they're stoned and just want garbage.

48
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:38,502
What makes it worse?

49
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:40,289
Thinking she had feelings for me,

50
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,737
or that she was using me for sex?

51
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:44,983
You stay away from Veronica.

52
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,083
I'm not the one she's running away from.

53
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:48,055
Gentlemen...

54
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:51,001
Thanks.

55
00:02:58,142 --> 00:02:59,128
What is it, buddy?

56
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:01,055
Hey, what is it?

57
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:13,046
I'm not leaving.

58
00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:20,670
It's kind of a bad time.

59
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:22,396
Okay.

60
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,290
So I should come back when, never?

61
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,771
That work for you?

62
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:29,436
What did I do, Veronica?

63
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:33,517
Can you just tell me so that I can apologise or explain?!

64
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:34,751
Explain. Okay.

65
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:41,284
Explain to me why you were the one with GHB the night of Shelly Pomeroy's party

66
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:43,445
when someone drugged and raped me.

67
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:45,509
Explanation?

68
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,085
Apology?

69
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,115
You were raped?

70
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,332
Okay, don't! Seriously!

71
00:03:54,162 --> 00:03:55,242
What happened to you?

72
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:56,810
You tell me.

73
00:03:58,007 --> 00:03:59,538
Wait. Wait a second, you think-

74
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,441
I was told you were the one with the drugs.

75
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:05,232
Yeah. I got some Liquid X when I was in Tijuana with Luke and Sean.

76
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:06,568
We were just gonna have some fun.

77
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,087
Fun? Like sex with unconscious people fun?

78
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:11,478
No, fun like go to a rave fun.

79
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:14,447
Oh. Okay. You've convinced me. Bygones.

80
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:15,906
What can I do?

81
00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:20,362
What can I do to make it better?

82
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:23,966
I'm going to find out who did this to me and I'm going to make them pay.

83
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:25,692
Even if it was you.

84
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:32,157
Sorry. I have to go throw up now.

85
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:08,702
As a rule, people that hate you aren't that helpful.

86
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:11,121
There were about a hundred people at Shelly's party.

87
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:14,618
Ninety-eight of them would walk over my corpse for free gum.

88
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,865
My 09er resources are limited

89
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:19,247
but I do have a few people I can count on.

90
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:21,868
Um, can we skip English today?

91
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,653
I have some sort of Hemingway related narcolepsy.

92
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:28,094
You start talking about "The Sun Also Rises" and I start falling asleep.

93
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:31,314
Don't blame Papa, blame Mrs Murphy's monotone.

94
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:36,337
Hey, you were at Shelly Pomroy's end of the year party, right?

95
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:40,223
Uh, yeah, yeah for a little while.

96
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:41,288
Did you see me there?

97
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,060
Why?

98
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:47,233
I just want to know, my memories a little fuzzy about that night.

99
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:48,866
Yep, maybe that's a good thing.

100
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,037
So  you did see me.

101
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:52,152
For like a second.

102
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,231
I was with Cole and we were just leaving.

103
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:57,176
I didn't even say goodbye to Shelly.

104
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,148
You talk to her like fifty times a day, come on.

105
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,991
Unless you want to stick around for some body shots.

106
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,287
Someone should help her.

107
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:13,442
Come on, let's go. I'm not ending the night with Veronica Mars puking in my car.

108
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:14,912
We can't leave her like that.

109
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:19,106
Look, someone's got her.

110
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:22,982
Hey,  dude, you can't be the cavalry and the martyr...

111
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,216
You don't know who helped me?

112
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:32,586
No, so that's your big high school related embarrassing moment.

113
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,060
Everyone's got one, right?

114
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:37,313
You got to let it go.

115
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:39,776
You'll make yourself crazy.

116
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:49,605
Watch your step sir.

117
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:54,576
Mr Mars,

118
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,157
well done.

119
00:06:57,503 --> 00:06:58,207
Thanks.

120
00:06:58,304 --> 00:06:59,046
Well done.

121
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:01,919
Maybe your daughter has a future in travel planning.

122
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:06,768
And if she gets a discount and I travel the world, I'll be sure to send you a postcard.

123
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,923
You can hang it in your cell.

124
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,678
Keith, thank you.

125
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:16,670
I don't know what we would have done.

126
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:18,251
I'm happy everything worked out.

127
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,242
I know you're anxious to get home so just stop by the office

128
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:23,034
when it's convenient and we'll finish up.

129
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,023
Finish up?

130
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:25,507
I'm referring to the reward.

131
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,403
You might want to speak to your daughter about that.

132
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,584
Veronica and I had an arrangement.

133
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:33,310
You just met her end of the bargain.

134
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:42,592
You have no idea what the past few weeks have been like.

135
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,649
Next time you run away, take your medication with you.

136
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:58,700
Empty stomach.

137
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:05,740
Remember when I saved you from drug dealers and I said I may call upon you for a favour someday.

138
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:07,945
You didn't say that.

139
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:09,058
It was implied.

140
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,358
Okay, what can I do you for.

141
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:12,247
Nice.

142
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:17,644
Uh, I heard you went to TJ with Sean and Logan and scored some GHB.

143
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:23,441
Wow, that was like, ah, that was like a year ago. I don't have any now.

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,870
I was gonna spike your juice box and have my way with you.

145
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
What'd you do with it?

146
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,400
Nothing.

147
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,344
Honestly, I didn't do anything, I gave it away.

148
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:33,593
Who'd you give it to?

149
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,469
Um, Dick Casablancas.

150
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:47,740
Look at that. Beaver's getting all the lovin', Dick's flapping out in the breeze.

151
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,884
Please, you have like the hottest girlfriend ever.

152
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:51,528
Much like fake boobs, you know.

153
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,150
Great to look at but they don't do as much as you'd like them to.

154
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:55,712
Wait'll you get a couple of drinks in her.

155
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,534
She's on fricking Atkins.

156
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,382
Did you guys get some stuff in TJ?

157
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:02,567
I'm saving it for a special occasion.

158
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:04,943
And this isn't it.

159
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,021
Who invited Veronica Mars? Huh?

160
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:12,977
Why do you let this stuff get to you?

161
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:15,599
Look at you, you're all tense.

162
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,962
Can you not be all over me for five seconds?

163
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:25,782
All right.

164
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:29,616
So Dick drugged Madison?

165
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:33,364
Well, he-he asked for two doses and I, so I just,

166
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,738
I figured he was gonna take one and ask her to take the other one but, um,

167
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:39,232
I'm pretty sure she didn't.

168
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,204
How do you know that?

169
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:41,854
You're not gonna like this part.

170
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,666
Stringy haired white trash.

171
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,989
As I understand it, GHB is supposed to make you nicer.

172
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:56,723
Why would Madison do that?

173
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:57,875
Uh, I don't know.

174
00:09:58,357 --> 00:10:00,301
'Cause she's a horrible human being?

175
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:04,663
You can keep asking, but you're not the fairest, trust me.

176
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:06,992
I can tell you who the pastiest is.

177
00:10:07,136 --> 00:10:10,414
What's the deal, can't buy bronzer with food stamps?

178
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:15,017
You wrote slut on my car last year at Shelly's party. Why?

179
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:20,782
Because whore had too many letters.

180
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:26,110
I have never done anything to you, up 'til now.

181
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:27,684
Whatever, Veronica.

182
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:28,810
Oh, like what?

183
00:10:28,882 --> 00:10:31,820
How 'bout making out with my boyfriend in front of an entire party.

184
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:35,292
I guess I shouldn't take that personally, though, huh?

185
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:37,196
You pretty much made out with everyone.

186
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:38,411
I don't believe you.

187
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:39,470
Are you kidding?

188
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:41,974
What's up Dick? How's it going?

189
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,827
…anybody else…

190
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:47,206
…When I think about you I touch myself.

191
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,295
You have the best hair.

192
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:50,719
You like that, huh?

193
00:10:57,753 --> 00:10:58,982
Come on, that's not cool.

194
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,266
You think that's cool though don't you, Case?

195
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,917
I made out with Dick and Casey?

196
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,712
Please. You made out with the garage door.

197
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:12,918
And don't even start with the "I was so wasted".

198
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,910
I wasn't drunk, I was drugged.

199
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,070
Someone put GHB in my drink.

200
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:20,256
Y eah.

201
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:24,879
She could have gotten me fired, Keith. How is that not a big deal to you.

202
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:25,766
I didn't say it wasn't.

203
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:28,571
She put a listening device in a plant,

204
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:31,223
had my son deliver it to my place of business!

205
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,487
And she has her reasons.

206
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:34,686
Her reasons? She's seventeen!

207
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:36,461
She's not your average seventeen year-old.

208
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:39,493
Well, how can she be when you treat her like she forty.

209
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:43,839
Mrs Fennel. I-I'm so sorry but Clarence Wiedman knew that I would-

210
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:45,113
- Veronica. 
- Just let me explain.

211
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:47,060
- No, you just give us a minute. 
- Dad, if I could just explain.

212
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:48,754
Veronica, go to your room, now.

213
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,321
Fine.

214
00:11:55,704 --> 00:11:57,049
But he bugged me first.

215
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:04,518
He bugged her first?

216
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:18,021
Duncan's okay, he's back home.

217
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:21,568
His parents are gonna keep him home a couple of days, let him rest.

218
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:23,391
I'm so sorry, Dad.

219
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:24,390
Stop, it's okay.

220
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,620
It's my fault.

221
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:29,857
I'm the one who gave Wallace a bugged plant.

222
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:34,881
Veronica. Did you make some kind of deal with Celeste Kane that I don't know about?

223
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:39,775
I… told her I'd look for Duncan if she released Weevil.

224
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:41,568
Well, she said she wouldn't pay the reward.

225
00:12:41,655 --> 00:12:43,149
She said that we're even now.

226
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,897
It's ridiculous of course, they'll pay. She's just enjoying the moment.

227
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,163
She's a witch.

228
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:49,272
Veronica.

229
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:51,521
What if you started looking for another job?

230
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,076
Selling clothes or something.

231
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:54,710
What?

232
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:56,574
I just can't help think that…

233
00:12:57,301 --> 00:12:59,437
your life would be better if you weren't working for me.

234
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:01,904
Are you kidding me?

235
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:05,289
You're the best father in the world.

236
00:13:06,514 --> 00:13:07,991
I mean, come on, look at me.

237
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:09,871
I'm healthy, happy,

238
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:11,878
good grades,

239
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:13,660
all my own teeth,

240
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,261
fancy shoes.

241
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:22,513
I never would have gotten through this past year if it wasn't for you.

242
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,644
If it wasn't for me you wouldn't have to.

243
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:36,353
Hey, stranger.

244
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:38,415
What's up Veronica?

245
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:42,771
Kind of an awkward question. Do you remember Shelly's end of the year party?

246
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:44,318
I know it was a while ago.

247
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:47,933
Not really. Look, I've gotta get some stuff done before class. See you around, okay.

248
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,660
Oh yeah. I was just wondering how you've been, you know, without your grandmother.

249
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,662
I've been good.

250
00:13:58,398 --> 00:13:59,977
Got my priorities in check.

251
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:04,308
No more throwing my family's money at strangers so I can eat S'Mores and listen to bad folk music.

252
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:06,416
What was the awkward question?

253
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,388
Did I hit on you at Shelly's party?

254
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:09,807
No.

255
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,502
Did it get ugly at Shelly's?

256
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:12,570
Oh, yeah.

257
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,736
I don't want anybody else.

258
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,140
When I think about you, I touch myself.

259
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:26,144
You like grabbing hair, huh?

260
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:28,628
That's nice, huh.

261
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,769
Why don't you go see Uncle Casey.

262
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:42,759
Oh, no thanks. I like mine to be able to stand on their own power.

263
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:45,564
Well, I'm gonna go drink some bleach now.

264
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,980
You know, just a thought. If you don't remember much about that party,

265
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:50,561
maybe you should leave it that way.

266
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,506
Can I guess that means you saw something else?

267
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:56,240
I have to go home.

268
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,135
You are home.

269
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:01,111
See there's your pool and your hot tub and your big mansion.

270
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:04,611
And here's a hot foreign exchange student who's been living with your family.

271
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:08,124
Now, I know you've had your eye on her

272
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:11,672
and that's okay, it's perfectly natural.

273
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,168
Some of the guys thought it would be cool to see you make out with Shelly.

274
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:18,103
They were feeding me shots?

275
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:20,847
Guess they were afraid you were sobering up.

276
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:40,205
Ugh. This is why I need to keep my walkie-talkies in my car. Muck.

277
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:41,798
Really? The dirt?

278
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:45,255
See, I find I hardly need my walkie-talkies at school at all.

279
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:46,385
But that's me.

280
00:15:47,051 --> 00:15:50,477
Wallace. I'm so sorry I had you bug Kane Software.

281
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:54,179
I honestly thought no one would find out and if I knew that your mom was gonna get in trouble-

282
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:56,365
Stop! I'm not stupid.

283
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,331
I know I wasn't just delivering a plant.

284
00:15:58,873 --> 00:15:59,774
I could've said no.

285
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:06,845
You know, I do these things for you and I never ask you why.

286
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:07,895
I know.

287
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,871
You know why?

288
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:12,252
Because I know you would never tell me.

289
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:13,722
I'd do the same for you.

290
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,402
Logan Echolls used one of the absence slips I took for you.

291
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,388
You checked the absence slips?

292
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,949
You, I do favours for.

293
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:24,100
My friends, I put my butt on the line for.

294
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:26,071
That guy doesn't even know my name.

295
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:27,689
You wanna tell me why I'm helping him out?

296
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:28,734
You're not.

297
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:29,957
You sure about that?

298
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:34,632
I needed him for something with his mother's case.

299
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,576
I-it was just loose ends and stuff. That's it.

300
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:41,591
T hanks.

301
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:44,775
Now that I have all the details, I don't feel like such a chump.

302
00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:57,657
What?

303
00:16:58,353 --> 00:17:01,154
I'm just thinking of all the ways I can destroy you.

304
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:03,925
Well you sitting there grinning is kind of torturous.

305
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,528
So Shelly Pomroy and I were thinking of getting together later

306
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,868
for a little girl-on-girl, you wanna come with?

307
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:12,213
Wow.

308
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:16,514
You know, when you're about to soil yourself, you get a little twitch right in your eye.

309
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:18,333
I have no idea what you're talking about.

310
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:19,321
Sure you do.

311
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:22,874
And unless you want me to tell one of my favourite local deputies

312
00:17:22,936 --> 00:17:25,516
that you were the one with GHB the night of Shelly's party,

313
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,154
I know you were feeding me drinks.

314
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:29,033
Look, I wasn't feeding you drinks. It was Dick.

315
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,640
He's the one that you should be talking to.

316
00:17:35,302 --> 00:17:36,077
Dick.

317
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:38,183
What?

318
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,687
You're gonna hurt her or something, man.

319
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:41,105
Oh, I'd hurt her.

320
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,410
You, she might not even notice.

321
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:45,678
It-this is-this is so not even funny.

322
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,631
What's the problem?

323
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:47,844
Like you're-like you're serious?

324
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:50,900
I mean this is you trying to get me to do something stupid that you can laugh at me.

325
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,094
She's actually kinda hot.

326
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:53,788
When she's quiet.

327
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:55,621
Perfectly cute piece of ass.

328
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,640
Ready and willing.

329
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,279
She's not willing, Dick, she's unconscious.

330
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,558
It's kinda the best you're gonna do, bro'.

331
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,733
You're not real big with the sober chicks.

332
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:07,509
Fine, just go, all right?

333
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:08,942
That's my boy.

334
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:11,565
Make sure you suit up.

335
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:14,090
You don't know where she's been.

336
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,512
Your issues with Dick and Beaver, not me.

337
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:27,124
They were horrible to you.

338
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,812
Well, I'm just sorry you had to witness it.

339
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:31,952
That must have been awful for you.

340
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:40,104
Hiya, Dick. How's it going?

341
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:41,548
What the hell are you doing?

342
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,638
Um, trying to get your attention.

343
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:47,134
Got a couple questions for ya.

344
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,161
You're frickin' nuts, you know that?

345
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,852
Insulting me right now seems like a good plan, how?

346
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:54,332
What do you want?

347
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,406
Answers, and quickly.

348
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,670
Did you give me GHB the night of Shelly's party?

349
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,143
What? No. I'm not even the one who had it.

350
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:05,444
I mean, I got some, but I didn't give any to you. I swear on my life.

351
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:08,137
See, when you say that, it makes me hope you're lying.

352
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:10,706
I know you brought me into the guest bedroom for Beaver.

353
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,530
More like, I found you in the guest bedroom.

354
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:16,523
Beaver, don't go, you said you were gonna stay here with me.

355
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:18,868
Yeah, well, I'm here, I'm staying… Veronica, I'm here…

356
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:21,740
Well why don't you come back here? It's an awfully big bed.

357
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:24,721
Are you freaking kidding me?

358
00:19:25,662 --> 00:19:27,224
How 'bout reality, Dick.

359
00:19:27,326 --> 00:19:29,573
What? I'm just telling you what I saw.

360
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:31,146
I didn't drug you.

361
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,576
Don't go blaming me because you got all wasted and slutty.

362
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:43,798
Beaver.

363
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:46,891
Damn, you don't look happy to see me.

364
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,066
How's it going, Veronica?

365
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,007
Really well!

366
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:54,313
I just found out that the dream I had where I was locked

367
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:56,977
all alone in a bedroom with you was reality.

368
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:59,634
Care to share some details, lover?

369
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:01,164
Nothing happened.

370
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,710
Actually, something did happen.

371
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,215
And I might not remember the details, but I sure as hell remember the morning after.

372
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:10,652
Look, I swear to god, I didn't touch you, Veronica.

373
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,813
Okay, I mean, Dick, he was,

374
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:15,949
he was all on me to and there was, there was this girl, this,

375
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:18,271
this freshman, her name's Cindy and she's kind of…

376
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:24,104
well, she's easy, you know and me and her, we were, we were supposed to…

377
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:28,373
I don't know, Dick, Dick, he set something up okay and then,

378
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,241
and then she was all over Logan and then she left early with him.

379
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:35,812
Yeah, it sucks to be you. And?

380
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:39,432
And then Dick, he brought me to the guest room with you.

381
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:43,748
I just wanted him to leave me alone.

382
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,802
You need me to get you started? 

383
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,452
Hey, I can draw you a diagram.

384
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:52,873
That's cool. You just, you just go, all right? I, I got it.

385
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:53,901
That's my boy.

386
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:55,033
Yeah.

387
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,451
Make sure you suit up.

388
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:58,474
You don't know where she's been.

389
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:08,166
Veronica, you okay?

390
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:19,527
It was my big night.

391
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,374
I don't know, I supposed to lose my virginity, instead I…

392
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:24,591
hurl on Carrie Bishop's shoes.

393
00:21:26,863 --> 00:21:27,842
Nothing happened.

394
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:31,205
Really, I mean, I-I swear on my life

395
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:34,611
that the last time that I saw you, you were passed out on that bed.

396
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:37,785
Well, hey.

397
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:40,268
Thanks for leaving me there.

398
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,195
The whole ritual cleaning thing is textbook for a reason.

399
00:21:50,314 --> 00:21:52,341
For a couple of minutes, you're in control

400
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:54,154
and everything's the way it should be,

401
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,762
at least on the surface.

402
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:58,993
You see another special on dust mites?

403
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,803
They're disgusting, they're everywhere, and they must be destroyed.

404
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:03,554
I have any messages, or did you boil them?

405
00:22:03,631 --> 00:22:04,542
Just a fax.

406
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,522
Apparently that package you've been waiting for is in Vegas.

407
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:10,830
Is it a white Bengal tiger?

408
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:16,329
No, it's the entertainment lawyer I've been tracking for the past year.

409
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:20,999
My source in Vegas spotted him. I'm gonna have to leave as soon as possible.

410
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:23,399
Maybe you want to stay with a friend or something?

411
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,045
And miss an opportunity to have the apartment to myself

412
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:29,836
so that I can raid the liquor cabinet and watch Skinemax?

413
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:32,907
No, wait, I'm a girl.

414
00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:35,677
I'm gonna do my homework, secure all the locks,

415
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:39,641
brush, floss, and crawl into bed with an overly protective pit bull.

416
00:22:40,143 --> 00:22:41,576
You don't have to worry about me.

417
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:49,414
Ah! Especially for you tonight, I am making what will be known

418
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:53,638
from now on as "Aaron's Extra Special Crab Cakes." Ha ha!

419
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:57,611
I'm sure I'll thoroughly enjoy them.

420
00:22:58,605 --> 00:23:01,687
Right up until my oesophagus closes up, cuts off my air supply,

421
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,808
and I shuffle off this mortal coil.

422
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,790
Perhaps my last words will be "Great crab, Papa."

423
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:11,763
I'm allergic to shellfish.

424
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:14,888
Oh. Of course. I forgot.

425
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:15,682
You didn't forget.

426
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:17,391
You never knew.

427
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,902
I did, I-I-I just got you confused with Trina, that's all.

428
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:22,121
I'm the one allergic to shellfish.

429
00:23:22,187 --> 00:23:23,877
Trina's the one allergic to work.

430
00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:25,343
You know,

431
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:31,183
somehow you got it in your head that I don't know a thing about you.

432
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,432
Well, I got news for you: I'm your father.

433
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:35,116
I raised you. I know plenty.

434
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:38,203
Well, then, round one of "How well do you know your son?"

435
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:40,860
When is my birthday?

436
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:44,967
February.

437
00:23:45,274 --> 00:23:47,584
Wow. Well, you got a vowel right.

438
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,289
You know, I have been pretty tolerant of your wiseass remarks but you are pushing it.

439
00:23:57,448 --> 00:23:59,110
Look, does it matter…

440
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:03,020
that I'm trying? I mean, does that count for anything at all?

441
00:24:03,881 --> 00:24:07,766
Yeah, you're accumulating points. You've almost won the wet vac.

442
00:24:07,972 --> 00:24:09,892
I'm committed to this family, Logan.

443
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:12,283
I'm committed to you.

444
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:15,181
You'll see that.

445
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,091
Well, you've got limited time 'cause let's face it,

446
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:23,085
my eighteenth birthday, whenever that is,

447
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,142
Mom's inheritance comes through and it's

448
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,975
bon voyage.

449
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,220
What can I get for you?

450
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,498
I'll have a hot chocolate, crème brulee

451
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:41,702
and some answers if you can give me about two minutes.

452
00:24:42,466 --> 00:24:43,786
I'm kind of in the weeds.

453
00:24:44,002 --> 00:24:46,654
Here's the thing. Do you remember Shelly's party last year?

454
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:47,663
Yeah.

455
00:24:47,848 --> 00:24:48,599
I don't.

456
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:51,717
At least, not between passing out in the back yard

457
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:54,016
and waking up the next morning in the guest room.

458
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,758
I think you probably saw me.

459
00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:57,499
I saw you.

460
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,155
Oh, god.

461
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,088
Shut the door next time.

462
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:21,716
Welcome back.

463
00:25:22,914 --> 00:25:26,008
So Carrie Bishop said that you and I were in bed together

464
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,389
the night of Shelly Pomroy's party last year.

465
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:30,040
Care to elaborate?

466
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:32,682
What? What are you talking about?

467
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,081
I wanna know what happened.

468
00:25:34,178 --> 00:25:35,816
Do you know how wasted I was at Shelly' party?

469
00:25:35,898 --> 00:25:38,335
I-I barely even remember it. The whole night's a blur.

470
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:40,122
That's kind of a thing with you, huh?

471
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:44,899
Carrie said she walked into the guest bedroom and you were naked and on top of me.

472
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:46,047
I can't believe this.

473
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:47,736
You were the one that raped me.

474
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:48,745
I raped you!

475
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:53,696
So… I'm a murderer and a rapist now.

476
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:58,550
What are you doing?

477
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:01,642
Why are you acting like this? Why are you acting like you weren't there?

478
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:03,291
What?

479
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:04,699
You were there too, you know.

480
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,126
I-I thought we had some unspoken rule,

481
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:09,584
like we're never gonna talk about it but now I raped you.

482
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,782
Hmm, you're here.

483
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:32,588
Hi, baby.

484
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:35,091
Miss you.

485
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:47,007
You don't remember.

486
00:26:49,428 --> 00:26:50,999
It's kind of a bad feeling, huh.

487
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:52,552
Then why did you leave me there?

488
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:56,744
If it was so tender, and loving, why did I wake up by myself searching for my underwear?

489
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,038
Because I had to get out of there!

490
00:26:58,112 --> 00:26:58,829
You had to?

491
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:02,264
Yes! I woke up, I, I saw you there, I realized what I did...

492
00:27:02,592 --> 00:27:04,747
What did you realize was so bad? What did you do?

493
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:05,683
I slept with you!

494
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:08,013
- But it was consensual, right? 
- Yes.

495
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:09,821
Then what about that is so wrong?

496
00:27:09,892 --> 00:27:12,386
Because you're my sister, and I knew it!

497
00:27:12,478 --> 00:27:15,346
Even after my mother told me, I tried to just cut you out of my life.

498
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:19,913
I loved you! I tried not to, I tried not to, but it won't go away!

499
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,019
I was about to call the police on you, stalker.

500
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:03,186
This is so not an "I told you so," but do you see why I kinda keep things to myself?

501
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:09,397
I think I can go home now.

502
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:14,000
Maybe you should just stay here.

503
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:15,056
No, I feel better.

504
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:18,685
Of course, you feel worse.

505
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:20,084
No, I don't care about me.

506
00:28:20,427 --> 00:28:22,059
I just wish I could do something.

507
00:28:23,396 --> 00:28:24,405
Or say something.

508
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:25,926
You don't have to say anything.

509
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:29,135
That's kind of the good part.

510
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:38,121
You say I never tell you anything when I ask for favours?

511
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,904
Yeah. You so don't need to worry about that right now.

512
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:45,315
I'm not worried.

513
00:28:46,974 --> 00:28:48,730
Here's everything there is to know.

514
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,169
Don't tell me Wallace still has you cutting his crusts off?

515
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:05,775
How are you, Veronica.

516
00:29:05,862 --> 00:29:06,655
Sorry.

517
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,903
I'm really hoping you won't hold my dad responsible for my boneheadedness.

518
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:15,406
He's the best guy ever, you see that, right?

519
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,558
You guys are really good together.

520
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:20,137
I know.

521
00:29:21,402 --> 00:29:22,931
You make him so happy.

522
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:26,270
I'm afraid I didn't make him too happy before he left for Vegas.

523
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,677
I think I might have ruined things.

524
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:31,667
Trust me; I know how he feels about you.

525
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,484
He's not going anywhere.

526
00:29:36,904 --> 00:29:39,189
Hello, who am I talking to?

527
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:40,027
Hi.

528
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,928
Is this Cheyenne?

529
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:43,432
You know it, baby.

530
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:46,469
I'd like to set up an, um, an appointment.

531
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:50,094
I'm so sorry. I know now it wasn't you

532
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,815
and I'm sorry I accused you.

533
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:53,724
It's fine. You okay?

534
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:55,235
It's not fine.

535
00:29:55,675 --> 00:29:56,862
I'm really sorry.

536
00:29:57,135 --> 00:29:58,040
Veronica.

537
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:01,215
All I care about is you.

538
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,605
Okay?

539
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:06,289
Did you find something out?

540
00:30:06,657 --> 00:30:07,533
Yeah.

541
00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:12,745
Well, do you want to tell me about it?

542
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:15,822
I mean, you-you don't have, you don't have to tell me anything.

543
00:30:17,264 --> 00:30:19,862
I'm just here for whatever you need, okay.

544
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:23,845
I was drugged but I wasn't…

545
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:29,815
I was with Duncan.

546
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:39,323
Apparently we ended up in the guest room together

547
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:42,252
and he was wasted and I was…

548
00:30:43,327 --> 00:30:44,413
out of it…

549
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:49,579
and I guess our feelings and nature…

550
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:52,441
I'm sorry.

551
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:55,984
I'm just glad you're here.

552
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:03,811
Well, hello to you.

553
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,969
Come in, come in, please.

554
00:31:14,185 --> 00:31:16,110
Look, can I get you anything to drink?

555
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:19,238
Are you hungry or anything?

556
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:24,231
I think not having to buy me dinner first is kind of the point.

557
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:29,346
Why don't you come sit over here with me

558
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,415
and relax, okay?

559
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:35,766
Well, maybe we could go sit out on the balcony.

560
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:37,732
You're still gonna be married on the balcony.

561
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:41,060
Now.

562
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:45,751
I want you to tell me exactly what you want.

563
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:49,964
That one thing you can never get the little woman to do.

564
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:51,894
And we'll start there.

565
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:01,572
Actually,

566
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:06,124
I'd like to start by talking about Abel Koontz.

567
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:14,316
Miss Collins, my name is Keith Mars. I'm a private investigator from California.

568
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,040
I've been looking for you for a year.

569
00:32:17,828 --> 00:32:22,057
I know you were with Abel Koontz at the time he supposedly murdered Lilly Kane.

570
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,593
I don't know what you're talking about.

571
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:26,511
I think you do. There's a phone record, Cheyenne.

572
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:31,259
Abel called the same number at the same time every week, it was a standing appointment

573
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,509
and by the time I traced that number back to you, you'd moved on

574
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:37,756
to Seattle, San Francisco, Aspen

575
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:40,745
and I bet I know why.

576
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:44,585
I packed up my whole life to get away from this and you have to come find me.

577
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:46,459
An innocent man's life is at stake.

578
00:32:46,553 --> 00:32:47,683
He confessed.

579
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,420
For whatever reason.

580
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:53,489
If I come forward, I'll be the most famous working girl on the planet.

581
00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:57,406
I have a five year old son who thinks I'm a stewardess.

582
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:58,737
A girl was murdered.

583
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:04,482
Don't you think the person who killed her should be the one in jail.

584
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:07,186
My dad thinks he's a gourmet. Humour him.

585
00:33:07,774 --> 00:33:10,821
Ah, so now he's going to make us eat to candlelight tonight.

586
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:16,668
Okay, showtime.

587
00:33:29,513 --> 00:33:30,809
Surprise.

588
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:56,690
So is this party nine months early or three months late?

589
00:33:57,397 --> 00:33:59,754
I got a lot of lost years I gotta make up for.

590
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:02,015
This is my way of getting started.

591
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:03,009
It's a good call.

592
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:16,270
Dude, what the hell are you doing?

593
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,202
Please tell me this is like, some new reality show called "My Skank".

594
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,244
Goodbye, Dick.

595
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:26,086
- What? 
- Get out of my house.

596
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:29,188
You have a problem with Veronica, you leave.

597
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:32,864
Actually, you have a problem with Veronica, you're pretty much dead to me,

598
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:36,310
so just, like, evaporate or something, I dunno.

599
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:40,539
That's kind of a general invitation.

600
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:42,054
If you don't like my girlfriend then…

601
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:45,997
just start heading toward the rectangle with the knob.

602
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:47,855
Are you okay?

603
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:56,058
Look, Duncan, listen, I wanna…

604
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:04,962
So.

605
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:07,311
Are you like dating Logan now?

606
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:08,463
Yes, Madison.

607
00:35:08,847 --> 00:35:11,786
Do you think his dad's gonna do another movie soon or what?

608
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:14,982
He's way too cute to become a has-been.

609
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:18,479
You want one.

610
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:21,888
They said it was sugar-free but, I don't know.

611
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:34,203
You don't want to drink that.

612
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,297
Why?

613
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,686
I'm betting Madison gave you a trip to the dentist.

614
00:35:40,464 --> 00:35:41,422
It's her thing.

615
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,373
She does it to people who she doesn't like.

616
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:47,499
She spits in the cocktail and calls it a trip to the dentist,

617
00:35:47,805 --> 00:35:49,424
'cause we're in eighth grade.

618
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:52,752
Ow. What are you doing?

619
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:55,379
Did you give me a trip to the dentist the night of Shelly's party?

620
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,199
What?

621
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:58,799
Hello, I have no idea what you're talking about.

622
00:35:58,877 --> 00:36:02,065
Did you spit in your drink and give it to me at Shelly's?

623
00:36:02,321 --> 00:36:05,526
Like I was the only person's spit you had in your mouth that night.

624
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,375
Regular soda?

625
00:36:15,317 --> 00:36:17,845
Why didn't you just fill the cup with lard?

626
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:37,466
You have no idea what you did to me.

627
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:39,969
Oh my god! I spit in your drink.

628
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,851
You are like so scarred for life.

629
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:14,089
Duncan! Duncan, what are you doing? Stop that.

630
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:17,862
This is about Veronica, isn't it?

631
00:37:18,548 --> 00:37:20,132
You're still in love with her, right?

632
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,793
Answer me.

633
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:29,357
Thanks for coming guys. I hope you got something to eat.

634
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:48,476
Now, see, why can't it just be like this?

635
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,036
Why do there have to be all those other people in this world?

636
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:53,693
What are you doing?

637
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,255
You're too short.

638
00:37:55,602 --> 00:37:57,148
It means I level the playing field.

639
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:01,281
Is this where you take all your conquests?

640
00:38:01,992 --> 00:38:03,840
Nope, only the short ones.

641
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:11,824
Hey, I have to tell you something.

642
00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:16,293
I'm sorry, we're past the confessional portion of this program.

643
00:38:16,405 --> 00:38:18,924
- We're on to the make out. 
- Listen, Veronica, stop, I gotta…

644
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,357
I have to tell you something about Shelly's party.

645
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:28,612
Go for it.

646
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:30,409
Here you go, sweet pea.

647
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:35,011
I know about the salt lick.

648
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:39,370
I gonna choose to think of it as one of those not real things.

649
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,746
There's more.

650
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:44,709
What the hell are you doing? She can barely sit up, you freak!

651
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:48,202
Wait dude, you can't be the cavalry and a martyr, man. Pick a side.

652
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:49,496
Leave her alone.

653
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:57,718
Hey, I'm sorry, dude.

654
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:01,667
You know, man, you're, I mean, you're totally right. It's no way to have fun, huh?

655
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:05,947
Cheers.

656
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:14,769
I just wanted Duncan to have some fun.

657
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,470
You know, he barely even smiled since Lilly…

658
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:21,087
You didn't know what would happen.

659
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:23,792
I'm the one who's responsible for what happened to you.

660
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:27,620
And I can't take that I hurt you like that.

661
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,665
I can't take that I hurt you when all I want to do is protect you.

662
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,231
I want you to trust me.

663
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:43,011
I do.

664
00:39:48,214 --> 00:39:49,089
Okay.

665
00:39:52,468 --> 00:39:55,320
I don't know about you, but I could use a refreshment about now.

666
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:12,078
You learned that from Lilly.

667
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:13,998
No, Lilly learned that from me.

668
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:20,941
It's almost endearing that I need a key to the liquor cabinet, don't you think?

669
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:28,973
Wow, just wild, huh?

670
00:40:35,157 --> 00:40:36,167
I'll be right back.

671
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:37,084
Two minutes?

672
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,497
Okay.

673
00:41:36,336 --> 00:41:37,098
You okay?

674
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:38,796
Thanks for coming to get me.

675
00:41:58,856 --> 00:42:00,351
Honey, I'm home.

676
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:05,687
So am I, honey, so am I.
