1
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,115
The most powerful woman in New York
is not Tina Brown...

2
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:55,986
or Diane Sawyer
or even Rosie O'Donnell.

3
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,615
It's the hostess at Balzac--

4
00:00:57,692 --> 00:01:01,355
which had overnight become
the only restaurant that mattered.

5
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,124
And we were there to celebrate
the moment.

6
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,630
This is humiliating.

7
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,633
We've been waiting f or 45 minutes.

8
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:08,134
I think I'm gonna f aint.

9
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,796
- Doesn't she know who we are?
- Who are we?

10
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:13,636
I own my own PR firm.
You write a newspaper column.

11
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,642
This should not be happening.

12
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:19,870
I'm going back up there.
Excuse me.

13
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:23,678
Hello. Excuse me.
Hello! We've been waiting 45 minutes.

14
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,981
Look, I'm not sure you understand...

15
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,650
but I'm kind of somebody...

16
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:34,160
and she's definitely
kind of somebody...

17
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:37,129
and we really need to eat now.

18
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,132
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,671
Excuse me.

20
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:50,172
- Give me a 20.
- You must be joking.

21
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,178
Do you think I should
make it a 50?

22
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:55,340
If I had $50 with me,
do you think I'd give it to that girl?

23
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,350
She cannot do this to us.

24
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:59,511
- We're leaving.
- Oh, God.

25
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:02,855
Let me tell you something.

26
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:05,017
I was that woman ten years ago...

27
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,526
but I wielded my power
in a benevolent manner.

28
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:10,189
Can we please talk about this
over lunch somewhere else?

29
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:13,199
Where, somewhere like New Jersey,
where we might actually get seated?

30
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:17,704
Do you realize, if she were a man,
not only would we be eating now...

31
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:19,865
but they'd be sending over
free drinks.

32
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,034
I know a great Thai place
around the corner...

33
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,043
where the owner's son
practically always sends over...

34
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,045
a complementary order of mee krob.

35
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,775
How sad.
Do you think we can get it to go?

36
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,874
A short time later,
Samantha headed back to her office...

37
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:34,217
while I decided to investigate
this theory I had...

38
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:38,054
about shopping as a way to unleash
the creative subconscious.

39
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,224
All right.
I'm gonna take them.

40
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,730
I was already planning
on returning them when--

41
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,232
Miss?

42
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,533
They told me to do that.
And now they want to talk to you.

43
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:57,710
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, my God! I don't believe it!

44
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,581
- When did you get to town?
- Just yesterday.

45
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:07,245
- Darling, you look f antastic.
- I can't let you do this.

46
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,619
Of course you can.
And you can pay me back never.

47
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,215
Besides, it's on Carlo.

48
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,591
Wow. When did you two--

49
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,459
About two months.

50
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,125
His f amily has this gigantic ranch
in Argentina. Very, very wealthy.

51
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:24,763
He has a tiny little penis,
but he knows exactly how to use it.

52
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,773
Wave, darling. Wave.

53
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:29,639
Ciao, ciao, ciao.

54
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,110
That's very nice of you,
but I just can't accept these.

55
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,510
But of course you can.

56
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:37,347
When have I ever given you a birthday
present or a Christmas present?

57
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,613
I mean, you are like
a sister to me...

58
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:43,384
yet I never see you.

59
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,618
The truth was,
we'd only met a f ew times.

60
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:49,060
Most people would classify Amalita
as Eurotrash.

61
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,064
I thought she was fun.

62
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:53,566
So call me. I'm staying
at the Four Seasons with Carlo.

63
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,159
- Don't you live in the city?
- I'm a citizen of the world.

64
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,296
A citizen of the world, darling.

65
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,307
Now take the shoes,
and we'll talk soon.

66
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,139
- I can't do this.
- Of course you can.

67
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:08,140
- Go, go.
- Thank you.

68
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,986
I couldn't understand a word
she was saying...

69
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:18,151
but I f elt I had in my possession
all the ltalian I'd ever need to know.

70
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,991
While at home, all the English
I seemed to encounter...

71
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,225
was "bills, bills, bills."

72
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,994
I envied Amalita.

73
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:29,832
Her lif e was a blur of rich men,
designer clothes...

74
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:31,667
and glamorous resorts.

75
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:35,004
She didn't actually work f or a living,
yet possessed a dazzling sexual power...

76
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:37,840
that she exploited
to her full advantage.

77
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,847
Which presented
a certain conundrum.

78
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:43,008
Where's the line
between prof essional girlfriend...

79
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:45,609
and just plain prof essional?

80
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:49,178
Women have the right to use every means
at their disposal to achieve power.

81
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,190
Short of sleeping their way
to the top.

82
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,351
Not if that's what it takes
to compete.

83
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,361
But that's exploitation!

84
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,693
Of men--
which is perf ectly legal.

85
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,029
Saturday night.
In an eff ort to save money...

86
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:02,535
and maybe even pick up
a f ew extra bucks...

87
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,798
I invited the girls over f or poker.

88
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,670
- I'll buy two.
- I'm in f or three.

89
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:10,040
So you advocate a double standard.

90
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,205
Women can use their sexuality
to get ahead whenever possible...

91
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,147
but men should not be allowed
to take advantage of it?

92
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:19,380
I'm just saying that men and women
are equal-opportunity exploiters.

93
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,683
- I f old.
- What if you sense that someone...

94
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:26,887
is giving you a prof essional advantage
because they find you charming?

95
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:30,328
- Charming?
- This I gotta hear.

96
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:35,563
A f ew days ago, Neville Morgan,
the notoriously reclusive painter...

97
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,570
paid a visit to the gallery.

98
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,236
Neville was making his yearly
pilgrimage to Manhattan...

99
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,902
to check out what was new and hot
on the art scene.

100
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:46,742
And he f ound it--
Charlotte.

101
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:50,250
It was only a matter of moments bef ore
he invited her to his f arm upstate...

102
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,512
to view his latest work.

103
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:56,078
If I could get him to show at the
gallery, it would be an incredible coup.

104
00:05:56,157 --> 00:06:01,424
- But what if he wants me to, you know.
- Hold his brush?

105
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,430
If he so much as suggests
what she's suggesting...

106
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,591
you give me a call
and we'll sue the hell out of him.

107
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,794
That's the only proper way
to trade sex f or power.

108
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,803
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

109
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,432
You're like the Harvard Law
Lorena Bobbitt.

110
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,602
It's Skipper.
I told him I was here.

111
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:21,011
He insisted on picking me up, but he's
not supposed to be here till 11:00.

112
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,413
He's like a sweet little seal pup.

113
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:26,112
That you sometimes want to club.

114
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,855
You're an hour early.

115
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:33,860
I can wait in the hall.

116
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:35,520
Skipper, come in.

117
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,621
It's all right.

118
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,461
I'm leaving anyway.

119
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,797
You guys have cleaned me out.

120
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,064
Good night, ladies.

121
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,799
Keep me posted.

122
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:54,139
A couple of hours later,
I was looking f orward...

123
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:56,308
to calling it an early night,
when--

124
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:04,088
- Hello?
- Carrie, you bitch! What are you doing?

125
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:08,151
- I'm getting ready to go to sleep.
- Why don't you come and join us?

126
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:13,326
We are at Balzac, and there is someone
here I am dying f or you to meet.

127
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,164
I'd love to,
but I'm really trying to cut back.

128
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:18,262
You know, pinch a f ew pennies.

129
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,500
You are crazy, you know that?

130
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,771
Why don't you just come down here
and be your f abulous self?

131
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,109
The truth was I could
barely aff ord that either.

132
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:29,115
But I rationalized
that my new shoes...

133
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:31,276
shouldn't be punished
just because I can't budget.

134
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,488
Sorry. You're not on the list.

135
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,683
I don't need a list.
My friends are already in.

136
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:40,454
Darling, what took you so long?

137
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:49,195
You won't believe what Carlo bought me
this afternoon at Van Cleef & Arpels.

138
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,703
What?

139
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,205
Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.

140
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:55,367
Twelve thousand dollars.

141
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:01,714
Listen, I want you to come and meet
the world's most f abulous man.

142
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:04,216
Sounds like a trendy sideshow act.

143
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:05,877
You're crazy!

144
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:12,949
Carrie, I'd like you to meet
my boyfriend Carlo.

145
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:15,655
- And his friend Gilles.
- Hello.

146
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,095
Hello. Nice to meet you.

147
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,065
Gilles is an architect from Paris.

148
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:26,698
- How long are you here f or?
- Just a couple of days. On business.

149
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:30,574
I've told Gilles all about you.

150
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,805
I told him
you were the most beautiful...

151
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,872
talented and f ascinating woman
in New York.

152
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,544
And single.
How is this possible?

153
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,284
I get it.
You're an architect and a comedian.

154
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,683
I don't understand.

155
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,288
Nothing.
I'm just being un peu stupide.

156
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,765
You? Never.

157
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:57,600
I suddenly recalled my terrible weakness
f or gorgeous French architects.

158
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,435
Can I get anyone something else?

159
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,142
You would like another
bottle of wine?

160
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,804
Wonderful.

161
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,615
And what will the rest of you
be having?

162
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,956
During the next couple of hours, I put
my journalistic skills to good use.

163
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,117
I discovered that Gilles
was recently divorced...

164
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:21,127
with a five-year-old daughter,
Beatrice...

165
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:23,129
who lived with her mother in Paris.

166
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:25,131
He was passing through New York
on his way to Brazil...

167
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,633
to supervise construction
of a new hotel.

168
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,465
I think you are too beautiful
to be a writer.

169
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,472
I think you're too charming
to be an architect.

170
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,474
I think you should
give up your lif e here...

171
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,635
and move with me
to Paris immediately.

172
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,975
I thought you were spending the next
six months in Brazil.

173
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,311
You can join me there first.

174
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:44,146
Don't tempt me.

175
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,482
I'm so broke these days
I might take you up on that off er...

176
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,646
just to save on rent.

177
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,656
Writing does not pay well?

178
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,157
No, it does.

179
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:57,061
It's just, I have
this little substance abuse problem.

180
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,794
Expensive f ootwear.

181
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:07,169
I see.

182
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,300
I'm only here f or the weekend...

183
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,810
but I would love to see you tomorrow.

184
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,673
Maybe you could show me the town.

185
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,683
You've never been to New York?

186
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,184
About 12 times...

187
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:22,586
but I've never seen it
with someone like you.

188
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:28,152
You really have that certain
je ne sais quoi, don't you?

189
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,363
Yes.

190
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,159
And so do you.

191
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:41,340
So, I'll see you tomorrow.

192
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,103
Good night.

193
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,043
Sure, I saw some red flags--

194
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:56,351
divorced, French
and almost uncomf ortably handsome--

195
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,226
but I f elt like
I was floating on air.

196
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,235
The next morning
I was brought back down to Earth...

197
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:12,568
as I confronted that eternal puzzle...

198
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,733
a closet full of clothes,
nothing to wear.

199
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,244
Just a minute!

200
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,047
Who is it?

201
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:29,415
- Hey.
- Hey. I'm sorry. I should go.

202
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,924
Skipper, come on in.
What is it?

203
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,924
It's Miranda.
She's got me totally whacked.

204
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,089
It's like I'm obsessed.

205
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,258
And I know that I shouldn't be
because I can sense...

206
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,268
that it's totally turning her off.

207
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:45,601
But I can't control it.
I can't.

208
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,106
It's like she's got
this power over me...

209
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,769
and I'm helpless.

210
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,438
Keep going.
I have to get dressed, all right?

211
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:56,847
Is it possible
to be addicted to a person?

212
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:00,444
The sex is so awesome
that it's, like...

213
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,284
it's all I can think about.

214
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:06,190
I've never considered myself
a horn dog bef ore...

215
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,286
but I'm worried I might be starting
to scare her off.

216
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:11,160
Well, is that what she said?

217
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,132
No, but mostly we just have sex
in the afternoon.

218
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,135
She never lets me spend the night.

219
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:20,639
Well, I have an idea.

220
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:25,303
Why don't the two of you
just spend a night together...

221
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,472
and not have sex?

222
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:31,143
That would be hard.
That would be really hard.

223
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:34,483
Well, I think it's really important
that you try.

224
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,489
I don't even shower afterwards.

225
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:41,153
I like to spend the whole day
smelling like Miranda.

226
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:55,841
I began to f ear that Miranda's sexuality
was overpowering poor Skipper.

227
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:07,179
Later I spent the most incredibly
romantic afternoon with Gilles.

228
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:21,197
I f elt like I had landed
in a Claude Lelouch film--

229
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,862
A Man and a Slightly Neurotic Woman.

230
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,374
Wait. Wait.

231
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,884
I kind of have this rule.

232
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:42,046
I don't sleep with men
I've only known a day.

233
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,555
I see.

234
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:52,565
I gave in. After all,
it was already tomorrow in Paris.

235
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,413
You look so beautiful
when you sleep.

236
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:11,076
I didn't want to disturb you.

237
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:14,416
- Are you leaving so early?
- I've got a plane.

238
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:15,921
I'll get up.

239
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,585
Stay in bed.
Order room service.

240
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,094
Enjoy yourself.

241
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,764
- I can just get dressed.
- Relax.

242
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,767
I'll call you.

243
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,272
Okay.

244
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,111
As he walked out the door,
it suddenly dawned on me...

245
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,276
that he didn't have
my phone number.

246
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,445
And I didn't have his phone number.

247
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,618
But he had left me a note...

248
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:01,634
with $1,000 in cash.

249
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:04,834
"Thanks f or the beautiful day."

250
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,463
Must have been
a hell of a beautiful day.

251
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,636
Well, it was.
We had such a f antastic connection.

252
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,645
Then he leaves me money.

253
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:15,705
I don't understand.
What exactly about me screams "whore"?

254
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,807
Besides the $1,000 on the end table?

255
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,318
I just can't believe
that you had dinner at Balzac.

256
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:24,221
Wait a minute. I thought I ordered two
eggs benedict and one spinach omelette.

257
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,452
It's all right.
I'll take the omelette.

258
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,494
This isn't right. We're gonna
pay f or all this ourselves, all right?

259
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,052
He said order anything.

260
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,655
The room service is one thing,
but the money-- uh-uh.

261
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,361
What are you getting so uptight about?

262
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,995
Money is power.
Sex is power.

263
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:41,666
Theref ore, getting money f or sex
is simply an exchange of power.

264
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:44,404
Don't listen
to the dime store Camille Paglia.

265
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,412
I don't know whether to take it
as an incredible compliment...

266
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,380
or as an incredible insult.

267
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,813
Just take it, period.

268
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:53,250
I wouldn't know how to return it anyway
because he didn't leave me his number.

269
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,311
He paid in full.
What more is there to talk about?

270
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:58,449
Who is this Amalita Amalfi character,
anyway?

271
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,688
I'm concerned that you've been drafted
into a ring of high-class hookers.

272
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:03,229
She isn't a hooker.

273
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,854
She's--

274
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,024
She's like
an international party girl.

275
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,533
She's a hooker with a passport.

276
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,502
Do you ever have any conversations
about money?

277
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,666
I did allude to the f act that I was
a bit cash poor these days.

278
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,539
So maybe it's supposed to be a loan?

279
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:19,545
I don't remember filling out
an application.

280
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:22,047
Sweetheart, men give, women receive.

281
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:25,551
- It's biological destiny.
- Do you really want to say that?

282
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:30,750
That's the argument men have used
since the dawn of time to exploit women.

283
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:35,591
I'm just gonna write the whole thing off
as a bad date with a cash bonus.

284
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,892
You know, that salmon is really good.

285
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,727
I think we should order another one.

286
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,827
As I struggled with the dilemma
of how to manage my newf ound money...

287
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:47,399
Charlotte arrived at the secluded
Connecticut home...

288
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:49,408
of the painter Neville Morgan...

289
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,070
in an attempt to secure
his latest work.

290
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,742
Welcome.

291
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:58,751
Hi. I f eel so privileged.

292
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:01,913
Meeting you is without a doubt
the high point of my career.

293
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,421
Thank you.

294
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,756
I'm frankly surprised that someone as
young as you is f amiliar with my work.

295
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,092
Are you serious?
I studied you in college.

296
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,757
Oh, my God.
I apologize.

297
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,768
- I really do.
- You're much too modest.

298
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:17,269
Here we are.

299
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,770
Excuse me.

300
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,938
The canvasses you're about to see...

301
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,607
are what I consider to be
the apotheosis...

302
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:32,618
of every great idea I've ever had.

303
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:35,780
It's the closest I've ever come...

304
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,791
to pure, universal God f orce.

305
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,626
The cunt.

306
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,797
Oh, my.

307
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,131
They're very powerful.

308
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,966
Exactly.

309
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:55,007
The most powerful f orce...

310
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,838
in the universe.

311
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,978
The source of all lif e...

312
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,638
and pleasure...

313
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:03,182
and beauty.

314
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,143
That's true.

315
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,846
I used to paint full nudes...

316
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,322
but as I got older I realized...

317
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,154
that the truth...

318
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,456
was to be f ound only
in the cunt.

319
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,462
Charlotte hated the "C" word.

320
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:21,899
But Neville Morgan was not a man
to be corrected.

321
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,833
Hi.

322
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,667
I thought you might like
something to drink.

323
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,537
Charlotte, this is my wif e,
Gertrude.

324
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,337
It's a pleasure.

325
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,844
- Lemonade and cookies?
- Thank you.

326
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:34,710
Each of these portraits...

327
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,547
is of a woman
who has touched my lif e.

328
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,353
Incredible.

329
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,718
I wonder...

330
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,656
would you consider
posing f or me sometime?

331
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,488
Me? l--

332
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,689
Well...

333
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,198
I'm very flattered.

334
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:57,202
Excellent.

335
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,704
So long as you're here,
I could sketch you this afternoon.

336
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,542
I bet you have
a beautiful cunt, dear.

337
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:08,373
As Charlotte pondered how f ar
she would go f or her love of art...

338
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,177
and the gallery--

339
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:13,613
Another Saturday night.

340
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:16,781
With my hooker money still
burning a hole in my pocket...

341
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,222
Samantha and I showed up
at Balzac.

342
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,226
She reasoned
that since I was there once...

343
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,228
I was as good as in.

344
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,729
I don't understand.

345
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,757
I made these reservations weeks ago,
and she's already been here.

346
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,393
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,898
Is there a host
that I might talk to?

348
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,910
I will snap her.

349
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:42,244
I will put her over my knee,
and I will snap her like a twig.

350
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,409
I'm sorry. I'm hungry.

351
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:48,420
I'm going to go to the bathroom,
and then we're leaving, all right?

352
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:00,931
Come here!

353
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,196
They all looked so chic and glamorous.

354
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,603
Part of me wanted to grab Samantha
and make a run f or it.

355
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,664
- While another part--
- Hi.

356
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,004
How are you?

357
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,509
Carrie, I want you to meet Mario...

358
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,380
Allen, Justine and Peter.

359
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:21,310
Mario's f amily has one of those
gorgeous palazzos...

360
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,083
on the Grand Canal in Venezia.

361
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:27,183
And we are all going there next week
f or the film f estival.

362
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,195
- You should join us.
- Absolutely!

363
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,130
Yes, you must bring your little laptop
and write all about it.

364
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,360
You'd be mad not to go.

365
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,297
Carrie is one
of the most f ascinating...

366
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:42,000
talented and beautiful women
in New York.

367
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,667
I have no doubt.

368
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,075
I've never been to Venice.

369
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:51,980
Venice is the most beautiful,
the most romantic city in the world.

370
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:53,178
Really?

371
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,619
I heard it was sinking.

372
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,990
That's why you must come immediately--
bef ore it's all gone.

373
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:06,157
I couldn't say I wasn't tempted.

374
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,325
I realized
that I could leverage myself...

375
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,995
Iike the human equivalent
of a sexy junk bond.

376
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:14,302
I'd parlay that $1,000
into a trip to Venice...

377
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,672
into a nice piece of jewelry...

378
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:19,337
a rich husband,
f ollowed by a richer divorce.

379
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,685
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to say good-bye.

380
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:27,947
I'm here with a friend.
She's waiting f or me at the bar.

381
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,420
What a pity.

382
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,653
Call me. I'm staying
at the Carlyle with Peter.

383
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,033
Just because Venice was sinking...

384
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:43,934
didn't mean my morals
had to go down with it.

385
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:48,369
And as f or Gilles and the $1,000...

386
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,375
I figured
there was nothing to be done.

387
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:53,207
For better or worse,
I had just established my rate...

388
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,213
f or a one-night stand.

389
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,049
Excuse me.

390
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:03,215
And then the most powerful woman
in Manhattan asked me f or a f avor.

391
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,722
Do you have a tampon?

392
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,224
Oh! Sure.

393
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,227
Of course.

394
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,322
Thanks a lot.

395
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:22,567
I never told Samantha the source
of my newf ound power...

396
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:25,236
but from that moment on,
we never had a problem...

397
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,745
getting a table at Balzac again.

398
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:35,079
A couple of weeks later,
we were all there...

399
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:37,248
to celebrate Charlotte's coup.

400
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,587
Hi. Excuse me just a second.

401
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:44,596
Are you number nine?

402
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,097
Oh, my God.

403
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,600
I am so not number nine.

404
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,101
Five.

405
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:52,937
Yeah, right.

406
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,945
It's this, right?

407
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:11,456
Really?

408
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:24,966
They say a picture is worth
a thousand words...

409
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:26,733
but in this case...

410
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,797
I was speechless.
