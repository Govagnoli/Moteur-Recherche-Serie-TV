1
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,824
Once upon a time...

2
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,894
in a kingdom far away...

3
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:56,825
a certain man...

4
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,265
and a slightly less
certain woman...

5
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:01,565
kept bumping into one another.

6
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:05,338
They seemed to meet everywhere.

7
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:10,111
On street corners...

8
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:14,308
at parties.

9
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:17,353
It was almost as if
they were dating accidentally.

10
00:01:18,154 --> 00:01:20,714
And then, after
another chance meeting...

11
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,691
at a wealthy lawyer's
new son's Bris...

12
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:29,922
they decided to pick a time
to bump into each other on purpose.

13
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:36,269
Saturday, 10:30.
The hottest new restaurant in Manhattan.

14
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:39,964
Samantha's P.R. firm
was handling the opening.

15
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:46,104
So, isn't Brian great?

16
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:49,618
Charlotte had a new boyfriend.
He had her big three:

17
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:51,915
Iooks, manners, money.

18
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:55,185
Did I tell you he wants to buy
a painting from my gallery?

19
00:01:55,258 --> 00:01:57,886
Love and a commission.
She couldn't have been happier.

20
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,292
- It's official. He's late.
- Who?

21
00:02:00,363 --> 00:02:02,092
Mr. Big, who else?

22
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,633
Carrie, that's great.
Is it a date?

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,191
He called it a thing.
He said, "Meet me--

24
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,033
Meet me for a drink thing."

25
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:12,040
- He never used the "D" word.
- Well, "thing" is good.

26
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:14,941
- I mean, "thing" comes before date.
- Let's hope so.

27
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:16,945
- I'm gonna go in.
- Okay.

28
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:19,277
- See you in there.
- Where did Skipper go?

29
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,782
I don't know how you can date
that younger guy.

30
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,217
- They're so scattered and unfocused.
- We're not dating.

31
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:26,482
It's a "fuck" thing.

32
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:28,683
Girls, isn't this fun?

33
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:32,922
I've turned away 20 so far.
People are actually crying.

34
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:44,267
Oh, something came up.
He's not gonna meet me.

35
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,002
Here, will you listen to this
and tell me if you can figure out...

36
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:50,409
whether he's not meeting me
as a date or as a friend.

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,311
All right.

38
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,406
Sometimes you need a second opinion...

39
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:57,146
with doctors, real estate, men.

40
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,744
Well?

41
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:00,948
I have no idea.

42
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:04,151
And I finished first
in my litigation class.

43
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:06,855
How pathetic do I feel asking you...

44
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:10,160
if a guy kind of likes me?

45
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,825
There you are.

46
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,704
Carrie, Miranda...

47
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:19,935
this is the hottest chef
in New York, Jon.

48
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:24,002
Jon. J-O-N.
No "H," no last name.

49
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,571
His blue crab strudel was so fabulous,
he didn't need one.

50
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:29,447
And this is
his very cute friend Sam.

51
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:32,818
Sam? Who's named Sam?

52
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:35,357
Me. Can I get you a drink?

53
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,722
Oh, good luck.
The bar is packed.

54
00:03:37,793 --> 00:03:40,193
No problem, 'cause
the bartender's a buddy of mine.

55
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,094
- Miranda?
- Martini.

56
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:46,033
Twenty-something guys always know
the really important "B" people.

57
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:49,236
Busboys, bouncers.

58
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:52,103
Plus, they have cute butts.

59
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:55,372
That's the Times critic.
I'd better go.

60
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:11,526
Did I mention
I'm sleeping with him?

61
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:16,930
Skipper!

62
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,232
He's lost.
We gotta get him.

63
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:27,407
They stopped making martinis, so I got
us two rum and Cokes. Is that okay?

64
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,967
Well, I hate rum and I hate Coke.

65
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:32,742
- But thanks.
- Martinis, ladies.

66
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,978
- Look at you.
- I was a waiter at TGIF.

67
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,644
Fabulous.

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,658
They liked each other immediately.

69
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,822
You wanna see something?

70
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,327
Can you narrow that down
a little bit?

71
00:04:57,974 --> 00:04:59,703
Wait, I didn't--

72
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:03,805
No fair.
Do it over.

73
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,819
- It's you.
- I've been looking all over for you.

74
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:13,650
Here you are, holding a tongue.

75
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:16,021
Well, your message said
you weren't coming.

76
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:18,390
I thought I said I'd try
to make it for an hour.

77
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,985
Yeah, but then you said that--

78
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:22,895
- What did I say?
- Never mind.

79
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:25,433
You're here, you have an hour.
Let's have a drink.

80
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,435
I was outside trying to get in
for 30 minutes...

81
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:30,097
inside looking for you for 20,
leaving me with just enough time...

82
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:33,369
to tell you that I'm out of time.

83
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:35,910
You have fun.

84
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:39,470
Men in their 40s are like the New York
Times Sunday crossword puzzle:

85
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,810
tricky, complicated...

86
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,681
and you're never really sure
you've got the right answer.

87
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:45,687
This place is tired.

88
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:49,990
- Do you want to get out of here?
- Sure.

89
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:54,761
Why not?

90
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,025
A short cab ride later...

91
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,397
Samantha, Jon "no "H",
Sam and l...

92
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:01,698
found ourselves at
the nearby twenty-something club.

93
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,972
I can't believe you made Jon
leave his own opening.

94
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:10,172
He is way too happening to be seen
someplace borderline tired.

95
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:14,512
It was a tough town. Hot places
had the life span of a medfly.

96
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,280
Samantha, everybody in here
is in their 20s.

97
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:20,686
And so are we.

98
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,690
As I glanced around the room,
I was amazed...

99
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:26,285
at the wide variety
of great twenty-something guys.

100
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:28,922
The groovy guy.

101
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:31,398
The corporate guy.

102
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:34,664
The jock guy.

103
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:36,671
The underage guy.

104
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:45,044
There you are.
How are you?

105
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,446
- I see you found us.
- Big couch.

106
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:49,108
Oh, here.

107
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,352
That'll work.

108
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:02,330
I'm not too heavy, am l?

109
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:04,491
Right. You weigh, like, nothing.

110
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:07,536
What's cuter than that?

111
00:07:07,603 --> 00:07:10,003
As we took a swig from
our pony-necked beers...

112
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:12,404
I remembered another type
of twenty-something guy.

113
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:17,412
So, what's it like
to kiss with that thing in?

114
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,914
You wanna find out?

115
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,419
The really good kisser guy.

116
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:41,502
Hello?

117
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,765
- I am so fucked.
- What's wrong?

118
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,500
No, I mean, literally.

119
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:48,202
I have been fucked every way
you can be fucked.

120
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:51,678
If you keep talking like that,
I'm gonna charge you by the minute.

121
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:54,307
As I searched for
my morning Marlboro Light...

122
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:57,841
Samantha proceeded to give me
a rundown of her night with Jon--

123
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,115
no "H," no inhibitions.

124
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:05,126
We did it with him on top,
me on top, me on my side.

125
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:09,221
- Him on his side?
- Oh, God, yes.

126
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:12,756
On his back, on his side,
on his face.

127
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:16,134
- Have you ever done that?
- It's too early to remember.

128
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,799
Well, do it immediately.
It is fabulous.

129
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,240
These guys in their twenties,
they are up for anything.

130
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,871
How did it go with you and Sam?

131
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:28,314
- We kissed.
- Just kissed?

132
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:32,411
No. We just kissed for five hours...

133
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:36,083
at the club, in front of the club,
on the corner of the club.

134
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:38,752
I forgot how much fun it is
to just kiss, you know...

135
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,762
even if I did only get
two hours sleep.

136
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,492
I didn't sleep at all.

137
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:46,558
As Samantha went on
about her sexual escapades...

138
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:48,330
I glanced down at my arm.

139
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:53,068
There it was in Bic blue--
twenty-something Sam's phone number.

140
00:08:53,142 --> 00:08:56,737
I had this sudden urge to call,
but I'd just left him.

141
00:08:56,812 --> 00:09:00,475
Hell, my lips were still swollen.
Why this sudden craving?

142
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:04,383
Are men in their twenties
the new designer drug?

143
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:08,082
Yes, Samantha, Miranda and I
were all recreational users...

144
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:10,921
but were we getting into something
we couldn't handle?

145
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:14,656
Okay, we were attracted
to younger men for various reasons.

146
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,597
But I couldn't help but wonder:
What do they see in us?

147
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:21,731
Women in their thirties
are just so grateful.

148
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:24,568
It's like every bullshit
nice thing you do...

149
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,574
is like throwing food
to the starving.

150
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,736
Take your shot!

151
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:34,182
They give great head
and know a lot about wine.

152
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:42,387
They remind me of my mom.

153
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,293
They know who they are
and what they want, and I like that.

154
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:58,869
- Fuck!
- Two words: smart pussy.

155
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:06,176
Later that week,
Miranda and I compared notes.

156
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:08,443
Shouldn't we be dating men
our own age?

157
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:09,848
Good luck finding one.

158
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,047
There are no available men
in their thirties in New York.

159
00:10:13,122 --> 00:10:16,922
Giuliani had them removed
along with the homeless.

160
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:21,429
Then what's really going on here?
ls it younger men feel safer?

161
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:23,897
What's really going on here is sex.

162
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:25,957
Good old-fashioned,
eager-to-please...

163
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:28,526
do-what-l-tell-you-to,
Eagle Scout sex.

164
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:31,835
But I'm not having sex.
It's a kissing thing.

165
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:34,569
So what's the big deal?
It's just a fling.

166
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:37,043
It's not like we're throwing out
our schedules or anything.

167
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:39,171
- Oh, sweetie, I gotta go.
- Yeah?

168
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:41,307
I'm late for a meeting
with my editor.

169
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:42,372
Bye!

170
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,950
I didn't wanna tell her
I cancelled lunch with my editor...

171
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:50,389
to go to Banana Republic and help
twenty-something Sam pick out a shirt.

172
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,222
Here.

173
00:10:57,099 --> 00:11:00,000
As I helped him try them on,
I thought...

174
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:03,402
"He's sweet, he's fun,
and I think he likes me.

175
00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:07,499
Could he be more than a fling?
Could he be a potential boyfriend?"

176
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:08,941
Please.

177
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:12,636
This isn't the Gap.

178
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,176
And speaking of
potential boyfriends...

179
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:20,483
Iater that week
the "crossword puzzle" asked me...

180
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,524
to meet him for a drink, blank.

181
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:25,992
Not quite a date, five letters,
starts with a "T".

182
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:32,362
Whoever this is, I can't talk.
I'm late for a drink thing.

183
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:35,528
I just need five minutes. I'm meeting
Brian later and don't know what to do.

184
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:38,505
- About what?
- Well, last night...

185
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,338
after a movie, we're walking down
Second Avenue and just passed--

186
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,241
Four minutes, Charlotte.

187
00:11:43,312 --> 00:11:46,873
I can't just blurt out
what he asked me. It's embarrassing.

188
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:49,611
What did the perfect boyfriend ask?

189
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:53,319
Meet me in front of your apartment
in ten minutes.

190
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,827
Okay, words are essential.
Tell me exactly how he worded it.

191
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:03,091
"We've been seeing each other
for a couple of weeks.

192
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:06,134
I really like you.
And tomorrow night after dinner...

193
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:08,135
I want us to have anal sex.

194
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:11,297
Okay, next stop is gonna be
62nd and Madison.

195
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:13,637
- 62nd and Madison?
- We're picking up Miranda.

196
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:14,971
- No, God, no.
- Yes.

197
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:17,478
- And then we're picking up Samantha.
- Oh, Carrie, no.

198
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:20,982
You need all the girl support you can
get, and I'm late for drinks with Big.

199
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,540
Oh, that's great.

200
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:27,248
Even in her state of abject blackness,
Charlotte was a dating optimist.

201
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:30,450
- It depends. How much do you like him?
- A lot.

202
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:33,051
"Dating a few months until somebody
better comes along" a lot...

203
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,221
or "marrying and moving
to East Hampton" a lot?

204
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,026
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

205
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:39,033
Well, you better get sure
real quick.

206
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:41,467
- You're scaring me.
- Don't scare her.

207
00:12:41,537 --> 00:12:43,300
It's all about control.

208
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:45,966
If he goes up there,
there's gonna be a shift in power.

209
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,100
Either he'll have the upper hand
or you will.

210
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:51,374
There's a certain camp that believes
whoever holds the dick holds the power.

211
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:53,574
Hello!
You're driving.

212
00:12:54,616 --> 00:12:56,584
The question is...

213
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,746
if he goes up your butt,
will he respect you more or less?

214
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,313
- That's the issue.
- No smoking in cab.

215
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,317
Sir, we're talking "up the butt."
A cigarette is in order.

216
00:13:06,395 --> 00:13:10,126
Front, back, who cares?
A hole is a hole.

217
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,497
- Can I quote you?
- Don't be so judgmental.

218
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:15,969
- You could use a little back door.
- I'm not a hole.

219
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:17,437
Honey, we know.

220
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:20,339
All I'm saying is that this is
a physical expression...

221
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:23,105
that the body was designed
to experience.

222
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,544
And P.S., it's fabulous.

223
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:28,139
What are you talking about?
I went to Smith.

224
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:32,916
Look, I'm just saying,
with the right guy and right lubricant--

225
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:38,853
What was that?

226
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:40,519
A preview.

227
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:48,661
Thanks.

228
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:55,505
Well, I can't believe it.

229
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:59,946
Same time, same place.
Just you and me.

230
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:03,814
Well, sort of.

231
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,615
Meet my friend Jack.

232
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,787
Oh, hi.
How are you?

233
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,294
Marvelous.
Going through my second divorce.

234
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:15,853
Bitch is getting everything
the first bitch didn't.

235
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:19,731
There he was, right in the middle
of my drink thing...

236
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:22,236
Mr. Marvelous.

237
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:25,762
Jesus.
Look at that beautiful woman.

238
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:30,270
I'm gonna go ask her to join us
for dinner. Excuse me.

239
00:14:37,653 --> 00:14:40,178
He, uh, called me crying.

240
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:46,692
Do you forgive me?

241
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:50,556
Here's what.

242
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:56,937
Why don't you two
have a guy's night.

243
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:59,735
You know, talk, cry, shoot bear.

244
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:02,436
I'm way behind
on my column anyway.

245
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:06,208
Here.
Next round on me.

246
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,249
We'll do our thing another time.

247
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:11,175
Are you sure?

248
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:16,550
Abso-fucking-lutely.

249
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,560
I didn't know
what I was supposed to feel.

250
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,859
Confused? Sad? Rejected?

251
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:25,491
I decided to walk to clear my head.

252
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:28,195
Also, I just left my cab fare
on the table.

253
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,137
So I walked.
I walked 48 blocks...

254
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:33,197
in four-hundred-dollar shoes.

255
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:41,649
I just needed something
to take the edge off.

256
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:48,116
A little kiss
to make me feel better.

257
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:08,540
But now, it wasn't working.
I wasn't getting the same rush.

258
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,477
Tonight, I needed more.

259
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:13,605
Meanwhile uptown,
Charlotte wondered...

260
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,173
when relationships had gotten
so complicated.

261
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:21,120
She yearned for the time when dinner
was followed by dessert, not lubricant.

262
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,248
I-l can't, Brian.
I can't.

263
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:26,852
I want to, but I can't.
I mean, actually--

264
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:29,159
No, that's not true.
I don't want to. Or maybe I do.

265
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:32,257
I don't know what I want, but
I'm afraid if I don't you'll dump me.

266
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:34,598
And if I do, then I'll be
the "up the butt" girl.

267
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,231
I don't wanna be the "up the butt" girl.
Men don't marry the "up the butt" girl.

268
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:40,935
Whoever heard of Mrs. Up The Butt?
No, no, no.

269
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:44,410
I can't.
I want children and nice bedding...

270
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:48,575
and I just can't handle this
right now.

271
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,084
Can we fuck the regular way?

272
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:54,280
Yes, please.

273
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,196
That night,
they made love the Charlotte way--

274
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:07,395
polite and respectful
on 300-count Egyptian cotton sheets.

275
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:10,438
Meanwhile downtown--

276
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,632
That was really great.

277
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,614
You know...

278
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:23,242
when you lay like that...

279
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:26,754
you have the cutest little wrinkles
in your neck.

280
00:17:26,822 --> 00:17:30,258
Samantha realized as long as
she dated someone younger...

281
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:32,725
she would always be older.

282
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:35,388
She gave up twenty-somethings
right then and there.

283
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:38,228
As Samantha went cold turkey...

284
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,666
I got in deeper and deeper.

285
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,042
- That was--
- Totally awesome.

286
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,514
I was hooked. Gone.

287
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,881
Who cares about age,
crossword puzzles...

288
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,977
the cab money I'd left
on the table?

289
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:02,546
This felt so good,
I'd do anything to keep this high.

290
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,787
And just when I thought
I couldn't get any higher...

291
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:07,795
he spooned me.

292
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:21,174
I woke up wanting more,
or maybe not.

293
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:25,339
In the gray morning light,
everything looked completely different.

294
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:31,746
Candles from Urban Outfitter,
dirty laundry, a pizza box.

295
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,549
Suddenly, reality hit.

296
00:18:33,622 --> 00:18:36,216
I'm in a twenty-something apartment.

297
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:40,823
- Good morning, babe.
- Good morning.

298
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:43,660
Fuck!
I had this amazing dream.

299
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,132
My father and my ex-girlfriend
were, like, dead or something.

300
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:51,604
How are you doing?
It's good to see you.

301
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,040
- Coffee. I need coffee.
- It's in the kitchen.

302
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,945
And I had these big hands,
like big aluminum hands.

303
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:04,611
And I lived in this, like,
big missile silo...

304
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,416
that was totally nuclear,
and it was surrounded...

305
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:09,957
by, like, my enemies and shit.

306
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:14,257
And one by one, they'd run at me!
They got inside somehow.

307
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:17,321
I don't remember,
but they would, like, run at me...

308
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:21,392
and I would crush them to pieces
with my big aluminum hands.

309
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,439
I crushed this one guy.
He had no face and stuff...

310
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:28,465
but I crushed him.

311
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:32,445
I could crush anything
with these big fucking hands, man.

312
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:34,948
You don't have any coffee--

313
00:19:35,016 --> 00:19:38,213
- You don't have any coffee filters.
- I'll make that. That's all right.

314
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:40,777
Oh! You were in the dream...

315
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:45,520
as this beautiful unicorn woman
with glass eyes.

316
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:47,687
You, coffee.
Me, bathroom.

317
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:50,560
That would make a kick-ass song,
wouldn't it?

318
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:52,623
Unicorn woman

319
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:54,293
Coffee.

320
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:02,876
Oh, that's my roommate.

321
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,946
Every fiber in my thirty-something
being was screaming...

322
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:10,246
"Get out!
You're too old for this."

323
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:12,252
And just when I thought
I couldn't sink any lower--

324
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:17,120
I need toilet paper!

325
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:20,628
I'm just using the last of it
to make the coffee.

326
00:20:27,736 --> 00:20:29,863
I decided
the only way to break free...

327
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,873
was to move from one addiction
to an even bigger one.

328
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:36,435
Shoes.

329
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:40,711
A couple of blocks
and way too much money later...

330
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:44,548
I realized I had just entered
an interesting chapter in my life.

331
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,553
I had outgrown the boys of my past...

332
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:49,055
and not quite grown into
the men of my future.

333
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,628
Hi. How are you?

334
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:56,493
Why is it in a city
of ten million men...

335
00:20:56,565 --> 00:21:00,763
you always see the one you don't want
and never see the one you--

336
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:05,234
What are you doing down there?

337
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:08,140
It's a wobbly table.
Guess I have the touch.

338
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,075
Would you care to join us?

339
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,476
Hinge.

340
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:13,912
- What?
- Your crossword puzzle.

341
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:17,247
Five-letter word.
"To bring together." Hinge.

342
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,912
Nice seeing you. Bye.

343
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,013
- Bye.
- Excuse me.

344
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,891
Hey, just so you know,
I would've gotten hinge on my own.

345
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:29,954
- Maybe.
- I have no doubt.

346
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:32,090
Now that I've got Jack hooked up,
I'm single again.

347
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,135
Maybe we could have dinner sometime.

348
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:37,831
I don't know.
I'm good at crossword puzzles.

349
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:40,932
I'm just not so good
at people puzzles.

350
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,499
Anywhere you want.

351
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:44,511
Just you and me.

352
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:47,639
Call me.

353
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:53,217
As I walked away, I had a thought:
Maybe all men are a drug.

354
00:21:53,288 --> 00:21:55,688
Sometimes they bring you down...

355
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:58,225
and sometimes, like now,
they get you so high.

356
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:02,023
Damn.

357
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:04,793
It would've been so cool
if I hadn't looked back.
