1
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:49,545
Two weeks ago,
I had my picture taken.

2
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:53,452
Look up. Good, good.

3
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:01,526
It was a promotional photo
for my column...

4
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:03,894
scheduled to run
on the side of a bus.

5
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:07,968
I had misgivings...

6
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:14,271
which were somewhat mollified when
they told me I could keep the dress.

7
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,413
Friday night.

8
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:23,246
In lieu of any actual social life
of their own...

9
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:25,946
Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte
had all stopped by...

10
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:30,082
to live vicariously through
my first official date with Mr. Big.

11
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:31,591
Carrie!

12
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:38,098
Honey, it's fabulous.
Bravo.

13
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,464
It's tits on toast, baby,
but you make it work.

14
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:45,336
Let's just say it. It's the naked dress.
You're obviously gonna have sex tonight.

15
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:48,240
- Come on. It's our first date.
- She's not gonna have sex.

16
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,076
- She's just gonna look like sex.
- That's right. I'm just the trailer.

17
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:54,138
Please.
If it happens, it happens.

18
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:56,548
- Bottoms up.
- Wait a second.

19
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:58,085
I thought you were serious
about this guy.

20
00:01:58,153 --> 00:02:00,485
You can't sleep with him
on the first date.

21
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,546
Here she goes again
with "The Rules."

22
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,457
The women who wrote that book wrote it
because they couldn't get laid...

23
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:07,427
so they constructed
this whole bullshit theory...

24
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,861
to make women
who can get laid feel bad.

25
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:11,922
But if you're serious about a guy,
then you have to keep him...

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,468
in a holding pattern
for at least five dates.

27
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:17,096
- You've gone up.
- Yes...

28
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:19,436
because the number of dates you wait
to have sex with a man...

29
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,101
is directly proportional
to your age.

30
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:25,510
Forget the math. Just don't fuck
on a first date, you're fine.

31
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,979
- Third date.
- Too soon.

32
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:29,949
Reality check.
A guy can just as easily dump you...

33
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:33,681
if you fuck him on the first date as
he can if you wait until the tenth.

34
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,746
When have you ever
been on a tenth date?

35
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:38,918
And by then, at least
you're emotionally involved.

36
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:41,827
I mean, isn't it better to find out
if the sex is good right offthe bat...

37
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:43,727
before anybody's feelings
get hurt?

38
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:47,063
- It's okay to have hurt feelings.
- And you always handle those so well.

39
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:49,126
Well, there is something
to be said for restraint.

40
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:52,367
- When did you become such a Victorian?
- The Victorians were onto something.

41
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,805
They valued romance.

42
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,639
True romance cannot exist
without good sex.

43
00:02:56,711 --> 00:03:00,545
And yet you can have good sex with
someone you don't like or respect...

44
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,105
or even remember.

45
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:06,780
All right. Well, ladies,
I'm just going to dinner.

46
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:10,086
- Good night.
- Bye! Have fun!

47
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:12,292
Bye!

48
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:18,155
The truth is,
I was dying to sleep with him...

49
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:21,669
but isn't delayed gratification
the definition of maturity?

50
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,370
Interesting dress.

51
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:36,713
- Meaning?
- Interesting dress.

52
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:57,896
Don't worry. I'm perfectly capable
of restraining myself.

53
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,405
So am l.

54
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,852
I can't be hemmed in by rules.
I go with my emotions.

55
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,017
Some of the greatest romances of all
time began with sex on the first date.

56
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:18,684
I bet.

57
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,092
I will not be the first one
to speak.

58
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:25,462
And if he never calls me again,
I'll always think of him fondly...

59
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,433
as an asshole.

60
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:29,470
That was really--

61
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:35,498
I mean, can you believe we--
on the first date?

62
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:37,807
I mean, I didn't plan that,
you know? l--

63
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:45,714
- What do you think?
- What? Ow!

64
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:53,558
I thought it was pretty fuckin' great,
but what do I know?

65
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,261
You feel like
getting some Szechuan?

66
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:11,768
Had Mr. Big discovered my weakness
for great sex and greasy Chinese?

67
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:14,337
Or was going out to dinner
simply a diversionary tactic...

68
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,407
to keep me
from spending the night?

69
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:19,783
Before I was able
to completely indulge my paranoia...

70
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:22,550
it was my pal Mike Singer.

71
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,559
We've known each other
for ten years but never had sex...

72
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:28,095
because we want to know each other
f or another ten years.

73
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:35,833
- What are you doing here?
- I'm with-- I'll tell you later.

74
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,804
You look great.

75
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:41,933
- Not too naked?
- Just naked enough.

76
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,206
Hi. I'm Carrie Bradshaw.
I'm an old friend of Mike's.

77
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:52,753
I'm Libby Biyalick. It's so nice
to finally meet a friend.

78
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:54,516
So I'll call ya.

79
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,984
Great.
Well, have a good dinner.

80
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,891
Nice to meet you.

81
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:04,796
I left the table wondering why Mike
didn't want to introduce me to his date.

82
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,458
Again!

83
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:14,300
That very same night, something
absolutely amazing happened to Miranda.

84
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,570
Really good now.

85
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,374
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry!

86
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,848
- I didn't mean-- Are you okay?
- She met someone in gym class.

87
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,316
Are you-- Oh, God.

88
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:28,385
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

89
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:31,220
So what exactly about my head
pissed you off?

90
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,861
I wish there was something
I could do.

91
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:39,229
Well, you can buy me dinner sometime
and a CAT scan.

92
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:44,564
His name was Ted Baker.
He was 32, a sports medicine doctor...

93
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,733
with an apartment
overlooking the Natural History Museum.

94
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:52,246
Three prior serious relationships,
none resulting in marriage.

95
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,482
Kiss to make it better.

96
00:06:56,618 --> 00:07:00,145
So, really,
can I call you sometime?

97
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,389
Sure.

98
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:08,954
He left a message
on my machine when I got home.

99
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,463
He wants to go out this week.

100
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:13,729
- That's fantastic.
- No. It's too quick.

101
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,269
I think maybe that kick in his head
scrambled his brains.

102
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:20,205
No. Too quick is sleeping with him
on the first date. That's too quick.

103
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:23,369
You both got excited, and you
went for it. Stop blaming yourself.

104
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,378
I don't blame myself.
I blame the dress.

105
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:29,940
The dress. The dress led me on,
had a lif e of its own.

106
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:33,545
Then we went to this Chinese restaurant,
and you'll never guess who I ran into.

107
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,681
- Mike Singer out on a date.
- The whole world's in love.

108
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:38,248
I'm not sure.
I don't know.

109
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:43,263
He was acting very weird, like he--
Iike he didn't want me to meet her.

110
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:46,664
- What's her name?
- Her name was Libby Biyalick.

111
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:49,931
Mike told me everything that afternoon
while I helped him pick out sheets...

112
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,494
at Bed, Bath & Beyond.

113
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:53,939
So how long
have you been seeing her?

114
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:56,203
A while.

115
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:58,040
Is this a painful topic?

116
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:01,081
No. It's just she's not
someone I date openly.

117
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,413
- Why? ls she married?
- No.

118
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,782
- Is she a cousin?
- No.

119
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:07,553
Look.

120
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:13,219
The thing is, she's smart,
incredibly sweet, and sex is great.

121
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,957
She's just not the one
I see myself with.

122
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:19,261
Why not?

123
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,461
It was about three months ago.

124
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:25,199
Mike had been dumped by Fiona Brooks,
a cellist for the Philharmonic...

125
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:28,299
who he was trying to forget
as quickly as possible.

126
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:34,076
They had both loved to cook, and
shopping was a Saturday morning ritual.

127
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:37,208
So he was feeling
particularly vulnerable when--

128
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:40,652
Care to try some aged
sheep's milk cheese from the Alps?

129
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:42,488
Thanks.

130
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,358
- It's good.
- It's made by monks.

131
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:53,662
- Really?
- Trappist monks.

132
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,667
Fresh goat cheese
from the Napa Valley.

133
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:03,667
It's delicious.

134
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,713
It's a triple cream from France.

135
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:24,197
Mike found himself
very uninhibited.

136
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,297
Since he didn't think Libby
was that gorgeous...

137
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:29,427
there wasn't any pressure.

138
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:38,077
The next morning,
he woke up and felt at ease...

139
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:39,704
very relaxed.

140
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:41,772
I'm a creative director
of an ad agency...

141
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:45,307
but eventually
I'd love to have my own shop.

142
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,685
I'd love to have my own shop too.

143
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:52,455
Well, cheese shop, I mean.

144
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:55,087
She was one of the only women
he'd ever met...

145
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:57,723
who he felt
he could just be with.

146
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,324
So what's the problem?

147
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:03,393
Look. She's not beautiful...

148
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:05,735
and we don't
have a lot in common.

149
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:08,640
I mean, most of her friends
are in dairy.

150
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,406
But she's warm
and unpretentious...

151
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:15,472
and it was the best sex
I've ever had in my life.

152
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,544
What are you afraid of?
What are other people going to think?

153
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:23,113
All I know is that she's not the right
woman for me in the larger sense...

154
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:25,625
so I keep her a secret.

155
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:30,623
I couldn't decide whether Mike
was being shallow or honest...

156
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:34,600
but the question
nagged me for days.

157
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:37,832
How many of us out there
are having great sex...

158
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,465
with people we're ashamed
to introduce to our friends?

159
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:45,112
Have I ever had fabulous sex
with someone I didn't want to admit to?

160
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:52,342
Did I ever tell you about that
jazz musician who lived with his mother?

161
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,048
- Yeah. Alex.
- What about the window washer?

162
00:10:55,123 --> 00:10:56,988
The one who doesn't
wear any underwear?

163
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:00,717
I met this gorgeous kid
in Spy Bar last year. He was--

164
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:03,025
He turned out
to be in high school.

165
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:06,862
Evidently, Samantha
had had lots of sex...

166
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,164
none of which was secret.

167
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:12,638
Fine. It just proves that I'm not
ashamed of anyone I've slept with.

168
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,935
Here it is.

169
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,376
Up here.

170
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:24,147
You look--

171
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,914
- Naked.
- There it was--

172
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:30,480
the dress that led me down
the garden path with Mr. Big.

173
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:34,358
- I shouldn't be embarrassed?
- No. You look fabulous.

174
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,828
Besides, there's no such thing
as bad publicity.

175
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,763
Yeah. You would say that.
You're a publicist.

176
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,768
You know, we need
to go someplace absolutely fabulous...

177
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:43,497
where we can toast you
where the bus goes by.

178
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:46,301
- And you can invite Mr. Big.
- No. I don't think so.

179
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,308
I haven't heard from him
since we spent the night together.

180
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:52,107
Sweetie, forget about him. You
are going to be on the side of a bus.

181
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,776
Ten million men are going to be
drooling over you on their way to work.

182
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:59,581
It's the best personal ad
I've ever seen in my life.

183
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:01,747
Samantha
had a particular knack...

184
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:04,792
for turning a desperate situation
into a hopeless one.

185
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:07,384
Speaking of secret sex...

186
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:10,430
did Charlotte ever tell you
about the rabbi?

187
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:11,487
The rabbi?

188
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:14,091
- Excuse me?
- You know who I'm talking about.

189
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:17,296
I cannot believe the two of you came
down here to interrogate me at work.

190
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:19,862
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

191
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:22,068
Anyway,
he wasn't a rabbi.

192
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,976
He was a Hasidic folk artist
from Brooklyn.

193
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:27,037
Close enough.

194
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:31,481
Evidently, Charlotte had seen
Shmuel's work in an exhibition...

195
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:34,578
and scheduled an appointment
to meet him at his studio.

196
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:39,015
These are outstanding.
So much life.

197
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,788
You have a beautiful way
with light.

198
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:43,455
Thank you.

199
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,464
This one is really special.

200
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,700
That's my yeshiva.

201
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:00,741
I wanted to
capture the exuberance of youth.

202
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:04,216
Charlotte quickly became intoxicated
by his talent...

203
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:07,516
his strangeness
and the smell of his wool.

204
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:09,021
Magical.

205
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:18,930
It was so sexy, so forbidden.

206
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,596
Daddy's little Episcopalian princess in
the arms of one of God's chosen people.

207
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:29,407
So we would talk about art and sex
and the Torah.

208
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:31,877
Why didn't you introduce him
to anybody?

209
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:33,607
I was embarrassed.

210
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:36,878
I mean, I could really date him,
and he couldn't date me.

211
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:38,782
I mean, what would people think?

212
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:41,481
If the sex is good,
who cares what anybody thinks?

213
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,853
Now, you cannot put this
in your column.

214
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:46,086
- Promise.
- I promise.

215
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,220
Was secret sex
the ultimate form of intimacy...

216
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:53,529
since it existed in a pure state
exempt from the judgment of the world?

217
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:56,263
Or is it just another way
in which we deny our feelings...

218
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,771
and emotionally
compartmentalize our lives?

219
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:06,810
- Hello?
- Do you miss me yet?

220
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:09,975
- Who is this?
- How have you been?

221
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:11,746
Great.

222
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:15,345
Fabulous. Fantastic, actually.
And you?

223
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:19,223
Well, at the risk
of sounding trite...

224
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:23,055
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

225
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:25,163
I adore trite.

226
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,962
Listen. We should
have a real first date.

227
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:34,974
You know? The traditional American kind.
Dinner and a movie.

228
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,374
Of course, knowing us,
we'll skip the movie.

229
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,470
Just as long
as we don't skip dinner.

230
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:44,714
What a relief! I had just escaped
the "sex on the first date" curse.

231
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:48,080
That weekend,
I was out with a man...

232
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,851
whose name
I wanted to shout from the rooftops.

233
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:56,056
Let me get this straight.
Your picture is going to be on a bus?

234
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,825
That's right.

235
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,662
A crosstown bus
or a downtown bus?

236
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:03,101
The M2. Goes right down Fifth.

237
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:06,196
- That's a good line.
- I'm getting together...

238
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,798
a group of my friends tomorrow afternoon
to watch it go by.

239
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:11,640
I thought maybe
if you weren't doing anything--

240
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:13,942
How are you?

241
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,650
- Good to see you.
- You remember Phyllis.

242
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,948
Of course.
Phyllis. How are you?

243
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:23,252
- Everything good?
- Yeah. Everything's dandy.

244
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:25,519
That's what I hear.

245
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:29,924
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you again.

246
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:32,295
- Good seeing you. Bye.
- Bye-bye. Cheers.

247
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:39,265
- Who was that?
- Just some guy I skied with in Aspen.

248
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,640
I didn't understand. Had I suddenly
become the invisible woman?

249
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:45,838
I tried
not to let it bother me.

250
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,107
I also tried not to let it bother me
that he took me back to Fung Wa...

251
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:52,948
scene of our postcoital dinner.

252
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,954
Oh, I can't
make your party tomorrow.

253
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:58,219
Oh, no. I wanted to introduce you
to some of my friends.

254
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,886
Well, I'll be home later
if you miss me.

255
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,261
As I surveyed the room...

256
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:08,290
I realized it smelled like a cheap date
you don't want anyone to meet.

257
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,803
I told Mr. Big I was on a deadline
and I had to get home.

258
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:16,937
- Hello?
- Listen. I have a question.

259
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:20,913
Of all the restaurants in Manhattan,
why did you take Libby to Fung Wa?

260
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,846
Well, it's pretty obscure.

261
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,010
There's not much of a chance
of running into anybody I know.

262
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:26,519
You mean it's the kind of place...

263
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:29,021
men take women they don't want
to be seen with in public?

264
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,682
Yes. It is perfect for that.

265
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,426
- Sorry.
- The evidence was mounting.

266
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:38,124
Was it possible that I
had become Mr. Big's secret sex girl?

267
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:43,726
The next morning, Miranda discovered
a shocking sex secret of her own.

268
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:46,102
She had just
spent a wonderful night with Ted...

269
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:50,109
who had to leave early in the morning to
catch a flight to D.C. for a conference.

270
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:54,511
- I can go home. It's no big deal.
- No. Stay. It's 6:00 A.M.

271
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:00,687
I'll be back tonight.
You want to do something?

272
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,120
- I'd love to.
- I'll call you at work.

273
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,818
Have a good flight.

274
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:13,833
Miranda waited
for the dead bolt to drop...

275
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:17,132
and then used the opportunity
to ransack Ted's apartment...

276
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,468
and look for pictures
of old girlfriends.

277
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,074
She was not at all prepared
for what she found.

278
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,553
Yeah. Do you feel your cock
where it wants to be every night?

279
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,786
Every single night
when you come home...

280
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,489
and everything's done in the house,
and I've been doing it all day--

281
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:46,761
I don't know what to do.
I can't admit to having found this...

282
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,394
but now I don't know
if I want to see him again.

283
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,631
How can you judge him
till you spank him?

284
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,070
- I'm only kidding.
- But obviously this is what he's into.

285
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,238
Maybe it's just his fantasy life.

286
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,143
Later that day,
the cream of New York...

287
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:07,710
gathered to toast
the maiden voyage of my bus.

288
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:10,985
- Where's Mr. Big?
- He couldn't make it.

289
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:13,526
- What do you mean, he couldn't make it?
- I don't know. It was a work thing.

290
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,722
But this is your bus party.

291
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:19,823
I told you you shouldn't have--
Well, never mind.

292
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,495
What? He's not here because
I slept with him on the first date?

293
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:26,199
Yes. When you sleep with a man
on the first date...

294
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,071
the relationship will never
be anything more than just sex.

295
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,212
- Cheers.
- I didn't want to admit she was right.

296
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,009
Here it comes!

297
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:37,346
I just wanted to see my bus
and get the hell out of there.

298
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,310
Oh, shit.

299
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:44,118
Carrie! Did I miss it?

300
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,557
Not yet. No. I thought
you were going to bring Libby.

301
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:50,085
Yeah. I finally ask her
to join me in public; she turns me down.

302
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:51,529
Why?

303
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,432
She told me she met somebody else who
doesn't have my problems with intimacy.

304
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,866
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,563
Quiet.

306
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,162
Here you come.

307
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,245
Don't worry, sweetie.
Don't worry.

308
00:19:13,354 --> 00:19:16,915
Nobody in New York notices a bus
until it's about to him them.

309
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:19,152
That's right.

310
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:23,094
Meanwhile, Miranda spent
another wonderful evening with Ted...

311
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,358
and began
to reevaluate her options.

312
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:30,460
That was one of the most amazing meals
I have ever had. Thank you.

313
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,129
My pleasure.

314
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,000
You know, I missed you today.

315
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:38,803
You did?

316
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:43,139
I guess I've just been waiting all
this time for a good kick in the head.

317
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:47,278
And here I thought that all
you really wanted was a good spanking.

318
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:51,790
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

319
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:05,401
Ted didn't take Miranda home
that night.

320
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:08,737
He never took her calls
or returned her messages....

321
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,175
and she never saw him
at the gym again.

322
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:18,583
Very late that night, fueled by
a massive quantity of champagne...

323
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:21,450
I decided
to say good-bye to Mr. Big.

324
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:29,619
I just came here to tell you that
if you're embarrassed...

325
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:32,962
or ashamed to be
involved with me in any way...

326
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,365
that we can no longer
see each other.

327
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:37,768
The truth is, I blame myself.

328
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:40,170
I wore the naked dress
on our first date.

329
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,435
I slept with him too f ast...

330
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,740
and now I'm on a Fifth Avenue bus
with a penis on my head.

331
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:51,546
-What are you talking about?
-You won't introduce me to your friends.

332
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,677
You bring me back
to that restaurant...

333
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,881
where men take women
they don't want to be seen with.

334
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,355
You won't come out
and meet my friends.

335
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:03,260
You have me in a niche. Certain events.
Certain restaurants. Certain people.

336
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,596
Like I'm only a particular fragment
of the kind of person...

337
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:10,000
you think you should be dating.

338
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:14,465
But I've only
gotten to know a particular fragment...

339
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,135
although I'm beginning
to know more.

340
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:21,875
No. This is not me. This is me
reacting to your perception of me.

341
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:28,149
Well...

342
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:32,924
I think Fung Wa's
is the best Chinese food in the city...

343
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:35,018
so that's why we went there.

344
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:36,357
And...

345
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:42,293
the guy we met in the street,
and I couldn't remember his name--

346
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,360
which possibly means
I have Alzheimer's--

347
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:46,201
so that's what that was about.

348
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:51,336
And this afternoon I had
courtside tickets to the Knicks...

349
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:56,907
and that's all, folks.

350
00:21:56,984 --> 00:22:01,887
I should have been jumping f r joy,
but I only felt a hard knot of fear.

351
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,392
So you and me--

352
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,855
then maybe this is for real?

353
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:15,960
Could be.
