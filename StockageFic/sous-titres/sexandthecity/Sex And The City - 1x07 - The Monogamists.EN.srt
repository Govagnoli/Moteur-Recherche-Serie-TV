1
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,907
The island of Manhattan
is a cozy village...

2
00:00:48,978 --> 00:00:52,573
populated by more than seven million
fascinating individuals...

3
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:55,048
who all behave like they own
the sidewalk.

4
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:58,211
But lately it seemed
as if the entire city...

5
00:00:58,287 --> 00:01:01,222
had been magically reduced
to only two people--

6
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,518
us.

7
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:06,028
Four-hour conversations flew by
in a space of 15 minutes...

8
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:08,188
and a few days apart
felt like weeks.

9
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:10,391
I realize that Einstein's
Law of Relativity...

10
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:13,526
would have to be amended
to include a special set of rules--

11
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:17,130
those to explain
the peculiar effects of infatuation.

12
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:20,335
- Hello?
- Hi.

13
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:23,708
I'm trying to get a hold of
a Miss Carrie Bradshaw.

14
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:26,111
- She used to be a friend of mine.
- Good morning.

15
00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:29,174
Wait. I think I recognize that voice.

16
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:31,948
I can't believe it's been so long.
I've been meaning to call you.

17
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:34,216
- I've just been--
- Fucking your brains out?

18
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,520
That's the least of it.
You know what?

19
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:40,323
I don't think that I have been
hit this hard since--

20
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:44,423
I won't compare it to anything, because
everything else has always ended.

21
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,400
Will I get to see you sometime?

22
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:47,936
Absolutely. How about tonight?

23
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:51,269
- Tonight will work.
- I'll call Charlotte and Samantha...

24
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,333
see if they're free, 'cause Big's got
this dinner thing, so we had no plans.

25
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:56,901
God, would you listen to yourself?

26
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,676
Yeah, I know. I've become
one of those women we hate.

27
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,810
Yes, you have. I can't talk now.
I'll call you later. Okay?

28
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:05,217
All right. Bye.

29
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:08,780
As I hung up, I realized
I'd committed the cardinal sin--

30
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:12,021
I'd forsaken my girlfriends
for my new boyfriend.

31
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:15,658
That night I faced the tribunal.

32
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:17,255
We really weren't that concerned.

33
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,131
Just completely hurt and off ended.

34
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:22,466
Actually, you missed a lot.

35
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:24,267
I know. I am trying--

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,832
Miranda had worked on
a big successful merger.

37
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,744
Samantha was obsessed with the idea
of a new apartment.

38
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:33,441
And Charlotte--

39
00:02:33,516 --> 00:02:36,417
Charlotte was practically engaged.

40
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:39,283
They met the day after
I dropped off the edge of the earth.

41
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:42,518
His name was Michael Conway.
He was from a good New York family...

42
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:44,957
and he absolutely adored Charlotte.

43
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:48,995
I think this might be it.
I think this might be the one.

44
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:51,465
We've met him.
He's perfect.

45
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:53,559
Even his fucking dog is perfect.

46
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:57,333
But there is one thing.

47
00:02:58,107 --> 00:03:01,099
Last night after Michael took Charlotte
to the Philharmonic...

48
00:03:01,177 --> 00:03:05,705
they went back to his place
and began the classic dating ritual--

49
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:07,715
the blow job tug of war.

50
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:20,591
- Come on.
- Not tonight.

51
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:23,723
When?

52
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:25,027
Sometime.

53
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:27,262
The truth is...

54
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:29,031
I hate doing it.

55
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:31,039
Honey, you can't be serious.

56
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:33,098
Are you telling us
you never perform this act?

57
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:36,076
She'll juggle, she'll spin plates,
but she won't give head.

58
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:39,637
I don't like putting it in my mouth.
I have a very sensitive gag reflex...

59
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:41,376
and it makes me wanna puke.

60
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,044
- That's one way to say no.
- It's not like I haven't tried.

61
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,588
I practiced on a banana.

62
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:49,783
I pretended it was a popsicle,
but I just don't like it.

63
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,260
Personally, I'm loving it up to the
point where the guy wants me to swallow.

64
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,921
That's just a judgment call.

65
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:57,465
Some men just take it
so personally if you don't.

66
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,763
Some guys don't give you a choice.

67
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:02,633
- That's just bad behavior.
- You honestly like it?

68
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:06,698
It's not my favorite thing on the menu,
but I'll order it from time to time...

69
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:08,869
and with the right guy...

70
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,138
it can be nice.

71
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:15,479
Oral sex is God's gift to women. You can
get off without a worry of pregnancy.

72
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:17,451
Plus, the sense of power
is such a turn-on.

73
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,580
Maybe you're on your knees,
but you got 'em by the balls.

74
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:25,025
Now, you see, that is the reason
that I don't wanna go down this road.

75
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:28,154
Sweetheart, if you're gonna get
all choked up about it...

76
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,925
just don't do it.

77
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:33,093
But if you don't go down on him,
how do you expect him to go down on you?

78
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,602
I don't.

79
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,104
Oh, well, forget it!

80
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:39,334
- I only give head to get head.
- Me too.

81
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,912
A few hours and a couple of bottles
of Pinot Grigio later...

82
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:50,349
and vows of friendship renewed,
we were almost out the door when--

83
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:53,183
Hey, isn't that Mr. Big?

84
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,452
Oh, I'm gonna go over and say hi.

85
00:04:57,526 --> 00:04:59,994
Ditching us now
would be really bad form.

86
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:01,791
I'm not gonna ditch you.

87
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:07,432
Surprise.

88
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:10,631
Hey, Carrie.
How are you?

89
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:14,039
Good. Good. I was just here
with my posse having dinner...

90
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,167
and I saw you.

91
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:22,074
Carrie, this is Julia Woods.
Julia, Carrie Bradshaw.

92
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:24,051
- Let's go.
- Nice to meet you.

93
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:28,953
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

94
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:29,956
Excuse me.

95
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:35,257
Are you on a date?

96
00:05:35,331 --> 00:05:37,060
Sort of.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,491
I thought you said you had
a business thing tonight.

98
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,799
I said a "dinner thing."

99
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:46,433
She's stunning. And I should know,
because, frankly, she stunned me.

100
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,602
Well, enjoy your dinner.

101
00:05:48,677 --> 00:05:50,804
Are you okay?

102
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,508
Sure. I was just--

103
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:56,346
I just didn't realize
you were dating other women.

104
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:58,147
Not a lot of other women.

105
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:01,887
- Why don't we talk about this Saturday?
- Sure, sure, sure.

106
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:04,858
So, then, enjoy your dinner.

107
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,157
I already said that.
Well, enjoy it twice.

108
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:08,526
Here we go.

109
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:15,630
I can't believe it.
He's seeing other women.

110
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:17,296
Prick.

111
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:21,935
True, we had never
discussed exclusivity.

112
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,571
But while for me the idea of
seeing another man would be like...

113
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:28,208
trying to fit another outfit
into an already overstuffed suitcase...

114
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:30,343
Big was happily dating another woman...

115
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,013
Iike it was the most natural thing
in the world.

116
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:36,114
Is it that men have an innate aversion
to monogamy...

117
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:38,125
or is it more than that?

118
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:39,820
I wondered.

119
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:43,262
In a city like New York
with its infinite possibilities...

120
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:46,563
has monogamy become
too much to expect?

121
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:49,763
I've been involved in a monogamous
relationship for over a year now.

122
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:52,136
It's been wonderfully fulfilling.

123
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:55,904
Of course, my definition of monogamy
includes sex with prostitutes.

124
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:59,937
The problem with monogamy,
it's just so incredibly dull.

125
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:02,245
My lover and I have a kind of
'90s monogamy.

126
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:06,414
We have sex with other people, but we
don't exchange fluids or phone numbers.

127
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:09,146
Hello.

128
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:12,785
Monogamy is fabulous. It gives you
a deep and profound connection...

129
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:16,194
to another human being and you don't
have to shave your legs as much.

130
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,367
Of course, I'm monogamous.

131
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:21,232
Why? What have you heard?

132
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:24,566
This is the C-line.
This is the best in the building.

133
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,473
Have you ever seen any place like this?
ls this to die?

134
00:07:27,543 --> 00:07:29,408
It's nice.

135
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:31,173
Hold this.

136
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:32,838
Just a second.

137
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,343
Excuse me. Excuse me.

138
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:39,353
Was someone looking for a view?

139
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:41,946
Pamela, it's beautiful,
but it's a little out of my price--

140
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:44,219
I know, I know, so sue me.

141
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:46,284
I just love to show
the creme de la creme.

142
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:48,353
I will break my ass for you,
sweetheart.

143
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,955
I just wanna ask you
for one small favor in return.

144
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,295
My first born?

145
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:57,800
No, sweetheart.
I don't even want my own kids.

146
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:00,273
Promise me that you won't work
with any other broker.

147
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:02,105
Of course.

148
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:04,611
Samantha didn't believe in monogamy...

149
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,114
especially when it came
to real estate agents.

150
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:10,777
This is a prewar 6.
Notice the classic lines.

151
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:12,514
Very solidly built.

152
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:15,682
Although Pamela had
the hottest contacts in town...

153
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:18,727
Rick did have a slight
competitive edge.

154
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:22,389
He gave Samantha the opportunity
to combine her two greatest loves--

155
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:24,591
sex and real estate.

156
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,659
That afternoon I dragged
my poor tortured soul...

157
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:29,829
out to lunch with Stanford Blatch...

158
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:32,897
and attempted to stun it senseless
with cosmopolitans.

159
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:35,466
Monogamy is on the way out again.

160
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:39,640
It had a brief comeback in the 90s,
but as the millennium approaches...

161
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:41,979
everyone's leaving
their options open.

162
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:44,349
You wouldn't commit
to a nice guy given the option?

163
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,718
I can't even commit
to a long distance carrier.

164
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:49,417
You know what you are?
You're a whore.

165
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,686
I wish that were true.

166
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:55,121
Jared, how are you?

167
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:57,529
My book just got a kick-ass review
in Entertainment Weekly.

168
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,657
How marvelous.

169
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:01,726
Jared, have you met Carrie Bradshaw?

170
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:04,830
No, but I've read your column.
Nice shit.

171
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:06,067
Thanks.

172
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:08,803
You should write about me.
My life is so fucked up right now.

173
00:09:08,877 --> 00:09:12,335
Carrie, Jared is the writer
of the book Avenue B.

174
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:16,043
And New York magazine just named him
one of the 30 coolest people...

175
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:17,779
under 30 in the city.

176
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:19,878
Wow. What an honor.

177
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:22,219
If they were doing
the 30 sexiest women under 30...

178
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,259
I'm sure you'd go
right to the top of the list.

179
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:26,021
You're quite the storyteller.

180
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:27,992
That's no lie.

181
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,725
The magazine's throwing us a party
tomorrow night at Luna.

182
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:33,290
- I'll put your names at the door.
- Thanks.

183
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,962
- So you'll be there?
- I'll do my best.

184
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:37,562
Groovy.

185
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:46,881
What was happening to me?
I used to get a secret rush...

186
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:50,043
from men who hit on me
during their 15 minutes of fame.

187
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:53,418
In this case,
it merely felt exhausting.

188
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,396
I'm just calling to confirm
tomorrow night. Are we still on?

189
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:10,097
Yeah, of course we are.
Why wouldn't we be?

190
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:14,575
I was striving for noncommittal, but I
was worried I had bordered on shrill.

191
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:15,769
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

192
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,737
Yeah, 8:00's fine.

193
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:20,880
I miss you, baby.

194
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:23,749
Yeah, me too.

195
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:27,380
There were so many questions I wanted
him to answer, but would not ask.

196
00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:29,219
Not tonight at least. Nope.

197
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,555
Tonight I would ask Miranda.

198
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:33,117
He said, "I miss you, baby."

199
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:36,596
Do you think that was meant to be
some kind of coded mea culpa?

200
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:40,124
You mean like what he really meant was,
"I've been a complete idiot.

201
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:42,295
Please forgive me for having dinner
with that other woman"?

202
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:44,430
- Exactly.
- Could be.

203
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:46,804
No, 'cause that would mean
everything he ever said...

204
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,469
that I interpreted as sincere
is subject to interpretation.

205
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:52,241
In that case, what I perceive
as his feelings for me may only be...

206
00:10:52,314 --> 00:10:55,249
reflected projections
of my feelings for him.

207
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:56,477
What?

208
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:00,252
Oh, God. I'm freaking.
I got to stop.

209
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,961
Hey, you guys. Great to see you.
What are you up to?

210
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,156
Just hanging.

211
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:12,826
Allison, this is Miranda and Carrie.
Miranda and Carrie, this is Allison.

212
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:16,098
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

213
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:20,267
Me too. We're all such big fans
of your column over at Vogue.

214
00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:22,936
- You work at Vogue?
- Designer relations.

215
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:25,775
Skipper and I just had
the most incredible meal.

216
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:27,782
This little hole in the wall.

217
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,648
This darling French bistro
that I am telling you...

218
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:34,018
I lived a year in Paris
and never ate so well, and cheap.

219
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:35,181
Really?

220
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:38,055
Go quick before the Times
destroys it with a rave.

221
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:40,959
- It was great to see you guys.
- Great meeting you.

222
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:43,054
- You too.
- Good night.

223
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,930
Who was that self-important bitch?

224
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:49,300
I think that was
Skipper's new girlfriend.

225
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:51,305
She seemed all right.

226
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:54,240
I didn't think that was his type.

227
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:57,904
That's true. You're his type,
but you broke up with him, remember?

228
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,244
Something looks different.

229
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:03,045
Has he been working out?

230
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:21,593
Hey, Skipper here.
Leave me a message.

231
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,537
Hi, Skipper, it's Miranda.

232
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:27,803
I just wanted to say
it was great running into you today.

233
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:28,934
And...

234
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:30,444
you looked great.

235
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:33,481
Did you do something different
to your hair?

236
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:34,981
Hello, Miranda.

237
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:38,815
I can't talk right now.

238
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:42,414
That's okay.
I just wanted to say...

239
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:45,392
maybe, you know, I thought
we could have dinner some night.

240
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,791
Seriously?

241
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:49,262
I miss you.

242
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:52,091
I'll call you later.

243
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:55,599
Is everything okay?

244
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:58,265
Allison, I think you're great...

245
00:13:00,075 --> 00:13:02,339
but I've gotta be
totally honest with you.

246
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:06,780
The woman who I think I love
just called and asked me back.

247
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,277
You're breaking up with me
while you're still inside of me?

248
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:16,780
As Skipper rededicated his
singular affection for Miranda...

249
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:19,759
Charlotte was receiving
her own declaration of monogamy.

250
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:24,265
What do you think about
not seeing anyone else but each other?

251
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,801
- Really?
- Yeah.

252
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:28,859
That might be a good idea.

253
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:31,872
I think it's the best idea
I ever had in my life.

254
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,966
Well, in that case,
absolutely.

255
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,905
And while Charlotte
embraced fidelity...

256
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:41,609
and Samantha flaunted
her infidelity...

257
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:46,513
I found myself caught somewhere
in between.

258
00:13:46,588 --> 00:13:49,284
So, whose very crowded apartment
are we in?

259
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:52,384
Max. He's an old friend of mine.
Remember, Becky's his second wife.

260
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:55,919
- She's a doll. You'll love her.
- Hey, there, stranger.

261
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:57,295
Melissa.

262
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,163
This is Carrie Bradshaw.

263
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:02,499
- Hi. Love your column. Never miss it.
- Wow. Thanks.

264
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:06,337
I've been trying to call you.
You still have my passport.

265
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,808
She's a friend
I once traveled with.

266
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,847
Internationally, I would imagine.

267
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:16,380
Let's find Max.

268
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,225
Excuse me.

269
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:27,227
Glad you could make it.
How are you?

270
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:30,287
I want you to meet someone
very special.

271
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:32,964
Julia.

272
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:34,798
Actually, it's Carrie.

273
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:37,797
Carrie. Well, welcome.

274
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:40,603
Carrie writes this fantastic column
in the New York Star.

275
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:43,473
It's called "Sex and the City."

276
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:46,605
If you're looking for material,
you're dating the right man.

277
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:48,581
Thank you, Max.

278
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,277
Thank you very much.

279
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:53,321
Are we dating? I thought
we were just sleeping together.

280
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:56,949
Well, I'm sure after tonight
we won't be doing much of either.

281
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:58,652
Excuse me.

282
00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:00,661
I'll be right back.

283
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,024
You've got to be kidding.

284
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:07,659
How many women are you dating?

285
00:15:07,736 --> 00:15:09,465
In the tristate area?

286
00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:12,837
Let's see, there's me, Julia...

287
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:15,570
and let's not forget
"International Melissa."

288
00:15:15,644 --> 00:15:18,511
- I'm not doing this here.
- Fine.

289
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,605
Can't we just enjoy the party?

290
00:15:20,682 --> 00:15:22,616
I don't know.

291
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:27,213
Come on. I mean,
what do you want from me?

292
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:29,052
What do I want from you?

293
00:15:32,494 --> 00:15:34,485
Nothing.

294
00:15:34,563 --> 00:15:36,758
I don't want anything from you.

295
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:38,766
I have to go.
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:42,497
I felt like a fool. I had gone so far
out on a limb with my feelings...

297
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:45,563
that I didn't realize
I was standing out there alone.

298
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:51,044
When life gets this confusing,
sometimes there's only one thing to do--

299
00:15:51,113 --> 00:15:53,104
attend a fabulous party.

300
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:01,488
Hey, Stanford.

301
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:04,889
Carrie! What a surprise.

302
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,723
- Where's--
- Don't ask.

303
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:08,126
What happened?

304
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:10,926
- He became predictable.
- How predictable.

305
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:13,797
- Hey, you made it.
- Hey, Jared.

306
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:17,669
- I'll get you a drink.
- Cosmopolitan. Thanks.

307
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:21,175
In a room where everyone was gorgeous,
cool and under 30...

308
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:24,610
monogamy suddenly began to seem
like a quaint notion.

309
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:28,413
That was, like, so great.

310
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:32,846
Don't you just wanna
lie like this forever?

311
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:35,185
Well, for a few minutes anyway.

312
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:38,089
I missed you.

313
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,095
I want you to know that that
other woman doesn't mean a thing to me.

314
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:44,496
That's all right.
I don't mind if you keep seeing her.

315
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:48,400
Oh, God, no. I broke up with her
the second that you called.

316
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:51,935
Skipper, you didn't
have to do that.

317
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:53,201
Of course I did.

318
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:56,267
I was so happy to hear from you,
that we were still doing it...

319
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:59,677
while I was talking to you
and I didn't even realize it.

320
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:01,409
You're kidding, right?

321
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,280
No. Isn't that crazy?

322
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:07,014
Yeah, that's exactly what it is,
crazy.

323
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:08,646
Listen, Skipper...

324
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:12,181
I'm not ready for a full-blown
relationship thing.

325
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:14,293
What?

326
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:18,492
I mean, we can see each other
and still see other people.

327
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:19,966
Right?

328
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:21,798
No, we can't.

329
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,269
At least I can't.

330
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:27,136
Why did you call me back anyway?

331
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:29,837
I'm sorry. I thought--

332
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:34,211
I'm not your private stud horse,
Miss Dial A Fuck.

333
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:37,382
Come here.
Come back.

334
00:17:37,452 --> 00:17:39,386
I'm tired of being jerked around.

335
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:42,423
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

336
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:47,360
While Miranda misjudged
the intensity of Skipper's feelings...

337
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:50,489
Michael left Charlotte
no doubt about his.

338
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:52,556
You're amazing.

339
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:55,660
You've got everything
I'm looking for...

340
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:58,831
and I've never found before
in one woman--

341
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:01,501
brains, taste, class...

342
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:08,978
and you're very, very sexy.

343
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,642
Thank you.

344
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:27,929
What's the problem?

345
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:29,470
I hate doing it.

346
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:32,832
You hate giving blow jobs?

347
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:36,771
It's not that big of a deal,
is it?

348
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:39,780
Well, sort of.

349
00:18:39,848 --> 00:18:41,975
Can't you just do it for me?

350
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,144
Would you really want me
to do something I didn't wanna do?

351
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,415
You'll get used to it.

352
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,359
No, I won't.

353
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:54,088
I never have.
Sorry.

354
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:58,690
Well, I plan on getting a lot
of blow jobs in the future...

355
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,860
and I'm hoping that you're around
when I get them.

356
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:03,267
What's that supposed to mean?

357
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:05,829
It means I'll have to find them
somewhere else.

358
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:09,810
You're telling me...

359
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:12,540
that you would give up a woman
who really cares f or you...

360
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:15,947
who would share your hopes
and your fears and your dreams...

361
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:18,485
the future possible mother
of your children...

362
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,214
all for a blow job?

363
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,550
You're right.

364
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,788
Will you at least
lick my balls?

365
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:29,090
Good-bye, Michael.

366
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,631
Michael was upset,
but Butterscotch seemed pleased.

367
00:19:35,704 --> 00:19:39,196
She was finally back
in her monogamous relationship.

368
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:43,271
Half-past midnight
in a city that never sleeps...

369
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:45,643
neither did the real estate market.

370
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:47,511
It's beautiful.

371
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:48,981
Isn't it?

372
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,984
It went on the market at midnight...

373
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:53,816
and you're the first one to see it.

374
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:56,152
Two bedrooms, prewar...

375
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:58,454
fireplace and views.

376
00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:00,187
Everything you wanted.

377
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:03,287
I love it.
I really love it.

378
00:20:03,365 --> 00:20:04,593
I knew you would.

379
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,327
Let's celebrate.

380
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,588
Oh, my God!

381
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:37,859
I can't believe that you are working
with another broker.

382
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:41,095
I can't believe you weren't
gonna show me this apartment.

383
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:55,074
2:00 a.m. and I already had
a new man in my life.

384
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,516
You know the greatest thing
about writing a successful book?

385
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,576
Besides the validation and acclaim.

386
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:02,623
Knowing that I'm pumping my ideas
into the world.

387
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,420
I thought it was the fact that you
could behave like an utter asshole...

388
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:07,825
and people would find you amusing.

389
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:10,660
I'm, like, in love with you,
you know that?

390
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:13,360
I'm, like,
fucking in love with you.

391
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:17,360
Will you go home with me tonight?

392
00:21:18,206 --> 00:21:21,141
Give me a minute.
I just have to make a call.

393
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:31,110
I just wanted to let you know
I'm at this very cool party...

394
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:35,213
for very cool people under 30 and this
very cool writer wants to take me home.

395
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,487
- What? What the hell happened to you?
- His name is Jared.

396
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,428
He's really cute
and really successful...

397
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:45,990
and he just put his arms
around me.

398
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:48,558
Here. Say hello, Jared.

399
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:51,366
- Hello, Jared.
- That was Jared.

400
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:53,669
Carrie, just get over here.

401
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:54,935
You get over here.

402
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:57,500
I can't.
I don't know where you are.

403
00:21:57,579 --> 00:22:01,675
I am the Luna Park Cafe. Meet me
out front. Your name's not on the list.

404
00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:05,919
Forty-five minutes later...

405
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:09,081
I realized I was alone in a park
at 3:00 a.m...

406
00:22:09,157 --> 00:22:11,648
and that it was time
to call it a night.

407
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:15,958
What are you doing back here?
You said to meet out front.

408
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,759
This is the front.

409
00:22:17,832 --> 00:22:21,359
This isn't the front.
This is the back.

410
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:24,269
I've been waiting out front
for 30 goddamn minutes.

411
00:22:25,173 --> 00:22:29,075
You see those doors? That's the front.
You were waiting at the street entrance.

412
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:31,703
The street entrance
is the front entrance.

413
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:33,713
Depending on where
you're coming from.

414
00:22:38,353 --> 00:22:41,754
I'm here.
Now, what's going on?

415
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:47,351
I've done the merry-go-round.
I've been through the revolving door.

416
00:22:47,428 --> 00:22:51,922
I feel like I met somebody I can
stand still with for a minute and...

417
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:56,028
Don't you wanna stand still
with me?

418
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,236
You drag me out here at 3:00 a.m. to
ask me if I wanna stand still with you?

419
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:20,987
In a city of infinite options...

420
00:23:21,062 --> 00:23:25,192
sometimes there's no better feeling
than knowing you only have one.
