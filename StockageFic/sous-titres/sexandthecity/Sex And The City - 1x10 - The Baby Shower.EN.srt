1
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,014
Let's be honest.

2
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:53,858
Sometimes there is nothing harder in
life than being happy for somebody else.

3
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:59,128
Like lottery winners or extremely
successful people who are 27.

4
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:01,963
Then there's that hell on Earth...

5
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:04,835
that only your closest friends
can inflict on you--

6
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:09,272
the baby shower.

7
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:12,871
You could not drag me to that thing
if you put a grappling hook in my mouth.

8
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:17,214
I think it's sad the way she's using
a child to validate her existence.

9
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,119
Exactly. Why can't she just use sex
and a nice cocktail like the rest of us?

10
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:22,918
I'm happy for her.

11
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:27,257
If I see another crepe paper stork,
I'm gonna rip its cardboard beak off.

12
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,991
Can I ask you,
would any baby shower bother you...

13
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:33,660
or is this one worse
because it's Laney's?

14
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:42,733
Laney Berlin.
You can't really describe her.

15
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,904
You just had to know her.

16
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:49,077
Chances are eight years ago
you probably did.

17
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:54,845
So help me,
she fucks on my couch, she buys it.

18
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:57,357
Isn't that how
you got the couch from me?

19
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:59,360
Laney, show us your tits!

20
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:02,693
Give it a rest!
You guys have seen enough of my tits.

21
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,024
Tits! Tits! Tits!

22
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:10,402
Laney did A&R for a record label...

23
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:13,703
or, as she used to call it,
sex with an expense account.

24
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:17,871
Every time she went on a scouting trip,
she came back with some hot new group...

25
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:21,211
and a gynecological condition
no one had ever heard of.

26
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:25,219
Those things make so many public
appearances, they need a booking agent.

27
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:32,754
Look at her, the poster girl
for low self-esteem.

28
00:02:32,828 --> 00:02:35,763
I have low self-esteem,
but I express it the healthy way--

29
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:37,992
by eating a box
of Double Stuff Oreos.

30
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,397
She's so sad.

31
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,328
Take it off!

32
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,598
Samantha and Laney had
a long-standing rivalry.

33
00:02:48,677 --> 00:02:51,339
Both wild, both sexy...

34
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:53,711
both incredibly insecure.

35
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:58,446
Two years ago, Laney did
the most shocking thing of all.

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,080
She met a Wall Street
investment banker, married him...

37
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:02,987
and moved to Connecticut.

38
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,288
That wasn't supposed to happen.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,352
She was supposed to have sex
with Sid Vicious and move to heroin.

40
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:13,763
It'll be fun. We've never even been
to visit her in Connecticut.

41
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:15,860
Exactly.
There's a reason for that.

42
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:17,905
- Lyme disease?
- That's another good one.

43
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:20,840
- It's a baby shower.
- No, it's a cult.

44
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,776
- A cult? What are you talking about?
- Listen.

45
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:26,279
They all think the same,
dress the same...

46
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:29,442
and sacrifice themselves
to the same cause-- babies.

47
00:03:29,518 --> 00:03:30,780
She's insane.

48
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:35,255
I've lost two sisters to the motherhood.
I know what I'm talking about.

49
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:37,814
We should go.
It's the right thing to do.

50
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,326
Give me one reason.

51
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:42,921
Okay. You're driving down the road.
You see a sign.

52
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:45,694
It says "two-headed snake."
You pull over.

53
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,463
Wild Laney is having a baby shower.
You pull over.

54
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:51,335
She's got a point.
It's the right thing to do.

55
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:55,467
Just imagine how fat she must be.

56
00:03:55,544 --> 00:04:00,072
As I penciled in the date,
I noticed something missing.

57
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:03,584
In between the Versace show
and dinner at Moomba...

58
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:05,449
there it wasn't--

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,579
my period, four days late.

60
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:11,993
That Saturday,
also known as "Seven Days Late"...

61
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,154
four city girls set off
to visit the country mice.

62
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,323
Are we there yet?

63
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:23,004
I've already had two of these,
so we're gonna be stopping a lot.

64
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:26,939
Hey, nice outfit. Is there gonna be
belly dancing at the shower?

65
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:29,033
Right after the gifts.

66
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,273
Shit! I spaced.
I forgot to buy her a present.

67
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,245
How tacky is it to give
the mother-to-be a fistful of cash?

68
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,481
Don't worry about it.
You can go in on mine.

69
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:42,352
You bought a pregnant woman
a bottle of Scotch?

70
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:44,358
The invitation said BYOB.

71
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:46,587
That meant "bring your own baby."

72
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,891
- What did you get her?
- Condoms.

73
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:53,697
- Seriously, what did you get her?
- Seriously. They're pastel.

74
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:55,929
Hey, guys! Wait, wait!

75
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,438
Hey, guys, wait for me!

76
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,805
Oh, my God!
Look at the size of that thing.

77
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:05,108
- We could drive that to Connecticut.
- I'm putting my name on that card.

78
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,047
All right.
Go, go, go, go.

79
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:15,047
Does anybody know how to drive?

80
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:23,727
As I turned the midsize coupe
onto Hollyhock Lane...

81
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:26,733
I was struck by how a place
so filled with nature...

82
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,827
could look so unnatural.

83
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,742
Oh, Toto, I don't think
we're in Manhattan anymore.

84
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:45,852
Her house is beautiful!

85
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:48,719
Oh, and look at her dog!

86
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,190
Hey, boy!
Come here, boy!

87
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:52,886
Come on, boy!

88
00:05:57,832 --> 00:05:59,595
Why didn't he come?

89
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:01,431
Invisible electric fencing.

90
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:04,097
It's the latest thing.
My sister has it.

91
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:07,872
Ready, girls?

92
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:09,376
Let's go.

93
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:17,117
Charlotte sweetie,
don't forget our gift.

94
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:33,058
- Look at you! You're huge!
- I know.

95
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:36,103
Isn't it great?
I can eat anything I want. Jealous?

96
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:38,702
Come on in. Come in.

97
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,236
Brigid, Roxanne, these are
my friends from the city.

98
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,245
We didn't think you'd make it.

99
00:06:45,313 --> 00:06:47,781
We got lost.
We took the wrong bridge.

100
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:50,647
Remember that feeling,
like if you left Manhattan...

101
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:52,414
you'd fall off
the edge of the earth?

102
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:54,717
Oh, God, don't remind me.

103
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:59,923
Oh, my God!
It's the Bellini baby basket!

104
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:01,758
Oh, look, everybody!

105
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,799
It's the Bellini baby basket!

106
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:09,064
Speaking of Bellinis,
I'm gonna have a big drink.

107
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,570
Jealous?

108
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:15,472
Is she still barhopping
and bed-hopping?

109
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:18,205
It's so sad
when that's all you have.

110
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,305
Okay, this is Rebecca...

111
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:24,147
- Susan...
- Hello.

112
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:25,618
Mindy.

113
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:28,281
Don't get up.
She's doing in vitro.

114
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:31,450
She's not supposed to move at all.

115
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:33,426
That's Betsy and her boy Harry.

116
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,429
They're inseparable.
They do everything together.

117
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,863
We call them
our old married couple.

118
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:41,368
Except it's not that funny since Betsy
and her husband are getting divorced.

119
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:43,370
Laney, we need you!

120
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:49,708
So all I have to do to meet
the ideal man is give birth to him.

121
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:52,872
I love my son.
Andy is 11months old.

122
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:56,144
He is a god,
and I tell him so every day.

123
00:07:58,953 --> 00:08:01,786
Thirty years from now,
what do you think the chances are...

124
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,882
that some woman's gonna be able
to make Andy happy?

125
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,722
I'm gonna go with zero.

126
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:13,100
Oh, it's adorable!

127
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:14,829
Look at that Charlotte.

128
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:17,667
I wish they made this in my size.

129
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:20,173
I told you, it's a cult.
We can't separate.

130
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,709
Once they isolate you from the herd,
it's all over.

131
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:26,205
As I watched Laney
tear open a baby bib...

132
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:28,215
with the same enthusiasm
she once reserved...

133
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:30,342
for tearing off rock stars' pants...

134
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:32,909
I couldn't help but wonder...

135
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:34,978
"Was I next?"

136
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:39,556
You know what?
I have to pee.

137
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:42,994
If you're not back in five minutes,
I'm coming after you.

138
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:49,303
The truth is,
I needed to escape.

139
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,930
The party had turned
into a preview...

140
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:54,941
a preview of a life
I didn't know if I was ready for.

141
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:05,512
Even seven months pregnant,
Laney couldn't keep her clothes on.

142
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,818
Clearly, a part of the old Laney
had survived.

143
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,358
But I wondered,
what was still buried...

144
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,020
deep inside the mommies downstairs?

145
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,690
Before I married my husband,
I slept around with everybody.

146
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,859
Now I have an lnternet lover.

147
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,527
No one knows.

148
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:28,542
When I was senior vice president,
212 people reported to me daily.

149
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,874
Now I just yell at the gardener...

150
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,140
who doesn't understand
a single word.

151
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:38,115
I'm exactly the same.
I love my life.

152
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:42,555
But every now and then,
I can't help but think about...

153
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,285
Lisa.

154
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:48,056
Sometimes I climb up
into the kids' tree house...

155
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,792
with my Walkman,
light up a joint...

156
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:53,834
and listen to Peter Frampton.

157
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,678
There's a woman in there breast-feeding
a child who can chew steak.

158
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:15,188
You know how I feel about that?

159
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:18,692
If you can ask for it,
you're probably too old to have it.

160
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,421
Jeremy, no!

161
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:23,424
I just realized...

162
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,433
maybe it's maturity
or the wisdom that comes with age...

163
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,995
but the witch in Hansel and Gretel,
she's very misunderstood.

164
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:34,041
I mean, the woman builds
her dream house...

165
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:37,703
and these brats come along
and start eating it.

166
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,173
I just have to tell you
your home is beautiful.

167
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:46,687
Thank you.
I know it's a big change.

168
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:50,019
But at some point,
you have to settle down.

169
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:52,582
I mean, life is not
a Jacqueline Susann novel--

170
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,959
four friends looking
for life and love in the big city.

171
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:02,134
Stop it! You are not going
to clean up at your own shower.

172
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,902
Relax, 'cause once Todd or Shayla comes
around, you'll never stop cleaning up.

173
00:11:06,975 --> 00:11:08,943
Shayla? Did you say Shayla?

174
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,309
- It's so unique, isn't it?
- It's so my name!

175
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:16,216
- I thought your name was Charlotte.
- No, it's not my name.

176
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:18,582
It's my name,
my secret baby name...

177
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:22,214
that I made up when I was 11
for my daughter when I had her.

178
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,316
I told you.
Don't tell me you don't remember.

179
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,657
I'm sorry,
I really don't.

180
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,324
A complete lie. She remembered.
We all remembered.

181
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,459
Charlotte had made us all swear
never to use it.

182
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:39,199
- My husband heard it somewhere else.
- Really? Where? I didn't tell him.

183
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:42,539
I can't believe
you're freaking out over a name.

184
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,443
- You're not even pregnant.
- That's not the point!

185
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:48,311
- What's going on?
- She stole my baby name.

186
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:50,214
You bitch!

187
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:53,985
Let's go.

188
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,454
Beers and bar nuts
at Flanagan's off Route Five...

189
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,125
were the perfect antidote
to Laney's House of Humiliation.

190
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,364
If I hadn't waited this long to have
a baby, that name would be mine.

191
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,374
Come on. You're still young. You have
plenty of time to have children.

192
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,875
No, I don't.

193
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,606
I don't want to be
one of those 40-year-old moms.

194
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:23,378
- No off ense.
- I don't want to be one of them either.

195
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,818
There are no frozen eggs
in my freezer.

196
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:28,753
Was the bathroom clean?

197
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:30,814
What do you think?

198
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:35,226
This is why I hate baby showers.
You always leave feeling depressed.

199
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,491
Paddy, another round.

200
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:39,931
Well, l, for one, love my life.

201
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:43,562
And I will not be made to feel
inadequate by all this baby talk.

202
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,233
I spoke to a woman
with a master's in finance.

203
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,243
All she wanted to talk about
was her Diaper Genie.

204
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,245
It doesn't have to be like that.

205
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,679
You don't have to lose yourself
to have a kid.

206
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:57,343
I know plenty
of cool, hip mothers...

207
00:12:57,418 --> 00:13:01,616
who live in the city and still have
great careers and stuff.

208
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:03,122
Who?

209
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,691
I'm late.
I missed my period.

210
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:09,355
Paddy, honey,
where are those beers?

211
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,863
How late?

212
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:14,368
I don't know, just a few--
Seven days.

213
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:17,029
Oh, honey, gray area.

214
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:19,539
True, you're in front
of the firing squad...

215
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:21,598
but you haven't been shot.

216
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:25,510
- I was once ten days late.
- Really? Were you having sex?

217
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,447
No.

218
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:32,650
What are you going to do?
You gonna tell Mr. Big?

219
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,156
I am not going to tell him
until I know what l--

220
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:38,624
till I know how l-- what--

221
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:43,291
No, I am not going to tell him...

222
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,060
until I know how to finish
this sentence.

223
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,131
- What did I miss?
- Nothing.

224
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:56,242
That night, Charlotte
got out her wish box...

225
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,336
where she kept reminders of
all the things she hoped for in life--

226
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:02,673
a gift for Shayla...

227
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:07,811
a town house in the city...

228
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,084
a beach house in East Hampton...

229
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,493
her dream man...

230
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,233
her backup dream man.

231
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:26,730
It's very strange when the life
you never had flashes before your eyes.

232
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,441
Carrie Held Hostage: Day Eight.

233
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:32,376
Miranda and I went shopping.

234
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,383
I'm on total ovary overload.
Which kind do I get?

235
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:39,284
Here. This one's on sale,
half off.

236
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:43,187
Sweetie, I just spent $395 on a pair
of open-toed Gucci's last week.

237
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,851
This is not the place to be frugal.

238
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,690
What about this one?

239
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,423
I remember First Response.

240
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:52,523
I had a very reassuring moment once
with First Response.

241
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,369
Here's hoping.

242
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:00,029
What if I am?

243
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,008
If you am, you am.

244
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:06,046
I don't think I'd be
very good at this.

245
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,377
I mean, am I maternal?

246
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:14,485
When I was a girl, I left my baby doll
in the rain for four days.

247
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:16,682
Her face peeled off.
That can't be good.

248
00:15:16,757 --> 00:15:19,658
- But if you--
- I shaved my Barbie's head.

249
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,124
When I was little, I took a rubber band
and put it around my dog's snout.

250
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,267
- What?
- God.

251
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:33,833
Can you picture it, us with--

252
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:35,773
Kids?

253
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:38,835
- Babies.
- I'll probably end up with five.

254
00:15:38,913 --> 00:15:42,246
Five hours
and two packs of gum later...

255
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,284
I decided
I couldn't take the test...

256
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:47,844
till I knew exactly how I felt
about the results, either way.

257
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,292
- Hello?
- It's Laney.

258
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,361
I just wanted to tell you
it was so great seeing you guys.

259
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:04,837
I know I was a big bitch, but you
gotta know my hormones are going wild.

260
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:09,275
The truth is, Laney's hormones
have been going wild since she was ten.

261
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,676
Seeing you made me remember
how much fun we used to have.

262
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:15,716
We did. It's amazing
how much time has gone by.

263
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:17,614
Tell me about it.

264
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,449
But I miss us. I really do.

265
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,456
- We should get together more often.
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,786
We should get together,
not just say we're going to...

267
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,796
but really do it.

268
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,389
Absolutely. Listen, I've gotta go.
I'm running late.

269
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:35,902
- Where are you off to?
- Samantha's having one of her parties.

270
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,562
- She is?
- Yeah.

271
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:41,574
Oh, man! That's the kind of thing--
I love Samantha's parties.

272
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:45,169
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Next time. I promise, all right?

273
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:46,679
Okay, bye.

274
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:51,314
Faced with her own inadequacies...

275
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,979
Samantha did something
only Samantha could do.

276
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,319
She threw
an l-don't-have-a-baby shower...

277
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,415
to let everyone know
she was fabulous.

278
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:00,323
Great to see you!

279
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,487
Oh! I don't have a baby!

280
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,190
Everybody drink!

281
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:09,995
- Are you having fun?
- Yes, but not as much fun as Miranda.

282
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,904
Still convinced that marriage
plus baby equals death...

283
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:14,737
Miranda chose life...

284
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,471
also known as Ed,
Samantha's accountant.

285
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:20,013
If she fucks on that couch,
she buys it.

286
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:30,288
Hey, you guys,
the entertainment has arrived!

287
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,528
- What are you doing here?
- What I do best-- partying!

288
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,361
- Maybe we better sit down.
- Fuck no! Where's the bar?

289
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,459
- Somebody get me a drink!
- You think that's a good idea?

290
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:46,028
Fuck yeah. I'm due any day.
What's one little drink gonna matter?

291
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,042
Maybe it'll help me go into labor.

292
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,371
She gives birth on that couch,
she buys it.

293
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,075
What are you doing here?
What is she doing here?

294
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,015
- I missed you guys.
- Us?

295
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:00,417
The pathetic, live-for-the-moment
single girls...

296
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:02,786
who think that life
is a Jacqueline Susann novel?

297
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:06,725
I'm sure you get asked this
all the time, but what is your problem?

298
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:11,322
My problem? Just that I had a dream
and you killed it, in a nutshell.

299
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:14,891
Really? You're lucky, because at least
you know what happened to your dream.

300
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,802
I have absolutely no idea
what happened to mine.

301
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:19,635
Hi, Laney!

302
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:22,801
I spent the next hour
keeping Charlotte away from Laney...

303
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:24,811
and Laney away from the vodka.

304
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:26,972
Look who came up for air.

305
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:30,245
He's a good kisser
and he's gonna do my taxes for free.

306
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,342
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Hey, Carrie.

307
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,682
Hey, Jonathan.

308
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:36,552
I've been talking to your friend
Charlotte. She's great.

309
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:39,787
- Is she seeing anybody?
- Wide open.

310
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,090
Just don't mention
the name Shayla.

311
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,790
- I'm sorry?
- Nothing.

312
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:46,458
It's a private joke.
Go forth and date.

313
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,235
His name was Jonathan Bix.

314
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:51,237
He was a trader at Bear Sterns...

315
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:55,332
and had just closed escrow
on a house in the Hamptons.

316
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:58,606
Charlotte suddenly realized
all was not lost.

317
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,442
As she sipped her beer...

318
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,540
she mentally Scotch-taped
her dream house back together again.

319
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:08,346
This party sucks.

320
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:11,858
Laney, maybe we should think
about getting you home, all right?

321
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:14,360
No, I don't wanna go back there.

322
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:18,890
Who wants to see my tits?

323
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:22,395
I'll take a look.

324
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,904
Laney, come on. Come back.
Don't do this.

325
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:27,133
Relax! It'll be fun!

326
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,575
All right, look.
Now we're gonna have a party.

327
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:32,874
Pregnant lady showin' her tits!

328
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:37,575
Oh, my God.

329
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:39,744
This is at once so sad...

330
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,779
and the most fabulous validation
I've ever gotten in my life.

331
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:55,534
This is weird.

332
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:02,665
I don't think I can do this.

333
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,971
No biggie.

334
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,212
Despite her best eff orts
to run free...

335
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:13,253
it appeared that Laney Berlin's
invisible electric fence...

336
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,481
stretched all the way to Manhattan.

337
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,860
No, I know I can do it.
Just give me one more chance.

338
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,523
Laney, it's not who you are anymore.
It's all right.

339
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:30,032
I didn't know that was gonna happen.
Nobody told me that was gonna happen.

340
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,766
I mean, somebody should warn you.

341
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,033
It's all right.

342
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:42,148
One day you're gonna wake up,
and you're not gonna recognize yourself.

343
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,154
Can you take her to Connecticut?

344
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:06,272
I spent the next day sitting on
a park bench watching children play.

345
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,402
If I had to, could I do this?

346
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:16,209
Would I be any good?

347
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,810
Would I somehow manage to stay me?

348
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:32,198
Hello. Oh, my!

349
00:21:34,268 --> 00:21:36,099
Oh, sorry.

350
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,502
That's okay.
She's adorable.

351
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:40,597
Yeah, most of the time.

352
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,370
You wanna go home?
Yeah, yeah.

353
00:21:43,444 --> 00:21:45,810
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

354
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:53,345
On the way home...

1463
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,931
I got my period.
