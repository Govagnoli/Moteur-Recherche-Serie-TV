1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,299
Last night my friend Miranda
got invited to a dinner party...

2
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,304
by a man she hardly knew.

3
00:00:52,674 --> 00:00:54,665
She was the date
of Nick Waxler...

4
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:59,407
a fairly successful sports agent
who once told her she had nice legs.

5
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:00,914
Okay.

6
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:05,817
Old movie stars you'd have liked to fuck
when they were young.

7
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:07,354
Alive or dead?

8
00:01:07,422 --> 00:01:09,481
It doesn't matter.
I'll start.

9
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:13,391
Veronica Lake, the year she made
Sullivan's Travels.

10
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:15,019
Dave?

11
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,362
I'd have to say
Sophia Loren.

12
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:20,628
Probably 'cause my dad
had this thing for her.

13
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:23,432
We won't go there.
Montgomery Clift.

14
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:25,439
- He was gay.
- Oh.

15
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:28,271
Marilyn Monroe,
before the Kennedys got to her.

16
00:01:28,343 --> 00:01:31,141
- Honey?
- Bing Crosby.

17
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:33,976
I stand by my choice.

18
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:35,948
Sean Connery.

19
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:39,214
Yesterday, today and tomorrow.

20
00:01:39,287 --> 00:01:43,815
For a first date, Miranda felt like
she was hitting it out of the ballpark.

21
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,420
Thanks.

22
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:48,962
So how long have
you known Nick?

23
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,227
We've been riding the same
elevator line for years...

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,393
and then we had lunch
a few weeks ago...

25
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:56,596
and then he
invited me here to dinner.

26
00:01:56,671 --> 00:02:00,198
- Well, we adore him.
- He's very smart.

27
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:03,608
- Guess he took our ultimatum seriously.
- Deanne.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,043
What are you talking about?

29
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:10,846
They told Miranda
that Nick had this thing for models.

30
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,320
Old movie stars you'd have
liked to fuck when they were young.

31
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:18,917
I'll start. Veronica Lake,
the year she made Sullivan's Travels.

32
00:02:18,993 --> 00:02:21,723
- Dave?
- I'd have to go with Sophia Loren.

33
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:24,492
Probably.
My dad had a thing for her.

34
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:27,467
- Montgomery Clift.
- Marilyn Monroe.

35
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:29,127
Bing Crosby.

36
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:31,997
Yvette?

37
00:02:33,508 --> 00:02:36,170
I don't know.
Charlie Sheen?

38
00:02:36,244 --> 00:02:38,178
They'd come to dinner...

39
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:41,511
push their food around and pout.

40
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,845
Veronica Lake.

41
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:45,317
- Sophia Loren.
- Montgomery Clift.

42
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:46,717
Marilyn Monroe.

43
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:48,449
Bing Crosby.

44
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:50,115
Marissa?

45
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:05,537
She had to make a phone call.

46
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:09,509
It got to be a problem.
They decided to take action.

47
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:13,479
Can't you find a woman who can
carry on a decent conversation?

48
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:16,540
Yeah, Nick.
And eat without purging.

49
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:18,051
What are you saying?

50
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:20,917
You can't bring around any more
of these so-called models.

51
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:23,514
It's too depressing.

52
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:27,721
Okay, okay.
I'll see what I can do.

53
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:29,558
And then he brought you.

54
00:03:29,631 --> 00:03:32,896
- So obviously not a model.
- In a good way!

55
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:36,196
Nick dates models?

56
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:46,772
Miranda confronted him,
and it didn't take him long to fold.

57
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:50,147
It's true. It's true, okay?
I'm obsessed.

58
00:03:50,218 --> 00:03:52,277
- Obsessed with models.
- Correct.

59
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:55,186
So what am l?
Your intellectual beard for the evening?

60
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:56,917
Don't be pissed, all right?

61
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:59,687
You gotta admit,
you met some nice people.

62
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:03,026
You had a good time. Okay?

63
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:06,299
You were on a date
with a modelizer...

64
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,301
and you didn't even know it?

65
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:12,328
If men like Nick are dating models,
what chance do ordinary women have?

66
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:15,501
Do you have to be a supermodel
to get a date in New York?

67
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:18,706
Modelizers are
a particular breed.

68
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,010
They're a step
beyond womanizers...

69
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:23,880
who will sleep with just about
anything in a skirt.

70
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:27,888
Modelizers are obsessed
not with women, but with models...

71
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:31,915
who in most cities are safely confined
to billboards and magazines...

72
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:35,156
but in Manhattan,
actually run wild on the streets...

73
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,221
turning the city into
a virtual Model Country Safari...

74
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:41,234
where men can pet the creatures
in their natural habitat.

75
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:44,032
As if we didn't
have enough problems.

76
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:47,867
They're stupid and lazy
and should be shot on sight.

77
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:49,432
I've been out
with lots of guys...

78
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,445
and they say I am just as beautiful
as a model, but I work for a living.

79
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:54,003
I'm like, well--

80
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:56,346
I'm like a model
who's taken the high road.

81
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,909
The advantages given to models
and to beautiful women in general...

82
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:01,922
are so unfair,
it makes me puke.

83
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,585
- Sweetheart, you are so cute.
- Cute doesn't cut it in this town.

84
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,322
What's cute
compared to supermodel?

85
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:11,923
There's nothing like raising the subject
of models among four single women...

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,730
to spice up an otherwise
dull Tuesday night.

87
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:17,202
They have this
distant, sexy look.

88
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:19,205
That's not sexy,
it's starvation.

89
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:21,571
That's starvation
in the best restaurants.

90
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:23,371
What I wanna know is...

91
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:25,969
when did all the men
get together and decide...

92
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:29,346
that they would only get it up
for giraffes with big breasts?

93
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:34,150
In some cultures, heavy women
with mustaches are considered beautiful.

94
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,156
You're looking at me
while you're saying that?

95
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:38,283
We should just admit
that we live in a culture...

96
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,418
that promotes impossible
standards of beauty.

97
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:42,895
- Except men think they're possible.
- Yeah.

98
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:45,797
No matter how good
I feel about myself...

99
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,335
if I see Christy Turlington,
I just wanna give up.

100
00:05:48,403 --> 00:05:52,772
I wanna force-feed her lard, but that's
the difference between you and me.

101
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,774
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:57,572
Look at you two.
You're beautiful.

103
00:05:57,645 --> 00:06:00,375
- I hate my thighs.
- Oh, come on.

104
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:04,817
I can't even open a magazine without
thinking, "thighs, thighs, thighs."

105
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,945
I'll take your thighs
and raise you a chin.

106
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:09,046
I'll take your chin
and raise you a--

107
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:14,823
What?

108
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,625
Oh, come on.

109
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:18,927
I happen to love the way I look.

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,661
You should.
You paid enough for it.

111
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,464
Hey, I resent that.

112
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:26,132
I do not believe in plastic surgery.
Well, not yet.

113
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:31,270
I find it fascinating that four
beautiful flesh and blood women...

114
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:33,472
could be intimidated
by some unreal fantasy.

115
00:06:33,548 --> 00:06:35,880
I mean, look.
Look at this.

116
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,851
Is this really intimidating
to any of you?

117
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,252
- I hate my thighs.
- Pass the chicken.

118
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:43,483
I have that dress.

119
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:44,991
Suddenly I was interested.

120
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:48,187
If models could cause
otherwise rational individuals...

121
00:06:48,262 --> 00:06:52,255
to crumble in their presence,
exactly how powerful was beauty?

122
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,302
There are two types of guys
that fall for beautiful women.

123
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:57,963
Either they're slime-balls
that are just out to get laid...

124
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,507
or they fall in love with you instantly.
It's pathetic.

125
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:02,634
Why fuck the girl
in the skirt...

126
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,271
if you can fuck the girl
in the ad for the skirt?

127
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:09,805
Being beautiful is such a power.
You can get whatever you want.

128
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:11,112
You can get anything.

129
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:14,621
I've been off ered trips to Aspen,
weekends in Paris...

130
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:16,281
Christmas in St. Barts.

131
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:19,121
A motorcycle, a juicer.

132
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:22,026
It's not like models
don't have brains.

133
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:26,055
They have them.
They just don't need to use them.

134
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:30,230
Most guys just think you're dumb,
but I'm really very literary. I read.

135
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:33,239
I'll sit down and read
a whole magazine from cover to cover.

136
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:35,138
Some scuba gear...

137
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:39,079
a Herb Ritt's photo.

138
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:42,412
A Bulgari necklace,
a breast job.

139
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:46,476
My friends think I'm shallow.
Sometimes I think they're right.

140
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:50,991
Other times I think,
"Hey, I'm fucking a model."

141
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:54,994
Models are a lot looser
than you think.

142
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:57,997
It's way easier to screw a model
than a regular girl...

143
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:00,090
'cause that's what
they do all the time.

144
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:02,796
It's how regular people are
when they're on vacation.

145
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,498
Barkley, a notorious modelizer...

146
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:09,168
was one of those SoHo wonders
who maintained a fabulous lifestyle...

147
00:08:09,243 --> 00:08:12,303
despite never having sold
a single painting.

148
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,814
So you're saying
it's easy to meet them?

149
00:08:14,882 --> 00:08:16,850
No, it's not so easy.

150
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,012
The trick is, you gotta treat them
like they're regular girls.

151
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:23,250
You gotta be able to roll into a place,
walk up to the hottest thing there.

152
00:08:23,324 --> 00:08:26,521
Otherwise you're finished.
It's kind of like being around dogs.

153
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:29,358
- You gotta show no fear.
- Things?

154
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,261
You call them things?

155
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:33,732
Yeah.
Well, they are things.

156
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:36,668
They're beautiful things.
And that's what my life's about.

157
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:40,530
Beauty.

158
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:44,304
Come here. I want
to show you something.

159
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:49,743
This is my real art...

160
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:53,048
only I can't really
show it to the public.

161
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:58,185
Well, not yet, at least.
Sit down.

162
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,797
That's Vanessa.
That's Tanya.

163
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,838
Elana.

164
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:14,136
Katrina.

165
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,971
I couldn't believe it.

166
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:20,002
The man had slept with half
the perfume ads in September's Vogue.

167
00:09:24,185 --> 00:09:26,676
Do they know about this?

168
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:27,721
Maybe.

169
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:29,881
Oh, look at that one.

170
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:35,187
She does runway now,
but I think she's gonna be huge someday.

171
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:39,461
I didn't know what to say. There really
wasn't anything to say except--

172
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:43,036
Do you have a light?

173
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:44,537
Sure.

174
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:54,079
Later that day
I was relieved to discover...

175
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:58,175
that at least one eligible bachelor
got his kicks off the runway.

176
00:09:58,252 --> 00:10:01,517
- So I totally dig your friend Miranda.
- That's great.

177
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:05,218
Yeah, I think she is
so sexy and smart and--

178
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:07,818
- Did she tell you that we made out?
- No.

179
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:10,022
Yeah, it was totally hot.

180
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:13,529
Why don't you call her?

181
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:16,126
- You should call her.
- I did, like a hundred times.

182
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:20,833
She totally won't return my phone calls.
Did she say anything about me?

183
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:26,379
I don't know, maybe she's just busy.
Am I not cute enough for her?

184
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:28,574
Of course you are, Skipper.
You're adorable.

185
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:32,517
I don't know. Find out for me.
I wanna see if I still have a chance.

186
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:37,349
- Right now, in front of you?
- I can handle it.

187
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:41,955
Hi, this is Miranda.
Please leave me a message.

188
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,520
Oh, it's her machine.

189
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:47,465
Hey, this is Skipper.
I'm in the street with Carrie.

190
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:49,435
I just told her
how you won't call me back.

191
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:53,200
So now you have to call me back.
You better call me back!

192
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:55,834
No, I'm kidding.
I'm joking.

193
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,812
But seriously, I hope
you call me back and...

194
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,371
did I mention this was Skipper?

195
00:11:03,484 --> 00:11:06,009
I believe there is a curse
put on the head of anybody...

196
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:08,317
who tries to
fix up their friends.

197
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:16,019
Where better to find modelizers in their
natural habitat than a fashion show?

198
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:20,727
Luckily, my friend Stanf ord Blatch had
a client in the hottest show in town.

199
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:24,032
"The Bone" is like the human
equivalent of the sable coat.

200
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:28,303
He's so beautiful that I find
that sometimes I have to look away.

201
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:30,936
- Do you see him?
- Right over there.

202
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:33,002
- Where?
- Look at him.

203
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,810
It's like he travels with
his own personal lighting director.

204
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:39,551
Derek, a.k.a. "The Bone"...

205
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,750
was the world's biggest underwear model
and Stanf ord's most important client...

206
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:46,952
as well as the subject
of his single-minded obsession.

207
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:49,052
Hey, Stanny.

208
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,998
Derek, I would like you to meet
a very dear friend, Carrie Bradshaw.

209
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:56,093
- Nice to meet you.
- Carrie writes "Sex And The City."

210
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,604
- Wow, that's great.
- Have you read it?

211
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:03,368
The other day, Derek and I
were walking past his billboard...

212
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:06,504
and he told me he'd like to get
a piece of it for his apartment...

213
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,172
Iike maybe his nose.

214
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:11,082
And I said, "You should get
the bulge in your pants.

215
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:14,986
That way when women ask how big you are,
you can say, 'Fourteen feet'."

216
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:17,922
- That would be funny, wouldn't it?
- Yeah.

217
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:20,654
Everybody's talking about you.
You are so great.

218
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:23,356
You're gonna be a star.
Have I told you that enough?

219
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:26,025
You're a star!
You're a star!

220
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,536
- We'd better let you get dressed.
- I am dressed.

221
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:33,235
- We'll see you after the show.
- Bye.

222
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:39,107
Can you believe anyone
that beautiful can be that nice?

223
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,514
I keep dreaming that someday
he's gonna say, "Stanford, I love you."

224
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:45,779
- Is he gay?
- He denies it.

225
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:48,344
How could anyone
that gorgeous be straight?

226
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:51,047
Sweetie, over here!

227
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,094
Samantha Jones never missed
a major fashion show.

228
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:57,756
She was one of the only people I knew
who thought that proximity to beauty...

229
00:12:57,832 --> 00:13:00,300
made her feel
more attractive.

230
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:03,996
Hey, sweetie, what happened? You
couldn't find seats right on the runway?

231
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:06,665
Oh, you can see all the flaws
from this angle.

232
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,044
- Hey, Carrie.
- Barkley, how are you?

233
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:21,019
- You going to the party afterwards?
- I don't know.

234
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:24,854
Of course we are.
Hi. I'm Samantha.

235
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:26,415
Barkley.

236
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:33,622
Martini straight up
or with a twist?

237
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:35,134
Straight up.

238
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:37,827
Really? He's very cute.

239
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:39,338
You're not dating him?

240
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:41,431
God, no.
He's a total modelizer.

241
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:49,812
Is he dating any one model
in particular?

242
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:54,548
Actually, he's sleeping
with all of them in general.

243
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:57,489
- Only models?
- Only models.

244
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:18,343
Later that night we all went
downtown f or a party.

245
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,277
I was beginning to float away
on a sea of sweet potato puffs...

246
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,478
with smoked salmon
and sour cream when--

247
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:31,149
It was Mr. Big:
major tycoon...

248
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:34,683
major dream boat,
and majorly out of my league.

249
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:37,196
I thought I saw you
on the runway.

250
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:39,365
Hi.

251
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:42,368
I started reading your column
after we met.

252
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:43,994
- You did?
- Yeah.

253
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:45,698
Cute.

254
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:47,673
Cute?

255
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:50,835
Well-- Yeah, cute.

256
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:52,845
What are you writing
about this week?

257
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:57,077
Well, I'm working on a story
about men who date models.

258
00:14:57,151 --> 00:15:00,211
- Any thoughts?
- Only that they're very lucky.

259
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:03,917
So what have you discovered
about these men...

260
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:07,017
who are dating models?

261
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:10,063
Well, I'm discovering that...

262
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,758
some of them treat it
as a competitive sport...

263
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,996
and others I think
just need the validation.

264
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,904
And probably others just have a thing
for exceptionally beautiful women.

265
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:22,108
Exactly.

266
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:24,337
And there's something
wrong with that?

267
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:26,470
There's nothing wrong.

268
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:29,482
I just think it might become
a bit monotonous.

269
00:15:30,684 --> 00:15:32,948
Puff?

270
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,988
- No, thanks.
- Excuse me.

271
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:37,080
So where do you--

272
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:41,059
- Where do you write these stories?
- My cute stories?

273
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:43,756
Have you got
an office or anything?

274
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:46,732
About half the time I'm at my apartment,
and the other half...

275
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,236
I'm over at this coffee shop
on 73rd and Madison.

276
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:54,104
Oh, Carrie,
I'd like you to meet Misha.

277
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:57,837
- Hi. You were great in the show.
- Thank you.

278
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:00,402
Suddenly I felt like
I was wearing patchouli...

279
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:02,415
in a room full of Chanel.

280
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,678
Well, it was nice
talking to you.

281
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:08,210
See you around sometime, I hope.

282
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:13,555
I thought I had come to terms
with my looks the year I turned 30...

283
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:17,586
when I realized that I no longer had
the energy to be completely superficial.

284
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:21,123
Your friend Barkley,
he's really been coming on to me.

285
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,169
Do you actually think
he believes I'm a model?

286
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:26,502
- You don't want to go there.
- Why not?

287
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:30,805
He has this thing for
secretly taping his conquests.

288
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:32,573
Really?

289
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:34,273
What a pervert.

290
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:39,211
As Samantha began to
get ready for her close-up...

291
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:43,086
I felt it was time
to call it a night.

292
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:46,285
I had never felt so invisible
in my entire life.

293
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,952
Taxi!

294
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:55,030
- Carrie.
- Hey, hi.

295
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:56,660
Did Stanford leave?

296
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:59,501
No, he's in there giving
a neck massage to a Versace model.

297
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:01,541
So, where are you going now?

298
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,906
- I'm going home.
- Can I come?

299
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:07,737
- You wanna come home with me?
- Sure, if it's quiet.

300
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:10,113
I can't take these crowds.

301
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:17,248
The things you gotta do
in the name of research.

302
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:26,965
Shouldn't you be spending the night
with some girl from the show?

303
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,968
No, I never date models.

304
00:17:29,036 --> 00:17:30,970
I think they're stupid.

305
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,530
I wondered if there wasn't
some kind of physics for beauty.

306
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:36,633
Maybe two models repelled.

307
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,168
Maybe models could only be
attracted to ordinary humans.

308
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:45,818
So, I think it's so cool
that you write.

309
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:48,650
- Thanks.
- I wish I could write.

310
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:51,748
I've got intense thoughts, but I can't
keep them in my head long enough...

311
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:54,419
to get them down on paper.

312
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:56,122
That's the big trick.

313
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:58,562
The truth is,
I'm totally neurotic.

314
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:02,295
One minute I can be walking
down the street, totally cool...

315
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:05,395
and the next minute
I'm depressed for no reason.

316
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:07,133
I'm totally self-conscious.

317
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:11,405
Before I say something, I say it in my
head first so it doesn't come out wrong.

318
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:15,247
Doesn't that seem like
a waste of time?

319
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:17,579
It only takes a second.

320
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:25,451
- And sometimes I get so distracted.
- What's distracting you now?

321
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:27,118
Your nose.

322
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:29,890
Thanks a lot.
I hate my nose.

323
00:18:29,963 --> 00:18:33,592
It's just so cute.
I hate my nose too. It's too big.

324
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:36,227
- But I think it depends on my hair.
- Yeah.

325
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,534
I see what you mean.

326
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:43,269
So what do you want to be
when you grow up?

327
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:46,835
Well, I think
this might be it.

328
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:48,848
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

329
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:53,376
I'd like to move back to lowa
and have kids and be a cop.

330
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,052
I felt like I was in my bedroom
when I was 16...

331
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:01,890
and I used to hang out with this guy
who was really beautiful...

332
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:05,762
and my parents thought I was helping him
with his chemistry homework.

333
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,960
Do you mind
if we just lie here?

334
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:10,333
I get so lonely in the city.

335
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:13,567
Sometimes it's just nice
to lie with someone.

336
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,267
Sure.

337
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:18,777
We could do that.

338
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:21,872
It was hard to imagine
that anyone so beautiful...

339
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:24,611
could ever be lonely.

340
00:19:25,752 --> 00:19:28,312
Meanwhile,
somewhere below 14th Street...

341
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:32,381
two ordinary joes were doing
their own lonely late-night thing.

342
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:33,892
- Anything else?
- That's it.

343
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:37,328
- Just cat food?
- Yes, just cat food.

344
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:41,367
Oh, hi, Skipper.

345
00:19:41,435 --> 00:19:44,529
So like, how come you haven't been
returning any of my calls?

346
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:47,165
I'm sorry.
It's been a really busy week.

347
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:49,471
I thought we had a connection.

348
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,701
I don't know.
Could I get my change?

349
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:55,077
You get that way with
every guy that you're with?

350
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:57,616
No, it's just--

351
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,416
Don't you wanna go out
with a girl your own age?

352
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,252
It's got nothing
to do with age.

353
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:07,622
I think you're luminous.

354
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:11,589
- You think I'm luminous?
- Totally.

355
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:15,297
Miranda couldn't resist
the vision of herself...

356
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:17,769
reflected in Skipper's
slightly smudged lenses.

357
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:24,708
- All right, let's get out of here.
- Let me just pay f or my Cap'n Crunch.

358
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:27,879
There's cereal at my place.

359
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:37,914
And Samantha found
the ultimate validation:

360
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:39,925
sex with Barkley.

361
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:41,654
So...

362
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:45,224
where is it?

363
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,130
What?

364
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,792
The camera.

365
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:53,138
Your friend Carrie
tell you about that?

366
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:55,470
Don't worry.
I only tape models.

367
00:20:58,011 --> 00:20:59,672
I won't mind.

368
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:03,882
Fine. I'll make an exception.

369
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:17,291
Samantha demanded nothing less
than the same consideration...

370
00:21:17,364 --> 00:21:19,628
given every other
model in town.

371
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:30,868
- Hello?
- Carrie, it's Stanford.

372
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:33,845
Do you have any idea what
happened to Derek last night?

373
00:21:33,914 --> 00:21:35,347
Actually...

374
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:37,110
you'll never
believe it, but--

375
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:38,776
Yes?

376
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,883
It's Stanford.

377
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:50,029
- Hi, Stanford.
- Derek?

378
00:21:50,097 --> 00:21:52,031
Could you put Carrie
back on the phone?

379
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:53,589
Sure.

380
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,434
- Hello.
- How could you?

381
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:02,236
I didn't.
We just talked.

382
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,937
I knew he was gay.

383
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:14,386
It's amazing what you'll do
to be with these models.

384
00:22:14,454 --> 00:22:16,183
I've gotta retire soon.

385
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:19,589
They keep me from getting work done,
they make me fuck up my life.

386
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:22,856
Look at me!
I'm an old man at 34.

387
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:29,765
I began to realize
that being beautiful...

388
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:33,135
is like having a rent-controlled
apartment overlooking the park:

389
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:35,766
completely unfair
and usually bestowed...

390
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:38,402
upon those
who deserve it least.

391
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:40,105
I'm not interrupting
your work, am l?

392
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,740
Hey, what a surprise.

393
00:22:42,816 --> 00:22:44,807
I can't stay.
I'm late for a meeting.

394
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:48,548
But I've been thinking about your
article about men who date models.

395
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:50,214
What about them?

396
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,420
First of all, there are so many
goddamn gorgeous women in this city.

397
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:57,496
What an amazing observation.

398
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:01,799
But the thing is this.

399
00:23:01,868 --> 00:23:04,029
After a while...

400
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:07,835
you just wanna be with
the one that makes you laugh.

401
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:09,341
Know what I mean?

402
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,847
Okay. See ya.

403
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:30,829
I take that back.

404
00:23:30,897 --> 00:23:33,559
Beauty is fleeting...

405
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:37,160
but a rent-controlled apartment
overlooking the park is forever.

406
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,810
