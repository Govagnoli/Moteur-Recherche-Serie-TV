1
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:51,269
Once upon a time
in a magical land called Manhattan...

2
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:53,466
a young woman fell in love.

3
00:00:57,011 --> 00:01:01,243
Charlotte and Jack locked eyes at
a black-tie benefit for Epstein-Barr.

4
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:07,510
She chased him through every disease
in New York.

5
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:11,650
They've been officially dating
since retinitis pigmentosis.

6
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:14,952
Jack was perfect for her.

7
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:19,125
Architect, philanthropist
and the sex was amazing.

8
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:24,597
Late one night,
Jack popped the inevitable question.

9
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:26,105
So...

10
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:29,109
what are your fantasies?

11
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:34,376
God, I'd love to own
my own gallery...

12
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:36,474
and maybe a little cottage in Maine.

13
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:40,885
Actually, I meant more like
screwing in an airplane bathroom...

14
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:42,684
kind of fantasies.

15
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:47,220
The closest Charlotte had ever come
to getting screwed on a plane...

16
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:50,696
was the time she lost all her luggage
on a flight to Palm Beach.

17
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:53,165
Well...

18
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:57,034
I've always wanted to do it
in my parents' bed.

19
00:01:57,105 --> 00:01:59,335
Wild. I like it.

20
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:00,897
What about you?

21
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:04,138
You, me and another woman.

22
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,312
Come on!

23
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:08,178
I'm serious.

24
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:12,185
Charlotte, you have no idea
how sexy you are, do you?

25
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:14,915
The idea of you touching
another woman...

26
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:19,049
God, it makes me hard
just thinking about it.

27
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:21,594
Wow.

28
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:29,669
Jack wants us to do a threesome.

29
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:32,573
Of course he does.
Every guy does.

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,734
Threesomes are huge right now.
They're the blow job of the '90s.

31
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,677
- What was the blow job of the '80s?
- Anal sex.

32
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:41,214
- Any sex, period.
- Don't let him pressure you into it.

33
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:44,274
It's just this guy's cheap ploy
to watch you be a lesbian for a night.

34
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,788
- Don't knock it till you've tried it.
- I had a threesome once, I think.

35
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:50,949
In college. I was drunk.
I woke up in someone else's bra.

36
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:53,755
The only way to do a threesome
is to be the guest star.

37
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:55,796
- The guest star?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:58,696
The girl the couple gets to come in,
screw and leave.

39
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:00,757
- The pinch hitter.
- Exactly.

40
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:05,397
Perfect. Great sex without wondering
what it will do to your relationship.

41
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:09,136
- But you don't have relationships.
- Which is why I have great sex.

42
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,304
- I've never done a threesome.
- Because you have relationships.

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,780
I've never done a threesome.

44
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,148
Of course you haven't. You in a
threesome? You won't even wear a thong.

45
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:21,347
- Jack thinks I'm sexy.
- He's buttering you up.

46
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:25,483
You start thinking you're hot,
then he brings up the threesome thing.

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,688
Boom! Suddenly you're kissing
another woman while he beats off.

48
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:29,991
Please!

49
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:32,555
Just make sure the other woman
isn't a friend.

50
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:35,761
Use somebody random,
somebody you meet in a bar or something.

51
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:38,203
- That's romantic.
- No.

52
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:43,209
I think I'd feel safer with a friend,
with someone I could trust. Like Carrie.

53
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:46,110
Gee, I'm flattered.

54
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,082
But I'd go with someone who has
a little more experience, like Sam.

55
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:51,584
Well, thanks.

56
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:56,089
But there is something sexy
about a first-timer like Charlotte.

57
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:58,921
- Really?
- Yeah.

58
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:03,624
Great. No, forget about me.

59
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:07,667
- Come on.
- I'd do it with you guys.

60
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:11,535
It's like picking teams
for dodgeball all over again.

61
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:13,699
Was Samantha right?

62
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:16,710
Were threesomes
the new sexual frontier?

63
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:22,341
No question.
Guys were infatuated with threesomes.

64
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:25,875
And when I started looking,
they were everywhere.

65
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:29,013
After all, our lives
are built on threesomes.

66
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,115
Fat, low-fat, nonfat.

67
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:34,753
First, business, economy.
Moe, Larry, Curly.

68
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:38,321
Maybe we were never meant to do it
with only one other person.

69
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,857
Maybe threesomes were
the relationship of the future.

70
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:46,067
Meanwhile, Samantha had been busy
guest-starring in a show...

71
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,109
I like to call
"Sam Does the Married Guy."

72
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:51,111
I love that you're not my wife.

73
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:53,306
I love that, too.

74
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:56,373
I mean, that thing you do
with your hips!

75
00:04:57,518 --> 00:05:00,009
Ruth won't even get on top.

76
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:02,556
Ken was 37, a wine importer...

77
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:06,354
unhappily married to a woman
who designed modular office furniture.

78
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:09,419
This affair was the most exciting thing
that had happened to him...

79
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,488
since the '94 Montrachet.

80
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:17,494
Five hours later,
Charlotte's night was just beginning.

81
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:20,541
She and Jack had just had
another fantastic date...

82
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,371
dancing for dyslexia.

83
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:24,809
So, what do you think of her?

84
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,610
- Is she hot?
- Jack!

85
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:30,116
You're right.

86
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:33,512
Maybe she's more your taste.

87
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:36,523
- Stop it.
- Have a light?

88
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:38,115
Sorry, I don't smoke.

89
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:40,057
That's a shame.

90
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:47,399
Did you see that?
She was flirting with us.

91
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:49,368
I think she was flirting with you.

92
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:53,168
You are such a turn on,
and you have no idea.

93
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:57,234
You're giving off this sexual energy
all the time.

94
00:05:57,311 --> 00:06:00,109
A vibe like you've got
a fire inside of you.

95
00:06:01,782 --> 00:06:04,512
She'd be crazy not to be in to you.

96
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:07,782
Who knows whether it was her vodka
or her vibe...

97
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:10,551
but Charlotte suddenly did feel
a little warm.

98
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,957
I think she put her hand on my leg.

99
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:15,757
Should I ask her to join us?

100
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:23,801
That night she had
an eye-opening experience.

101
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:55,668
Charlotte hadn't been that excited since
she tried on her cheerleading uniform.

102
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:59,262
What do you think
your dream meant?

103
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:04,868
I'm in the sand box with Charlotte, Sam
and Carrie and they won't play with me.

104
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,538
Please. It's obvious.

105
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:09,515
Across town, Miranda was dealing
with her own nightmare.

106
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:13,042
I know it's juvenile, but it bothers me.
I'm attractive, smart. Right?

107
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,054
Plenty of people should want me
for a threesome.

108
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:19,821
So you're saying you're attracted
to your girlfriends.

109
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:23,660
No! But if your friends
won't go down on you, who will?

110
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:25,358
That's some dream.

111
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:27,958
It was so real.
I can't stop thinking about it.

112
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:30,196
- And I think I enjoyed it.
- That's great.

113
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:33,468
Dreams are a good way to experiment.

114
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,975
It's like buying a dress
and keeping the tags on.

115
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:39,570
Do you think it means I should do it?
Have a threesome?

116
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:42,138
Jack says that I have a fire
inside me.

117
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:44,150
Tell him they make a cream for that.

118
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:45,776
I'm serious.

119
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:49,289
It's your call, but don't do it
just to make Jack happy.

120
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:51,291
Maybe it would bring us closer.

121
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:55,261
Isn't it weird that you're thinking of
sleeping with someone you don't know...

122
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:58,196
to get closer to Jack?

123
00:07:58,266 --> 00:08:00,791
How well do we ever know
the people we sleep with?

124
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:02,802
That was the thing about Charlotte.

125
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,738
Just as you were about to write her off
as a Park Avenue Pollyanna...

126
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:10,208
she'd say something so right on,
you'd think she was the Dalai Lama.

127
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:13,076
Is my hair too shiny today?

128
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:18,585
And then, she'd say something else.
But the bigger question remained.

129
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:22,214
If Charlotte was actually considering
a threesome, who wasn't?

130
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,918
The Village Voice had more ads
looking for threesomes...

131
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:28,587
than it did for small, rat-infested
studios running at $1000 a month.

132
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:31,564
But who actually answered these ads?

133
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:34,032
Wall Street honcho seeks
two horny gal pals...

134
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:36,535
for an East Hampton fuck-fest
at my summer home.

135
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:38,037
No fatties, please.

136
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:43,702
Sweet, suburban school teacher seeks two
men to fulfill her wildest fantasies.

137
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:48,477
You be black or hispanic,
I'll be on time.

138
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:51,109
I need your dick now.

139
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:53,119
X-Files fanatic twosome...

140
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:56,384
seeks Scully look-alike
for abduction fantasy.

141
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:58,550
Me, gorgeous with big boobs.

142
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:00,651
You, a couple with class.

143
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:03,322
Let's experience everything
the city has to offer.

144
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:07,197
I'm into museums, blow jobs,
theater...

145
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:09,759
and golden showers.

146
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:12,533
I seem to be the only person
in New York...

147
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:15,200
who still believed
in the one-on-one relationship.

148
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:17,244
Mr. Big and I
were actually doing sleep-overs.

149
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,744
Which one?

150
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:21,647
This one.

151
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:31,181
You better be careful.
I could get used to this.

152
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:34,625
Why is it that putting a tie
around a man's neck...

153
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:37,186
is sometimes even sexier
than taking it off?

154
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:39,255
What are you doing for lunch today?

155
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,995
I could maybe swing an hour
between meetings.

156
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:46,267
No. Sorry, I can't.

157
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,366
- I have to interview someone.
- About what?

158
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:52,435
Threesomes.
Ever go to one?

159
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:54,708
Sure. Who hasn't?

160
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:58,445
Really. With who?

161
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,680
My ex-wife.

162
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:04,088
Suddenly my column
was the last thing on my mind.

163
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:05,591
You were married?

164
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:09,789
Yeah. I thought I told you.

165
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:13,489
No, you didn't.

166
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,762
An ex-wife. That's a new twist.

167
00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:19,135
And they had wild sex. Threesomes.
We don't have wild sex.

168
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:23,006
We used to, but now we have sweet sex.
Wild always beats out sweet.

169
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:27,411
- But he's not with her anymore.
- Because they stopped having wild sex.

170
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:29,244
That's why Ken's fucking me.

171
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:32,046
- His wife won't give him a blow job.
- Should that make me feel better?

172
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:35,111
He's never going to leave his wife
for you. They never do.

173
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:38,920
Thank God. Who needs the trouble?
This is ideal. No muss, no fuss.

174
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:40,927
Sounds like you're selling
toilet bowl cleaner.

175
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:43,828
Does this color turn you on?

176
00:10:43,898 --> 00:10:46,230
You had to hand it to Miranda.
She was determined.

177
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,995
It's a little orange.

178
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:50,468
There's only one thing left to do.

179
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:52,506
What? Leave him before he leaves me?

180
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:55,041
You kidding?
Check out the ex.

181
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:03,374
Charlotte was right. We don't
really know the people we sleep with.

182
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:06,386
After all, what did I really know
about Mr. Big?

183
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:10,390
Except he had an ex-wife named Barbara,
who, I discovered, worked in publishing.

184
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,221
My plan was simple.

185
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:16,093
I'd pitch her a steamy, bodice-ripping
paperback which she'd probably reject...

186
00:11:16,163 --> 00:11:18,256
but at least I'd get five minutes
face-to-face with her.

187
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:20,027
Carrie?

188
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:23,294
Come right in.
Barbara's ready for you.

189
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:27,535
Thanks. Bye.

190
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:31,066
Carrie Bradshaw.
I am so excited.

191
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:34,308
Sit down.
I'm a huge fan of your work.

192
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:36,406
Good taste and beautiful.
Could it get worse?

193
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:41,285
Oh. Special Olympics chairwoman.

194
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:43,653
Sorry. I haven't hung it yet.

195
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:45,919
So, I'm dying to hear your pitch.

196
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:49,360
I never knew you were interested
in writing children's books.

197
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,389
Well, who doesn't love
children's books?

198
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:56,436
Five minutes of bodice-ripping material
out the window.

199
00:11:56,504 --> 00:12:01,237
So I did what any writer would do.
I pulled an idea out of my ass.

200
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:05,938
Well, my story is about
a little girl...

201
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:10,417
named Cathy,
Little Cathy.

202
00:12:10,484 --> 00:12:12,918
What makes Little Cathy special?

203
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:18,118
Well, she's got
these magic...

204
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,290
cigarettes.

205
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:23,728
- She has magic cigarettes?
- Yes.

206
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:26,561
Little Cathy and her magic cigarettes.

207
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:33,162
Whenever she lights up, she can go
anywhere in the whole wide world.

208
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,936
Arabia, New Jersey.

209
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,911
I mean, that stuff is gonna be
all worked out, of course.

210
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:43,006
You want to write a children's book
about smoking?

211
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,678
It's a children's book for adults.

212
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:52,817
You are outrageous.
I love it.

213
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:54,758
I thought you might.

214
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:58,525
I have been dying to do something
with an edge. This could be great.

215
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,089
It was the last straw.

216
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:04,103
She was smart, beautiful,
and she got me.

217
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:07,231
I'd have to kill her.

218
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:12,702
Meanwhile, Samantha was about to have
her own encounter with the third kind.

219
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,611
Oh, I'm sorry.

220
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:16,445
- Ken!
- Sam!

221
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:18,712
- You two know each other?
- Sure.

222
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:23,246
Not really.
Ruth, this is Sam. Samantha.

223
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:25,121
She bought pinot noir from me.

224
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:27,353
- Sam, this is my wife Ruth.
- Hi.

225
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:32,930
Okay, we should be going.
See you.

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,127
That afternoon was a first
for Samantha.

227
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:39,332
She successfully screwed a guy
in under two minutes.

228
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,610
The more Miranda analyzed,
the worse her nightmares got.

229
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:49,081
So, the four of us get into a cab, only
they won't let me sit in back with them.

230
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:52,209
They make me ride in front with
the driver, who's the original Chris...

231
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:54,447
from The Partridge Family.

232
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:56,819
What I'm hearing is
you're still very upset...

233
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,188
about being sexually rejected
by your friends.

234
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:01,090
Let me ask you something.

235
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:06,223
Would you do a threesome with me?

236
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,600
I think we need to talk about
why you're asking me that.

237
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:12,662
I take that as a no.

238
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:18,545
That night I thought I could put
the whole Barbara thing out of my mind.

239
00:14:18,612 --> 00:14:21,376
After all,
Mr. Big was with me now.

240
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:26,152
Nibbling his ear lobes?
How sweet.

241
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,280
Let me show you how it's really done.

242
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:34,923
So I guess you couldn't avoid
a threesome...

243
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:37,486
because even if you're the only person
in the bed...

244
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:41,159
someone has always
been there before you.

245
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:43,829
What just happened?
Where'd you go?

246
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:46,705
I was preoccupied.

247
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:48,765
No kidding. About what?

248
00:14:48,842 --> 00:14:51,777
Your ex-wife's breasts,
your ex-wife's lips...

249
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:54,609
your ex-wife's long legs.

250
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:56,980
My column.

251
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:01,351
You know, I didn't tell you I was
married because it was a long time ago.

252
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:03,253
What happened?

253
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:07,123
Alienation of affection
followed by divorce.

254
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,054
Let's not talk about the past.

255
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,758
Please?

256
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:21,203
What Mr. Big didn't realize was
the past was sleeping right next to me.

257
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:29,716
The next day, the flesh-and-blood
Barbara asked me to lunch.

258
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:32,343
Hi. Thanks for meeting me.

259
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:34,580
Thanks for inviting me.

260
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,488
Wow! You changed your hair.

261
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:40,823
Oh. Well, thanks.

262
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:44,955
- Listen, I have some not great news.
- I'm back with Mr. Big?

263
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:48,331
The head guys didn't go
for Little Cathy. But fuck 'em.

264
00:15:48,402 --> 00:15:50,893
They wouldn't know a good book
if it bit them in the ass.

265
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:52,404
Yeah, fuck 'em.

266
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,407
I still love the project.

267
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:56,966
And at the risk of sounding
like a groupie...

268
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,342
I'd really like it
if we could become friends.

269
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:02,676
Friends?

270
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,242
Two hours and four chardonnays later,
I was sleeping with the enemy.

271
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,154
- So, never been married?
- Once. Long time ago.

272
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:12,283
Really? What happened?

273
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:16,056
He had a wandering eye.
Wandered right over to my best friend.

274
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:20,459
What about you?
Are you seeing anyone?

275
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:24,801
No one special.

276
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:28,808
For Samantha, the shit
was about to hit the phone.

277
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:31,139
Hello.

278
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:33,577
It's over. I told my wife.

279
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:36,172
- Who is this?
- It's Ken.

280
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,777
Wait. You told Ruth about us?

281
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:42,413
I'm in love with you.
Now we can be together.

282
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:45,287
No, no, no.

283
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:46,792
Hang on.

284
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:53,094
- Hello.
- This is Ruth Scheer, Ken's wife.

285
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:57,126
- I found your number in his drawer.
- Hang on.

286
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:59,229
Listen to me.
You love your wife.

287
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:02,571
- No. I'm in love with you.
- No, no, no.

288
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:07,910
Sam's "no muss, no fuss" affair
was starting to feel very mussy.

289
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:10,381
- I'm back.
- I don't know who you are...

290
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,248
but Ken and I love each other
very much.

291
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,515
Of course you do.

292
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:21,027
We have an unshakable bond. Whatever it
takes, I'll keep this marriage together.

293
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:24,427
Good for you.
Listen, this was a huge mistake.

294
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:27,058
It didn't mean anything.
It was just sex.

295
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:28,795
Exactly!

296
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:31,963
And if being sexually adventuresome...

297
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:37,238
will keep this marriage together,
then I am prepared to join you...

298
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:39,142
with him...

299
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:40,646
in bed.

300
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:46,551
Oh, no. No, no, no.

301
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,852
Samantha was a guest star.
Series regular was not in her contract.

302
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:56,660
That night at the Attention Deficit
Disorder Masked Ball...

303
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,257
Charlotte felt free
to indulge her fantasy.

304
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:04,236
It's amazing what sequins on a stick
can do to free up inhibitions.

305
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:08,468
Who here is your type?

306
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:19,051
Do you like peacocks?

307
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,552
Do you?

308
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:26,659
Then Charlotte did the unthinkable.

309
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:34,322
Oh, my God.
She winked at me.

310
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:35,925
Excellent.

311
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:38,403
I need to get out of here.

312
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:49,013
Hey, you okay?

313
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:50,947
Yeah, I think so.

314
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:54,510
- How'd it feel?
- Weird.

315
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:57,489
Well, I enjoyed it.

316
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,294
- I do have another fantasy.
- What's that?

317
00:19:02,362 --> 00:19:05,661
Doing it upstairs at a party.

318
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:25,075
Can I join you?

319
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:30,185
She realized that this was her moment.

320
00:19:30,257 --> 00:19:34,023
If she was going to take the plunge,
it was now or never.

321
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:57,181
Unfortunately,
it was Jack who plunged first.

322
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,617
Apparently someone else's fire
was a little stronger than Charlotte's.

323
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:03,383
She was not the guest star
in this fantasy.

324
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,267
Meanwhile,
at a bar downtown--

325
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,174
- Miranda?
- Hi.

326
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:30,006
What a relief.

327
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,917
Most of the women who answered our ad,
they were kind of--

328
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:35,784
Butt ugly.

329
00:20:35,856 --> 00:20:37,881
Nothing like you.

330
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,887
Thanks.

331
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,157
We've never done anything
like this before.

332
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,630
It's a huge fantasy of Mark's.

333
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:48,065
I offered to do it
for this 30th birthday.

334
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:50,603
Whatever happened
to giving a nice pen?

335
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:57,806
Are you doing anything tonight?

336
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:03,173
Let me just be clear here.
You want to do a threesome with me.

337
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:08,253
If you're busy, we understand.

338
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:12,655
I tell you what. Let me just make
a quick phone call. Okay?

339
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:28,540
That night,
Miranda finally got her validation.

340
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:32,203
Her shrink had suggested
she come three times a week.

341
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:36,309
I didn't see Mr. Big for eight days.

342
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:41,184
- That was a great meal.
- Yeah, it was.

343
00:21:41,254 --> 00:21:44,587
The food was terrible, and we were
talking to each other like strangers.

344
00:21:44,658 --> 00:21:46,990
What is wrong?

345
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,494
Look, you tell me you have an ex-wife.

346
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:52,657
You tell me you guys had a three-way.
Yes, I asked.

347
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:56,327
You drop this big bomb,
and you don't give me any details.

348
00:21:56,403 --> 00:22:00,737
- You didn't tell me why you broke up.
- I cheated on her.

349
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:03,776
- I know. She told me at lunch.
- I know. She told me she told you.

350
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:06,278
- She told you?
- She told me.

351
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:10,646
That's another thing. You didn't tell me
that you're still talking to her.

352
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:12,844
I still talk to all my ex-wives.

353
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:15,513
I'm so not finding that funny.

354
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:18,023
Oh, come--
Wait a minute.

355
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,557
The reason we had the threesome
is because we were both looking...

356
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:24,927
for something or someone else.

357
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:35,402
Do you know anyone
who's right for me?

358
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:49,021
Then it was just the two of us.

359
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:53,822
And I realized the real appeal
of the threesome: It was easy.

360
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:56,158
It's intimacy that's the bitch.
