1
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,237
My friend Miranda was dating
Thomas John Anderson...

2
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,471
an up-and-coming
New York playwright.

3
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:54,740
Oh, God.

4
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:02,981
That was wonderful.

5
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:05,819
Things were great
except for one thing.

6
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,825
I'll be right back.

7
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:11,152
Immediately after sex...

8
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,596
he'd hop out of bed and shower.

9
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,905
- Be right back.
- Night after night, the same thing.

10
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:39,115
- I'll be right--
- Yeah.

11
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:42,217
She decided to confront Thomas John
Anderson as soon as he dried off.

12
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:52,527
- So, what's with the showers?
- What do you mean?

13
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:55,130
You always get up and shower
right after we're done.

14
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:57,675
I'm starting to feel like it's me.

15
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:01,702
No, it's not you.
It's just--

16
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,374
- What?
- It's just a habit I have.

17
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,942
Growing up, the nuns told us
sex was a sin.

18
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,047
So I just got into the habit
of taking a shower after l...

19
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:13,557
you know, came.

20
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:15,218
Oh, the nuns.

21
00:02:15,294 --> 00:02:19,390
Miranda suddenly realized
she was dating "Catholic Guy."

22
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:23,458
So you thing the water serves as
a retro baptism kind of thing?

23
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:25,470
Beats me. If I'd known
he was Catholic...

24
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:27,472
I never would've gone out
with him in the first place.

25
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,407
- They should make them wear a sign.
- Single people in New York...

26
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:33,104
rarely ask about their dates'
religious backgrounds...

27
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:36,443
for the same reason they don't ask
the number of former sex partners:

28
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:38,745
- too scary.
- I mean, he's a rational...

29
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:42,116
Iogical guy
in every respect but this.

30
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:44,417
Clean. You forgot clean.
He's a clean guy.

31
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,483
Leave it to me to find the only
religious guy left in Manhattan.

32
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:51,553
New York is a city
filled with places to worship.

33
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,564
But it recently dawned on me...

34
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,601
the only time I ever heard
anyone mention going into one...

35
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,534
was for a singles mixer.

36
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:01,835
Are relationships
the religion of the '90s?

37
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:05,069
Having been raised in the church
of "be nice to people...

38
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,078
and don't talk
with your mouth full"...

39
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,637
I decided to check out some more
traditional religious types...

40
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:11,649
in their natural habitat.

41
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:15,209
As I watched people leaving church,
I was amazed at how they looked.

42
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:18,688
Valentino, Escada,
Oscar de la Renta.

43
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:22,557
What is it about God and fashion
that go so well together?

44
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:26,359
And suddenly, there he was
wearing Armani on Sunday.

45
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,732
Mr. Big.

46
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:31,502
I admit it was kind of a shock.

47
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,334
Up until that moment, I thought
he only believed in the Yankees.

48
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,714
Hello there, churchgoer.

49
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:48,952
- What are you doing here?
- Research.

50
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,479
I'm doing a column on closet
Presbyterians. You know any?

51
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:55,686
Actually, I'm an atheist,
but don't tell the minister.

52
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:57,928
Who's the mystery woman?

53
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:00,599
My mother.

54
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:05,232
- I take her to church every Sunday.
- Really?

55
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:10,036
I'm so loving that.
How come you never told me?

56
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:12,600
Well, you write every Sunday, so--

57
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:16,114
So every Sunday-- church.

58
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,240
Right.

59
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:24,053
I've got 20 minutes
before my racquetball game.

60
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:26,591
- Why don't we have coffee?
- I can't. I'm on deadline...

61
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:29,651
and this cappuccino
just kicked in, so--

62
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:31,891
So?

63
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:38,200
God bless.

64
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,397
It was one of those awkward
relationship moments...

65
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:42,667
where you feel like you know
nothing about the person...

66
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,403
you thought you knew
everything about.

67
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:47,411
He goes to church
with his mother?

68
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,572
- That can't be good.
- Don't listen to her.

69
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:52,242
A man who cares about mother
makes a wonderful husband.

70
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:54,683
- I think it's sweet.
- All religions are sweet...

71
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,085
until you get to that
shower-after-sex phase.

72
00:04:57,156 --> 00:05:00,421
- Is he still doing that?
- It's amazing he has any skin left.

73
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:03,222
Have you tried
taking a shower with him?

74
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:05,422
I'm afraid he'll pull out
garlic and a cross.

75
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:08,364
So, which church
does his mother go to?

76
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:12,632
- Park Avenue Presbyterian.
- It's one of the best on the East Side.

77
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:15,173
What, are you rating churches?
ls there a Zagat guide for that?

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,141
Four stars, great bread,
disappointing wine selection.

79
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,304
The thing is, I'm dying
to meet his mother.

80
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,745
Can you imagine?

81
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,182
Getting on the good side of his
mother is like closing the deal.

82
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:29,049
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's about time.

83
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,419
I just had a five-hour lunch
with James.

84
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,321
Five-hour lunches.
I remember those.

85
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:36,122
Ladies, I have an announcement.

86
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:38,629
- Please don't laugh.
- What?

87
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:41,757
- I'm in love.
- What?

88
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:44,462
Samantha uttering
those words to us...

89
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:46,470
was an event as unfathomable...

90
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:49,234
as Moses parting the Red Sea.

91
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,734
It all started
a couple of weeks ago...

92
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,245
on a particularly blah
Wednesday night.

93
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:58,044
Samantha decided to treat herself
to a night of great music.

94
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,150
I couldn't help but notice
how you move to the music.

95
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:07,488
It's beautiful.

96
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,493
Well, I love jazz.

97
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,229
That's pretty clear.

98
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:14,629
Are you a musician?

99
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,327
Yeah.

100
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,528
Trapped in the body of a lawyer.

101
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:21,402
Well, we won't tell anyone.

102
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,241
May I join you?

103
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:27,308
Sure.

104
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,279
After they closed the jazz joint
they walked and talked for blocks.

105
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,788
You have to at least
try one of the glazed.

106
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,790
It's a little bit of heaven.

107
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:45,562
Heavenly.
And I never thought I'd get there.

108
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:48,600
Why not?
An angel like you?

109
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,266
And then Samantha did something
rather shocking for a first date--

110
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:56,273
she didn't ask him home.

111
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:59,410
Thanks, James.

112
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:02,675
I had a wonderful time.

113
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:04,682
Can I see you again?

114
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:07,551
I'd love that.

115
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:12,356
And with that one touch,
Samantha...

116
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:14,824
who was never a believer
in relationships...

117
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,986
suddenly became a convert.

118
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,691
I'd totally given up on the idea
that you could actually talk to men.

119
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:22,927
- Don't spread that around.
- Before James...

120
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:25,936
all my conversations
consisted of two sentences--

121
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:28,802
"give it to me" and "go home."

122
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:30,808
And I owe it all to Charlotte.

123
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:34,039
Me? What did I do?

124
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:36,046
All that bullshit you spout...

125
00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:38,708
about not sleeping with men
right away actually paid off.

126
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:42,550
If I'd fucked James already,
who knows where we'd be.

127
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:44,782
Wait. You haven't had sex yet?

128
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:45,881
Soon.

129
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:48,420
You know...

130
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:51,053
I think he's someone
I could actually marry.

131
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:55,232
Samantha, that's great.

132
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,736
The idea that Samantha could possibly
get married before she did...

133
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:01,238
shook Charlotte's beliefs
to the core.

134
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:03,274
She took some drastic action.

135
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:05,640
She made an appointment
to see Noanie Stine...

136
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:08,407
psychic to the stars
and a cosmic connection...

137
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,643
who lived in a brownstone between
Central Park West and Columbus.

138
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:13,981
- Is this you and Madonna?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:16,418
We go to the same Cabala class.

140
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,987
Now...

141
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:24,290
pick three cards, face down
with your left hand.

142
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,692
Charlotte had heard about Noanie
through a sorority sister...

143
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:30,860
whose marriage she had
very accurately predicted.

144
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:35,768
Now, is there one question
in particular?

145
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:38,708
Well, no.

146
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:40,244
Just--

147
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,371
There is.

148
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:44,381
When will I get married?

149
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:50,148
"Ace of wands." Prosperity.

150
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:55,582
"Nine of cups."
Strength and independence.

151
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:00,697
"The Hanged Man."
A new awakening.

152
00:09:00,766 --> 00:09:03,701
You're a strong,
independent woman...

153
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:07,136
with great success in your future,
but I do not see marriage.

154
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:11,465
- Excuse me?
- I don't see it.

155
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,575
- What?
- I don't see marriage.

156
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:19,606
Well, how can you just
say that like that?

157
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,080
I mean, what about my feelings?

158
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:27,614
Honey, I'm a psychic.
I'm not a shrink.

159
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:30,161
So, who is the fabulous mother
in the hat...

160
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:33,425
and when do I get to
go to church with you two?

161
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:36,092
You want to go to church?

162
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:38,602
You say that like I'm
the antichrist or something.

163
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:43,064
It's just I never thought of you
as the church type.

164
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:46,201
Oh, really?
What type am l?

165
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:49,975
The incredibly beautiful
and intelligent type.

166
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,409
What religion are you?

167
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:57,080
I'm no one religion in particular.
I'm open to all.

168
00:09:57,155 --> 00:09:59,817
- Kind of like a 7-Eleven?
- Come on.

169
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,884
I want to go to church with you and
your mommy. How about this Sunday?

170
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:07,796
Well, it's just
a private little thing...

171
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:10,699
my mother and I do,
just the two of us.

172
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,545
You want to go
to the Caribbean next week.

173
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:23,046
Sure. I'll go pack my jet ski.

174
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:26,380
No, I'm serious.
We could both use a vacation.

175
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:30,080
The sun, the sand, you and me.
You waiting on me.

176
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:33,022
- Can you get away?
- Yeah, but I can't afford it.

177
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,457
I'll tell you what.
I'll buy the tickets.

178
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:39,429
When we get to St. Barts,
you can buy me one big margarita.

179
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,339
Wait. I want to hold you.

180
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,884
- I'll be right back.
- Stay here a second.

181
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,916
Isn't this nice? Us together?

182
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:08,323
Yeah.

183
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:12,796
I'm just gonna go jump in the shower,
and then, boom, I'm all yours.

184
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:15,458
There's nothing sinful about sex.

185
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,831
Oh, really?

186
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:22,635
Well, thanks for clearing that up.

187
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:25,403
And what is that?
The gospel according to Miranda?

188
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,105
And next you're gonna say
that God made the body...

189
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,240
and if God made the body and sex
is an expression of that body...

190
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:35,252
how could anything made by that
God-made body be considered sin?

191
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,151
Well, yeah.

192
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:40,447
It's a miracle! I'm healed!

193
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,459
You're free to go work
with the lepers now.

194
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,461
I guess this means
I'm not going to hell.

195
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:47,327
Great news! Thank you, Miranda.

196
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,266
Thank you
for saving my immortal soul.

197
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,235
In her effort to help...

198
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:56,604
Miranda had accidentally detonated
some kind of Catholic guilt bomb.

199
00:11:57,876 --> 00:11:59,901
I'm gonna go take a shower.

200
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:02,742
When I come out, I'd kind
of like it if you weren't here.

201
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:04,813
You got it.

202
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:07,647
Six months later,
that exact same speech...

203
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:10,085
would find its way into
Thomas John Anderson's...

204
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:13,022
hit Off-Broadway play
Shower of Shame.

205
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:17,359
Meanwhile, downtown...

206
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:20,023
Samantha was preparing
to see God.

207
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:26,036
I know it's only been
a couple of weeks...

208
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:28,095
but I love you, Samantha.

209
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:30,107
I love you too.

210
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:40,251
Oh, honey,
I can't wait any longer.

211
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:43,014
Just unzip and get over here.

212
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,662
Okay, I'm ready.

213
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,829
Put it in.

214
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,601
It is in.

215
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:06,110
Samantha said a little prayer
that he was kidding.

216
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:07,611
He wasn't.

217
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:14,310
Sunday morning. A time for rest.
A time for relaxation.

218
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:16,752
A time for spying.

219
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:19,449
The plan was simple.
Just get a look at the mother...

220
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:21,458
then Miranda and I
would go for eggs.

221
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:24,461
Look at how crowded it is.
What a sham.

222
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:28,056
Will you lighten up? It's a Presbyterian
church, not a Catholic one.

223
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:31,625
Catholics, Episcopalian,
Buddhists, Shakers, Quakers.

224
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:34,399
All the same, all designed
to fuck up our sex lives.

225
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:35,905
Here, pray.

226
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:38,474
There they are.

227
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:40,272
- Where?
- Right there.

228
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:43,576
As I watched Mr. Big standing
quietly next to his mother--

229
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:47,542
tall, proud, respectful--

230
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,315
I think I fell a little bit
more in love with him.

231
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:51,582
Let us pray.

232
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:55,353
- We come together--
- We're out of here.

233
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:11,301
Here they come.
Let's make a break for it.

234
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:13,207
No, they saw me.
I have to say hello.

235
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:15,246
I can't pray and run.

236
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,473
There they are.

237
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:19,383
Go. I'm fine.

238
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:26,188
Aren't you the young lady
who made all that noise?

239
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:28,658
Slippery gloves.

240
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:30,490
- 'Morning.
- Good morning.

241
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:33,258
- It's a lovely church.
- Yes, isn't it?

242
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:37,665
- Don't you think it's lovely?
- Mother, this is my friend Carrie.

243
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:40,796
I searched her face
looking for the light of recognition.

244
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,107
But there was nothing.

245
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,209
I'm going to say good-bye to the pastor.
It was lovely meeting you.

246
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,715
"My friend Carrie"?

247
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:56,049
You show up at church
after I asked you not to.

248
00:14:56,121 --> 00:15:00,353
Are you testing me? Why all the
interest in meeting my mother?

249
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:03,121
- Has she even heard of me?
- She doesn't need to meet...

250
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,593
another girlfriend.

251
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:09,766
I didn't mean--

252
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:12,327
I mean...

253
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:15,202
I'll introduce you
as my girlfriend when I'm sure.

254
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:21,244
Look, I have to do things
on my time frame.

255
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:22,837
"Time frame"?

256
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,848
We've been going out for months.

257
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:31,451
I really don't know
what else to say to you.

258
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:34,686
We'll get there. You just
have to have a little faith.

259
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,320
- "Faith"?
- Yeah. Look.

260
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,830
In a couple of days we're going on
vacation. We can talk then.

261
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,833
Right now, I've got to get
my mother home. Okay?

262
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,062
Well, go.

263
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,004
Just go.

264
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:05,922
Move over.

265
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:13,520
I didn't leave.

266
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,998
You didn't seem fine.

267
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,535
He introduced me to his mother
as a friend.

268
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:23,903
She never heard of me.

269
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:25,909
That isn't a good sign.

270
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,676
- Maybe they're not that close.
- Don't lie. You're in a church.

271
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,221
I can't get inside.

272
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,517
I don't know what else I can do.

273
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:47,361
Late that night
in the Church of Disco...

274
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:49,593
Stanford invited everyone he knew...

275
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:52,135
to a party to introduce
a new fragrance--

276
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:53,898
Fallen Angel.

277
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:00,877
Also, he wanted to show off
his new boyfriend...

278
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:02,970
Allanne.

279
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:08,014
Isn't this fun? It's like hell
with a cover charge.

280
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:10,452
Carrie, this is Allanne.

281
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:14,116
- Hi. Nice to meet you finally.
- You too.

282
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:17,923
Did I tell you that Allanne
designed the Fallen Angel bottle?

283
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:20,321
Yes. Congratulations.

284
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:23,390
Thank you.
Excuse me for a second.

285
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:25,493
I just saw someone
I want to say hello to.

286
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:33,110
You know what we did today?

287
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:38,047
We shopped for Deco
cabinet handles for his armoire.

288
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:41,608
I turned into one of those
couples we hate and I'm loving it!

289
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,314
Stanford and Allanne
worshiped the same God--

290
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:45,981
style.

291
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:49,220
You all excited for the big vacation?

292
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:51,558
I don't know.
I can't help feeling...

293
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:55,360
Iike it's some sort of consolation prize
for not letting me in his life.

294
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,061
What is going on
with you two?

295
00:17:58,136 --> 00:18:01,867
- We're not in the greatest place.
- What happened?

296
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,306
He wouldn't introduce me
to his mother.

297
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,141
Thanks.

298
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,309
Skipper. Hi.

299
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,615
It seems Stanford had invited
everyone in his Rolodex.

300
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:19,316
I was hoping I'd see you here.

301
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,052
I've been totally thinking
about you since we broke up.

302
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:24,060
- You have?
- Totally.

303
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:27,424
You look great.

304
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:30,957
Thanks. So do you.

305
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:33,435
Miranda looked at Skipper.

306
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,564
The months apart had shed
a new light on him.

307
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,407
Actually, they'd shed a new light
on his shower-free feelings about sex.

308
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:43,845
Later that night, the three of us
tracked Samantha to the ladies' room...

309
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,179
to get the lowdown
on her love life with James.

310
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,185
Here you are. We've been
looking for you everywhere.

311
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:51,689
So, how is everything?

312
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,951
She means have you and James
done it yet?

313
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:56,725
And?

314
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:01,522
- It's nice.
- I'm so happy for you.

315
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,932
Sweetie, what is it?

316
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:09,439
Nothing.

317
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,377
What's going on?
Why are you crying?

318
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:19,840
James has a small dick.

319
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:24,284
- It's not the end of the world.
- It's really small.

320
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:26,050
- How small?
- Too small.

321
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,183
- Size isn't everything.
- Three inches?

322
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:30,318
- Well--
- Hard?

323
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:34,994
- Is he a good kisser?
- Who the fuck cares?

324
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,967
His dick is like a gherkin!

325
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:41,005
I feel so terrible.
Listen to me. I'm a bad person.

326
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:44,439
Don't beat yourself up. You had certain
expectations and you're disappointed.

327
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:46,443
Why? Why?

328
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:49,480
Why does he have to have
a small dick?

329
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:52,516
- I really like him.
- I thought you loved him.

330
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:56,986
- We've all been there.
- That's for sure.

331
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,183
I was once with a guy the size of one
of those little miniature golf pencils.

332
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:03,284
Couldn't tell if he was
trying to fuck me or erase me.

333
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:08,964
I'm sorry. It's just-- It's funny.

334
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:10,967
Let's not lose perspective.

335
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:14,471
- There are ways to work around this.
- I don't want to.

336
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:17,599
I love a big dick.
I love it inside of me.

337
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,405
I love looking at it.
I love everything about it.

338
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,570
When I blow him, it's like...

339
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,608
nothing.

340
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:31,579
- Can you talk to him about it?
- No.

341
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:34,284
It's the only thing
we can't talk about.

342
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:41,392
- What am I gonna do?
- How is he with his tongue?

343
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:49,099
Charlotte left us all behind, telling
us she had another party to go to.

344
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:55,168
She took a cab to a part of town
never mentioned in the New Yorker.

345
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:56,770
Will I ever get married?

346
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,618
I call the power of all the saints.

347
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:05,481
St. Lazarus.

348
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,116
St. Rosa. Send me your guidance.

349
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:11,361
Send me the truth.

350
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,862
Send me an answer.

351
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,344
No yolk.

352
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,041
What does that mean?

353
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,180
You'll never be married.

354
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,014
You are cursed.

355
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:42,617
But do not worry.
For $100 dollars, we can remove it.

356
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:52,665
The entire way home, Charlotte berated
herself for being so foolish.

357
00:21:52,737 --> 00:21:54,671
She simply refused
to give in to the idea...

358
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:56,639
that she would never get married.

359
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,732
Sorry.

360
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:00,903
All she had to do was keep
believing, and it would happen.

361
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,845
It was 3:00 a.m.
in the Church of Disco...

362
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:10,183
and Miranda couldn't believe
what she was about to say.

363
00:22:10,254 --> 00:22:13,712
- You want to spend the night?
- The night? The whole night?

364
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:17,292
Yeah, the whole night.

365
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:23,925
- I knew we'd get back together.
- You did?

366
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:26,230
Yep.

367
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,365
Every night I'd light a candle
and say a little prayer.

368
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:32,409
You're a freak.

369
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:37,578
Samantha tried desperately to believe
that love was stronger than sex.

370
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,384
Why are you crying?

371
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:44,487
I'm just so happy.

372
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,486
I stayed up all night
questioning my faith in faith.

373
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:56,397
I mean, hadn't I had faith
in us all along?

374
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:04,166
Faith that all the withholding
would stop.

375
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:08,704
Faith that he's say "I love you."

376
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,145
Let's go!

377
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,614
Hey, hurry.
We're gonna miss the plane.

378
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:16,880
Wait, wait.
Put them down a second.

379
00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:18,888
Just put them down.

380
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:24,955
What?

381
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:28,962
I need a sign.

382
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:32,969
I mean, you told me
to have faith, but, see...

383
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:36,666
I'm kind of losing mine, so...

384
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:38,675
I need a sign.

385
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:42,645
What, like in those old religious
movies? A voice from above?

386
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:45,172
Just tell me I'm the one.

387
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:50,883
You don't have to tell your mother
or the whole world, just--

388
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:55,792
Just tell me.

389
00:24:11,442 --> 00:24:13,376
I can't do this.

390
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:22,281
Just get in the car. Please.

391
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:24,920
I can't.

392
00:24:26,724 --> 00:24:28,658
I love you, but I can't.

393
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:36,132
So that's it?

394
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:07,963
After he left, I cried for a week.

395
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:13,034
And then I realized I do have faith.

396
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:15,868
Faith in myself.

397
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,568
Faith that I would one day
meet someone...

398
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:21,669
who would be sure
that I was the one.
