1
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,061
One of the best things about
living in a city like New York...

2
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:53,627
is leaving it.

3
00:00:57,576 --> 00:00:59,703
My friend Patience and her husband...

4
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:01,746
invited me to the Hamptons
for the weekend.

5
00:01:03,182 --> 00:01:05,582
Patience and Peter
were the perfect married couple.

6
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:07,414
They were fun, smart...

7
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:09,579
and they looked like they fell out
of a J. Crew catalog.

8
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:13,421
If their house wasn't right on
the beach, I would have hated them.

9
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:17,019
So he gets in the cab
and slides up next to me.

10
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:22,924
Yes?

11
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:24,128
And it is hot.

12
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,472
It is hot all the way from Houston
and West Broadway...

13
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,097
to 72nd and Madison.

14
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:32,735
Hampton houseguests are always required
to sing for their supper.

15
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:37,180
Brokers give investment advice.
Architects, design advice.

16
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:41,982
Single people give married friends
tidbits from their sexual escapades.

17
00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:46,987
The next morning I woke up
feeling rested and fabulous.

18
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:49,926
I couldn't wait to go out
and take in the spectacular view.

19
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,526
Morning.

20
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,760
Patience went out to get
juice and muffins.

21
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:58,427
She'll be right back.

22
00:01:58,504 --> 00:02:00,165
There he was--

23
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,766
full-frontal friend.

24
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:05,036
Good!

25
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,944
He just stood there, casual,
happy, hanging out.

26
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:11,209
- I didn't know what to do or say.
- Great!

27
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:14,946
I only knew one thing--
that's way too much Peter before coffee.

28
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:17,881
- Good morning.
- Hey.

29
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:21,392
Got some fresh juice
and the good muffins.

30
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:25,020
So what's happening?

31
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:31,860
I ran into Peter in the hallway
without his underwear on.

32
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,871
P.S. Congratulations.

33
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,938
Sunny day.

34
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:42,071
Honey, did Carrie
see your dick in the hall?

35
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:44,741
Yeah, she caught me
on the way to the bathroom.

36
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:47,251
Oh.
"On the way to the bathroom."

37
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,880
Oh, yeah! The good muffins.

38
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,990
So what are we doing today?

39
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:59,963
I barely had time to shove
a "good muffin" in my purse...

40
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:01,966
before I was on my way
back to New York.

41
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:04,696
I'm confused. Why would he do that?
Did he want to have sex with you?

42
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,761
I don't know.
It didn't feel sexual.

43
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,364
Maybe we wanted to show it off.
Like a monkey.

44
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:13,739
- So how big was it?
- Fresh pepper?

45
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,145
Yes, please.
Thank you very much.

46
00:03:19,118 --> 00:03:21,848
- That'll do.
- Would you like some fresh pepper?

47
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,548
Oh, honey,
I'd love some fresh pepper.

48
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:28,423
In fact, I think everyone at this table
could use a lot of fresh pepper.

49
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,029
Thanks.

50
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:39,098
So I told her I didn't understand
why she was so upset.

51
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:41,969
She said I couldn't understand it.
I'm single.

52
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,907
And what? Single women
prowl beach houses...

53
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:47,969
hoping for glimpses of their
friends' husbands' dicks?

54
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:50,879
- How good a friend was she?
- What's the diff erence?

55
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,883
When someone gets married,
all bets are off.

56
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:55,283
They become married,
and we become the enemy.

57
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:57,481
As the only single lawyer
working at her law firm...

58
00:03:57,556 --> 00:03:59,490
Miranda had given this topic
some thought.

59
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:02,391
Married women are threatened
because we can have sex...

60
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:04,622
anytime, anywhere with anyone.

61
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:05,958
We can?

62
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:09,899
And they're afraid we're gonna have it
anytime, anywhere with their husbands.

63
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:11,663
I would never sleep
with a married man.

64
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:14,638
What makes you so sure you haven't?
Wedding rings come off, you know.

65
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:18,802
Face it, ladies. If you're still
single, you are not to be trusted.

66
00:04:18,877 --> 00:04:21,505
Come on! Not all married women
feel that way.

67
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,209
Charlotte treated marriage like
a sorority she was hoping to pledge.

68
00:04:25,284 --> 00:04:27,309
You're right. Not all.

69
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:29,377
The ones who don't fear you
pity you.

70
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:31,320
That's not true.

71
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,450
Are you telling me you haven't gotten
those "poor single you" Iooks?

72
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:36,926
- I hate those.
- Okay, yes, I have.

73
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:40,123
I hate it when you're the only
single person at a dinner party...

74
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,461
and they all look at you
like you're a--

75
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,659
- Loser.
- Leper.

76
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:44,895
- Whore.
- Exactly!

77
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,461
I'm telling you,
married people are the enemy.

78
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:51,873
Was Miranda right?
Were we enemies?

79
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:54,970
Is there a secret cold war
between marrieds and singles?

80
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,145
I love my single friends.
But now that I'm married...

81
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:01,652
I don't see them
as much as I used to.

82
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,813
It's too painful.

83
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:06,949
They remind me of how desperate
I used to be.

84
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:09,721
When women get married,
they forget who they are.

85
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:12,889
"I" becomes "we."
"We" Ioved the movie.

86
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:14,899
"We" hate that restaurant.

87
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:19,471
My best buddy and I
did everything together.

88
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:22,063
Then he married this girl
who doesn't like me.

89
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,506
Now I only see him
on Super Bowl Sunday.

90
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:26,510
It's all about
what you want out of life.

91
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:29,103
Some people, like me,
choose to grow up...

92
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:31,115
face reality and get married.

93
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:33,549
Others choose to, what?

94
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:37,817
Live an empty, haunted life
of stunted adolescence.

95
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,291
No, it's not a cold war.
It's an out-and-out battle.

96
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,521
And it isn't just straight people.

97
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:46,291
Every gay guy I know
is running off to Hawaii...

98
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:48,629
putting on a caftan,
reciting vows...

99
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,497
and feeling superior to me.

100
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:53,538
- Caftan?
- Oh, yes, with orchid leis.

101
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:54,537
Aloha.

102
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,134
I miss the old times
when everyone was alone.

103
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,373
Now I'm starting to feel like
I'm an outcast in the outcasts.

104
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:05,715
Oh, my God! Joe!

105
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:10,913
It's been years. I haven't
seen you since you were--

106
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:12,081
Straight?

107
00:06:12,157 --> 00:06:14,318
I was gonna say in Miss Saigon.

108
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:17,260
- Still am.
- I love Miss Saigon.

109
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:20,298
Oh, this is my friend Stanford.

110
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:22,663
This is my life partner Lou.

111
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:24,759
Oh, look at that.

112
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:27,999
- Congratulations.
- Where are you registered?

113
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:30,769
- Barney's.
- I was kidding.

114
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,842
How about you?
Are you married?

115
00:06:33,912 --> 00:06:35,937
Not really. I mean no!

116
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:40,178
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Perfect!

117
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:44,979
- What?
- Lou and I want to have a child.

118
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:48,083
We already have a surrogate,
but we need a topnotch egg.

119
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,789
What are your feelings
about donating one?

120
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:55,966
Listen, here's our card.

121
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:58,002
You think about it,
and give us a call.

122
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,129
- We'll pay.
- Great seeing you.

123
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:06,544
I had just experienced single-bashing
for the new millennium.

124
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:09,103
I was no longer considered a person.

125
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:11,581
I was now an egg farm.

126
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,550
Meanwhile, in a park downtown...

127
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:16,383
another single woman
was about to be humiliated.

128
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:20,516
Miranda was obliged to attend
her firm's annual softball game.

129
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:22,685
A law firm softball game
is like any other...

130
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:25,662
except when a lawyer steals
a base, he gets promoted.

131
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:28,529
Miranda.
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

132
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,534
All right.
Let's get it over with.

133
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:36,403
Panicked at the idea of spending another
firm function labeled as a leper...

134
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:39,808
Miranda had agreed
to be fixed up on a blind date.

135
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:42,438
Miranda, this is Syd.
Syd, Miranda.

136
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,352
Look at you two.
It's a perfect match.

137
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:50,217
Well, I'm gonna excuse myself.

138
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:54,849
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

139
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:57,724
I'm gonna get a soda.
You want a soda?

140
00:07:57,796 --> 00:08:00,697
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna get us a soda.

141
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:03,368
Jeff.

142
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:05,665
Pretty great, huh?
Can I pick 'em or what?

143
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:08,137
Yeah. I'm not gay.

144
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:09,298
Seriously?

145
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:13,071
I've been with the firm eight months.
I haven't once seen you with a guy.

146
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:15,443
Circumstantial, Jeff.
I'm single.

147
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:18,506
Christ! When did being single
translate into being gay?

148
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,551
Shit.

149
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:23,713
You want me to go over there--

150
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:25,757
No, I'll do it.

151
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:31,922
Brave Miranda marched right over
and told Syd she wasn't.

152
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:34,864
They had a good laugh
and decided to stay and play ball.

153
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:49,645
Miranda and Syd's last-inning double
play got the attention of everyone...

154
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:51,945
even the firm's senior partner.

155
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:54,884
- That was quite a play, ladies.
- It's all about teamwork, Charles.

156
00:08:54,953 --> 00:08:57,751
- Chip.
- Chip.

157
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:01,657
My wife and I are having
a dinner party on the 12th.

158
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,695
Just some couples, nothing fancy.

159
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:05,957
We'd love it if you both
could make it.

160
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:07,464
We'd love to.

161
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,237
Later that night, Miranda
gave me the lowdown on her day.

162
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:18,902
So you think it's just because
they think you're in a couple?

163
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:21,172
I know it. I've been
with the firm for two years.

164
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:24,306
He's barely spoken to me.
All of a sudden, it's "Chip."

165
00:09:24,382 --> 00:09:26,111
A lawyer named Chip.
Gotta love that.

166
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:29,278
And they seemed so relieved
to have finally figured me out.

167
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:31,652
So you're going to the dinner?

168
00:09:31,723 --> 00:09:34,453
Yup. I'm determined
to make partner in this firm...

169
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:36,960
even if I have to be
a lesbian partner.

170
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:39,326
After Miranda left,
I had a thought.

171
00:09:39,397 --> 00:09:41,695
Maybe the cold war
isn't about hate.

172
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:45,794
Maybe it's about fear,
fear of the unknown.

173
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:48,305
Married people don't hate singles.

174
00:09:48,373 --> 00:09:51,706
They just want us figured out.

175
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:54,371
I felt it was time
to stop all the speculation...

176
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:56,209
and infiltrate the enemy camp.

177
00:09:56,281 --> 00:10:00,342
Lunch with my favorite couple,
David and Lisa.

178
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:03,683
Well, I don't think of us
as married so much as together.

179
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:05,347
- Wait. Are we married?
- Yeah.

180
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:08,290
Remember that day you wore the white
dress and we got all the flatware?

181
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,089
Oh, yeah.

182
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:12,528
I guess I should
stop seeing other men.

183
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:14,758
What about you?
You like being single?

184
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,664
Most of the time, yeah.

185
00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:18,635
Then there are the other times.

186
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:22,366
Like family functions when you're
the only one that's not married...

187
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,169
and they sit you at the kid's table.

188
00:10:24,242 --> 00:10:29,373
Or when you two eat off
the same fork, I just--

189
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:31,381
Oh, man, that's so sweet.

190
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:34,475
Don't start crying.
He's such a pussy.

191
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:37,317
But you do want
to get married someday, right?

192
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:39,249
I don't know.

193
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:41,758
I'm beginning to think
I may not be the marrying kind.

194
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:42,885
Really?

195
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:45,225
No sooner had the words
come out of my mouth...

196
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:47,265
than I wondered if they were true.

197
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:50,902
Hey, Sean! What a surprise!

198
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:53,164
This is our friend Carrie.

199
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:55,172
We just about to have dessert.
Want to join us?

200
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,503
Sure.

201
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,778
This is such a surprise.

202
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:06,512
Another time I hate being single is when
married friends "surprise" fix you up.

203
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:08,610
Two espressos
and a tiramisu later...

204
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:11,315
I had learned that Sean
was the youngest of three brothers...

205
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,323
had his own investment firm...

206
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:16,360
and was about to move into
an apartment he had just purchased.

207
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:18,896
- You know this was a fix-up, right?
- Oh, please.

208
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:21,091
I could smell it
before you walked in the door.

209
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,566
My parents met on a fix-up...

210
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:26,536
and they will be married
41years next month.

211
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:28,664
Wow. That's great.

212
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,176
It was then I realized I was
having coffee with the marrying guy.

213
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:35,577
That elusive and rare Manhattan man
whose sights were set on marriage.

214
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:39,208
So, Carrie, can I see you again?

215
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:41,419
Sure.

216
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:49,319
Over the next week and a half,
I met Sean for a movie...

217
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,756
I met him for another movie...

218
00:11:56,468 --> 00:12:00,632
and I helped him pick out a top of the
line cheese grater at Williams-Sonoma.

219
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,673
My buddies are giving me
a big housewarming on the 12th.

220
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:05,801
-You should come and bring your friends.
-Sounds like fun.

221
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:10,271
Thanks for a great day.

222
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:15,217
He was like the flesh-and-blood
equivalent of a DKNY dress.

223
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:19,280
You know it's not your style, but it's
right there so you try it on anyway.

224
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:24,260
It was the night of the 12th.
On the East Side...

225
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:28,129
a pseudo-lesbian couple attended
a right-wing Republican dinner party.

226
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:37,006
On the West Side,
a trio of single gals...

227
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:39,669
went to a single guy's
housewarming party.

228
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:43,407
- So are his friends cute?
- Don't know. I haven't met them yet.

229
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:46,211
How did you manage to get
a new boyfriend in a week?

230
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:50,050
He's not my boyfriend.
He's just somebody I'm trying on.

231
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:51,554
All right. Ready?

232
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:00,660
Everywhere I looked,
people were standing in twos.

233
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:03,895
It was like Noah's Upper West Side
rent controlled ark.

234
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:05,903
It's all married couples.

235
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:09,702
Samantha gave me a look like
I had sold her to the enemy...

236
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:11,742
for chocolate bars and nylons.

237
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,941
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

238
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:18,039
You must be Charlotte.

239
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:20,914
- And you have to be Samantha.
- Yeah. Where's the bar?

240
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:24,114
Kitchen. You can't miss it.
Room with the stove.

241
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:26,919
- This apartment is amazing.
- I've been planning it for years.

242
00:13:26,992 --> 00:13:28,926
I'll give you the grand tour.

243
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:33,294
As I moved through the married couples,
I noticed something was different.

244
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:35,890
No fear, no pity, no pointing.

245
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:39,368
Were Sean's friends cold war
conscientious objectors...

246
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:41,803
or was it just that
I was "figured out"?

247
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:47,839
My accountant says that it's best
to go with low-risk stocks.

248
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:49,971
That depends.
What are your expectations?

249
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:51,913
Well, I'm not sure.

250
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:56,143
Honey, I need you to come
over here and meet someone.

251
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:58,917
Sure. This is Samantha.
Samantha, this is Elaine.

252
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,888
His wife.

253
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:03,151
Honey, I really need you
in the other room.

254
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:06,425
Sure. It was nice
talking to you, Samantha.

255
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:12,326
And this is the den.

256
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:15,066
Oh, you have one of these
leather club chairs. I love these.

257
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,700
Thanks. I'm using this room
as an office now...

258
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:20,643
but someday this is gonna be
the kid's room.

259
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:21,736
Look.

260
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:26,882
I got this three years ago
in Aspen.

261
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,942
What do you think?

262
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:35,916
Okay, I owe you.

263
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:39,191
I didn't know that all his buddies
were gonna be married.

264
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:41,664
Oh, my God.
You're doing tequila shots?

265
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:43,325
You see that buddy over there?

266
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:46,430
I fucked him.

267
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,770
See that buddy over there?

268
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:51,536
I fucked him too.

269
00:14:52,877 --> 00:14:54,936
I never thought I'd see them again.

270
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,208
Maybe we should start tagging
your married men...

271
00:14:57,282 --> 00:14:59,477
and that way you can
keep track of them.

272
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:03,043
- He's gonna ask you to marry him.
- He is not.

273
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:05,055
I've been dating him
a week and a half.

274
00:15:05,123 --> 00:15:08,115
No guy buys a classic six
on the Upper West Side...

275
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:11,185
unless they are seriously
thinking about marriage.

276
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:14,629
Some people read palms.
Charlotte read real estate.

277
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,532
If you turn into one of those
married assholes...

278
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:19,536
I'll kill you.

279
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:24,999
Sean is the greatest guy,
and he love kids.

280
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:30,237
Plus, he owns his own business,
and he's got 300,000 in the bank.

281
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:33,614
We both slept with him,
and he is great in bed.

282
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:35,880
An hour and a half
into this housewarming...

283
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:39,822
I had gone from party guest
to prisoner of war.

284
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:42,223
Samantha is totally drunk.
I've gotta get her out of here.

285
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:45,729
- You're not going anywhere without me.
- Carrie.

286
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:48,823
Oh, God. More friends.

287
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,060
Surprise!

288
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:52,326
It certainly was.

289
00:15:52,403 --> 00:15:55,236
Last time I saw Patience,
she was shoving me on a bus.

290
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:59,208
When Sean told us you and he
were dating, we were so thrilled.

291
00:15:59,277 --> 00:16:03,111
Oh. Well, listen. About what happened
at your beach house--

292
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:05,672
- Don't mention it.
- I just-- I'm not even sure--

293
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,479
I said don't mention it.

294
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:10,953
This party is terrible.
Who are you?

295
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:14,480
This is my friend Patience,
and this is her husband Peter.

296
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,628
I heard about you.

297
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:21,231
Big pepper mill dick!

298
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:27,996
And just as suddenly,
our little cease-fire was over.

299
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:32,872
Meanwhile, across town
things were winding down.

300
00:16:32,944 --> 00:16:35,139
Thank you so much.
We really had a great time.

301
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:37,943
As did we all.

302
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:40,348
She is a real find.

303
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:42,386
We'll do it again soon.

304
00:16:42,453 --> 00:16:45,422
I'll meet you at the elevator, okay?
I need to--

305
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:49,720
We can't do it again soon.

306
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:51,785
Syd and I aren't really a couple.

307
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:54,525
In fact, we're not even
really lesbians.

308
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:57,033
Well, Syd is. I'm not.

309
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:59,365
I just took advantage
of the situation...

310
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:01,735
to bend your ear
about my work at the firm.

311
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,404
Shrewd move, Counselor.

312
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:07,304
- No harm done.
- Thank you, sir.

313
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:09,312
My wife will be disappointed.

314
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,838
She was looking to add
a lesbian couple to our circle.

315
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:18,918
As they rode between floors...

316
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,983
Miranda considered how much easier her
life would be if she were in a couple.

317
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:24,494
Any couple.

318
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:32,266
Yep.

319
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:34,828
Definitely straight.

320
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:37,306
Yeah. You are.

321
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:39,608
Sorry.

322
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:44,112
While Miranda cursed
her heterosexuality...

323
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:46,844
and wondered how much longer
she could fight the war...

324
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:51,346
Charlotte cursed tequila
and forced Samantha into a cab.

325
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:54,220
She decided Samantha was too drunk
to get home alone...

326
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:56,624
and insisted she spend
the night on her couch.

327
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:08,964
Let me get that door for you.

328
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:15,145
- All right.
- I like him.

329
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:19,082
She got Samantha upstairs
and safely to bed.

330
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,084
Or so she thought.

331
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:26,619
A couple of hours later, Samantha woke
up still drunk and still single.

332
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:28,784
And single to Samantha
meant one thing.

333
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,393
- Can I have a cigarette?
- Sure.

334
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,642
Can I have a kiss?

335
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,220
Jesus.

336
00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:02,551
I really shouldn't.
Somebody might see.

337
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:06,158
Why don't you come upstairs,
just for a minute?

338
00:19:23,781 --> 00:19:26,909
Don't be scared, miss.
It's me, Tommy. I'm just leaving.

339
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:29,578
Your friend invited me up.
I know it was wrong.

340
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:32,680
But I've been so lonely
since I left home...

341
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:34,691
and I wanted the feel of...

342
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,489
a woman's touch on me.

343
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:40,490
I'm going into the bathroom now...

344
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:44,296
and when I come out,
you won't be here.

345
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,303
And I never want this
mentioned again.

346
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:49,904
Let me get the door for you, miss.

347
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,277
I was hoping you'd stay over.

348
00:20:05,757 --> 00:20:08,157
Look, Sean...

349
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:10,023
I don't think this is gonna work.

350
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:13,029
We want different things.
You obviously want to get married...

351
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:15,258
and I don't know what I want.

352
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:20,434
You could smell my desperation, right?

353
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:24,540
It's just--

354
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:28,844
I was trying you on.

355
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:30,676
You know?
See if it fit.

356
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:34,074
It doesn't.

357
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:35,813
I'm sorry.

358
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:45,895
I don't understand you women.

359
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:47,794
All I hear is...

360
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:50,129
"I want to get married."

361
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:53,669
And none of you says yes.
What the fuck?

362
00:21:03,915 --> 00:21:06,884
I'm so tired
of going through women.

363
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:08,885
I just want to get married.

364
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:13,686
I may know someone
who's perfect for you.

365
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:16,859
Who?

366
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,331
They started out casual--
a brunch here, a concert there.

367
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:24,095
But pretty soon
they were visiting china.

368
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:27,103
I always wanted this pattern
for formal dining.

369
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:30,640
Are you serious?

370
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:37,412
Charlotte broke it off then and there.
It would never work.

371
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:40,474
He was American Classic;
she was French Country.

372
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,150
Your friend never called
like she promised.

373
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:48,351
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

374
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:56,428
As I sifted through the rubble
of my marriage skirmish...

375
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:57,593
I had a thought.

376
00:21:57,668 --> 00:22:00,000
Maybe the fight between marrieds
and singles...

377
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:02,096
is like the war
in Northern lreland.

378
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:04,107
We're all basically the same...

379
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:06,769
but somehow we wound up
on different sides.

380
00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:10,837
Sure, it'd be great to have that
one special person to walk home with...

381
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:12,906
but sometimes there's nothing better...

382
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:15,544
than meeting your single girlfriends
for a night at the movies.
