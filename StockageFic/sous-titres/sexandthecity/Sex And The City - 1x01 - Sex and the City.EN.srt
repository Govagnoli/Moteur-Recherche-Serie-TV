1
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:53,014
Once upon a time,
an English journalist came to New York.

2
00:00:57,853 --> 00:00:59,821
Elizabeth was attractive and bright.

3
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:03,916
Right away she hooked up with one of
the city's typically eligible bachelors.

4
00:01:03,993 --> 00:01:06,985
The question remains--
Is this really a company we want to own?

5
00:01:07,063 --> 00:01:11,227
Tim was 42, a well-liked
and respected investment banker...

6
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,734
who made about two million a year.

7
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:19,733
They met one evening,
in typical New York fashion...

8
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:21,743
at a gallery opening.

9
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:30,419
Like it?

10
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:33,512
Yes, actually.
I think it's quite interesting.

11
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:35,986
What?

12
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:38,618
I feel like
I know you from somewhere.

13
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:40,685
Doubtful.
I only just moved here from London.

14
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:44,665
London? Really?
That's my all-time favorite city.

15
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:47,066
- It is?
- Absolutely.

16
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:49,161
It was love at first sight.

17
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:50,830
You know...

18
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:55,009
I think perhaps I have met you
somewhere before.

19
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:02,015
For two weeks they snuggled...

20
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,846
went to romantic restaurants...

21
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,985
had wonderful sex...

22
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:14,324
and shared
their most intimate secrets.

23
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:18,563
One warm spring day...

24
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:21,899
he took her to a town house he saw
in Sunday's New York Times.

25
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:24,804
How 'bout if we start at the top
and work our way down?

26
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:27,502
There are four bedrooms upstairs.
Do you have any children?

27
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:29,009
Not yet.

28
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:33,447
That day, Tim popped the question.

29
00:02:33,516 --> 00:02:36,110
How'd you like to have dinner
with my folks Tuesday night?

30
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:38,745
I'd love to.

31
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,312
On Tuesday,
he called with some bad news.

32
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,950
My mother's not feeling very well.

33
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:45,584
Well, gosh, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:48,255
- Could we take a rain check?
- Of course.

35
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:51,164
Tell your mum
I hope she feels better.

36
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:54,800
When she hadn't heard from him
for two weeks, she called.

37
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,601
Tim, it's Elizabeth.
That's an awfully long rain check.

38
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:01,802
He said he was up to his ears
and that he'd call her the next day.

39
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,639
He never did call, of course.
Bastard.

40
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:10,015
- She told me one day over coffee.
- I don't understand.

41
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:13,920
In England, looking at houses together
would have meant something.

42
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:17,516
Then I realized no one had told her
about the end of love in Manhattan.

43
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:23,057
Welcome to the age of "un-innocence."

44
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:28,693
No one has breakfast at Tiffany's,
and no one has affairs to remember.

45
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:31,433
Instead,
we have breakfast at 7:00 a.m...

46
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:34,305
and affairs we try to forget
as quickly as possible.

47
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:39,309
Self-protection and
closing the deal are paramount.

48
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:42,647
Cupid has flown the co-op.

49
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:47,414
How the hell did we
get into this mess?

50
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:53,150
There are maybe tens of thousands
of women like this in the city.

51
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:56,858
We all know them,
and we all agree they're great.

52
00:03:56,932 --> 00:04:00,060
They travel. They pay taxes.

53
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:03,833
They'll spend $400 on a pair
of Manolo Blahnik strappy sandals.

54
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:06,566
And they're alone.

55
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,171
It's like the riddle of the Sphinx.

56
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:16,082
Why are there so many
great unmarried women...

57
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:19,178
and no great unmarried men?

58
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:21,689
I explore these sorts of issues
in my column...

59
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:24,089
and I have terrific sources: my friends.

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,891
When you're a young guy in your 20s,
women are controlling the relationship.

61
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:30,488
So by the time you're
an eligible man in your 30s...

62
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:33,126
you feel like you're being
devoured by women.

63
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:36,535
Suddenly, the guys are
holding all the chips.

64
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:39,836
I call it the mid-30s power flip.

65
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:47,843
It's all about age and biology.

66
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:50,317
I mean, if you want to get married,
it's to have kids, right?

67
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:53,753
Not with someone older than 35, 'cause
you have to have kids right away...

68
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:56,053
and that's about it.

69
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,322
I think these women should
just forget about marriage...

70
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:00,987
and have a good time.

71
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:08,362
I have a friend who'd always gone out
with extremely sexy guys...

72
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:10,371
and just had a good time.

73
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:13,567
One day she woke up,
and she was 41.

74
00:05:13,642 --> 00:05:17,134
She couldn't get any more dates.
She had a complete physical breakdown...

75
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:21,343
couldn't hold her job and moved back
to Wisconsin to live with her mother.

76
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:29,189
Trust me-- this is not a story
that makes men feel bad.

77
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:33,319
Most men are threatened
by successful women.

78
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:36,387
If you want to get these guys,
you have to keep your mouth shut...

79
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:38,399
and play by the rules.

80
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:44,433
I totally believe
that love conquers all.

81
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:46,805
Sometimes you just have to
give it a little space...

82
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:49,276
and that's exactly what's missing
in Manhattan--

83
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:51,540
the space for romance.

84
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:56,375
The problem is expectations.

85
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:59,615
Older women don't want to settle
for what's available.

86
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:06,025
By the time you reach your mid-30s
you think, "Why should I settle?"

87
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,563
You know?

88
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:12,294
It's like the older we get,
the more we keep self-selecting...

89
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:15,166
down to a smaller and smaller group.

90
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:17,228
What women really want is
Alec Baldwin.

91
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:23,240
There's not one woman in New York who
hasn't turned down 10 wonderful guys...

92
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:26,975
because they were
too short or too fat or too poor.

93
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:30,485
I have been out with some of
those guys-- the short, fat, poor ones.

94
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:32,180
It makes absolutely no difference.

95
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:36,020
They are just as self-centered and
unappreciative as the good-looking ones.

96
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:39,060
Why don't these women
just marry a fat guy?

97
00:06:39,128 --> 00:06:44,122
Why don't they just marry
a big, fat tub of lard?

98
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,364
Happy birthday, dear Miranda

99
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:52,999
Happy birthday to you

100
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:57,205
Another 30-something birthday with
a group of unmarried female friends.

101
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,975
We would all have preferred
a nice celebratory conference call.

102
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:01,846
- You were saying?
- Look.

103
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:05,512
If you're a successful single woman
in this city, you have two choices:

104
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:08,148
You can bang your head against the wall
and try and find a relationship...

105
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:10,987
or you can say "screw it,"
and just go out and have sex like a man.

106
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,498
- You mean with dildos?
- No, I mean without feeling.

107
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:19,261
Samantha was a New York inspiration.

108
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:21,269
A public relations executive...

109
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:24,829
she routinely slept
with good-looking guys in their 20s.

110
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:28,399
Remember that guy I was going out with?
Oh, God, what was his name? Drew.

111
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,968
- Drew the sex god.
- Right. Afterwards?

112
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:34,174
I didn't feel a thing. It was like,
"Hey, babe, gotta go. Catch ya later."

113
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,843
And I completely
forgot about him after that.

114
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,581
But are you sure that isn't
just 'cause he didn't call you?

115
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:42,988
Sweetheart, this is the first time
in the history of Manhattan...

116
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:45,390
that women have had
as much money and power as men...

117
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:48,828
plus the equal luxury
of treating men like sex objects.

118
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:51,889
Yeah, except men in this city
fail on both counts.

119
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,901
I mean, they don't want to be
in a relationship with you...

120
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:56,494
but as soon as you only want them
for sex, they don't like it.

121
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:59,063
All of a sudden they can't perform
the way they're supposed to.

122
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:02,372
- That's when you dump them.
- Ladies, are we really that cynical?

123
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:04,378
What about romance?

124
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:06,107
- Yeah!
- Who needs it?

125
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:08,706
It's like that guy, Jeremiah,
the poet.

126
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:11,810
I mean, the sex was incredible.

127
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:15,050
But then he wanted to read me
his poetry and go out to dinner...

128
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:17,888
and the whole chat bit, and I'm like,
"Let's not even go there."

129
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,895
What are you saying? That you're just
going to give up on love?

130
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:23,022
- That's sick.
- No, no, no. Believe me...

131
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:25,464
the right guy comes along,
and you two here, this whole thing--

132
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:27,764
- right out the window.
- That's right!

133
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:32,239
Listen to me! The right guy is
an illusion. Start living your lives.

134
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:36,607
So you think it's really possible
to pull off this whole...

135
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,340
women-having-sex-like-men thing?

136
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:42,043
- You're forgetting The Last Seduction.
- You're obsessed with that movie.

137
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:47,646
Okay, Linda Fiorentino fucking that guy
up against the chain-link fence.

138
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:50,590
And never having one of those "Oh,
my God, what have I done?" epiphanies.

139
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:52,092
I hated that movie.

140
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,057
Was it true?

141
00:08:56,131 --> 00:09:00,227
Were women in New York really giving up
on love and throttling up on power?

142
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:03,738
What a tempting thought.

143
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:11,343
I'm beginning to think the only place
one can still find love and romance...

144
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:14,382
in New York is the gay community.

145
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,283
It's straight love
that's become closeted.

146
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:19,320
Stanford Blatch was
one of my closest friends.

147
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:24,087
He owned a talent agency and, at
the moment, was down to a single client.

148
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,990
So, are you telling me...

149
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:27,961
that you're in love?

150
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,295
How could I possibly
sustain a relationship?

151
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:34,392
You know Derek takes up like,
a thousand percent of my time.

152
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,268
Don't you think
that's a bit obsessive?

153
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,206
I'm a passionate person.
His career is all I care about.

154
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:43,870
When that's under control, then I can
concentrate on my personal life.

155
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:47,143
Stanford, he's an underwear model.

156
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:50,242
With a billboard in Times Square.

157
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:52,844
Oh, my God. Don't turn around.

158
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:55,412
The loathe of your life is
at the bar.

159
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:58,023
It was Kurt Harrington...

160
00:09:58,093 --> 00:10:01,324
a mistake I made when I was 26...

161
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:03,261
and 29...

162
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:04,663
and 31.

163
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:07,668
Carrie, don't even go there.

164
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:09,601
What?
Do you think I'm a masochist?

165
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:11,263
- The man is scum.
- Good.

166
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,242
Because I don't have the patience to
clean up this mess for the fourth time.

167
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,245
Will you relax?
I don't have a shred off eeling left.

168
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:19,610
Thank God.

169
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:23,509
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to visit the ladies' room.

170
00:10:25,387 --> 00:10:28,652
It was true.
I no longer felt a thing for Kurt.

171
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:32,490
After all these years,
I finally saw him for what he was:

172
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,927
a self-centered, withholding creep...

173
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:37,693
who was still the best sex
I ever had in my life.

174
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:41,293
However, I did have
a little experiment in mind.

175
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,440
Wow. What are you doin' here?

176
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:53,947
Hey, babe.

177
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:58,448
- God, you look gorgeous.
- Thanks.

178
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:02,319
So, how's life?

179
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:05,451
Not bad. Can't complain. You?

180
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:08,462
Oh, you know, just writing the column.
The usual.

181
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,624
So, you seeing anyone special?

182
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,665
Not really. You?

183
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:16,966
Oh, just a couple guys.

184
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,768
- Well, you look good, though.
- So do you.

185
00:11:25,314 --> 00:11:27,009
So...

186
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,880
what are you doing later?

187
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:32,546
I thought you weren't talking to me
for the rest of your life.

188
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:34,714
Who said anything about talking?

189
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:40,484
What do you say to my place, 3:00?

190
00:11:41,563 --> 00:11:43,963
All right. See ya there.

191
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,176
Are you out of your mind?
What the hell do you think you're doing?

192
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:02,149
Oh, calm down.
It's research.

193
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:05,816
Oh, God. Oh, Kurt.

194
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:08,516
Kurt was just like I remembered--

195
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,889
better-- because this time...

196
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,293
there would be none of that
messy emotional attachment.

197
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,131
All righty. My turn.

198
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:30,406
Oh, sorry.
I have to go back to work.

199
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:33,973
What? Are you kiddin'?
You're serious?

200
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:36,711
Oh, yeah. Completely.
But I'll give you a call.

201
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:38,650
Maybe we can do it again sometime.

202
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:41,355
Yeah, but--

203
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,189
As I began to get dressed,
I realized that I'd done it.

204
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,894
I'd just had sex like a man.

205
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:56,628
I left feeling powerful,
potent and incredibly alive.

206
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:58,570
I felt like I owned this city.

207
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,131
Nothing and no one
could get in my way.

208
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:14,252
- Number one, he's very handsome.
- There ya go.

209
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:17,156
Number two, he's not wearing
a wedding ring.

210
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:22,492
Number three, he knows I carry
textured Trojans with a reservoir tip.

211
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:23,826
Thanks a lot.

212
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:25,799
Anytime.

213
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:45,620
Later that night,
Skipper Johnston met me for coffee...

214
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:47,780
and confessed
a shocking intimate secret.

215
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:49,585
Thank you.

216
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:52,252
Do you know that it has been,
like, a year?

217
00:13:53,362 --> 00:13:54,954
Really?

218
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,430
I don't understand that.
You're such a nice guy.

219
00:13:57,499 --> 00:14:00,730
That's the problem.
I'm too nice, you know?

220
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:03,999
I'm a romantic.
I just have so much feeling.

221
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,040
Are you sure you're not gay?

222
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:09,009
No! I'm sensitive...

223
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:11,807
and I don't objectify women.

224
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,372
You know, most guys,
when they meet a girl...

225
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,510
the first thing that they see is--

226
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:20,452
- You know--
- Pussy?

227
00:14:20,522 --> 00:14:22,615
Oh, God! Oh!

228
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:25,455
I hate that word.

229
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:28,428
Don't you have any friends
that you can hook me up with?

230
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:32,098
- They're too old for you.
- I like older women.

231
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:35,169
Maybe.

232
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:38,832
- Maybe my friend Miranda.
- When?

233
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:42,673
Tomorrow night. We're all going
downtown to this club, Chaos.

234
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:44,336
Great.

235
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:47,481
Don't tell her I'm nice.

236
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:50,878
Miranda was gonna hate Skipper.

237
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:54,353
She'd think he was mocking her
with his sweet nature...

238
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:57,290
and decide he was an asshole...

239
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,294
the way she had decided
all men were assholes.

240
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:09,101
- Hello?
- Hey, Carrie, it's Charlotte.

241
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,798
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

242
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:12,840
Look, I can't meet you guys
for dinner tomorrow night...

243
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:14,967
because I have an amazing date.

244
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:16,135
With who?

245
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:19,647
Capote Duncan. He's supposedly some
big shot in the publishing world.

246
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:20,942
- Do you know him?
- Did I know him?

247
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:24,144
He was one of the city's most
notoriously "un-gettable" bachelors.

248
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:29,122
Wait, don't even answer that question
because, frankly, I don't care.

249
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:34,390
And another thing. I'm not buying any
of that women-having-sex-like-men crap.

250
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:39,298
I didn't tell her about my afternoon of
cheap and easy sex and how good it felt.

251
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:43,030
All right. Fine. Have a good time,
and promise to tell me everything.

252
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:44,697
Well, if you're lucky.

253
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:46,934
- Bye.
- All right. Bye.

254
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:53,144
Friday night at Chaos.

255
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:56,742
It was just like that bar in "Cheers"
where everybody knows your name...

256
00:15:56,818 --> 00:16:00,481
except here they were likely
to forget it five minutes later.

257
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:02,715
Hi.

258
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:08,161
Still, it was the creme de la creme
of New York whipped into a frenzy.

259
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,562
Sometimes you got a souffle...

260
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,891
sometimes cottage cheese.

261
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:16,938
It is like a model bomb
exploded in this room tonight.

262
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:20,532
Is there a woman here aside from me
who weights more than a hundred pounds?

263
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:23,305
I know.
It's like "Undereaters Anonymous."

264
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:25,005
That's funny, Skippy.

265
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,981
- Skipper.
- I have this theory...

266
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:32,577
that men secretly hate pretty girls
because they rejected them in school.

267
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:35,316
Right. But if you're not
part of the "Beauty Olympics"...

268
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,985
you can still become
a very interesting person.

269
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,721
Are you saying
that I'm not pretty enough?

270
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:42,786
No, no, no.
Of course you are.

271
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:45,196
So, ipso f acto,
I can't be interesting?

272
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:47,201
Women fall into one of two categories:

273
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:50,670
beautiful and boring
or homely and interesting, is that it?

274
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:53,230
No, that's not what I meant.

275
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:56,004
Excuse me.
Is this your hand on my knee?

276
00:16:57,746 --> 00:16:59,577
Let's just keep 'em
where I can see 'em, all right?

277
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:03,607
Well, I guess you must
find me beautiful.

278
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:06,279
- Or interesting.
- I was about to rescue Skipper...

279
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:09,585
from an increasingly hopeless situation,
when suddenly--

280
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,957
Lucky me, twice in one week.

281
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:16,657
Well, I don't know if you're going
to be getting that lucky.

282
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,926
You know, I was really pissed off
the way you left the other day.

283
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,661
- You were?
- Yeah.

284
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,930
Then I thought, how great!

285
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:24,733
You finally understand
the kind of relationship I want...

286
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:26,398
and now we can have sex
without commitment.

287
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,643
Yeah. Right. Sure. I guess.

288
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:34,978
- So when I feel like it, I'll call you.
- Yeah, please.

289
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,417
Whenever you feel like it.
If I'm alone, I'm all yours.

290
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:40,477
Right.

291
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:41,852
I like this new you.

292
00:17:41,923 --> 00:17:43,254
Call me.

293
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:44,417
Yup.

294
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:48,689
I didn't understand.

295
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:53,223
Did all men secretly want their women
promiscuous and emotionally detached?

296
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:58,068
And if I was really having sex like a
man, why didn't I feel more in control?

297
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:00,699
You see that guy?
He's the next Donald Trump...

298
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:03,471
except he's younger
and much better looking.

299
00:18:05,313 --> 00:18:06,871
Hi.

300
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:09,007
- You know him?
- No.

301
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:10,915
I've never seen him in my life.

302
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:14,581
He usually dates models, but, hey,
I'm as good-looking as a model...

303
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:17,181
plus I own my own business.

304
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:19,591
Samantha had the kind
of deluded self-confidence...

305
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:22,494
that caused men like Ross Perot
to run for president...

306
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:25,192
and it usually got her
what she wanted.

307
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:27,735
Well, if you're not gonna hit on him,
I will.

308
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:29,531
And there she went--

309
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:32,596
off to take her best shot
with Mr. Big.

310
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:39,909
Meanwhile, Charlotte York was having
a splendid evening with Capote Duncan.

311
00:18:39,981 --> 00:18:42,882
Wanna go back to my place
and see the Ross Blechner?

312
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:45,545
I'd love to,
but it's really getting late.

313
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,212
No problem.

314
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:53,751
- What year was it painted again?
- '89.

315
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:56,058
Though Charlotte was determined
to play hard-to-get...

316
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:58,622
she didn't want to end the evening
too abruptly.

317
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,033
Well, maybe just for a minute.

318
00:19:07,742 --> 00:19:10,575
This could easily go
for a hundred grand.

319
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:12,875
Ross is so hot right now.

320
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:16,712
It's beautiful.

321
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:20,119
No, you're beautiful.

322
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:26,425
Thank you for tonight.

323
00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:28,325
- Yeah?
- I had a wonderful time.

324
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:29,988
Well, it was my pleasure.

325
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,474
I have to get up
really early tomorrow.

326
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:51,714
I'll get you a cab.

327
00:19:56,624 --> 00:20:00,788
Charlotte told me she thought she had
played the entire evening flawlessly.

328
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:09,369
So, what are you doing
next Saturday?

329
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:12,668
I'm having dinner with you.

330
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:25,251
- You're going to the West Side, right?
- Right. West Fourth and Bank, please.

331
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:30,681
Hey, scoot over, will ya?
Two stops:

332
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,989
Fourth and Bank and...

333
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:34,688
West Broadway and Broom.

334
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:38,927
- You're going to Chaos?
- Oh. Yeah.

335
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:41,795
Why?

336
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:44,528
Look, I understand
where you're coming from...

337
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:46,471
and I totally respect it...

338
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,068
but I really need
to have sex tonight.

339
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:55,405
Back at Chaos...

340
00:20:55,483 --> 00:20:57,678
things were swinging into high gear...

341
00:20:57,752 --> 00:21:00,346
and Samantha was
putting the moves on Mr. Big.

342
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:02,583
I've been smoking cigars for years...

343
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:04,955
back when they were
terminally uncool.

344
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:08,325
I've got this great source that sends me
Hondurans. Do you want to try one?

345
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:10,796
- No, thank you.
- Really? You can't find them anywhere.

346
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:14,900
Cohibas-- that's all I smoke.

347
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,572
Look, I do the PR for this club...

348
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,474
and I have the key
to the private room downstairs.

349
00:21:29,217 --> 00:21:30,514
Really?

350
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:33,317
You want a private tour?

351
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,291
No, thanks,
but maybe another time.

352
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:47,496
Meanwhile...

353
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:51,869
Skipper Johnston was hopelessly smitten
with Miranda Hobbes.

354
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,467
- So, where we goin' now?
- Listen, Skippy...

355
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:58,706
you know, you really are a nice,
sweet guy, but--

356
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:02,013
Oh, I understand.

357
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,345
Good night.

358
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:12,757
Miranda told me later
that she thought he was too nice...

359
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:15,660
but that she was willing
to overlook one flaw...

360
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:20,960
and Capote Duncan found his fix
for the night.

361
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:26,363
Where is it?
I wanna see the Ross Blechner.

362
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:28,102
Wait. Later.

363
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:30,105
Later.

364
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:42,323
Oh, listen, l--

365
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,085
I gotta get up really early...

366
00:22:44,158 --> 00:22:46,558
and, actually, you can't stay over.

367
00:22:46,628 --> 00:22:48,289
Cool?

368
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:50,797
Sure. I have to
get up really early too.

369
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:09,308
Taxi! Taxi!

370
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:15,681
And so another Friday night
in Manhattan crept towards dawn.

371
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:24,162
Just when I thought
I would have to do the unspeakable--

372
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:25,597
walk home--

373
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:39,576
Well, get in, for Christ's sakes.

374
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,448
- Where can I drop you?
- 72nd Street and Third Avenue.

375
00:23:53,394 --> 00:23:55,828
- Have you got that, Al?
- Yes, sir.

376
00:23:57,498 --> 00:23:59,932
So, what have you been
doing lately?

377
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:02,561
You mean besides going out
every night?

378
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:04,571
Yeah. I mean,
what do you do for work?

379
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:06,197
Well, this is my work.

380
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:09,072
I'm sort of a sexual anthropologist.

381
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:13,045
You mean like a hooker?

382
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:17,509
I write a column called
"Sex and the City."

383
00:24:17,585 --> 00:24:20,577
Right now I'm researching an article
about women who have sex like men.

384
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:23,417
You know, they have sex...

385
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:25,982
and then afterwards
they feel nothing.

386
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,689
- But you're not like that.
- Well, aren't you?

387
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:33,932
Not a drop.
Not even half a drop.

388
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:38,171
Wow. What's wrong with you?

389
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:43,302
I get it.

390
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:45,846
You've never been in love.

391
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:48,205
Oh, yeah?

392
00:24:48,282 --> 00:24:49,544
Yeah.

393
00:24:51,753 --> 00:24:54,620
Suddenly I felt
the wind knocked out of me.

394
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:57,783
I wanted to crawl under the covers
and go right to sleep.

395
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:09,667
- Thanks for the ride.
- Anytime.

396
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:15,237
Wait.

397
00:25:20,848 --> 00:25:23,112
Have you ever been in love?

398
00:25:24,318 --> 00:25:26,786
Abso-fuckin'-lutely.

399
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:38,455
