1
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:49,474
New York City is all about sex.

2
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:52,536
People getting it.
People trying to get it.

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,772
And people who can't get it.

4
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:58,615
No wonder the city never sleeps.
It's too busy trying to get laid.

5
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:02,747
But if you ever actually do manage
to get someone in bed...

6
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:04,758
the real fun begins.

7
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:09,292
That's the kind with nuts in it.

8
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:11,298
We love our nuts.

9
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:20,531
After sleeping together
for many weeks...

10
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:24,567
Mr. Big and I had gotten comfortable
enough to really sleep together.

11
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:31,975
It was nice.
It was the way...

12
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:34,521
I'd always dreamed it could be.

13
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:36,716
- Good morning.
- Morning.

14
00:01:46,668 --> 00:01:48,636
Was that you?

15
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:50,830
Oh, my God.

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,970
I think it might be worse
under there.

17
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:56,408
Shut up!

18
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:03,250
I hadn't dressed so quickly
since the time...

19
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:05,252
I was caught in the boy's dorm
sophomore year.

20
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,413
- Wait. Don't you want some coffee?
- Oh, gosh.

21
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:09,423
I'm late for a thing.

22
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:13,216
Oh, my God. I was mortified.

23
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:16,488
I didn't call him
the rest of the day.

24
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:21,024
I tried to lose myself in work,
but every time I stopped to think...

25
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:25,129
- Oh, God.
- I'd relive my hell all over again.

26
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,942
The next day, I realized
how childish I was behaving.

27
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:33,606
I decided to stop avoiding the situation
and take the grown-up approach--

28
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,114
complete and utter denial.

29
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:37,879
I saw the Met is opening
a new Goya exhibit.

30
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,147
Do you want to go this Saturday?

31
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:42,519
Sure.

32
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,990
Could you get me
some more duck sauce, please?

33
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:46,993
I most certainly can.

34
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:52,391
Oh, and we have to stop and see
the Renoirs. I love the Renoirs.

35
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:03,804
There's a moment in every relationship
where romance gives way to reality.

36
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:23,688
You know-- You know what?

37
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:26,461
I'm exhausted.

38
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:30,197
You mind if we just
call it a night? Okay?

39
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:31,499
Sure.

40
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:35,008
Good night.

41
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:36,008
'Night.

42
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:42,615
That was the first night
we slept together and didn't make love.

43
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:45,619
By the middle of the next week,
it was three times in a row...

44
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,621
and I was beginning to worry.

45
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:49,657
Three times? Try three months.

46
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:51,988
- No.
- Yes.

47
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,552
Now would be a good time to wipe
that horrified look off your face.

48
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,359
I'm sorry, sweetie.

49
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:59,992
I just-- I didn't know.
Where have I been?

50
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:02,002
You've been having sex.

51
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,200
I've been at Blockbuster
renting videos. It's tragic.

52
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:08,799
I'm like two rentals away
from a free pound a Gummy Bears.

53
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:10,571
Relax.
You're just in a dry spell.

54
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:12,579
I can't believe you said that.

55
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:15,775
You're all freaked out about three
times. I'm talking three months.

56
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,876
That's different. Not doing it when
you're with someone means much more...

57
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,784
than not doing it
when you're not with someone.

58
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:22,345
What are you worried about?

59
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:25,153
I thought you said everything felt
really comfortable and great.

60
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:27,717
- Maybe too comfortable.
- What do you mean?

61
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:31,696
I farted.

62
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:34,792
I farted in front of my boyfriend.

63
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:37,929
- And?
- And we're no longer having sex.

64
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:40,566
And he thinks of me
as one of the boys.

65
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:43,202
And I'm gonna have to move
to another city...

66
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:46,577
where the shame of this
won't follow me.

67
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:48,309
You farted. You're human.

68
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:50,351
I don't want him to know that.

69
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:53,319
I mean, he's this perfect guy.

70
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:56,323
He walks around his perfect apartment
with is perfect suit.

71
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:59,258
He's perfect, perfect, perfect,
and I'm the girl who farts.

72
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:02,091
- No wonder we're not having sex.
- You're insane!

73
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:04,688
It's been three times.
It's perfectly normal.

74
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:07,894
Says who? I mean...

75
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,800
say it's not the--

76
00:05:09,871 --> 00:05:11,896
then what else is going on?

77
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:14,464
Is it normal to be
in the same bed and not do it?

78
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:17,443
I guess it depends
on what's normal for you.

79
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:19,446
Oh, God. I hate that.

80
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:21,914
Who am I to know what's normal?

81
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:23,917
I haven't dated in a hundred years.
I haven't a clue.

82
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:27,580
Well, three months
is not normal for me.

83
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:30,556
One month was interesting.
Two months was numbing.

84
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:34,186
Three months, I am going
out of my mind.

85
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:37,459
There are 1.3 million
single men in New York...

86
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,591
1.8 million single women.

87
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:42,602
And of these
more than 3 million people...

88
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,366
about 12 think
they're having enough sex.

89
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,931
How often is normal?

90
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:51,274
I have to masturbate three times
a day just to make it through.

91
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:54,179
Some people take coffee breaks,
I take jerk-off breaks.

92
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:57,877
They say the average 33-year-old woman
has sex 3.5 times a week.

93
00:05:57,952 --> 00:05:59,886
I'd like to know
who that woman is.

94
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:03,446
My wife and I haven't has sex
since the baby was born.

95
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:05,617
The baby's applying to Yale
next fall.

96
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:09,822
Once-- One time a day...

97
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:13,458
but two time on very special day.

98
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:18,028
Normal is the halfway point between
what you want and what you can get.

99
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:20,870
Even in the plow position,
I could count on Samantha...

100
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:23,069
for amazing sexual clarity.

101
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:25,612
Very good. Let's move on
to downward facing dog.

102
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:31,882
With him, I could do it
every hour on the hour.

103
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:35,047
Do you think it means something
if Big and I are sleeping together...

104
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:37,057
but we're not sleeping together?

105
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,117
- The truth?
- When have I ever wanted that?

106
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:41,252
Okay, tell me.

107
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:43,058
I think there's trouble.
I mean...

108
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,861
sex is a barometer for what's
going on in the relationship.

109
00:06:47,235 --> 00:06:49,169
I wasn't going to tell you this,
but...

110
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:52,928
I farted.

111
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:58,008
- Then move your mat away.
- Not now. I did it in front of Big.

112
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:01,046
- Huge mistake.
- You think?

113
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:04,081
It wasn't a choice.
I'm human. It happened.

114
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:07,918
No, honey, you're a woman, and men
don't like women to be human.

115
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:09,980
We aren't supposed to fart, douche...

116
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:12,389
use tampons or have hair
in places we shouldn't.

117
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,260
I mean, hell, a guy once broke up
with me because I missed a bikini wax.

118
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,729
I knew it.

119
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:20,859
This is a watershed relationship moment
I'm never gonna be able to erase.

120
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:21,993
Sure you will.

121
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:25,300
Just go over there and fuck his brains
out and he'll forget all about it.

122
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:28,365
Men aren't that complicated.
They're kind of like plants.

123
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:31,276
- Concentrate. Quiet your insides.
- Now he tells me.

124
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:33,870
Roll over on your backs.
Take goddess pose.

125
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,643
Let your breathing work with you.

126
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:40,951
In...

127
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:42,785
and out.

128
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,390
In.

129
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:47,553
Out.

130
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:52,495
Would you like to go
for a coffee sometime?

131
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:55,092
Forty-five minutes and
three animal positions later...

132
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:57,603
Samantha and Siddhartha were sipping
green tea...

133
00:07:57,672 --> 00:07:59,663
at a nearby health food restaurant.

134
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,230
Tofu or not tofu.

135
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:04,972
I always feel so amazing after yoga.

136
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:07,480
My body feels so open, so alive...

137
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:09,607
so ready for anything.

138
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:13,075
Yes?

139
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:14,348
I'm celibate.

140
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:18,883
I practice "parmacharia,"
Tantric celibacy.

141
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,621
I gave up sex three years ago.

142
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:22,822
My God. Why?

143
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:27,197
Or more importantly, why?
Didn't you like it?

144
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:30,294
Oh, I loved it.
I'd have sex mooring, noon and night.

145
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:32,965
Sometimes three women a day,
and I was always ready for more.

146
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,907
- Now you're just being cruel.
- No.

147
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:37,911
It was all ego.

148
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,948
And where I am now
is so much better than sex.

149
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:44,246
Oh, come on, honey.
Nothing's better than sex.

150
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:46,218
Think about really good f oreplay.

151
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:50,090
Your sexual energy's
just starting to awaken.

152
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:52,682
Now imagine a three-year foreplay...

153
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:57,655
where all that sexual energy
is coursing through your body...

154
00:08:57,732 --> 00:08:59,666
but it never gets released.

155
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:02,032
It just recycles.

156
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:06,068
Builds. Rises.

157
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,840
Until your entire being is humming
with that electric sexual energy.

158
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:14,541
My apartment's
just around the corner.

159
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:18,813
The only thing hotter than sex
is not having sex.

160
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:22,378
Amazingly, talking dirty
about not having sex...

161
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:24,617
was the most sexually deviant act...

162
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:27,092
Samantha had
participated in for months.

163
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:29,220
The next night when
I met Charlotte for dinner...

164
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:31,390
I had reached my own
transcendental state.

165
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:33,456
Pure Mr. Big obsession.

166
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:37,337
The first time he was tired.

167
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:40,806
The next two times, l--

168
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:45,573
I don't know. I don't know.
It's bad, isn't it?

169
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:48,774
Relax. There's nothing wrong
with your relationship.

170
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:52,046
- That's not all. I--
- What?

171
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,388
I couldn't bring myself
to tell her.

172
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:57,287
I was afraid she'd go
spontaneously deaf.

173
00:09:57,358 --> 00:10:00,020
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

174
00:10:00,094 --> 00:10:03,530
People put too much emphasis
on the importance of sex.

175
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:06,032
It's not the most important thing
in a relationship.

176
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,830
- Right.
- Take Kevin and l, for example.

177
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:11,337
We've been going out for weeks,
and we still haven't done it.

178
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:14,533
I mean, we touch and cuddle...

179
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:17,772
but he's sweet,
and he respects my boundaries.

180
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:22,282
I like it. It makes it special.
Oh, there he is.

181
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,877
Meeting a friend's new boyfriend
for the first time is always tense.

182
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:27,944
What if you don't like him?
What if he doesn't like you?

183
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:29,956
Kevin, this is my good friend Carrie.

184
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,187
What if you've
already slept with him?

185
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:38,657
- You two know each other.
- Well, kind of.

186
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,963
We used to go out.

187
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:43,765
Well, kind of used to go out.

188
00:10:43,838 --> 00:10:46,932
You two used to go out?
That's so funny.

189
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,238
- Isn't that funny?
- That's my office.

190
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,278
I gotta take this.
I'[Il be right back.

191
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:56,642
Okay, when?

192
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,648
- Three years ago?
- Three years. I can live with that.

193
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:02,620
Serious?

194
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,284
- No.
- Good. Why'd you break up?

195
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:08,161
We were in different places
and l--

196
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:11,562
We don't have time for diplomacy.
Just tell me.

197
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:13,122
He's a sex maniac.

198
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:22,799
When Charlotte discovered that Kevin
had tucked his libido away...

199
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:27,439
for her comfort level, she was
even more moved by his restraint.

200
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:30,211
I want you to know how much
I appreciate your patience.

201
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:33,916
You've been so patient with me.

202
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:36,479
Shows how much you really care.

203
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:38,491
And all that waiting...

204
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,050
is gonna make it
all the more special for us now.

205
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:49,894
There's only gonna be one stop.
Thanks.

206
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:07,387
I don't think this is gonna work.

207
00:12:08,222 --> 00:12:10,554
- Why? ls it me?
- No, you're great.

208
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:13,149
I'm just not that sexual a guy.

209
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:17,428
It's me. I know it's me.

210
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:20,865
Look, Carrie told me
that you were quite sexual.

211
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:24,598
In fact, I believe
she used the word "maniac."

212
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:26,367
That was before.

213
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,902
- Before what?
- Prozac.

214
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:33,378
- Prozac.
- Yeah. I used to be such a mess.

215
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:36,746
Mr. Mood Swing.
It's a total lifesaver.

216
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:39,718
The only downside is
it takes the air out of my tires.

217
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:42,950
After a while, it's
kind of like a taffy pull.

218
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:46,959
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

219
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:50,989
I don't.
I wish I could say I felt worse...

220
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:54,865
but to tell you the truth,
these days, nothing gets me down.

221
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:56,869
You want to watch a movie?

222
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:03,109
Terrified of going to Mr. Big's...

223
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:05,771
for what could become
another platonic sleepover...

224
00:13:05,846 --> 00:13:10,977
I paced my apartment and tried not
to think about our lack of sex when--

225
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:13,576
There they were, my new neighbors--

226
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:15,588
Mr. and Mrs. Get-it-on.

227
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:20,184
A couple so obviously into each other
there was only one thing to do--

228
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,193
watch.

229
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:28,101
Then something wonderful happened.

230
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:30,535
My desire overcame my fear.

231
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:32,367
Hi, it's me.

232
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:34,373
Is it okay if I come over?

233
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:39,446
Meanwhile, across town at the corner
of Nirvana and West Third...

234
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:42,949
Siddhartha was helping Samantha
along her newfound path.

235
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:45,884
"Blocks are connection
to our inner life...

236
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:47,511
and true identities."

237
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:50,614
- You're hard.
- I know.

238
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:53,023
"Our addictions and attachments...

239
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,118
are a way to block
our spiritual hunger...

240
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,296
through unhealthy
and dependent ways."

241
00:13:58,365 --> 00:14:00,697
- You're still hard.
- It'll go down.

242
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:02,429
So can l.

243
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:14,870
I showed up at his apartment
feeling sexy and confident.

244
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:17,417
Wearing my secret-weapon skirt
that really hugged my hips...

245
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:19,008
I was ready to go.

246
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:21,020
He didn't have a prayer.

247
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:27,793
Very nice. Come on in.
I'm watching the fight.

248
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:36,735
Baby.

249
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,274
Come on. Let me watch this.

250
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,082
Oh, man!

251
00:14:58,993 --> 00:15:00,927
Jesus, Carrie! Come on!

252
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:03,623
Would you knock it the fuck off?
I'm trying to watch this fight.

253
00:15:03,697 --> 00:15:05,187
Fine. I'll leave.

254
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:08,235
What is wrong with you?
Why are you acting so nuts?

255
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:12,238
Maybe I'm not perfect. Maybe
I don't fit into your perfect life...

256
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:15,070
with your perfect apartment
and your perfect pay-per-view fight.

257
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:16,473
Maybe I should leave.

258
00:15:19,513 --> 00:15:21,572
I stood there and waited
for the obligatory...

259
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:24,345
he's-coming-to-stop-me
ten seconds.

260
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:25,942
He didn't.

261
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,252
By the time I got home, I was sure he'd
left an apology on my voice mail.

262
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:33,122
You have no new messages
in your mailbox.

263
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:35,661
I didn't sleep very well that night...

264
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:38,163
but I wasn't the only one.

265
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:41,360
After a night of spiritual reading
with her hunky guru...

266
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:45,496
Samantha began to feel things
she hadn't felt in a very long time--

267
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,437
frustrated and horny.

268
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:49,976
She decided it was time
to put an end to her suffering.

269
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:53,673
But just as she reached the place
Krishna called the gateway to life...

270
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:56,875
she turned back
and decided not to enter.

271
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:58,714
After all, she'd come this far.

272
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:01,880
She could continue
not to come at all.

273
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:04,652
In an effort
to get her mind off sex...

274
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:07,421
Miranda had rented
a five-hour Danish documentary...

275
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:09,428
on the Nuremberg trial.

276
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:12,056
- It actually worked until--
- Hey, gorgeous!

277
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:14,532
Why don't you quick drop this?

278
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,865
Hey, she's thinkin' about it.

279
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:22,466
Where you goin' so fast?
I got what you want, what you need.

280
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:25,944
Like every woman consumed
with a relationship problem...

281
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:28,709
I needed a project
to keep my mind from obsessing...

282
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:30,716
and my hands from dialing his number.

283
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:37,590
Three months and one week.

284
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:40,752
Miranda needed to keep
her hands busy as well.

285
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:43,422
- Did he call?
- Nope.

286
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:46,022
And it's been two days.

287
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,433
Nice color. Ecru?

288
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:50,435
Egg shell.

289
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:55,873
Well, I think it's over.

290
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:57,877
I should never have farted.

291
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:00,641
Jesus, Carrie! That's it.
I've heard enough about the fart.

292
00:17:00,714 --> 00:17:04,707
- It's not the fucking fart.
- I know it's not the fucking fart.

293
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:06,719
I think I'm in love with him...

294
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:10,723
and I'm terrified that's he's gonna
leave me because I'm not perfect.

295
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,383
All right.

296
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:16,395
Let's just put the roller down
and go in the other room and talk.

297
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:19,557
Sex has stopped.
He hasn't called.

298
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,726
What if he never calls
and three weeks from now...

299
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:24,293
I pick up The New York Times
and I read that he's married...

300
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:28,501
some perfect little woman who never
passes gas under his $500 sheets.

301
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,372
When did you get so obsessed
with being perfect?

302
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:32,878
I don't know. It's something about him.
You should see me around him.

303
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:36,848
I'm not like me.
I'm like "together Carrie."

304
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:41,286
I wear little outfits-- "sexy Carrie,"
and "casual Carrie."

305
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:45,052
Sometimes I catch myself
actually posing. It's exhausting.

306
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,888
Then stop.

307
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,258
Why don't you show him
more of this Carrie? She's great.

308
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,388
What if he doesn't like her?

309
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,933
Oh, my God!

310
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:58,198
Look at them.

311
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,105
I had no idea
they did an afternoon show.

312
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:04,940
When a show is good,
word gets around.

313
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:08,038
There we were, the '90s version
of matinee ladies.

314
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:10,049
Who said the theater was dead.

315
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:12,881
Samantha, I cannot believe
that you would give this up on purpose.

316
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:15,922
- Actually, I hardly miss it.
- How long has it been?

317
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:18,958
- A hundred years.
- It never goes down, does it?

318
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:21,517
- Look, it's still--
- Hard.

319
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:23,859
- Yeah.
- Gummy Bear, please.

320
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:30,201
- Give me the fucking candy.
- Hey, snapping over Gummy Bears...

321
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,500
might be a sign
that celibacy's not for you.

322
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:34,666
All I can say is that my big payoff
better be worth it.

323
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:36,675
Samantha, I don't understand you.

324
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:39,439
There are people starving out there
and you're fasting.

325
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:41,640
Stop complaining. At least
you can take care of yourself.

326
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:43,649
I'm way beyond that point.

327
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:45,685
Beside, I think I've given myself
carpal tunnel.

328
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:48,016
Sure, it's all fun until you
get to know each other.

329
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:52,958
That move is what there famous for.

330
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:57,094
It's been an hour.
How can that guy still be--

331
00:18:57,164 --> 00:18:58,654
Hard.

332
00:18:58,732 --> 00:19:01,394
I have got to try this again
with Kevin.

333
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:05,598
We really like each other. That's
got to be stronger than a drug, right?

334
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:07,139
I'm warning you.

335
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:10,699
If I make it to four months,
I'm humping one of you.

336
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:15,615
Oh, my God.

337
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:17,013
I hate them.

338
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:20,713
After the second show, each of us
went on with our Saturdays.

339
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:23,779
Miranda went to get a movie
and another pound of Gummy Bears.

340
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:26,155
Hey, it's my sweetheart!

341
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:29,161
You're looking good, baby.
Good enough to eat.

342
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:31,823
Where are you goin', doll?
I got what you want.

343
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,367
- I got what you need.
- You talking to me?

344
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:36,425
We got a live one, boys.

345
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:39,734
You got what I want?
You got what I need?

346
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:43,242
Well, what I want is to get laid.
What I need is to get laid.

347
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,802
- I need is to get laid.
- Take it easy, lady. I'm married.

348
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,646
All talk and no action, huh?
What a cafone!

349
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:53,712
Yeah, she's something else.

350
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:57,223
Samantha decided to channel
her frustration at yoga.

351
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,020
Good.

352
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:02,323
Now release and breathe.

353
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:06,799
Unless you're planning to move
those hands down, get them off me.

354
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:09,631
Exhale and turn around
into asana.

355
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:12,763
She had reached the end
of her path and her patience.

356
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:25,546
Wanna fuck?

357
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:29,788
Wanna fuck?

358
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:31,591
Yeah.

359
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:41,165
Samantha spent the afternoon
having multiple yo-gasms.

360
00:20:41,235 --> 00:20:45,194
Later that night, Charlotte was
determined to prove she was stronger...

361
00:20:45,272 --> 00:20:48,139
than selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitors.

362
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,403
Isn't your arm getting tired?

363
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:52,775
No, I think it's starting to work.

364
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:57,816
It's not,
and I'm beginning to chafe.

365
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:09,595
- You okay?
- Yeah.

366
00:21:09,663 --> 00:21:13,793
I've just never been
in this situation before.

367
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,801
Do you think you'll ever--

368
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:20,372
- Never mind.
- What, think I'll ever go off it?

369
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,704
- Yeah.
- Nope.

370
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:25,176
Not even for me?

371
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:27,406
Nope.

372
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:30,973
Come on. Wouldn't you rather be
with a guy who'd kind and giving...

373
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:32,985
and not that interested in sex...

374
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:35,988
than an unstable, oversexed prick
who only wants to get laid?

375
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:42,187
Nope.

376
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:45,698
Once Charlotte realized she couldn't
get what she thought she didn't want...

377
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:48,826
she couldn't imagine
going on without it.

378
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:53,239
Saturday night's dinner came and went
with no call from Big.

379
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:55,241
My life was suddenly shit...

380
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:57,243
but my cabinets
were looking fabulous.

381
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,814
- Who is it?
- Me.

382
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:10,850
- Surprise.
- Yeah.

383
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:23,935
- What's all this?
- I'm painting.

384
00:22:24,004 --> 00:22:26,370
I can see that.

385
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,431
Why didn't you call?

386
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:31,443
Why didn't you call?

387
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:37,316
So this is where you live.

388
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:42,717
About time you invited me up.

389
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:44,780
I didn't invite you.

390
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:46,291
I know.

391
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:57,170
It's nice. Very nice.

392
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:59,171
No, it's not. It's a mess.

393
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:03,843
The floors need to be stripped
and the curtains are--

394
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,878
I want to change a lot of it.

395
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:09,515
I don't know.

396
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,851
I like it.

397
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:20,592
I like it the way it is.

398
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:24,063
What was that all about
the other night?

399
00:23:24,898 --> 00:23:26,832
That was me...

400
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,492
having a meltdown.

401
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:40,540
Nice paint.

402
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:42,548
- Egg shell?
- Yes.

403
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:54,187
Did you know there's a couple
humping outside of your window?

404
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:56,729
Really? Oh, I never noticed.

405
00:23:57,864 --> 00:24:01,630
All I could think was
why aren't we having sex?

406
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:05,193
Is this normal? What's wrong?

407
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:07,206
- Where are we going?
- Oh, hell.

408
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:11,371
We can do better than that.

409
00:24:15,315 --> 00:24:17,249
And then he kissed me.

410
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:23,379
Odd how normal can sometimes
feel so uncomfortable.
