1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,790
Every morning, New Yorkers
leave their crowded apartments

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,316
and head out to the crowded streets
on their way to work.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,314
Today, I was one of them.
Sometimes a girl needs a new start.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,232
I had a new do, a new mortgage,

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,799
and therefore a new job.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,354
I had just submitted my first article

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,272
for one of today's most relevant

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,476
and provocative magazines,

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,473
at least to me: "Vogue".

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,791
Also known as Mecca, where I belong.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,030
This isn't "Vogue".

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,156
You didn't like it?

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,915
- No one is saying that.
- I am. I didn't like it.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,312
What Enid is trying to say is
that you wrote a wonderful first draft.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,198
That isn't "Vogue".

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,750
The article I'd put my heart
and soul into was bleeding.

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,195
Your spin on the idea is clever.

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,035
Different types of men
as the new accessories for fall.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,671
"A Prada dress should always be worn
with an investment banker."

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,512
That's wonderful.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,990
The assignment was 500 words
on accessories, not men.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,039
I'm not convinced she knows anything
about purses or men.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,350
Enid, for the love of God...

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,149
What you've handed us
is just your newspaper column

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,551
with the word "style"
where the word "sex" used to be.

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,838
We don't want "Vogue" according
to your agenda. No one cares.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,278
I don't care about your agenda.
I care about designers.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,159
Oscar de la Renta, Chanel, Dior.

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,835
I want less Carrie Bradshaw
and more:

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,357
"carry this bag with these shoes".
You're a writer. Write this down.

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,195
I was trying to introduce the bags
and bracelets

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,351
with a little humour.

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,909
Kind of, men are the new black.

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,989
- It was supposed to be funny.
- It was supposed to be bags.

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,553
I didn't really bring
a writing implement.

36
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,438
OK, bags.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,076
An hour later, Enid had to leave
for a lunch date,

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,196
presumably to devour another writer.

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,476
Don't let Enid get to you.

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,111
She just came back from Paris.
Apparently humour is out this season.

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,750
Billie Holiday. The only woman
in more pain than you right now.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,318
Come on, Cookie. Chin up.

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,835
In publishing you need
two things:

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,470
a tough hide and a dry Martini.

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,195
Martinis in the morning.
Is this allowed? Is it "Vogue"?

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,035
Only in emergencies.
The last time I did this was

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,158
when I heard that fun fur
was making a comeback.

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,275
Look at this mess.
Why was I even hired?

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,673
You have me to blame for that. My
daughter introduced me to your column.

50
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,195
I thought you'd be a natural
at "Vogue".

51
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,875
- I guess you thought wrong.
- Haven't been wrong yet.

52
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,191
"Vogue" is all about vision
and you have got vision.

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,318
We have to hide your vision
from Enid's.

54
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,153
A little less you,
a little more purse.

55
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,871
Come on.

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,678
Drink.

57
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,958
Cheers.

58
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,876
One and a half Martinis later.

59
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,398
The sad thing is, this is what I do best.
Look at it!

60
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,475
- Cookie, you're drunk.
- Yeah, Cookie's drunk.

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,517
I'm drunk at "Vogue".

62
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,672
How can you get so drunk
on one and a half Martinis?

63
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,153
I didn't eat breakfast and I'm a size two.
Perfect for "Vogue". But no.

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,269
- I'm drunk and a failure at "Vogue".
- I feel awful. This is my fault.

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,273
I came in here today so cocky.
I thought I knew it all.

66
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,238
I had my man jokes

67
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,710
and my purse puns.
You heard her.

68
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,668
What do I know about purses? Nothing.
What do I know about men?

69
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,752
I spilled. I spilled at "Vogue".

70
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,356
Maybe we'd better just take you home.

71
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,876
I can't go out there.
I'm drunk.

72
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,638
I'm drunk at "Vogue"!

73
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,635
Left, right, left.

74
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,475
Look at me. Pretend I'm saying
something fantastic about corsets.

75
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,588
- Tell me that wasn't Anna Wintour.
- It wasn't. Left, right.

76
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,275
Left. Left...

77
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,358
I'm so sorry.

78
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,192
That night, at a more appropriate
cocktail hour...

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,591
There must be something you want
for your birthday.

80
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,072
- What I want is not to celebrate it.
- What if I want to celebrate it?

81
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,232
That would be enough.
I have everything I need.

82
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,473
It's not about needing.
It's about wanting something for fun.

83
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,029
Something decadent, naughty even.

84
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,510
May I tempt you with dessert?
How is everything?

85
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,274
- Delicious, thank you.
- Alexa.

86
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,556
I pre-ordered our chocolate soufflé

87
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,234
if you're in the mood
for something sweet.

88
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,834
Thank you for keeping
an eye on us.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,118
I couldn't help it. You're the most
attractive couple here.

90
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,915
I know what I'd like for my birthday.
A championship fuck fest with you.

91
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,992
Then consider your candles blown.

92
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,116
And Alexa.

93
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,958
You asked.

94
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,510
Is a three-way with a 21-year-old
a bad birthday idea?

95
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,753
- And a four-way next year?
- He'll cheat with me or without me.

96
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,429
- Happy birthday to you!
- He didn't ask for a hooker.

97
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,513
- These are the options?
- At least I'm part of the fantasy.

98
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,593
The fantasy being he is attractive
to someone who could be his daughter.

99
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,957
He is, that's the problem.
Richard's in his prime.

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,429
Men get better looking
as they get older.

101
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,989
- Women get...
- Three-ways, apparently.

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,038
Or a Marc Jacobs little notebook.

103
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,590
Evidently, I'm recommending it
to "Vogue" shoppers.

104
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,796
Just be careful.

105
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,590
If a man has a fantasy and you fulfil it,
the relationship could blow up.

106
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,309
Then you're the idiot
who did it with him on the golf course.

107
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,313
- Was that you and Trey?
- It's a "for instance".

108
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,995
Sorry I'm late.
I was shopping for a stroller.

109
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,948
I should be doing the things
I have to do before the baby comes

110
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,315
and I'm unable
to leave my apartment.

111
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,996
- Like jujitsu and off-track betting?
- Like buying a crib.

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,551
Evidently I'm to go to "Crib World".
"Crib City" wasn't big enough.

113
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,110
Why isn't there a store called
"This Is The Crib For You"?

114
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,953
They deliver it
and help you raise your child.

115
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,272
- You don't have a crib yet?
- No, Charlotte. I have a job instead.

116
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,796
When am I supposed to find time
to prepare for this baby?

117
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,238
- I don't have a vague idea.
- I don't have a "Vogue" idea.

118
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,994
- What about old One Ball?
- I tried that.

119
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,789
He starts acting all father figure,
I get territorial.

120
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,474
It's too complicated for "Crib World".

121
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,838
Let me help you. It's not too late
to have a baby shower.

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,070
I hate baby showers.

123
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,869
The games, the finger sandwiches,
the oohing and aahing.

124
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,838
- I don't ooh and aah.
- Think of the gifts.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,197
It would be a great way
to get all the stuff you need.

126
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,319
- Who would I invite?
- Anyone who invited you to theirs.

127
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,075
It's your shower.
You can invite whoever you choose.

128
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,870
You want to throw me a baby shower
after all you've been through?

129
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,634
I think it would be good for me.

130
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,233
OK, but no cutesy storky shit.

131
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,428
Just a dignified lunch with presents,
which I will open after everyone leaves.

132
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,956
- You have to open the presents.
- No opening of presents,

133
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,271
no games, no crustless bread.
I want fried chicken.

134
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,715
It's not Super Bowl Sunday!

135
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,599
It's my shower
and I'll fry if I want to.

136
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,958
- What shall we do for our gift?
- Stick to the registry, Three-way.

137
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,078
Charlotte decided that if she was going
to host a baby shower,

138
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,518
she should hide the evidence
that she had wanted one of her own.

139
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,031
Later that week, I had a meal with
the perfect dinner accessory: Julian.

140
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,910
My wife is a former dancer.
The first time I saw her on stage,

141
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,868
I fell in love with her.
She pliéed and I plotzed.

142
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,595
- 24 years next September.
- You got married after grade school.

143
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,230
I knew there was
something about you I liked.

144
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,192
Is there a man in your life?
Is it a great love?

145
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,150
I just broke up with somebody.

146
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,553
Yes, it was a great love.

147
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,759
But he went there
and I went there.

148
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,150
And there you have it.

149
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,311
Julian, the reason that I asked
you to dinner tonight...

150
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,313
- You knew I'd pay?
- Besides that.

151
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,875
I really appreciate
your interest in my article,

152
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,508
but I've decided not to finish it.

153
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,434
You're just going to quit?
I don't let my kids quit.

154
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,036
I'm not one of your kids.
I'm a girl you get drunk sometimes.

155
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,079
Forget about me. What would
your father say about you quitting?

156
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,549
He wouldn't have a lot to say.

157
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,837
He quit my mother and me
when I was little.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,514
I mean a long time ago.
I was five.

159
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,389
- Why did he leave?
- No idea. Never said.

160
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,908
And that's the name of that tune.

161
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,510
- What?
- It's interesting.

162
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,672
Your father leaves without any answers

163
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,150
and you spend your life
asking questions about men.

164
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,233
It's 20 years of analysis.
Forgive me?

165
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,188
"Vogue". What if I could fix it
so that you only deal with me

166
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,591
and Enid spends less time
hating your writing?

167
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,231
Cookie, you're no quitter.
We get to work on this together.

168
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,158
- Why are you being so sweet?
- Martini guilt.

169
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,439
Later that night, I got to thinking
about fathers, or the lack of them.

170
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,592
A daughter's relationship
with her father is the model

171
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,115
for all her relationships with men.

172
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,556
Is that pop psychology
or is there some truth to it?

173
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,430
Does an imperfect model
mean a life of imperfect relationships?

174
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,628
I couldn't help wonder:
how much does a father-figure figure?

175
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,836
I understand your concern,

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,515
but I'm looking at the contract
right now...

177
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,989
Could you hold for a moment?

178
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,151
I'm on a conference call.

179
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,198
Charlotte York says it's an emergency.

180
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,435
- What's wrong? You OK?
- I'm fine.

181
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,115
You forgot to include a
Manhattan Whoozit in your registry.

182
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,876
A learning toy.
Active toys make for passive children.

183
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,316
I don't have time.
I'm on a conference call.

184
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,713
- What about a Peek A Ball?
- I have to get back.

185
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,031
I saw a gorgeous centrepiece
in the shape of a stork.

186
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,839
- I'm at work!
- We have to order it by noon.

187
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,434
Its feathers are white Fiji Mum.

188
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,034
- What did I say?
- No storks,

189
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,794
but these people will want
to see a baby.

190
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,748
No storks, no present opening,
no cutesy stuff. We agreed.

191
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,070
What about a marzipan baby carriage?

192
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,596
It has a chocolate baby inside.
You can eat the baby.

193
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,039
The next day, Samantha made
a conference call of her own.

194
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,359
Will Mr Wright be joining you
for lunch?

195
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,195
No. It's Richard's birthday
this weekend.

196
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,954
I'm organising a celebration for him.

197
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,112
Would you like to reserve
one of our banquet rooms?

198
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,192
That won't be necessary.
It's a small party.

199
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,477
A very small private party
of three.

200
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,953
Just Richard, myself and a third.

201
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,875
- If you have any openings.
- I'm wide open.

202
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,917
Lucky me.

203
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,038
Now that Charlotte's house
was ready for the shower,

204
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,510
she wanted to make sure
Miranda's was ready for the baby.

205
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,629
The bassinet can go by the bed,
so he's right there for feedings.

206
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,234
Unless you have him
in bed with you.

207
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,233
Can't I go to jail for that?

208
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,870
Many cultures believe it's safer
for the baby's breathing,

209
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,716
although you risk rolling over
and smooshing him in your sleep,

210
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,996
but that almost never happens...

211
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,948
- I'll just put him in the thing.
- The bassinet? Great!

212
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,434
When he's big enough,
you can put the crib here.

213
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,388
- Is that what you were thinking?
- I hadn't thought about it.

214
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,518
You need to start thinking
about these things

215
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,992
before the baby gets here.
What kind of mother do you want to be?

216
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,993
I plan to be a good mother.

217
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,311
A marsupial mom or a stroller mom?

218
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,756
Will you be breast-feeding
or bottle-feeding?

219
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,119
And with all the sharp edges around here,
this place is a death trap.

220
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,159
- You need to back off.
- I'm just trying to help.

221
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,356
Pointing out the things I do badly?

222
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,511
- I'm not...
- Yes, you are.

223
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,276
You need to try to let
other people in a little.

224
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,560
Once you have that baby, you're not
going to be able to control everything.

225
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,713
I just want to enjoy the fried chicken
and be done with it.

226
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,838
I had to rethink the fried chicken.

227
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,879
You were the only one who wanted it.
We're having masculine greens

228
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,715
and a lovely puttanesca
with a Fiji Mum centrepiece.

229
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,110
A Fiji Mum stork centrepiece?

230
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,397
- You can deal with one stork!
- Two storks!

231
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,836
- There's a stork on the invitation.
- That is a duck.

232
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,515
It's smoking a boy cigar.
The duck's not for children.

233
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,194
The duck is fucked.
This shower is fucked!

234
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,239
- You can't have one without baby stuff!
- Or a shower without a mommy!

235
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,277
- Fine!
- Fine!

236
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,478
You'd better show up. I'm not
getting stuck with a bunch of lawyers

237
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,155
who don't appreciate
a beautiful puttanesca!

238
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,312
Watch out for the sharp edges!

239
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,030
Thanks for coming down.

240
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,909
I didn't have a choice.
You couldn't make it up the stairs.

241
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,071
There. Do you feel better?

242
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,791
The back, yes. The other stuff, no.
I'm going to be a terrible mother.

243
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,954
I am! I have no maternal instincts.
I yelled at Charlotte.

244
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,954
She was just pointing out
what needed to be child-proofed.

245
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,712
Oh, my God!

246
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,916
I need to be child-proofed.

247
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,790
You want to quit? I'll quit the magazine,
you quit the baby.

248
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,032
Two quitters.
We'll live happily ever after.

249
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,510
- Can I tell you a secret?
- You're not really pregnant?

250
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,114
I dropped my niece on her head.

251
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,159
I was baby-sitting when I was 13
and I got bored.

252
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,471
I was doing my homework,
she slid down the couch.

253
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,916
- Two stitches.
- Get off my stoop!

254
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,554
How is this kid ever going to make it?

255
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,395
A Type-A mother who works 50 hours
a week, no father figure.

256
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,835
- He has a father figure.
- Steve.

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,036
I meant you.

258
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,510
Really? I do like those Yankees!

259
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,555
- Second date. Dinner and a movie.
- I hate them.

260
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,759
Do you think it can be as simple as:
"my father walked out,

261
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,753
"therefore I'll always be messed up
about men"?

262
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,275
My father came home every night.

263
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,876
- I have no clue about men, either.
- So it's a crap shoot.

264
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,395
Do I have to go
to my own baby shower?

265
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,711
I RSVPed to a duck with a cigar.

266
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,552
You're going.

267
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,269
- I've got to catch a cab.
- Let me get you a forklift.

268
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,115
Are you ready?

269
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,872
Go.

270
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,669
- Good girl. Goody girl.
- You too.

271
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,870
The next day, Miranda decided
not to dock her own shower.

272
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,429
You showed up!

273
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,115
Bring on the ladies in hats
and let's get this over with.

274
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,955
- Where are all the storks?
- You said you didn't want any.

275
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,917
I know, but...

276
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,957
- What did you do?
- It's your shower.

277
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,319
Can you get that? I have to get
the sandwiches, which have crusts.

278
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,597
Nothing cute.
No ridiculous baby stuff allowed.

279
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,748
Aren't you supposed to be
on a lily pad, being worshipped?

280
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,512
What is that?

281
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,639
It's a four-tiered baby cake
made entirely of diapers.

282
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,633
- We ordered it online.
- What do I do with it?

283
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,155
- Didn't you want one?
- No.

284
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,995
We're not taking it back.
We've been seen carrying it.

285
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,116
Definitely not "Vogue".

286
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,512
- Charlotte said it was the perfect gift.
- We should have got a massage.

287
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,870
One hour, two platters of chicken
and 13 lawyers later,

288
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,873
all talk had turned to babies.
Almost all.

289
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,113
I have 21 years of experience.
I could fuck her under the table.

290
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,477
In a three-way situation,
it could come to that.

291
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,553
- I have tricks she's never seen.
- And those tricks aren't for kids.

292
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,713
- She's just renting him. I own.
- Exactly.

293
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,555
- Although I don't really own.
- It's an illegal sublet thing?

294
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,314
It's a breast pump.

295
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,392
I didn't want you borrowing mine.

296
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,428
I have to pee.

297
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,599
Here. You take Charles.
Have fun, Mom!

298
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,073
Keep it coming, ladies.
Keep the presents coming.

299
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,757
- Yeah?
- Nothing.

300
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,358
Something tells me
this one's Tiffany.

301
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,192
That's from me.

302
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,070
That is elegant.

303
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,518
That's exactly like the rattle
Trey gave me when we first...

304
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,637
- You OK?
- I'm fine. I'm sorry, everybody.

305
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,197
Excuse me.

306
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,550
What did I do?

307
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,076
I need to be alone right now.

308
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,512
Except you've got 20 people
in the other room.

309
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,471
- I'm sorry I ruined your shower.
- You didn't.

310
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,394
There wouldn't be a shower to ruin
if it weren't for you.

311
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,512
I know this is hard.

312
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,912
I really appreciate you trying to be OK
with me having this baby

313
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,200
because I need you.

314
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,035
Let's face it.
You're the only person in my life...

315
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,959
...who knows how important it is
to have a cake made of diapers.

316
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,311
There's lotion in there too.

317
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,637
And baby bottles.

318
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,713
- And a receiving blanket.
- See?

319
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,791
- I would never have known that.
- You would have figured it out.

320
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,478
Just like that, Miranda realised she
might be a good mother figure as well.

321
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,949
Somebody better check on Mommy
because little Fitz has wet himself.

322
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,759
And myself, I might add.

323
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,798
I happen to have four tiers
of diapers.

324
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,592
Can we cut the cake?
I have a three-way to go to.

325
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,718
That's my earring.

326
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,075
That night at the three-way,

327
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,708
Samantha made sure
it happened her way.

328
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,236
Just so we're clear,
tonight is about sex,

329
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,393
not love. There will be
no kissing on the mouth.

330
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,677
Richard's lips are off-limits
to anyone but me.

331
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,115
What if he kisses me?

332
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,352
- Who's up for champagne?
- I'm up for anything.

333
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,995
Easy, Sam. There's more
than enough of me to go around.

334
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,559
Tell her, Daddy.

335
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,952
The one thing Richard didn't want
for his birthday was to feel older.

336
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,395
- Get rid of her.
- I'm on it.

337
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,872
It was time for the fledgling
to leave the love nest.

338
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,068
Anything else you want
for your birthday?

339
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,028
No, this is great.
Just you and me.

340
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,796
What about my three-way?

341
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,997
I have a bus boy arriving
at midnight.

342
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,598
Seriously, let's try this.

343
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,070
Just you and me, nobody else.

344
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,351
OK.

345
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,954
By giving Richard what he wanted,

346
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,432
Samantha finally got
what she needed: monogamy.

347
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,229
The following night,
with help from my favourite editor,

348
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,676
I finished the impossible:
my first "Vogue" piece.

349
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,595
Now my favourite part
of the writing process: print.

350
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,639
Congratulations, Cookie.
500 beautifully written words,

351
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,793
some even include the Carrie
Bradshaw agenda, cleverly hidden.

352
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,633
It's a literary "Where's Waldo?"

353
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,509
When I finish a piece,
I open a bottle of Château La Tour.

354
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,389
- How do you celebrate?
- By buying shoes and purses.

355
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,076
In that case, have you ever heard
of the "Vogue" accessories closet?

356
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,595
Oh, my God!

357
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,116
It's too good!
I'm sorry, but it's...

358
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,831
It's too good!

359
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,275
Like a kid in a couture candy store.

360
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,479
This is too much!
How can this be?

361
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,235
Designers send us things
and we photograph them.

362
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,273
Oh, my God!
Do you know what these are?

363
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,831
- We're not supposed to be in here.
- Manolo Blahnik Mary Janes!

364
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,833
I thought these were an urban shoe myth.

365
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,549
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be pillaging the men's side.

366
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,589
Oh, my God!
These are authentic patent leather.

367
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,799
If they don't fit, so help me,
I'm going to wear them anyway.

368
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,276
They almost fit.

369
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,398
Tell me what you think
about these Versaces.

370
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,153
- What do you think?
- What are you doing?

371
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,359
- I'm just showing you these briefs.
- Well, don't.

372
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,638
- Julian, pull your pants up.
- Look at you in those Mary Janes!

373
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,472
Stop!

374
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,234
What happened to your wife,
the dancer?

375
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,631
She's having an affair
with her chiropractor.

376
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,755
- I find you adorable.
- You could be my father.

377
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,799
- Would your father wear Versaces?
- Pull your pants up!

378
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,157
All right, but as someone
who cares about you,

379
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,915
- you have serious issues with men.
- I do right now, yes!

380
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,959
An older man can help
with those father issues, Cookie.

381
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,112
Don't Cookie me, Freud.
Pants up.

382
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,477
Show some respect.
This is "Vogue"!

383
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,438
It turns out Julian had an agenda
as well.

384
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,273
Cleverly hidden, of course.

385
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,678
From then on, once a month
when I went to "Vogue",

386
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,877
I thought it best
to work exclusively with Enid.

387
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,952
This shows improvement,
but still reeks of you.

388
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,157
This magazine doesn't care
what you say about shoes.

389
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,470
What do you know about shoes?

390
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,949
Enid, with all due respect,

391
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,193
men I may not know,
but shoes...

392
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,271
...shoes, I know.

393
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,508
- I'm walking.
- I'm walking, too.

394
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,513
It's tempting to wish
for the perfect boss,

395
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,274
the perfect parent
or the perfect outfit,

396
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,557
but maybe the best we can do
is not quit,

397
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,157
play the hand we've been given
and accessorise the outfit we've got.
