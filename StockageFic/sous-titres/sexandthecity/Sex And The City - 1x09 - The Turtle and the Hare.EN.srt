1
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:49,598
In a city of perf ect people...

2
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:53,076
no one was more perf ect than Brooke.

3
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:59,446
She was an interior designer
who only dated A-list guys.

4
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,046
For Brooke, every Saturday night
was like the senior prom.

5
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:09,854
So, when she got married...

6
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:13,228
we were all dying to see
which one had made the cut.

7
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:18,403
Was I the only one who remembered
that Brooke once described this man...

8
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:21,338
as more boring than exposed brick?

9
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:31,149
It was your average $100,000 wedding.

10
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:37,145
Investment bankers
and the women who hate them...

11
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:42,225
classmates from Steiner,
Dalton and Brown...

12
00:01:42,294 --> 00:01:43,761
and us.

13
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,230
We looked like
The Witches of Eastwick.

14
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:02,937
A wedding this size always
has two singles tables.

15
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,850
We were at the other one.

16
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:11,214
Hello.

17
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:17,184
Hi. I'm Bernie Turtletaub,
friend of the groom.

18
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:22,293
It was the Turtle.
A Manhattan legend known f or two things:

19
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:24,734
good investments and bad breath.

20
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:26,772
My f eet are killing me.

21
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,865
- Sit down.
- I can't. This outfit works if I stand.

22
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:34,271
I think it works either way.

23
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:37,440
You know, I think
I'm at that table over there.

24
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:44,254
Your friend is gorgeous.

25
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:47,315
What do I have to do
to get to know her better?

26
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,034
Do you think the pears
in this tart are bosc or bartlett?

27
00:02:58,103 --> 00:02:59,798
Who cares?

28
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:03,035
Two hours later, we were bored.

29
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:05,076
Supplies were dwindling...

30
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:08,011
and one of our passengers
had jumped ship.

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,140
Are we gonna stick around
and catch the bouquet?

32
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:13,811
That is so not going to happen.

33
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:16,377
Bosc! They've got to be bosc.

34
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:24,329
Can you believe I finally did it?

35
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,693
You're next.
Bill's got some great single friends.

36
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:39,736
It's always better to marry someone
who loves you more than you love them.

37
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:48,944
People are always telling me things
I don't want to hear.

38
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,650
But this one crossed the line.

39
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:54,716
Did I wake you?

40
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:57,125
- Not at all.
- Question.

41
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,562
Why do people get married
if they're not in love?

42
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,998
I don't know.

43
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:06,595
Companionship, guilt,
political asylum?

44
00:04:06,672 --> 00:04:10,130
- Why did you get married?
- I was a f ool in love.

45
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,007
That is so sweet.

46
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:16,275
-And then I was a f ool in divorce court.
-Now you're just a f ool.

47
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:21,308
Exactly. Which is why I'm never
getting married again.

48
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:24,254
Suddenly, I had to concentrate
on breathing.

49
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:29,119
- Are you in bed with someone?
- No. Are you?

50
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:32,561
Just three slices of wedding cake.
You jealous?

51
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:35,998
That depends. What are your plans
f or the frosting?

52
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,662
- Good night.
- Good night.

53
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,666
I hung up the phone wondering...

54
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,074
could I date a man
who would never get married?

55
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:52,208
Wow! A guy who doesn't want
to get married! Film at 11:00!

56
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:54,411
Don't tell me
you're surprised by this.

57
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:57,353
You know who wants to get married?
Men who miss their mommies.

58
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:00,620
Maybe this wasn't my target audience.

59
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,627
Am I the only one who thinks
this is a major bummer?

60
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:05,892
What if you spend five years with him
and in the end you have nothing?

61
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:09,696
I wasn't thinking about it until he said
I couldn't. Now it's all I think about.

62
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,066
Just be cool. You don't care.

63
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,230
Then he'll wonder why you don't...

64
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:18,037
which will make him realize he does,
and then it's a whole new ball game.

65
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,704
So in your world,
it's always sixth grade.

66
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:26,274
A relationship has to be based
on honesty and communication to succeed.

67
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:29,185
Okay. If you were 25,
that would be adorable...

68
00:05:29,254 --> 00:05:32,348
but you're 32 now,
so that's just stupid.

69
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:34,449
- I can't just ignore it, can l?
- Yes. No!

70
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:38,053
What's the big deal? ln 50 years,
men are gonna be obsolete anyway.

71
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,827
Already you can't talk to them,
you don't need them to have kids with...

72
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,130
you don't even need them
to have sex with anymore...

73
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:46,637
as I've just
very pleasantly discovered.

74
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:49,606
Uh-oh. Sounds like somebody just got
their first vibrator.

75
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:53,270
Not first. Ultimate.
And I think I'm in love.

76
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:56,872
Oh, please, stop!
This is so sad.

77
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,350
I'm not gonna replace a man
with some battery-operated device.

78
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,546
You say that, but you haven't met
"The Rabbit."

79
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:05,454
If you're gonna get a vibrator,
at least get one called "The Horse."

80
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:10,484
A vibrator does not call you on your
birthday, send flowers the next day...

81
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:13,793
and you cannot take a vibrator home
to meet your mother.

82
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:18,769
I know where my next orgasm is
coming from. Who here can say as much?

83
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:27,810
That night, Samantha went on a date
with a flesh and blood man...

84
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,815
while the three of us went in search
of furrier companionship.

85
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:35,286
Ladies, I'd like you to meet the Rabbit.

86
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,186
$92?

87
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:40,555
Please! Think about the money
we spend on shoes.

88
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:44,118
I have no intention of using that.
I'm saving sex f or someone I love.

89
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,426
Fantastic.
Is there a man in the picture?

90
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:51,264
Look! Oh, it's so cute.

91
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:54,794
I thought it would be all scary
and weird, but it isn't. It's pink!

92
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,273
For girls!

93
00:06:57,342 --> 00:07:01,676
Look. The little bunny has
a little f ace like Peter Rabbit.

94
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:04,511
It's even got a remote.
How lazy do you have to be?

95
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:09,015
Later that night,
back at the brier patch--

96
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,352
Hello?

97
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:21,661
You are not going to believe
the evening I've had.

98
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,203
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

99
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:31,336
Jerry, who Samantha met
at Brooke's wedding...

100
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,346
took her to Lava,
New York's restaurant du jour.

101
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:45,314
From the moment I saw you at
that wedding, I knew we'd have dinner.

102
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,257
Aren't you cocky!

103
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:51,023
I'm the kind of guy,
I see something...

104
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,361
I like it, I go after it.

105
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,061
You sound like my kind of guy.

106
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,231
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

107
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:12,909
Ten minutes and a couple
of cocktails later--

108
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,114
Where the hell is he?

109
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:34,269
He obviously had seen something else
he liked and gone after it.

110
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,511
Then, just when she thought
her evening couldn't get any worse--

111
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,883
Samantha?
Hey, Samantha!

112
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:50,615
It's me.

113
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,219
Bernie Turtletaub from the wedding.

114
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:56,660
Oh, right.

115
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:58,719
Are you here all by yourself?

116
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:01,732
Sort of. I'm--

117
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,563
Sit down, join me!

118
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:09,140
You look great.

119
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:14,111
What Samantha needed now more than
anything was a compliment from anyone.

120
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:23,212
I can't believe the synchronicity.
I was just thinking about you!

121
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:29,122
So, do you like this shirt?

122
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,459
My ex-girlfriend
picked it out f or me.

123
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:37,434
Honey, no off ense,
but your breath--

124
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:39,129
I know.

125
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:43,368
It's these Chinese herbs I'm taking.
You know, f or longer lif e.

126
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:48,436
With breath like that, you're gonna live
a very long lif e alone.

127
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,612
I killed the last woman
who talked to me like that.

128
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,788
Samantha was impressed.
The Turtle had attempted a joke.

129
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:09,732
Once we get the breath under control,
we're shopping f or a new wardrobe.

130
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:11,735
He's a cute little fixer-upper.

131
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:14,363
Sweetheart, he's a man,
not a brownstone.

132
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:18,273
When I'm through with him,
he'll be Gracie Mansion.

133
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:21,778
Samantha and the Turtle?

134
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:24,748
But then again, I'm dating a man
who will never get married...

135
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:30,118
and Miranda is having a meaningful
relationship with something from a box.

136
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:36,289
In a city of great expectations, is it
time to settle f or what you can get?

137
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:38,295
I needed some answers.

138
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:40,297
Later that week, I met Brooke.

139
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:44,563
Just back from her honeymoon, she was
all business: the business of marriage.

140
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:47,264
I'd like to return these.

141
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,002
Can you melt them down
into one decent gift?

142
00:10:51,076 --> 00:10:52,668
His friends.

143
00:10:52,744 --> 00:10:56,043
So, how is it being married?

144
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,049
It's f abulous. I f eel like
an enormous weight has been lifted.

145
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,678
- And that's a good thing.
- What's that supposed to mean?

146
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:07,851
It just means you're happy
with Allen, right?

147
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:09,518
Yes, I'm happy.

148
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:12,256
Then I'm happy f or you.

149
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:17,634
Listen, I hope I didn't give you
the wrong idea.

150
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:20,570
I think Allen's great.

151
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,664
He's incredibly successful.

152
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:26,837
We think we're Carolyn Bessette. One day
John-John's out of the picture...

153
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:29,938
and we're happy just to have some guy
who can throw around a frisbee.

154
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:34,247
- Look who's here. Hey, you two!
- What a small world!

155
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,446
I couldn't believe it.

156
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:39,217
It was the Turtle
wearing Helmut Lange.

157
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,954
- Wow, he looks great!
- Doesn't he?

158
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:45,324
He twirls!

159
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:46,864
- What do you think?
- Fabulous.

160
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:49,992
He's like a whole new person.

161
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:52,229
Don't I have a 3:00?

162
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:54,772
That's right. I'm taking him
to Bliss f or a f acial.

163
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,707
See you later. Bye.

164
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:00,904
I have to run, too.
I'll call you.

165
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:02,571
Smart girl.

166
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:05,207
She seems happy.

167
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:09,185
Samantha left with the Turtle,
Brooke left with a better gift...

168
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:12,621
and I left wondering if everyone
in Manhattan was settling.

169
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:18,459
My Zen teacher told me that there was
nothing like yoga to quiet a busy mind.

170
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,794
Just as I had reached the moment
of no thought--

171
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:24,097
- I think I broke my vagina.
- Sorry. Am I pulling too hard?

172
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:26,831
Metaphorically, I mean.
With the Rabbit.

173
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:29,237
- So you've been using it!
- Yes.

174
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:32,970
I'm scared if I keep using it, I won't
be able to enjoy sex with a man again.

175
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,477
Why?

176
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:37,344
Have you ever been with a man...

177
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,249
and he's doing everything
and it f eels good...

178
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:43,310
but somehow you just can't manage to--

179
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,480
Come?

180
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,046
Yeah.

181
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:50,151
Well, it's weird, 'cause with
the Rabbit it's like every time, boom!

182
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:54,164
And one time,
I came f or like five minutes.

183
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,859
It's not illegal.

184
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:59,097
Yeah, but no man ever did that.
I'm scared. What am I gonna do?

185
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:03,039
You could still enjoy sex with a man
and the Rabbit.

186
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:05,736
No, no.
I'm done with it.

187
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:08,211
That's it. I'm never going
to touch that thing again.

188
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:16,249
- I got to cancel on the ballet tonight.
- Why?

189
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:22,284
I'm expecting a phone call...

190
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,294
Iong distance phone call,
transatlantic.

191
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:26,694
Charlotte could never tell
a decent lie.

192
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,995
I knew an addict when I saw one.

193
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:33,970
I love Sleeping Beauty!
The music, the sex, the costumes!

194
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,529
It's so romantic!

195
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:39,236
You like it because she gets to sleep
f or 100 years, and doesn't age.

196
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:43,008
I invited Stanf ord to the ballet.
I knew he was available.

197
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:45,311
Stanf ord, cute, huh?

198
00:13:46,885 --> 00:13:49,820
I've had it
with the whole gay scene.

199
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:53,255
It's so competitive. You won't believe
what happened to me last week.

200
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:57,091
Evidently Stanf ord,
tired of bars and blind dates...

201
00:13:57,162 --> 00:13:59,562
decided to place a personal ad.

202
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:06,260
He scheduled a rendezvous with the only
respondent on a cold, Sunday afternoon.

203
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:12,375
Twenty minutes and three f alse alarms
later, he was ready to call it quits.

204
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,634
Stanf ord?

205
00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:16,976
Yes.

206
00:14:18,116 --> 00:14:20,949
Sorry. This is not gonna happen.

207
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,215
It's so brutal out there.

208
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,988
Even guys like me
don't want guys like me.

209
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:32,256
I just don't have that gay look.

210
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,493
I don't know.
You look pretty gay to me.

211
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,762
Come on, maybe it's just a phase.

212
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:42,330
Puberty is a phase. Fifteen years
of rejection is a lif estyle.

213
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:47,344
Sometimes I think I should just marry
a woman and get all the money.

214
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,505
- What is there, a cash prize?
- Yeah.

215
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:54,484
My grandmother gives everyone
their inheritance when they get married.

216
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:57,386
- She doesn't know you're gay?
- She doesn't believe in gay.

217
00:14:57,455 --> 00:15:00,049
Really? That's funny.
Big doesn't believe in marriage.

218
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,322
Maybe you should propose to me,
and we'll all live happily ever after.

219
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:07,593
-You really do want it all.
-I don't know. Maybe nobody gets it all.

220
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,965
Though, you do have a point.

221
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:14,665
We're best friends.
We make each other laugh.

222
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,673
We both sleep with men.

223
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:19,642
This is not a bad idea at all.

224
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,771
- Actually, I was kidding.
- I'm not! Think about it.

225
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:27,910
Who else would keep you in expensive
shoes and encourage you to cheat?

226
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:29,749
Now you're talking!

227
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:34,520
Friday night with a man who shared
my passion f or hot men in tights.

228
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:39,394
Saturday afternoon in bed with a man
who shared my passion f or passion.

229
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:42,092
Maybe there was such a thing
as having it all.

230
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,636
What's that smile about?

231
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:50,607
Oh, I got a marriage proposal
last night.

232
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,943
Really?

233
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:56,876
From whom?

234
00:15:56,948 --> 00:16:01,248
A very handsome, witty young man
about to come into his inheritance.

235
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,847
Oh, I see.
Anyone I know?

236
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:09,360
Actually his name is Stanf ord.
Stanf ord Blatch.

237
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,387
I thought he was gay.

238
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:14,898
He is.

239
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,533
That should make
f or an interesting column.

240
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,940
What are you gonna do
about sex?

241
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:27,979
I have you.

242
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:38,318
I guess you've got it all
figured out...

243
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,358
Mrs. Blatch.

244
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:45,226
The more he mocked me, the more I became
convinced that this idea was genius.

245
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:51,730
That night, Miranda and I had plans
to join Charlotte...

246
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,795
f or a gallery opening
in Chelsea when--

247
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:01,668
- Hello?
- Carrie, it's Charlotte.

248
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:04,909
I'm really sorry,
but I'm going to have to cancel.

249
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,076
I'm totally wiped out.

250
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:09,819
Wiped out!

251
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:14,291
That was Charlotte speak f or "I'm
spending the night with my vibrator."

252
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,384
But you guys have fun, though.

253
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,452
There was only one thing to do.

254
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,090
A rabbit intervention.

255
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,134
Come on, let's go!

256
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:25,829
- Okay, where is it?
- What are you talking about?

257
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:28,395
The Rabbit.
Give us the Rabbit.

258
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:32,466
Hey, it's a vibrator.
It's not like it's crack.

259
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:41,278
You hid the Rabbit behind
a stuff ed rabbit? That is so you.

260
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,718
You have a lot of nerve coming in here.
You're the one who made me get it.

261
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:45,813
I thought you could handle it.

262
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,452
No big deal. I'd rather stay home with
the Rabbit than go out, deal with men.

263
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:57,364
All right. You're right.
I'll go get dressed.

264
00:17:57,435 --> 00:18:00,370
With a little help from her friends,
Charlotte decided...

265
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:04,033
that she wasn't
going to settle f or herself.

266
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:07,510
While Samantha was doing everything
in her power to remake the Turtle...

267
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:10,844
into a man she could f all
in love with.

268
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:13,679
- How's your dinner?
- It's questionable.

269
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:18,212
I can't figure out whether
the mushrooms are shitake or chantrelle.

270
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:20,689
They're definitely not porcini.

271
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,821
Maybe they're wood ear.

272
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:28,265
Maybe it doesn't matter.

273
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:32,163
My God!
They're trompettes!

274
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:36,833
It was then that Samantha realized
that even with all her eff ort...

275
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,900
he was still just
the Turtle in black.

276
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:42,742
You know, I'm not f eeling very well.

277
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:45,874
I think I'm going
to have to send myself home.

278
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,588
I'll call you.

279
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:59,959
Excuse me.
Do you like this shirt?

280
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:04,365
My ex-girlfriend picked it out.

281
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,427
After 12 phone calls
and three e-mails...

282
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:10,872
Stanf ord badgered me into at least
meeting his grandmother.

283
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,001
I love that suit you're wearing.

284
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:16,069
Designed by Coco Chanel herself.

285
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:19,378
- Seriously?
- Grandmother's worn that f or 40 years.

286
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,476
And it still fits.

287
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:24,715
- It never goes out of style.
- Never.

288
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,553
I have it in blue, black, pink.

289
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,887
And eggshell!

290
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,951
Exactly.

291
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:33,930
Stanf ord tells me
you're a writer.

292
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,932
Yes, I have a column in The Star.

293
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,231
I was a career woman
many, many years ago.

294
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,932
But I gave it up
to have children.

295
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:47,469
Oh, wow! ls this you?

296
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:49,706
Not a bad-looking girl.
Don't you think?

297
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:55,275
Doesn't she look exactly like
Deborah Kerr in An Aff air to Remember?

298
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:56,547
She does.

299
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:01,381
Oh, my God!
This has to be Stanf ord.

300
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:03,427
- You're the same person.
- That's enough.

301
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:07,794
Come on. This is fun. I had no idea
you had such a big f amily.

302
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:10,630
How about you, honey?
Do you want a f amily?

303
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:15,571
As I looked around at all the
memorabilia and f amily photographs...

304
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,474
the f aces of brides and grooms,
children and grandchildren...

305
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:21,739
I realized--

306
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:23,474
Yes, I do.

307
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:28,349
Stanny, be a dear. Go in the kitchen
and get me some matches.

308
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:30,216
Of course.

309
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:38,058
I love my Stanf ord.
He's a very sweet boy.

310
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:40,461
But you know, he is a fruit.

311
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:45,868
I realized then that the only
inheritance Stanf ord was going to get...

312
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:48,804
was her collection of Chanel suits.

313
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:54,107
Salt. Yeah.

314
00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:58,171
That night at dinner, I knew I would
have to break the news to Mr. Big.

315
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,382
What do you think?

316
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,393
I do want to get married someday.

317
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:12,452
Maybe not today.

318
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,693
But I can't date somebody that won't.
What's the point?

319
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:19,769
Definitely too much salt.

320
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:27,167
I mean, it's all in the timing.
You gotta brown the garlic...

321
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:31,807
bef ore you put in the onions,
know what I mean?

322
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:36,077
I thought we were having fun.

323
00:21:48,032 --> 00:21:51,195
It's bitter, but it definitely
has possibilities.

324
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:56,569
You have a little bit
of sauce on the lip...

325
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:58,666
right there.

326
00:21:58,743 --> 00:22:03,009
My Zen teacher also said
the only way to true happiness...

327
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:06,312
is to live in the moment
and not worry about the future.

328
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:10,783
Of course,
he died penniless and single.
