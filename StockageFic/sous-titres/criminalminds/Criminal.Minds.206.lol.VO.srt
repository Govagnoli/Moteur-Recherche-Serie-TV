181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,200
Children shouldn't
have to worry

182
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,400
about something like that.

183
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,700
Tell me about it.

184
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,100
The woods were
the only thing
i was afraid of

185
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,200
when i was a kid.

186
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,600
Seriously?

187
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Thought you grew up
in a small town.

188
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,900
Yeah, surrounded
by woods.

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,600
Bummer for you.

190
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,800
Yeah.

191
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
Only thing i was
afraid of was the dark.

192
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,700
Some of us still are.

193
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,200
When we land,

194
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,300
morgan and reid go
to the new crime scene.

195
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,600
The little girl.

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,500
I'll look at the scene
where nicholas faye was found.

197
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,200
This is where
he dumped the body.

198
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
This isn't
a dump site.

199
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,900
Murder happened
right here.

200
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,300
Autopsy report indicates
no signs of a struggle.

201
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Poor little guy,
never had a chance.

202
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
So far
into these woods,

203
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,900
no one
could hear him scream.

204
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,500
Exactly how his killer
wanted it.

205
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
The last 2 months,

206
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,400
we've lost more children
in this town

207
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,900
than we have
in my whole lifetime.

208
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
The others
were car accidents.

209
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
The residents
are terrified.

210
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Got an 8-year-old
myself.

211
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,900
Victims
knew their killer.

212
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,600
They followed
him to this spot.

213
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,100
What makes you
think that?

214
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,900
The kids went this deep
in the woods

215
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
because
they trusted him.

216
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,700
He stashed his weapon
here beforehand,

217
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,400
which means we're
looking for someone
intelligent, methodical.

218
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,200
Methodical?

219
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
Bashed the kid's
head in,

220
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,700
looks like a moment
of rage to me.

221
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,100
I agree.

222
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,000
That's what's confusing.

223
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,800
Doesn't make sense.

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,100
This is just
a quarter mile

225
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,700
from where the 2 boys
were killed.

226
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,100
Bludgeoned to death
the same way.

227
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,400
Not entirely true.

228
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,100
I found some markings
on her scalp

229
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,400
that indicated
that that psycho

230
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,400
beat her post-mortem.

231
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,200
Suggests the unsub
is getting more brazen.

232
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,900
He's getting brazen,
all right.

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,700
I've bagged 3 children
in the last month.

234
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,400
Now he's spending
more time with the victims

235
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,900
even after death.

236
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,600
He had to know he wasn't
gonna be interrupted,
but how?

237
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,000
How could he
be so sure?

238
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,000
The forest goes
for miles and miles,

239
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,400
but nobody goes
walkin' in it

240
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,500
unless they're
lookin' to kill.

241
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,800
Or hunt.

242
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
In which case,
you don't want to be

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,500
on the trail.

244
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Reid, whoever killed
these children

245
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
is very familiar
with this area.

246
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,100
In my opinion,
he probably lived
in ozona his whole life.

247
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,600
It could be someone
you know,

248
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,400
or it could be a stranger
you pass at the grocery store.

249
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
It's vital that we keep
our eyes open

250
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
and our children close.

251
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,200
Now, as ozona's
guidance counselor,

252
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
i can only help
your children
with the aftermath,

253
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,100
but our police department

254
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,400
is working
with the fbi,

255
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,700
gathering information
on the case.

256
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,300
To elaborate on that,
agent jason gideon.

257
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,500
We want you to know

258
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,800
we're doing
everything we can

259
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,100
to find the person
responsible.

260
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,600
Until we do, there are
a number of precautions

261
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,800
that you'll need to take,

262
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
so let me go over
some of them with you.

263
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,700
First and foremost...

264
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,100
it's something we call
the buddy system.

265
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
That means you always
go everywhere with a friend.

266
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,600
That's right
because bad men
and women

267
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,900
are more likely
to talk to us

268
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,500
only when we're
by ourselves.

269
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,500
Jj: We don't know what
these guys look like yet.

270
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,700
Might be someone you know.

271
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,200
Yes, sweetheart,
you got a question?

272
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,100
There was this little girl
once on the news,

273
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,100
who just got grabbed

274
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,500
right in front
of her house.

275
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,600
Could that happen
to us?

276
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,300
Nothing's gonna happen
to any of you

277
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,900
as long as you remember
this buddy system, ok?

278
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,300
Any more questions?

279
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,300
Did you ever
find his hat?

280
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,300
Gideon:
Excuse me?

281
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,100
This is
nicholas faye's mother.

282
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,000
The red one
that i put on him?

283
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,700
He had it on
when he left.

284
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,700
I'm sorry, mrs. Faye.
We haven't.

285
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,100
Mandatory curfew at 5 p.m.

286
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,700
Just make sure you know
where your children are.

287
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,800
You just gotta
move fast.

288
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,200
Old man finnegan
can't eat you

289
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
if he can't
catch you.

290
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,500
I want to go home.

291
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Come on.
Just ring the guy's bell.

292
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,100
Why don't you?

293
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,400
I already did
when i was, like, 5.

[Loud thuds]

295
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,700
Oh, no, it was
just the wind.

296
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,700
Now, come on.
It'll be fun.

297
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,500
Not if he catches me.

298
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,400
Come on, it'll be easy.
Just ring and run.

299
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,100
We'll be right here.

300
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,400
Yeah. Now go.

301
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,500
Go.

302
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,400
Go, go.

303
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,600
Go.

Hotchner.

309
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,500
Hey, hotch,
what's up?

310
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,100
I went to her apartment
to talk to her,

311
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
but she was leaving
with an overnight bag.

312
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,300
So she's running.

313
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,100
I don't know.
I hope not.

314
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
I'm following her.

315
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,600
All right,
keep me posted.

316
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,700
Just wait for me up front.

317
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,700
No wandering.

318
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,900
Ok, dad.

319
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,700
It's too scary to let 'em
out of your sight.

320
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,700
I know.

321
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,500
Can i have
your attention, please?

322
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Good afternoon.

323
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,900
I want to make
something clear.

324
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,800
Due to the velocity
of change,

325
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,600
we predict
this offender

326
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,000
could try to strike
again anytime.

327
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,400
His confidence builds
with every attack.

328
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,100
Look for someone
physically fit,

329
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,400
shy, kind disposition,

330
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,400
someone you may trust
with your own child.

331
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,800
Because the killer
targets kids,

332
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,700
he may be small
himself.

333
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,500
And though we keep
referring to
this unsub as "he,"

334
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
do not rule out
a woman.

Excuse me.

last seen?

after school.

at the school zone.

345
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,800
If the boy was abducted,

346
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,600
then this area would be
the most secluded nearby.

can put his guys
at the gas station...

is matthew?

at that age.

over here?

awful upset

about nothin'.

You look like
you have a secret.

359
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,600
Secret's important.

360
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
Is it
about your brother?

361
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,700
Honey, is that true?

362
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,500
Are you hidin' somethin'?

363
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,000
You want to protect him,
right?

364
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,100
That's what
a brother's for.

365
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,600
Matty said he was
just gonna ring the doorbell

366

at the haunted house...

367
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,900
on the hill.

368
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Finnegan's place.

369
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,100
Who's finnegan?

370
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,900
This old guy who lives
in that house.

371
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,700
Forever. Kind of
a local legend.

372

Ghost story.

373
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,500
Reid: About?

374
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,600
Supposedly,
he watches the kids
from his window...

375
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,300
hunts 'em,

376
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,400
skins 'em,

377
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,200
eats 'em.

378
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,400
Standard.

379
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Kids have been
tellin' that story

380
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,300
since i was a kid.

381
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,900
Morgan: Why haven't we
heard about this?

382
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,900
Fables are often sparked
by an ounce of truth.

383
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We should exhaust
every possibility.

384
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,100
I'm sorry, dad.

385
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,000
You've been
following me.

386
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,900
What's going on?

387
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,900
Elle, i'm listening.

388
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,500
Ok.

389
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,600
I really wanted to be
a part of the team.

390

You were.

391
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,100
But when i needed
thteam,

392
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
i was all alone.

393
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,800
I was alone
in the one place

394

that i have the right
to feel safe,

395
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,000
and that's my home.

396
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,800
Just like
those women in ohio
who were attacked

397
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,000
had a right to feel safe
in their homes.

398
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Does that justify
taking the law
into your own hands?

399
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,700
What makes you say
that i have?

400
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,100
Because you're here
confessing your sins.

401
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,800
You know i don't have
any evidence,

402
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,200
and you know how quickly
i'd arrest you if i did.

403
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,900
So what are we
gonna do about it?

404
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,300
Sure looks
like a haunted house.

Gideon:
Morgan, you and jones
take the front.

406

the outbuildings.

Ah!

411

Upstairs is clear.

is the missing boy.

I know.

416
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
Maybe he's been away.

417
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,500
No. His paper
was delivered today.

Yeah. Question is,
where is he now?

No.
Are you hurt?

I didn't want
the old man
to find me.

It's all right.
No one's gonna harm you.

house on the hill

431
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,300
is like the bates motel
of ozona, texas.

Yeah, we heard
the legend.

433

Reid, seriously,
people that go into that house

434
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,700
supposedly never come out.

435
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Spooky.

pretend not to enjoy
that rumor so much,

entered the house.

of that
actually happening.

441
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,500
This is true.

were false alarms.

is that matter
of his missing wife.

Wife? What wife?
When did she go missing.

445
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,900
Almost 50 years ago.

Let's go.

Here's a question...

509
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,000
if a tree
falls in the forest,

510
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,900
does it make a sound

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,400
if there's nobody
there to hear it?

512
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,200
What the hell
are you readin' over there?

513
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,100
I was just thinking.

The unsub found

part of the woods,

516

and no one else knew.

517
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,400
So he was able
to use this house,

518
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,800
an no one
was the wiser.

519
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,700
Actually,
i was referring
to finnegan's wife.

520
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,800
What are you
talking about?

521
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,000

522
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,700

almost 50 years ago,

523
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,500
when, in actuality,
she left finnegan
for another man.

524

He writes about it
in his journals,

525
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,800
how he would
look out the window
on a daily basis

to see if she
would come home.

527
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
She never did.

528
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,600
He never recovered.

529
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,100
He ended up turning
into a recluse

misunderstood.

So the unsub
ate everything.

537
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,500
Almost everything.

538
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,000
Unopened bowls
of creamed spinach

539
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
thrown into the trash,
each one wrapped
with duct tape.

540
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,600
One with each tray.

541
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,700
So we're lookin'
for a guy

542
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,900
who really, really
hates spinach.

543
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Who doesn't?

544
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,600
Ritualized, meticulous,
organized.

545
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,800
He would eat
with the same particulars.

546
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,900

Hotch.

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,600
It's about elle,
isn't it?

551
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,900
I don't know.

552
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,800
You know, i talked
to her in ohio.

553
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,600
Reid,
we all talked to her.

554
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,200
No, l... l... i talked
to her before.

555
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,000
I went to her room
one night,

556
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,400
and she was drinking.

557
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,100
She almost died.

558
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
I'd be drinkin', too.

559
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,000
Why the woods, jj?

560
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,100
Hmm?

561
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,600
Your fear.

562
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,200
You said
it was of the woods.

563
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Uh, i used to be
a camp counselor
as a teenager

564
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,800
in the woods
up in vermont,

565
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,400
and the night shift...

566
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,200
tuck the girls in,
turn off the lights,

567
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,500
you know,
the typical drill.

568
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,700
Everything seemed fine,
all the kids were asleep.

569
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,800
You know, nothing seemed
out of the ordinary...

570
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,600
until i noticed
that there was some blood

571
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
on the hallway floor,

572
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,300
so i followed
the blood trail

573
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,200
out to the camp director's
cabin,

574
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,900
walked up to his bed,
and he was just lying there

575
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,300
underneath his covers...

576
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,700
dead.

577
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,700
Someone stabbed him.

578
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,100
I ran out of there
so fast.

579
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,000
Out the door,
down the hall.

580
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,900
I just remember it
being really dark.

581
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,100
Once i got to the door,

582
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,700
there was
another counselor there.

583
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,100
I guess she heard me scream.

584
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,400
They caught the caretaker
on his way to town.

585
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,100
I guess he still
had the knife on him.

586
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,200
Anyway, i guess
that's probably

587
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,600
when i decided
i didn't like the woods.

588
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,900
You're serious.

589
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,300

Come on, i don't know
why i'm afraid of the woods.

I just... i am.

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,400
Why is he still afraid
of the dark?

595
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,300
Yeah, reid, why are you
still afraid of the dark?

596
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,900
Because of the inherent
absence of light.

Oh.

598
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400

Hey, girl, you got
somethin' good for me?

I pulled
two sets of prints
off those food trays.

606
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,500
Two?

607
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,000
One belonging
to a child.

608
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,200
Ok, but which one
of the victims?

609

Why don't you coordinate

610
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,400
with the ozona coroner's
office for a match?

or you could do us
all a favor.

maybe get
a little somethin'
taken off your time.

What do you say?

653
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,500
I never stepped
inside finnegan's house.

the answer

for, james.

we got your fingerprints

inside the house
all over the trays
of food.

658

Of course, you did.

I delivered 'em
every week.

workin' at the food bank

665

Maybe you were tryin'
to dispose of it.

666
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,200
Or were you so proud
of your keepsake,

a nice safe place
to hide it?

been for you, james?

00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,800
is fallin' apart,
isn't it?

Oh, yeah,
you gotta be feelin'

a loss of control,
sense of abandonment,

674
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,800
and i would guess, uh...

00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,000
little impotent maybe.

all that exciting to me.

a little uninspired?

a minuteman, are you?

that was exciting!

come over here
and sit your ass down?

Yeah.
What'd you find out?

The second set of prints

700
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,500
didn't match
any of the victims.

701
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
So there might be
a fourth victim
still out there.

for missing children reports

703

ok, i see.

714
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,800
Thank you.

715
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,900
What is it?

716
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,900
Morgan: James,
i can't help you.

717
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
If you don't talk,
i can't help you.

718
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,700
Jeffrey never arrived
at school today.

719
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,000
His father
said he was sick.

720
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,800
Morgan: Somethin'!

721
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,500
[Cell phone rings]

722
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Yeah?

723
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,600
Yeah, yeah, i got it.

724
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,800
I got it.

725
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,400
What were you doin'?

726
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,900
Workin' your way up
to the victim

727
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,200
you wanted to kill
the most?

728
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,800
Your son?

729
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,900
What'd you do
with him, james?

730
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,200
Are you
really that weak?

731
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,400
You gotta blame
your own kid

732
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,400
for your failed marriage?

733
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Shut up!

734
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,800
No, you talk to me!

735
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,400
'Cause i need
to understand this.

736
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,200
You beat those children,
who trusted you. Why?

737
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,700
So you could regain
your power?

738
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,400
I got a newsflash for you.

739
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,100
You never had any
to begin with.

740
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
That's right.
Keep it comin'.

741
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,600
Keep it comin'.

742
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,900
I am so far
from finished with you,
you son of a bitch.

743
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,100
I will go all night.
You understand me?

744
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,500
You make me sick!

745
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,800
What is that?

746
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,800
It's an epi pen.

747
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,600
Weird.

748
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,500
Whoa.

749
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,100
Think i just
found something.

750
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,100
[Ring]

751
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,400
Yeah.

752
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,700
An epi pen
and a refrigerator

753
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,900
that's filled
with dairy products

754
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,500
that have been sealed
with duct tape.

755
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,500
Gideon: Thank you.

756
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
That's helpful.

757
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
You know
what happens to guys

758
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,000
who mess with kids
on the inside?

759
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,500
Can i have
a word with him?

760
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,800
Yeah.

761
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,100
It's a rough day,
huh?

762
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,900
Coffee?

763
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,200
Yeah, i wouldn't mind.

764
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,800
Milk?

765
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,800
Please.

766
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,500
Say when.

767
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,200
When.

768
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,700
How long
have you known?

769
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,200
Known what?

770
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,900
That your son
is a murderer?

771
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,200
What are you
talkin' about?

772
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,200
You might
have been the one

773
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,700
who brought
the food trays
to finnegan's,

774
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,200
but your son
ate them.

775
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Everything
but the creamed spinach.

776
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,600
Do you want me
to confess?

777
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,800
I mean, is that
what this game is?

778
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,300
'Cause that's fine.

779
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,400
You bring me another pen,

780
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,700
i'll write out
my confession.

781
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,800
And we found
an epi pen in your kitchen.

782
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,300
So what? That proves
that my kid has an allergy.

783
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,400
To milk.

784
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,700
How did you know that?

785
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,500
You just told me.

786
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,000
What's it matter?

787
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Jeffrey's allergy
is dangerous.

788
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,900
So much so, he wrapped
the only dairy product
with duct tape

789
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,400
so he wouldn't
accidentally eat it.

790
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,700
You taught him well
to protect himself.

791
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,700
I found
the baseball cap.

792
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,300
I found it
this morning.

793
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,200
[Crying]

794
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,200
It was
in my son's drawer.

795
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,100
Where is he,
mr. Charles?

796
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,400
Tracy!

797
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,000
Cut it out!

798
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,000
"Cut it out!"

799
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,900
Let's go, simon.

800
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,600
Where are you going?

801
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,000
We're supposed to walk
each other home.

802
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,300
I'm walkin'
to henry's.

803
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,200
But he doesn't live
on our street.

804
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
I'll walk you home.

805
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,400
Hey, jeffrey.

806
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,100
Because you shouldn't
be walking alone.

807
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,800
You know, the whole
buddy system and all.

808
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,200
Yeah. That's
really nice of you.

809
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
Thanks.

810
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,900
Come on.
I know a shortcut.

811
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,900
where is he,
mr. Charles?

812
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,200
I left him at home.

813
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,800
But he's not there.

814
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,700
If he's not there,
i don't know where he is.

815
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,400
An 8-year-old girl,
tracy belle's been
reported missing.

816
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,800
Last seen getting
off her school bus
on fuller road.

817
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,500
Get a team there now.

818
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,500
Let's go.

819
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,900
Mack, get yourself
over to fuller road.

820
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,500
Tracy: How much longer?

821
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,200
You're walking
too slow.

822
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,400
This book bag is heavy.

823
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,300
My legs are tired.

824
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Uh!

825
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,200
Why'd you do that?

826
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,000
Shut up
and keep walking!

827
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,400
I don't feel good.

828
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,800
I told you to shut up
and move!

829
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Aah!

830
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,700
You know,
after his mom left,

831
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,800
jeffrey probably
resented the fact

832
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,200
that his dad spends
more time at work

833
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,000
with other kids
than with his own.

834
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,400
And took out
that rage

835
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,700
on any kid he viewed
as having what he didn't.

836
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,000
So tracy's mom said
the bus would have dropped
her off here after school.

837
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,900
She was supposed to walk
home with a neighbor.

838
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,400
That's most likely
when jeffrey approached,

839
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
but where would he
have taken her?

840
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,200
There's such heavy
patrolling in this town.

841
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,600
How do you manage
to take a little girl+???

842
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,900
Because we taught him.

843
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,400
Nobody's gonna think
anything of two kids
walking together...

844
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,700
the buddy system,
remember?

845
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,800
In the process of
educating the public,

846
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,200
we educated a killer.

847
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,300
When it's off-season
from baseball,

848
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,900
where would
a 12-year-old kid hang out?

849
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,900
The park.

850
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,900
Surrounded by woods.

851
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,100
Let's go.

852
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,300
Tracy!

853
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,200
Let's just go.

854
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,700
I was only playing.

855
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,400
Why do you have to be
such a baby?

856
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,700
Tracy!

857
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,400
Tracy!

858
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,400
It's tracy belle's.

859
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,900
They're in these woods.
Split up.

860
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,400
Aah!

861
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,200
[Tracy screams]

862
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,400
[Shouting]

863
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,800
Aah!

864
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,400
Aah!

865
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,600
Gideon: Hey!

866
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,800
You ok?

867
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,700
[Song begins]

868
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,800
Why'd you hurt
those kids?

869
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,500
Because
i wanted to.

870
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,100
What?

871
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,800
To gideon or hotch
or any of you guys.

872
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
I talked
to elle that night,

873
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,300
and i knew
she wasn't right,

874
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,200
but i should have
told someone.

875
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,600
Reid, listen to me.

876
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,500
Do not do that
to yourself.

877
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,900
You were just trying
to help a friend.

878
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,000
You hear me?

879
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,700
Don't go there, kid.

880
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,800
Elle made
her own choice.

881
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,500
That's on her.

882
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,500
She hasn't
admitted anything?

883
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
No.

884
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,900
Well, you're doing
the right thing.

885
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,700
Yeah, i know that.

886
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,600
Gideon: So i'll see you
in a few hours.

887
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,200
Ok.

888
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,000
Gideon?

889
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,300
Yeah.

890
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,300
Tell him
i said good-bye.

891
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,300
This is not
an admission of guilt.

892
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,500
Right.

893
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,000
You know, when i
first started this job,

894
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,800
the sound
of my phone ringing,

895
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,900
a call from the bureau,

896
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,600
i used to get
so excited.

897
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,700
The blood would race
through my veins.

898
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:44,000
And now, that same sound,
it paralyzes me.

899
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,700
I'm not the same person
anymore.

900
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,200
That night at lee's,

901
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,700
if i had to do it
all over again,

902
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,600
i wouldn't change a thing.

903
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,100
Even though
you killed someone.

904
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,700
I guess
that's it then.

905
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,800
You know, when i first
joined the team,

906
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,200
i couldn't figure out
why you never, ever smile.

907
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,600
Now i think i'm
actually gonna miss that.

908
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,800
I'm gonna
miss it, too.

909
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,800
