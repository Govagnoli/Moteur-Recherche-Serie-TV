1
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,333
So are you a knick fan?

2
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,831
10 million a year
they're paying Larry Brown.

3
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,338
You're from here?

4
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,223
No.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,771
Out of town?

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,192
Suit yourself.

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,018
You sure this is where
you wanna be?

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,187
Did you hear me?

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Walter Derbin, age 52.

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
His body was found
in his cab in east harlem.

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He was blindfolded
and shot once in the chest.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Death was caused by
knife stab through his ear.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
he broke off
the handle

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and put the blade
lodged in his brain

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
it's the same signature
as two other murders.

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Rachel Holman, 24,

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
found in her apartment
3 weeks ago on the lower east side.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And kaveh surrani, 30.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The police found him
2 weeks later

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
in his painting studio
in hell's kitchen.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Different locations, 
different victimology.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's possible we're looking for someone
who'll hunt indiscriminately.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
- Nypd have any leads?
- Guy's a ghost

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
he kills at night.
There's no witnesses.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is the nypd feeling
the strain?

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, they've withheld details so the press
hasn't sniffed out a link between the murders.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
With no discernable victim patterns, 
the killer's practically impossible to stop.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Did you know the original zodiac killer
actually continually changed his victims.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Young, old, men, women, 
white, black.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,415
Exactly, and he killed for 30 years
without ever being caught.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,707
Criminal Minds
Season 01 Episode 17

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
W.H. Auden said:

33
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
"Murder is unique
"in that it abolishes the party it injures.

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
"So that society must take
the place of the victim,

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and on his behalf, 
demand atonement or grant forgiveness."

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is not how I planned to spend
a few days home in new york.

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'd kill for an afternoon at barney's
and dinner at il cantinori.

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,681
I'm looking forward
to seeing new york.

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You've never been
to new york?

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We've never had
an unsub there.

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I thought you were gonna talk to Reid
about taking some vacation time.

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What's vacation time?

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Reid, it's a one hour flight.

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, if we have some time, 
I'll show you around.

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,594
It's 3 hour
train ride, man.

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ok, here's what we know.Blitz attackers
are almost always male.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He got picked up in the pouring rain
by a new york cabbie,

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
so we definitely know
he's not a brother.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The fact that he kills
in a major urban setting

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
without detection
indicates he's highly intelligent.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How intelligent
can he be?

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And blitz attackers
are textbook disorganized killers.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, but he brings along
a murder kit.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Blindfold, knife.
How disorganized can he be?

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We'll split up.
We'll take the last two crime scenes.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
In the meantime, let's talk about
what we can agree on.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
A blindfold likely
means one of two things.

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The unsub might
blindfold them initially

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
if he's unsure of killing them
and wants to avoid detection.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Exactly.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But since we know the cab driver
couldn't have been blindfolded when

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
he drove the unsub, 
we're looking at reason number 2.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Blindfolding a victim
suggests the unsub feels remorse.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Doesn't want his victims
to look at him...

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
as he kills them.

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What's in that building?

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Nothing.It's been vacant for
a couple of months.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This train goes express after midnight.
It doesn't even stop here.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He picked this spot beforehand.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
His last fare was logged in an address
on church street.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You have any idea
what's there?

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Church is an entry point
for brooklyn.

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There's a dive there where the cabbies
stop for coffee before the overnight shift.

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,649
Explains how
he got a cab.

75
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:03,242
This guy's definitely
not disorganized.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Rachel holman.
"Change of address" card.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
She just moved in. Hadn't even
filled out yet.

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So she probably didn't
know her neighbors,

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and they weren't likely
to check in on her.

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Nope.

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I also found this.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's a printout of A.A. 
Meetings in the area.

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
She was starting a new life.

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,456
Hey, you guys, check this out.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The cops' theory is that

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
she was home and the unsub broke in
through the front window and surprised her.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But look. This is
the gunshot to the chest.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is the knife
to the head.

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So then after
she was shot,

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
she tried to run away
from him toward the door.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Exactly.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He was already in the apartment
when she got home.

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The hallway's the only
room in the apartment with no windows.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,309
No one could see him, 
so he just waited patiently.

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So...

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
she comes home...

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and she opens the door...

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and she walks in the hallway.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
She walks down, and then...

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
bam, he shoots her
right here.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But she tries
to run away...

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and he's on her.

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So why didn't he just
shoot her again?

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Why stab her and break the blade
off in her head?

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, there are a number of
possibilities.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Through the ear is
the softest path to the brain.

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Snapping the handle's
also common in prison shankings.

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Break it off,

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
other guy can't
pull the blade out.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What's the other
possibility?

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Lawrence bittaker
and roy norris

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
drove ice picks into their victim's heads
and broke off the handle.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's possible our unsub
is sort of a, uh,

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
serial-killer groupie.

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So is this guy an ex-con
or some nut job with an amazon account?

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This particular unsub
presents a mixed profile.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No offense, 
then what good is it?

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The profile's just a starting point
for narrowing down the suspects.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
For instance, the fact that the unsub
shoots his victims first

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
suggests that he needs a quick and
effective means of controlling the situation.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's possible that he
feels he can't overpower his victims.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It could be that he has
a physical problem.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Or that he's not confidant just
because he's small.

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We now know he has a high
degree of organization.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That coupled with the fact
he hunts at night

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
means he probably has
a steady job.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So we're looking for
a small, angry white guy with a day job?

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Maybe it's wilson.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Cut it!

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No, that's all right.That's all right.
You're right.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There's a lot
we still don't know, but

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
we do know this:

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
These are not
blitz attacks.

134
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They're too controlled.

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
These are absolutely
executions.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
An unsub's signature--

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
is his own extremely
rare combination of m.O. And ritual.

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
An unsub kills to
satisfy an inner need,

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and he'll continue
killing until that inner need,

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
which is based on
a ritual, is lived out perfectly.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Because reality
never lives up to fantasy,

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
this becomes an impossibility.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
In other words,

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
he's not gonna stop killing
until we catch him.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Ok. Hit the streets
and keep your head on a swivel.

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Thank you very much.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hi. Jennifer jareau.
We spoke on the phone.Detective bennett.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
- Hello.
- Agent Hotchner.

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So I spoke to
your point man.

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I reiterated how important it is
to keep the crime scene details under wraps,

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
but it would go a long way if it came
out of your mouth, too.

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You got it.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,234
If this guy's who we think he is, we're talking
terror like New York hasn't seen since sum of sam.

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,929
May I help you?

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,215
Are you ok?

156
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So this is where
terror starts.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How'd they find him?

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
- Night janitor.
- He see anything?

159
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No, but he remembered
a parishioner who was here earlier.

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
- So there's a potential witness.
- Right there.

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
- This lady?
- Mm-hmm.

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
- Help?
- Yeah.

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
First public killing.

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,383
He's getting bolder, huh?

165
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He didn't let his surroundings
alter his method.

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He's meticulous.

167
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,693
Presentation is  
important as the kill

168
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
as soon as the police
asked me if I'd seen anything,

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I had a sickly feeling.

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
- So you saw him?
- Not his face.

171
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He had a hood on

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and he kept his head down.

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But something about
his behavior unsettled you?

174
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry.
I should have known.

175
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There's no way that someone could know
something like this.

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It almost felt like
he couldn't hear me,

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
like he was in his
own world, you know?

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You spoke to him?

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I just asked if he was ok.

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And he didn't speak?

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He didn't even look up.

182
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I couldn't stop
watching his hands.

183
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
They were moving, 
like he was playing a piano

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
or fingering
a rosary maybe.

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He could have killed me.

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Unless he's not
killing at random.

187
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,221
And whatever these people have in common's
what got them killed.

188
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry.
Would it be possible to maybe...

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,174
slide that thing
out of his ear?

190
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I thought maybe he was uncomfortable
being in this parish.

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why would it be uncomfortable?

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because of all that...

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
business.

194
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
A year ago, the rector
was indicted for pedophilia.

195
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
A lot of people
stopped worshipping here.

196
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But father Breeman was tried in a court
of law and found innocent.

197
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's not my place
to question that.

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He's not using just any knife.
It's made of flint.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
As in stone?

200
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
In egyptian mythology, flint was the symbol
for protection and retribution.

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
With hieroglyphics, they used to depict
dangerous animals

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
like scorpions
and snakes being

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,764
cut with flint knives
in order to render them powerless.

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Anything strike you as strange?

205
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,197
The blood's all
on the inside.

206
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Fount of all knowledge.
Check my flow.

207
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I need you to check all the victims
and see if any were charged with a crime.

208
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Ok. You wanna time me, or should I just
dazzle you off the clock?

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Ok. Kaveh surrani.

210
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Vehicular manslaughter.

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Tried and found not guilty
july 2002.

212
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Rachel holman. Convicted
of cocaine possession, 2004.

213
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
oh, baby girl.
Just say no.

214
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
No acquittals?

215
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Uh...wait.Hold on.

216
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Same case. She was also
up on charges for administring

217
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
a fatal dose of heroin to her boyfriend.

218
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Jury found her not guilty.
Can we go 3 for 3?

219
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yahtzee.

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Our cabbie, 
walter derbin.

221
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Spousal battery.
Bastard!

222
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
- But he was innocent?
- If you wanna call it that.

223
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Charges were dropped
mid-trial 4 months ago.

224
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
- You're a genius.
- You're just saying that 'cause it's true.

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Thanks.

226
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If the victim was blindfolded first, 
the blood would have flowed over the blindfold.

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He puts it on
after he kills them.

228
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
All 3 charged with a felony.
All 3 found innocent.

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And that didn't show up
on your men's radar?

230
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Acquittals? No.

231
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why is it important?

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,097
Because we have
a new profile.

233
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We know believe these killings
aren't random.

234
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We might be dealing
with a vigilante.

235
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The unsub first shoots his victims
in order to subdue them.

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Flint knife then provides
both an efficient kill

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and symbolic retribution.

238
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Finally, the victim is blindfolded,

239
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
like the statute of lady justice.

240
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This particular unsub,

241
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
he displays both
a heightened--

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
it's actually almost
a poetic sense of right and wrong.

243
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Serial vigilantes
are extremely rare.

244
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The exaggerated drama of these killings
suggest that they're somehow personal.

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He, or someone close to him, 
is likely the victim of a violent crime.

246
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
His first killing was possibly
against his original attacker.

247
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And since then he's developed

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
an overblown sense of justice
in order to justify that killing to himself.

249
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Because he chooses
the imagery of lady justice,

250
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
it's possible we're
dealing with someone who works

251
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
in or around
the criminal justice system.

252
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Lawyer, paralegal, 
bailiff, even a judge.

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We'll cross-check
unsolved murders

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
against suspects
in assault cases

255
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and victims who work
in the system.

256
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Whatever the unsub's job,

257
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
he's someone who's
a cog in the machine.

258
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He's overworked, 
undervalued.

259
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He's used to not being
noticed.

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
His sense of theatrics
is a way to enhance his own self-esteem,

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
convince himself
he has a higher purpose.

262
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,298
And he also knows that people look
right through him.

263
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Being faceless is his best defense
against protection.

264
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He's everyone.

265
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
One last thing.
We need you to close ranks.

266
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The more details slip out, 
the more he'll feed off it.

267
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We don't want him believing he captured
the public's fear or imagination.

268
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Too late.

269
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The afternoon edition's leading
with the vigilante story.

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
How did they get it?

271
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't know.

272
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You were worried about this guy becoming
another son of Sam.

273
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,917
Now we might be dealing
with a vigilante folk hero like bernhard goetz.

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So you know there was a big hole
in the profile you presented back there.

275
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Can you pass the moo shoo, please?

276
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What's the hole?

277
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I left out the possibility
our unsub might be a cop.

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, the do know the system.

279
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They're definitely
overworked and underpaid.

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
They see so much
injustice every day

281
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
they can easily take matters
into their own hands.

282
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
When someone like
our victim is killed,

283
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
police refer to the murder
as a public-service murder.

284
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You know how many rapists
i saw walk during my sex-crime days?

285
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
None of the victims, 
they didn't want to press charges.

286
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Or the juries, they said

287
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
that she was asking for it.

288
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It was enough
to make you explode.

289
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a long way from
feeling like that

290
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and actually committing
murder, don't you think?

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Not really.

292
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Excuse me. Can I get
a fork, perhaps?

293
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Did you know that
experts credit confucius

294
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
with the advent of
the chopstick?

295
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He equated knives with
acts of aggression.

296
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You don't know how
to use them, do you?

297
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's like trying to forage for dinner
with a pair of number 2 pencils.

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Ok, here, 
let me help you.

299
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
- Oh, the rubber-band.

300
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, new york city cops do have a lot of
pressure on 'em.

301
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Every move they make
is scrutinized.

302
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You know, the first cases
of criminal profiling

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
happened when
a new york city cop

304
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
asked a criminal
psychiatrist friend

305
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
to help with
the mad bomber case.

306
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The mad bomber was a major inspiration
for the unabomber.

307
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
He eluded cops in new york for 16 years, 
starting in 1940.

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But he kept his promise and never set off
a single bomb during the second world war.

309
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Psychiatrist james brussels,

310
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
he developed a profile
so accurate

311
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
he predicted that when
they caught the bomber,

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
he'd be wearing a double-breasted suit
and it would be buttoned.

313
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You guys,

314
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
we're here in new york

315
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and even when we're not
talking about our case,

316
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
we end up talking about
another profiler.

317
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You're right.

318
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So, elle...

319
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
are you seeing anyone?

320
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Uh, gideon...

321
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
why didn't you tell the cops
that it might be one of their own?

322
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If we're gonna catch the guy,

323
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
we need all the help
the cops can give us.

324
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,055
The last thing i want to do
is accuse one of them of murder.

325
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Gideon.

326
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's absolutely
incredible.

327
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
1.3 billion people
stay nourished using these things.

328
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,150
Yeah. Ok. I got it.

329
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,206
He just took out a cop killer.

330
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
His name's shawn cooley.

331
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
One year ago, he killed
2 port authority cops.

332
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And he walked

333
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
because the only witness against him
was shot 6 times outside his apartment.

334
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It might be worth having your
men re-canvas this morning.

335
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
People are more likely
to talk in the day.

336
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
- They feel safer.
- I'm already on it.

337
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
More bad news.

338
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's the same reporter every time.
Ncwagner.

339
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He's practically
deifying him.

340
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm not even happy with the results
when god plays god.

341
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You know, a few of the men were talking about
making him wish list of other dirtbags.

342
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
"Some day a real rain will come
and wash all the scum off the streets."

343
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Taxi driver.

344
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This town loves a
psychopath.

345
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Why hasn't he contacted
the press yet?

346
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Reid's right.

347
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
He's got the symbolism,
the inflated sense of duty.

348
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He should be
seeking out acclaim.

349
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Maybe it's not about
acclaim with him.

350
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He's on a mission.
Maybe it's about the work.

351
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,572
Yeah, but the last 2 cases were a cop killer and
a pedophile priest.Those are higher profile cases.

352
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:42,942
he's getting more confident

353
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:46,680
he's growing until his role is the
cities judge and executioner

354
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll check the press archives
for controversial acquittals.

355
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Maybe we can target the victim before the unsub,
have the police waiting on him.

356
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,709
Hey, guys. Listen to what
came off the tip hotline.

357
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I got a tip.
Let the guy be.

358
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
How come the nypd wants
to catch this guy?

359
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Are you jealous he's doing the job
better than you?

360
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It goes on for half an hour.

361
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He's a hero.

362
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The exact same thing happened with the
goetz-new york subway shooting in the early eighties.

363
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You weren't even born.

364
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I read a lot.

365
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
- Hey, talk to me, baby.
- Who do you love?

366
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That depends
on what you're giving me.

367
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh, don't be such a man.

368
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I ran the names
of the 5 victims like you asked.

369
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
No overlap in arresting officers,
public defenders or district attorneys.

370
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
- Do I sense a but
- small but.

371
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Atne not what
i was jonesing for.

372
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
you're killing me
with entendres.

373
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But each one was processed at the manhattan
criminal courthouse at 100 centre street.

374
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Do you have any idea how many cases
run through there every year?

375
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
122, 998.

376
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But at least we've eliminated
4 other boroughs, hmm?

377
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah, great.All right.

378
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's a start.
Thanks.

379
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Ta.

380
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Do you have any idea
how many cases--

381
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
122, 998 cases a year.

382
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We'll check it out.

383
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Maybe there's someone with a history of
erratic behavior who worked in the building.

384
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Crime groupies.

385
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
A security guard
that fits the profile.

386
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Get with J.J. See what you
can make of her case list.

387
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Ok.

388
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll go with you.

389
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Ever crossed your mind?

390
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Taking the law into my own hands?

391
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Not the law, justice.

392
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What's this about?
The boys in iowa?

393
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's just a question.

394
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I guess if I think if I ever let
my mind go there,

395
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
then the unsubs would be getting into my head
instead of me getting into theirs.

396
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That wouldn't be a good idea, now,
would it?

397
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The cops have already been down here asking
their questions.

398
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I just want to give you
a description of someone,

399
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
see if he sounds familiar.

400
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
He's quiet. He...

401
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
body language gives the impression
he's seen too much.

402
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Work in this building long enough,
we all get that way.

403
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
He's small, meticulous.
You might not notice him at first,

404
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
but when you do, you realize he's heard
everything around him.

405
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He might have had a personal brush
with crime.

406
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
When it happened, he talked bout it
all the time.

407
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But now you realize he hasn't mentioned it
in quite a while.

408
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And when the subject of the vigilante
comes up, he expresses his support,

409
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
but it's not something he would bring up
in conversation himself.

410
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Well, if people are
being honest with you,

411
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
that's most of the people in
this building.

412
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
How old are you?

413
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
24.

414
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll give you 6 years.

415
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
That point, a tiny part
of your brain will be asking

416
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,602
if what this guy's doing
isn't the right way to go.

417
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
- anything?
- Uh-uh. You?

418
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
No.

419
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,771
What happened in iowa?

420
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
it was one of the first cases
hotch and I worked together.

421
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Small town, 2 boys had been murdered,
same signature.

422
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The profile led us
to the local 4-h leader.

423
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
We went to interview him.the guy,

424
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
he was suiciderly ???
Our guns were drawn.

425
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
At some point, he turns
the shotgun on hotch.

426
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Instead of firing, hotch talks him down
the guy surrenders.

427
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Sounds like pretty good work.

428
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
At trial, the guy's wife gave him
an alibi for both murders.

429
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Small town.They all knew each other.
The jurors believed her.

430
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,232
Eventually they got him
when he killed another boy.

431
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,244
any luck?

432
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
this guy's not
doing us any favors.

433
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
His access is unbelievable.

434
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,148
He's practically scooping us.

435
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The fbi needs help and they get you
to do their bidding?

436
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
i am an fbi special agent.

437
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The rest of the team is too busy.
they're out in the field.

438
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,588
Yeah, and they're doing
a bang-up job, too.

439
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Look, the fact is you've scooped every other
reporter in new york.

440
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You've even managed
to be ahead of the cops a few times.

441
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
A good crime reporter needs to be better
than the police.You got less to go on.

442
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Well, that's why agent gideon was hoping
you'd accept this invitation to help.

443
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Jason Gideon?

444
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
He used to be
one of the best.

445
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
- He still is.
- Yeah. He had kind of a famous meltdown.

446
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And a whole string
of success since he's returned.

447
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah, yeah. Meltdown's
make better copy.

448
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Maybe you can take that
up with him yourself...

449
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
you know, if you
decide to come in.

450
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So how did you put together
the vigilante angle so quickly?

451
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I covered the original trials
of all the victims.

452
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You must have a good memory.

453
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
A lot of killers can't remember details
from their own crimes.

454
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Some cases just stick
right in your brain.

455
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Tell us about the victims.

456
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
All right. Well, this girl,
she was just a waste case.

457
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The jury bought into the whole
"addiction as disease" bs.

458
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And this old guy,

459
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
he was a thug.He beat his wife,
but the case fell apart

460
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
because she wouldn't testify.

461
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Surrani?

462
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
He drank and drove.

463
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It was a tragedy, but...

464
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
it was the kind of thing
that could happen to anybody.

465
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So who do you think we're looking for?
What's his background?

466
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
My guess is he's a crime victim.

467
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Probably something violent.

468
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But you do think he's a hero.

469
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Well...

470
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
you know, this city make you
swallow a lot of crap.

471
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's hard not to feel
for someone who won't take it anymore.

472
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
These haven't been released to the press.
They're pretty grim.

473
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I've seen plenty
of crime scenes.

474
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Right.

475
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
We're stuck on the ear.

476
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Is it for killing efficiency
or symbolism?

477
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,342
Why would you stab someone through the ear
into their brain?

478
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What's going on here?

479
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
The profile leads us to think
that he works close

480
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
to the criminal justice system.
What do you think?

481
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
No, no.

482
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You didn't bring me in here
because you wanted my help.

483
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The profile suggests this guy'd contact
the media.He hasn'T.

484
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And we thought the killer wouldn't need
to contact the press if he were the press.

485
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You're single-handedly turning this
psychopath into a folk hero.

486
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So what happened?
You get your men killed on the job

487
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and you think everybody else
must be a killer, too?

488
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
- Watch your mouth.
- It's ok, hotch.

489
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
- Not our guy.
- You're damn right.

490
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I didn't kill anybody.
What about you?

491
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Wagner.

492
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You're right.

493
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You're not the killer.

494
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Mm-hmm.

495
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Everything you feel is vicarious.
You don't have it in you to act.

496
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
This psycho's
the last chance for you.

497
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You've screwed up other jobs.
You drink too much.

498
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Probably have a broken
marriage or two.

499
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You're actually hoping
he doesn't get caught for a while.

500
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Part of you knows that's twisted
and pathetic, but hey...

501
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,238
you're just reporting
the news, right?

502
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,352
Hey! Hey!

503
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The reporter is not a vigilante.

504
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah, we know.
How do you know?

505
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
There was just another
shooting in central park.

506
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You say shooting.
What about the rest of the signature?

507
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Officers heard the shot,
but he ran off before they got there.

508
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The victim was
an undercover cop.

509
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I think you're
looking for me.

510
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Put the gun
on the ground!

511
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
- On your knees!
- Drop the gun!

512
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Get down.

513
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Don't move.

514
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
No, you don't understand.

515
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I did this all for you.

516
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,487
We're in this together.

517
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
His name's will sykes.
He's a security guard at a boutique in soho.

518
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
He was a mugging victim last year.
Spent 2 days in intensive care.

519
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Fits the profile.

520
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
How's it going in here?

521
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
He just confessed
to all the murders.

522
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So what were you doing
in the park?

523
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's full of animals.

524
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Muggers and scum,
drug dealers.

525
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I knew one of them
would try to prey on me.

526
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That's not your
usual method.

527
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I mean, you target them.
You don't let them target you.

528
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I made that point,
now I'm making this one.

529
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Which is?

530
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
If you hunt us
on the street,

531
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,207
you will die
the way you lived.

532
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So why turn yourself in now?

533
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I can't change the city
without help.

534
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
People need to be inspired.

535
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
They need to see me.

536
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
They need to hear my voice.

537
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Can you tell me about
the cab driver, derbin?

538
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
He was a thug.
A wife beater.

539
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And the priest?

540
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
What's to know?

541
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
He preyed on young boys.

542
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Is that why you stabbed him
in the groin?

543
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's what he deserved.

544
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Thank you.

545
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Why would he confess
to murders he didn't commit?

546
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Because he has
narcissistic delusions.

547
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
He wants the glory.
He wants to be a star.

548
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
He went into the park hoping that somebody
would mess with him.

549
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
He killed your undercover officer
but not the others.

550
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So where dos that leave us?

551
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
We know our unsub has a heightened sense
of right and wrong.

552
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
If he knew that he inspired a would-be
vigilante to murder an undercover cop,

553
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
he might feel remorse.

554
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You think you might be able to mend fences
with the reporter, wagner?

555
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
If it played to his ego, yeah.

556
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:39,000
We might be able to draw the unsub out.
That's a good one.

557
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Wagner said this morning that the cop's blood
is all over the vigilante's hands.

558
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
How did J.J. Get him to cooperate?

559
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The unsub may feel
a need to be there,

560
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
to physically mourn
for what he caused.

561
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
If that article lures him,
wagner gets to claim he caught a murderer.

562
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It's the ultimate scoop.

563
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Will they know
how to spot him?

564
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I briefed your men.If the unsub's there, he'll
be alone, out of place, not speaking to anyone else,

565
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
probably not even
making eye contact.

566
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Hopefully, he'll panic,

567
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
draw attention to himself.

568
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I can never get that sound
out of my head.

569
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Wakes me in the middle of the night.

570
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
If there was any justice,

571
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,000
cop killers would have
to hear it for an eternity.

572
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Hotch.

573
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Hey, hotch.
Hotch, it's morgan.

574
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Thank you--listen,

575
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
something's funky, man.

576
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm here trying to get transcripts
from the victims'original trials.

577
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I thought maybe there cod have been a
disturbance at the courthouse,

578
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
or maybe the unsub even made himself known.
You know what I mean?

579
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah.

580
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Ok. Well, here's the thing.There are no records
available yet from the cabbie's trial.

581
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
The clerk told me that
your average court reporter

582
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
is 3 to 6 months behind
in transcribing his notes.

583
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That means that anyone who knows the details of
that case had to have been in the courtroom.

584
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Court reporters take their work
home with them.

585
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
They get paid overtime.They take their notes
in court and finish transcribing them at night.

586
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You know what bennett said about not being able
to get the sound of bagpipes out of her head?

587
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Maybe that's why the unsub stabs
the ears.

588
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Killers often harm their victims in ways
that they themselves have been harmed.

589
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Court reporters, by definition,
are a faceless cog in the machine.

590
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
He sits there day in and day out
transcribing testimony.

591
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
What if the voices wouldn't stop when
you left the courtroom?

592
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
They witness at the church
said that the unsub

593
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
- was playing a piano-like motion.
- Or transcribing.

594
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Killings a good way to get
the voices to stop, huh?

595
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Holla.

596
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I need the name of the court stenographer
in each of the victims' original trials.

597
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Same one every time.
Marvin doyle.

598
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Cross-check him against crime records.
See if he was ever the victim of a violent crime.

599
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Not him.

600
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
His parents killed in
an attempted robber, '04.

601
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
That's his stressor.
Is he still working?

602
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
100 center, 
courtroom 12-b

603
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
we've got him.

604
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Marvin doyle.
Is that him?

605
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Doyle called in sick.

606
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We were in this
courtroom yesterday.

607
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
He saw us.

608
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Tell your judge
i need a warrant.Take that.

609
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Marvin doyle.
Fbi. Open up.

610
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Clear!

611
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's clean.

612
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:02,000
He's gonna keep
the voices out.

613
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He sound-proofed
the entire place.

614
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
He ripped the speakers
out of the television and the radio.

615
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And here is life insurance check
for $250, 000.

616
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's 2 years old.
He didn't cash it.

617
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:33,000
He won't accept blood money.

618
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Here's a box full of flint knives.
There's got to be a hundred of 'em.

619
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Hey, guys. Come take
a look at this.

620
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It's a stenography machine.
Look at the keys.

621
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
They're all worn out.

622
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It's like he was trying to transcribe
the voices in his head and he couldn't keep up.

623
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Looks like
hieroglyphics.

624
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's called steno.
It's basically

625
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
a phonetic series
of syllables.

626
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
No court reporter takes notes the same way so no
one can translate them but the reporter himself.

627
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
He's getting paid overtime
to study potential victims.

628
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
He knows we're onto him.
He's racing us now.

629
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Someone in these boxes
is targeted to die.

630
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
We need to get inside his head and figure
out who so we can stop him.

631
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Let's go.
Start fishin'.

632
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
this is a lot of boxes.
How are we supposed to narrow it down?

633
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Check and see if it ended in acquittal.
If it didn't, toss it aside.

634
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It has to be a capital case.He's escalating.
The more brutal the better.

635
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Why not go by most recent?

636
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Judging by his elaborate filing system,
doyle obviously has obsessive-compulsive disorder.

637
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
People with ocd often finish tasks
then go back to the beginning and start over.

638
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So he continually goes through the transcripts and
the first one to trigger him becomes his next victim.

639
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Here's one.

640
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
This is a liquor store owner
who was shot with his own gun.

641
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Flip to when they present the defense.
Did the defendant testify?

642
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,000
No.

643
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Stick with the ones where
the accused took the stand.

644
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
This is personal.
He hears their voices.

645
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Doyle's victims all claimed to be a type
of victim themselves.

646
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
They first two threw themselves on
the mercy of the court,

647
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
pleading alcohol
and drug dependency.

648
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The priest said he was
a victim, victim of recent hysteria.

649
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Look for key phrases:Victim, mercy, anything that
signifies they thought their crime wasn't their fault.

650
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I think I might have one, guys.
Ted elmore.

651
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
He shot and killed both his parents after claiming
self-defense for years of physical abuse.

652
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Doyle lost his own parents.Hearing someone get
away with killing their own, that would haunt him.

653
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Hello?

654
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Is ted elmore there?

655
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Not right now.
Can I take a message?

656
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Who's this?

657
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
This is his wife.
Who's this?

658
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:09,000
My name is jason gideon.
I'm with the fbi.

659
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Honey, the fbi
is on the phone?

660
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Mrs. Elmore!

661
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Mrs. Elmore!

662
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Come on!

663
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
He's there.

664
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I think I can
talk him out.

665
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I have snipers up high.If they get
a clean shot, they have my order to take it.

666
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
We might be able to reason.

667
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
We rushed him.

668
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
He doesn't want to have
an innocent hostage.

669
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
He has an exaggerated sense
of right and wrong.

670
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And so do I.

671
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Talking's worth a shot.

672
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm coming with you.

673
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Shut up!

674
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
He didn't do anything to you.

675
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Tell her how you lied.

676
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Tell her how you
killed your parents

677
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and pretended they'd
been hurting you.

678
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
They did hurt me.

679
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'll kill him.

680
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Then you wouldn't get
to hear the truth.

681
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
If he admits the truth,

682
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
the voices will stop, right?

683
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
They always lie.

684
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Do you have the shot?

685
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Negative.

686
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Let us interrogate him?

687
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Put the gun down.We're the fbi.
We'll get the truth.

688
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Marvin, I'm gonna put my gun away.

689
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:10,000
We'll do this together, ok?

690
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Tell him the truth.

691
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Tell him how you lied
on the stand.

692
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
They did hurt me.

693
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Don't listen to them.

694
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
If he dies,

695
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
they'll go away!

696
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
What do you think?
They won't come back?

697
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Beverly, iowa, 1999.

698
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
A man kills 2 boys only to walk away free
and kill another one.

699
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Stop.

700
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Haskins, georgia, last year.

701
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
3 white guys kill
a black teenager--

702
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
just because 4 witnesses see it.
The jury finds them not guilty--

703
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
just because.

704
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The first 2 boys were 14 years old.
The third was only 12.

705
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
- Stop!
- It doesn't stop.

706
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Diallo, blake, simpson,
t cullen davis.

707
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You can't kill
fast enough to keep up.

708
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
They killed my parents.

709
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I know.

710
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm so tired.

711
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Marvin, listen to me.

712
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Why don't you just
give me the gun?

713
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Promise you...

714
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I will get you a place

715
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
to rest.

716
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Are you clear now?

717
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I heard there was a secret code

718
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
the day that played

719
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and it pleased the lord

720
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
but you don't really care
for music, do you?

721
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Well, it goes like this
the fourth or fifth

722
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
the minor fall
and the major lift

723
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
the baffled king
composing, hallelujah

724
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
hallelujah

725
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
hallelujah

726
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Gandhi said,

727
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
"it is better to be violent
"if there's violence in our hearts

728
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
than to put on the cloak
of non-violence

729
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
to cover impotence."

730
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Gandhi also said,

731
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
"I object to violence

732
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
"because when it appears to do good,

733
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
"the good is only temporary.

734
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
The evil it does

735
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
is permanent."

736
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
he got what he deserved.

737
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
He only did what the rest of us
wish we could do.

738
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I felt safer when he was alive.

739
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
This is why we need gun control.

740
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
The guy's a murderer.
He got his own. Death penalty.

741
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I say he's a hero.

742
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
They only killed him because they were
afraid no jury would convict him.
