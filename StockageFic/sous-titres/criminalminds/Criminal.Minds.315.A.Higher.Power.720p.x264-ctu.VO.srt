1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,500
They said that storm
was coming,

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,600
And they weren't kidding.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,400
oh...

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,500
How are we?

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,200
Well, you know, it's hard.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,200
Just one foot
in front of the other.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,100
Thanks.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,800
It would have been
amy's birthday tomorrow.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,600
Paul?

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,000
Hmm.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,800
He's been a rock.

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,700
But you know how he is.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,800
His glass is always full.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,700
I think he's home.

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,200
Well, the kids are with
grandma tonight.

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,300
We have a night off.

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,800
Yeah.

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,100
God, we need it.

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,100
Thank you.

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,800
I appreciate the call, kate.

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,400
You know, I... I should go.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, ok.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,800
Bye.

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,600
Paul?

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,700
Paul, i think the lightning
blew out the house.

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,400
Paul.

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,800
Honey? Paul?

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,600
Paul?

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,300
Paul.

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,400
Honey?

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,900
Paul, open the door.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,100
Honey?

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200
Unlock the door!

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Paul!

35
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Aah...

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,500
Paul!

37
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, my god!

38
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,500
Agent jennifer jareau?

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,500
A friend of mine
gave me your number,

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,300
Said you might be able
to help.

41
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,600
Ronnie baleman,
pittsburgh p.D.

42
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,600
There's something
going on in my town.

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,233
Something's not right.

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Got a case.

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,700
So, you've either decided
we're taking the case

46
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,400
Or this bag is headed
for another destination?

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
I need a favor.

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,500
Of course.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,400
I need some personal time,
no more than a day.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
Take all the time
you need.

51
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,400
I need to talk to jack.

52
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
I've lost her,
but i'm not gonna lose him.

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,000
I need to try to...

54
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,100
Tell him what's going on.

55
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,600
I don't know how much
he's going to
understand, but...

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
All he needs to understand...

57
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,900
Is that you love him.

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,800
I'll join you when i can.

59
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,900
3 months ago a fire
in the shadyside rec center

60
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,600
Killed 14 children.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I remember that.

62
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,500
What does that
have to do with us?

63
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, over the past
3 months there's been
5 suicides.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,200
All of them lost a child
in the fire.

65
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,900
The last one
was paul baleman.

66
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,400
He was found electrocuted
in his bathtub yesterday.

67
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,200
I received a request
for our help.

68
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,700
Why do they need our help?
They're suicides.

69
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,500
All of the suicides
were within 2 weeks
of each other.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,100
It could be
some kind of pattern.

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Detective ronnie baleman,
pittsburgh, p.D.

72
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,800
Thinks that something's
going on.

73
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,900
Well, of course he does.

74
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,100
Why do you say that?

75
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,900
He's related
to that man, right?

76
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,100
His brother.

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,400
A cop who doesn't
believe his brother
committed suicide.

78
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,500
Come on, next case.

79
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Now, wait a second.

80
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,600
5 suicides
in the same neighborhood

81
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,700
Within months?

82
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,200
That's a serious spike.

83
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,700
Suicides don't spike
after a tragedy.

84
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,800
Quite the opposite,
actually.

85
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,400
Following world war i and ii,
right after kennedy was shot,

86
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,600
And following 9/11,

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
Suicides plummeted.

88
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,000
Within a society,
external threats

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Usually create group
integrations.

90
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,100
People come together.

91
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,700
So if there's
reason for doubt,

92
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,100
Which there obviously is,

93
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't those families
left behind

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,300
Have a right to know?

95
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,900
Yes, they do.

96
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,600
Ok, sure,
they deserve to know,

97
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,300
But let somebody else
tell them,
like social services.

98
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,300
Contact detective baleman.

99
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,000
Let him know we're coming.

100
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,900
Http://www.Ragbear.Com

101
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,000
Rossi: "there is no refuge
from confession but suicide,

102
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,600
And suicide is confession."

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,500
Daniel webster.

104
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,500
Hotch would never
have taken this case.

105
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,300
And i say case
in the loosest sense.

106
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,200
We'll follow the facts
as they are without bias.

107
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,900
Isn't that what we do?

108
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,500
What facts, rossi?

109
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,700
Look at us.
We don't have a single file.

110
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,600
Ok, let me help you out.

111
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,300
Jump right in anytime.

112
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,400
Fact one...
There are no files,

113
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
So it seems no case.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But what if there is?

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,100
One fire, 14 deaths,
5 suicides.

116
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,200
All the suicides

117
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,000
Are connected
to the original fire.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,900
And all exactly 2 weeks apart.

119
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,200
Come on, derek,
you can't tell me

120
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
That doesn't feel
a lot like a pattern.

121
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Prentiss:
and a timeline.

122
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Right?

123
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,300
A lot of people lost
their kids in that fire.

124
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,500
That's a whole
world of grief,

125
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,700
And for a few...

126
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,800
Suicide's their only way out.

127
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,800
Or someone decided it was.

128
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,300
And made it look this way?

129
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,700
What if they have?

130
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,900
Then we're looking for
one very smart unsub.

131
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,700
Who targets people
in grief.

132
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,200
And that would
make them what?

133
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,300
Someone who thinks

134
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,200
They're putting them
out of their misery.

135
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,900
An angel of death.

136
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,100
Agent jareau?

137
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Hi. I'm detective
ronnie baleman.

138
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,300
Hi. This is ssa rossi,

139
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,900
Ssas morgan, prentiss,
and dr. Reid.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,300
Thank you, all of you,
for coming.

141
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,600
Well, your colleagues don't
look all that happy to see us.

142
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,900
They didn't just
lose a brother.

143
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
I'd like to get started
on all the files.

144
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,200
We're gonna build what we
call psychological autopsies

145
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,100
To determine whether
the victims killed themselves.

146
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,500
Everything's
in those boxes.

147
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,700
We'd also like to take a look
at your brother's house.

148
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
I'll take you there.

149
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,500
I think it's better
if you stay here.

150
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,400
It's my case.
I brought you here.

151
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,300
Technically,
there is no case.

152
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,200
If there was,
you wouldn't be on it.

153
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,600
We need to profile
the scene without bias.

154
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,900
I could use your help
with these files.

155
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,700
It looks like
there's quite a few.

156
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
My brother kept a journal.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,100
I found this on the desk
in his bedroom.

158
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,100
Read the last page.
They're not the words
of a suicidal man.

159
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,000
You seem pretty sure
that an unsub exists.

160
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,800
So are you.

161
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,700
You're here,
aren't you?

162
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
He wasn't on
antidepressants.

163
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,200
He wasn't depressed.

164
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,900
Do you mind if my colleagues
take a look upstairs?

165
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,900
Ronnie kept it
exactly as it was

166
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,100
Until you got here.

167
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
Tell me about the fire.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,800
It's the annual fall dance
for the kids.

169
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
And it's really popular.

170
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,900
It's hard to get tickets.

171
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,200
But the kids love it.

172
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,400
Do you personally know

173
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,100
Any of the other families?

174
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,700
Who lost children?

175
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,900
And who recently
committed suicide as a result.

176
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,100
Just questions.

177
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Ok?

178
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,900
He knows...

179
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,900
Paul wouldn't do this.

180
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,400
What?

181
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,800
Paul wouldn't do this.

182
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,900
Not after all
we've been through.

183
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,100
He would not leave us.

184
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Not like that.

185
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,700
Go ahead.

186
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,900
Put it up.

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,800
This is a physical
representation

188
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,400
Of the 5 equivocal deaths.

189
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Together with the profile
of each case,

190
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,900
We'll build psychological
autopsies of each person.

191
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,200
And this will tell us
if it was suicide
or murder.

192
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,300
Uh, suicide, yes,
murder, no.

193
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,900
And you think it's
a pretty good indicator.

194
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,400
Since its inception
in 1958,

195
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,500
It's proven to carry
a 92% accuracy rate

196
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,100
In cases that have
gone to trial.

197
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,500
Ok, so the door was locked
from the inside

198
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
And the wife
broke the door in.

199
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,300
But he could have
gotten out that window.

200
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
Well, it's a good
20-Foot drop.

201
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,100
It'd hurt,
but you could do it.

202
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,500
So a toaster was thrown
in the tub, right?

203
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,900
Space heater.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
Toaster, space heater.
Did the job.

205
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,500
Hey. It's a 110 outlet
with no gfi.

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,900
Go on.

207
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Well, it's a 1930s house,
but it's been remodeled,

208
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,100
With no ground fault
installation.

209
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,400
Yet there was a gfi unit
installed in the kitchen.

210
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
I put them
in all my properties,

211
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,600
Especially the bathroom
and the kitchen.

212
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,300
Any surge of electrical
current will shut the power down

213
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
At the source.

214
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,800
Properties?

215
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,100
Yeah.

216
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,000
How many properties?

217
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,100
4.

218
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,700
Whoever threw the space heater
in this tub

219
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,200
Knew that there was no gfi.

220
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,100
Mm-Hmm.

221
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,700
Come on.

222
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,700
Mrs. Baleman,

223
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,600
What did your husband do
for a living?

224
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,200
He was a contractor.

225
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,300
Well, if these autopsies
prove they weren't suicides,

226
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,800
Then i need to inform
the media right away.

227
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,000
I would err
on the side of caution.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,800
What?

229
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,100
People need to know.

230
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
And they will, as soon as
we have absolute proof.

231
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,800
I think the town's been through
enough already, don't you?

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,500
Also keep in mind that
if these cases are related,

233
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,700
This unsub's probably
already aware
that we're onto him.

234
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,200
But the community
needs to know

235
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,000
If there's a serial
killer in its midst.

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
And they will,
as soon as we have proof.

237
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,200
Even if the proof
means another body.

238
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
He's right, you know.

239
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
He's also personally
motivated, though,

240
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
Which means he's likely
to react irrationally.

241
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,400
If this turns out to be
the work of a serial killer,

242
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,900
The whole town will, too.

243
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,000
You know what i think,
jakey?

244
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,400
Quarterback.

245
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,800
Yeah.

246
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,300
Maybe that's a little
too dangerous.

247
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,700
How about a kicker?

248
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,400
Yeah, a kicker.

249
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,100
Ooh! Looks like
we have a visitor.

250
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,100
Just a second!

251
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,400
Mommy will be right back.

252
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,500
Hey there. Come on in.

253
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,800
Thank you very much.

254
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
Say hi, jake.

255
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,600
Can you do that
for mommy, say "hi."

256
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,800
I've got your bag
in the other room.

257
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,300
You ok?

258
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,200
Yeah, i'm good.
Let's do this.

259
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,000
All right, you got a kid.

260
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,600
There's a bad guy
in the house.

261
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,800
What do you do
to protect your child?

262
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,800
Fight.

263
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,000
Not a single defensive
wound on her body.

264
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Well...

265
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,200
I don't suppose she climbed
up there of her own free will.

266
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,400
Unless
she committed suicide.

267
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,300
She's got a baby
crying for her
in the other room.

268
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,600
Father found him
in the high chair.

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Not a scratch.

270
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,500
Remember,
the unsub believes

271
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,100
He's on some kind
of a mission.

272
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,800
The child is of no
importance to him.

273
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,400
You find
a suicide note?

274
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,800
I haven't found one yet.

275
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
So what are you thinking?

276
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,800
In every case, there's no
evidence of a struggle.

277
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,200
Or breaking and entering.

278
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,900
I'm going to need
you and emily to contact
all of the families

279
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,000
Affected by the fire
and inform them
what's going on.

280
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,800
They need to be
warned immediately.

281
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,400
So she couldn't cope.

282
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,000
She snapped.
It happens.

283
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
It happens every day.

284
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,900
No, not here it didn't.

285
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,400
Emily...

286
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,600
Right now that's
exactly what happened.

287
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,400
Paul baleman's house...
That's what you'd expect

288
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,400
From someone who
was deeply depressed,
deeply traumatized.

289
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,800
Yeah, i know.
I saw it.

290
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,300
Everything past orderly,
everything present
disorderly.

291
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,900
The bookshelf,
the glass cabinet

292
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,500
All had order
when their lives had order,
had meaning.

293
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,100
Everything about beth's home
says she moved on.

294
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,300
Then how did she get up
there without a fight?

295
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,100
Whew... uh....

296
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,900
She was already dead.

297
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,200
Dead weight is a lot
heavier than alive.

298
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,200
Um...

299
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,700
Ok, well...

300
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,200
She can't believe
he's gonna spare the baby

301
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,900
If she does what she's told.

302
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,600
The question is,

303
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,300
How did he get in?

304
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,200
Beth must have let him in.

305
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,600
I mean, she had to.

306
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,500
They all let him in.

307
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,600
So she fixes them drinks,
he drugs her.

308
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,000
That's gotta be it.

309
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,400
Emily, the strange and great,
what can i do you for?

310
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,000
Hey, uh, i'm looking
for a drug

311
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,800
That would temporarily
paralyze or subdue someone,

312
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,700
Not kill them,
but give full control.

313
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
Well, i always use alcohol.
Less fuss, way cheaper.

314
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,500
Um, uh, look for something
that wouldn't show up
in a toxicology report.

315
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,000
Ok, got it.

316
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,800
Thank you.

317
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,100
Anything to tell us

318
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,000
Whether these are suicides
or not?

319
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,500
These are some samples
from diedre nollard,
the jumper.

320
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
See, we have
an insurance form,

321
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,300
A letter she wrote
to her neighbor
a month ago,

322
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,400
A birthday card she wrote
to her husband a week ago,

323
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,600
And her suicide note
as found on her body.

324
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Suicide note matches,
right?

325
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,100
Definitely by her own hand,

326
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,300
But she's professing
regret. Look.

327
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
"Uh, i'm sorry i let you down.

328
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,900
Please forgive me.
I disappointed you." And so on.

329
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,000
But the handwriting,

330
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,300
The forensic analysis
is saying the exact
opposite.

331
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,100
What do you mean?

332
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,500
Um... well, you see
how the handwriting slants uphill?

333
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,100
It's a clear sign
of optimism.

334
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,900
The same with how
the spacing
is so consistent.

335
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,700
And these long t-Bars...

336
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,600
Those indicate
an enthusiastic person.

337
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,700
Not someone
who would take a swan dive
off a 5-Story walkup.

338
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,400
Look, even if we had
alerted the media...

339
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Now we'll never know.

340
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,100
Like i said,
that's on me.

341
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,300
But, hey,
now we have the proof

342
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,000
That these aren't suicides.

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
Those notes,
were they coerced?

344
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
If you were to force someone
to write their own suicide note,

345
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,600
These are words
you generally wouldn't use.

346
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,900
I'll take that as a no.

347
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,200
And my brother's journal?

348
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
I haven't...
It's extensive. I haven't...

349
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Another no.

350
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
Can we inform the media now?

351
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,300
I have.

352
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,500
I need you all outside.

353
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,100
This is ssa aaron hotchner.

354
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
He's just arrived.

355
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
What have we got?

356
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,200
Including extended families,
over 100 individuals

357
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
Within the pittsburgh area
were affected by that fire.

358
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,400
So this unsub
is targeting grief, eh?

359
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,100
Grief?

360
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,000
An event.

361
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
A single event
in this unsub's life

362
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,300
Led him to end the life
of someone he believes
had to die.

363
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,900
From that moment on,
he created his own sense of morality...

364
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,200
What is right
and what is wrong...

365
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,900
And he rationalizes
what he did,

366
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,500
That first kill
over and over again,

367
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,100
By targeting people
that he believes
can't be saved

368
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,700
By anyone
other than himself.

369
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,500
He decides who lives
and who dies,

370
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,700
And this gives him
an all-Consuming
sense of power.

371
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,900
So they're not gonna stop
anytime soon.

372
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,100
Well, that's assuming
there's someone
to actually stop.

373
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,700
And if there is,

374
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,200
He's convinced he's
on a mission of mercy,

375
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,700
And even after he's caught,
he'll maintain
he did nothing wrong.

376
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,300
He.

377
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,200
White male, mid to late 30s,
he's polite, forthcoming,

378
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,700
Doesn't stand out.

379
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,700
And we believe his victims,
these families,

380
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Are all letting him in.

381
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,600
My brother and his wife
weren't letting anyone in.

382
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,700
If anything, they were
closing themselves off.

383
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,200
Well, this unsub
has found a way in,

384
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
One that's very hard to trace.

385
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,700
In every case
there was no evidence
of a struggle,

386
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,200
No attempt at escapes.

387
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,200
He finds
a personal connection
and uses it to buy time.

388
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,500
And my officers
need to know this.

389
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
We've found...

390
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,100
That angels of mercy

391
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,500
Are often people
in the medical profession,

392
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Cops.
As well as law enforcement.

393
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,200
Which is why
we're meeting out here.

394
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,600
Now, we're only fishing.
We don't want to point
a finger.

395
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,200
Point it.
I don't give a damn.

396
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
If that's
what it's about,

397
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,900
Let us figure out
where to point it.

398
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,400
I asked garcia to check into
emergency responders

399
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,900
Around the scene of the fire.

400
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,800
Good. Prentiss?

401
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,300
He's smart. He knows
all about these
people's schedules,

402
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,700
Their routines.

403
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,700
Look, if this unsub
does exist,

404
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,400
This is a guy
who's all about control.

405
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
He chooses how they die,
when they die.

406
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,200
He even positions them exactly
how he wants them to die.

407
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,600
That makes him
hypervigilant,

408
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,700
A guy who's always
on the lookout,
risk averse, unseen.

409
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
The only way to stop him

410
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Is to find out how
he's managed to get into
all of his victims' lives.

411
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,800
We find that out,
we've got our killer.

412
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,800
We can start
bringing people in,

413
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,400
Find the connection.

414
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,900
I haven't had a drink.

415
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,800
It's been 3 weeks...

416
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,100
4 days.

417
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,600
Some of you know
i lost my son... ben

418
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,800
In the fire.

419
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,600
A few of you
have pushed me

420
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
To go see
his little league games...

421
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,500
His old team.

422
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,700
He used to pitch.

423
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
But i gotta be honest,

424
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,000
I just haven't been
up for that.

425
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,100
I drive by every day.

426
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,900
I thought maybe today.

427
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,600
Maybe not.

428
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,600
I don't know.

429
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,800
Thank you for coming.

430
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
We're so sorry
about the loss of your son.

431
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,400
I'm sure you know
about the suicides

432
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,000
That have occurred
in shadyside over
the past 2 months.

433
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,900
We believe there's
a serial killer

434
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,300
Who is making it appear
as though his victims
were committing suicide.

435
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,500
Oh, my god.

436
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,900
And he's targeting
people

437
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,600
That were affected
by the fire.

438
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,200
Wh-What do you mean?

439
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,100
I mean, why would someone
do that?

440
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
He believes
he's an angel of mercy,

441
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,200
That he's actually
helping his victims move on.

442
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,000
Do you, uh, believe
we may know this person?

443
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,400
Yes, we do.

444
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,800
We just buried our daughter.

445
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,000
Yes, we know.

446
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,800
Whatever
his motivations are,

447
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,300
It's crucial we look into
every part of your life.

448
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,600
Oh, like he's done
or is doing, right?

449
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,400
Um, can you think of
anyone who might want...

450
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Might want to kill us?

451
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,800
They're just
doing their job.

452
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,800
He's a white male,
mid-30s.

453
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,900
He comes across
as very concerned,

454
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,000
Friendly, charming.

455
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,600
No.

456
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,700
I'm sorry.

457
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,300
If you need our help...

458
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,200
For anything.

459
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,100
Thank you.

460
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,800
Did you see her
with her son?

461
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,500
What?

462
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,500
She couldn't hold him.

463
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,700
She couldn't look at him.

464
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,400
Mind if i sit here?

465
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,200
Help yourself.

466
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,400
So you made it.

467
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,600
Yeah, i did.

468
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,400
Face what you fear the most.

469
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,800
Step 10... Continue to take
personal inventory.

470
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,900
Go ahead, hot stuff,
talk to me.

471
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,600
Hey, so,
prentiss was looking

472
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,100
For some narcotics,
my burning love hunk,

473
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,400
And i scored humongously.

474
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,100
I ran every toxicological panel
known to man on the victims

475
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,600
And came up with zilch,
which means he must be
knocking them out

476
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,100
With a neuromuscular agent.

477
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,500
With a what?

478
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
A paralytic.

479
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,700
Yeah, yeah. Something like
succinylcholine

480
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,900
Or vecuromium, one of those ones
that would metabolize
in the body so quickly,

481
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,000
It wouldn't be detectable.

482
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,700
Plus, plus, also,
and i called me up mr. Coroner

483
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,000
And said, how would you
do this?

484
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
And he says, by injection.

485
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,200
So i say, hey, guy,
wouldn't that leave a mark?

486
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,100
And he's all, "hold up."

487
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
And then he goes and looks
at beth smoler's body

488
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,800
And finds the mark.

489
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,500
A hole,
right in her hairline.

490
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,100
Ok, so you have to be
in the medical profession

491
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,800
To get ahold
of those drugs, right?

492
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,700
Not necessarily.

493
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,600
You can get almost anything
online these days.

494
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,100
This drug leaves no trace?

495
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,000
None.

496
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,800
Even if a coroner
was looking for something,

497
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,300
The evidence was gone.

498
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,300
And beth smoler
didn't see anything coming.

499
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,400
No, sir.
She completely saw it coming.

500
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,000
They all saw it coming.

501
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,500
Neuromuscular blockers
paralyze the muscles temporarily

502
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,900
While you remain
very much awake.

503
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He sedates them,
then quickly engineers
their suicide.

504
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,800
Well, if that's true,
it means this unsub's

505
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,900
Not looking for
the glory of the kill.

506
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,300
No, but unfortunately
for his victims,

507
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,800
They're wide awake
when he decides

508
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,500
It's time for them
to move on.

509
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,700
I know that feeling...

510
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,900
When is it ever
going to end?

511
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,500
The sadness,
it just goes on and on,

512
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,800
Every breathing moment.

513
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,300
And the pain,
it overwhelms you.

514
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,800
And if you could end it...

515
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,400
You would.

516
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,100
That's why when you
looked at me, curtis,

517
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,700
I knew in that moment
what you wanted of me.

518
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
What you wanted me to do.

519
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm only sorry
it took me this long.

520
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,000
But i'm here now.

521
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,600
You can let go, curtis.

522
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,700
I think we're ready now.

523
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,800
Yeah.

524
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
We're ready.

525
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,150
Wo
the barrel was placed
right there,

526
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,150
Under the chin,

527
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,150
He shoots,

528
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,850
And the bullet
went up through

529
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,150
The small and hard
palate of his mouth,

530
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,850
And then it exited
out through his--

531
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,250
Cranium. Check
the back of his head,

532
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,550
His hairline.

533
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,150
There. See it?

534
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,350
Oh, a puncture wound.

535
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,050
Made by a...
Needle.

536
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,450
Did he leave a note?

537
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,250
All right, rossi, i'm in.

538
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,350
We got ourselves an unsub.

539
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,550
They all have
the same type of tone.

540
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,750
It's uncanny.

541
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,050
And you're saying that
they all wrote these willingly.

542
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,150
None of them are forced,

543
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,150
But even here
in curtis fackler's,
he never says goodbye.

544
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,750
It's like they're
not meant for anybody,

545
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,550
Not for a wife,
not for a kid.

546
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,350
Then who are they
writing them to?

547
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,250
They're amends,
to themselves, and i...

548
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,350
I believe they're written
as part of a program.

549
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,850
Program?

550
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,250
The five stages of grief...

551
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,850
In some self-Help groups

552
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,850
They ask you to write down
an amends to yourself.

553
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,450
Is that right?

554
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,950
And all of these groups
are anonymous, right?

555
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,650
Well, just to give you
an idea of what we're
dealing with here,

556
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,350
Just for alcoholic
support groups for tonight,

557
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,250
Monday, there are... 91

558
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,550
Around pittsburg proper.

559
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,050
You gotta be kidding me.
That many?

560
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,150
They have different meetings
all day and night,

561
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,950
Different locations,
different degrees
of participation,

562
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,050
Of religiousness.

563
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,950
Ok, i've sent you
a schedule of meetings

564
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,350
For the major grief staples...

565
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,550
Alcohol, drugs,
depression, and loss...

566
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,250
All within a 2-Mile radius
of shadyside. There are 11.

567
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,450
Can we get
a list of names?

568
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,750
Why not?
No.

569
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,650
They're anonymous. That's how
he's been getting away with it.

570
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,150
Let's gather the troops.

571
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,050
We're gonna need
all the people you can spare.

572
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,150
You got it.

573
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,450
Can you think of anybody
who sticks out?

574
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,050
He's confident, earnest.

575
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,950
Mm-Mmm.

576
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,850
Hell, i mean, we're addicts.

577
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,650
Everyone sticks out
and no one sticks out,
you know?

578
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,250
We're just checking
all the different groups
in the area.

579
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,350
This is a really
private group.

580
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,450
Honestly, i don't think
i can help you.

581
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,350
And if i could, i wouldn't.

582
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,150
Even if it means
that one of the members
of your group

583
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,550
Might get killed?

584
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,050
This person has
a specific background,

585
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,250
A tragic event.

586
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,150
He would have felt
compelled to tell his story

587
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,150
And maybe he told it
time and time again.

588
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,250
That's about
90% of the group.

589
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,450
He might have
brought up suicide.

590
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,850
There has been a lot
of suicide talk lately.

591
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,450
Anyone come to mind?

592
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,850
You know, there was a guy

593
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,350
Who talked about
his brother's suicide.

594
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,550
It was pretty intense.

595
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,850
This guy stood up
and told a story
about his brother.

596
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,950
His family was so poor...

597
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,350
They shared the same bedroom
till they were 15.

598
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,050
We heard
the same story.

599
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,750
He's moving
from group to group,
repeating it.

600
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,750
He said his name was peter

601
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,950
And that his dad was a...

602
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,950
Professor at brassard,

603
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,650
And we were just kids.

604
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,450
Slept in separate beds.

605
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,950
And my father, he'd be
coming up the stairway...

606
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,650
And we'd hear this...
This creaking sound.

607
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,150
It was awful.

608
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,450
And then he would...

609
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,550
He would get in the bed
with james and...

610
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,850
Molest him.

611
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,950
The worst part of it
is that he pretended

612
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,850
To be asleep
when it happened.

613
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:57,350
If it's true, it could be
what started our unsub
on his mission of mercy.

614
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,150
It certainly
didn't end well,

615
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,850
At least not for james,
the older brother.

616
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,350
Then one night, i, uh...

617
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,850
I came into our room and...

618
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,650
Well, james
had slashed his wrists.

619
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,350
The sheets were covered
in his blood.

620
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,350
It was... It was everywhere.

621
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,750
And then he looked me
in the eye...

622
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,650
And i knew...

623
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,650
In that moment...

624
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:32,050
I knew... that i just
had to let him go.

625
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,350
Ok, so we've got two names...
James and peter.

626
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,750
And the university...
Brassard.

627
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,650
Well, that'll make it
easier for you, garcia.

628
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,950
If the unsub's father
really taught at brassard,

629
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,350
Chances are he's local.

630
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:47,850
Reid?

631
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,950
Angels of mercy,
they repeat the same event

632
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,250
Over and over again.

633
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,250
What are you getting at?

634
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,250
Well, if as you said,
the story's true,
then he's leaving

635
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,250
One key piece
of information out.

636
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,750
The event that started it all.

637
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,250
His brother didn't
kill himself.

638
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,150
Peter did.

639
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,550
The fire caused
such grief and suffering

640
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,050
That it became the trigger.

641
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,850
And unable to stop himself,

642
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,850
He targets someone
he believes needs his help.

643
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,250
At first he keeps to
some kind of timeline,

644
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,250
A few weeks,
but the last two kills
were within days.

645
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,550
He's devolving.

646
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,550
I got it.

647
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,850
It's from 1984.

648
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,250
It's the brassard college
university newspaper.

649
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,450
Garcia, they lived on campus?

650
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,050
Yeah.

651
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,150
It says here james redding
was the youngest suicide

652
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,550
In pennsylvanian history.

653
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,950
And his father charles redding
was a professor. Creep.

654
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,450
Is there any possibility

655
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,350
That while
we've been talking,

656
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,850
You've been multitasking?

657
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,350
What, track down
his current address?

658
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,150
Ha ha. I love you,
penelope garcia.

659
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,450
Ha. Get in line.

660
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,150
Clear!

661
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,250
We're clear!

662
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,050
Clear!
Clear!

663
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,250
We need to work fast.

664
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,250
There's meetings taking place
all over the city.

665
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,350
At least
with your guys and ours,

666
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,150
His chances
are next to zero, right?

667
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,550
He's got away with it
this far.

668
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,750
Guys.

669
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,050
You might want
to take a look at this.

670
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,150
He's crossed off the names
of beth smoler
and curtis fackler,

671
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,250
The last two victims.

672
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,350
It's a grid
of all the support groups.

673
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:31,850
Times, dates.
Got a list of names
of all those in the meetings.

674
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,050
They all have a type.

675
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,350
Alcoholic, narcotic,

676
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,750
Depression, divorce.
Man, this guy
kept himself busy.

677
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,950
Hey. Laurie ann morris.

678
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,750
We spoke to her
and her husband.

679
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,750
Her name's not crossed off
like the others.

680
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,750
Hi, my name is laurie ann.

681
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,450
Hi, laurie ann.

682
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,900
She's not answering
her cell phone.

683
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,100
The husband's
already left for work.

684
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,500
I'm calling his cell now.

685
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,300
Jonathan, hello.
This is agent emily prentiss
from the fbi.

686
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,100
Is your wife laurie ann
with you?

687
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,100
Can you tell us where
she is right now?

688
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,800
Got it.

689
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,700
Rough day?

690
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,300
You don't have to
answer that.

691
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,600
Oh, tried to quit.

692
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,700
Can't quite
seem to do it.

693
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,700
Maybe now's not the time.

694
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
Right.

695
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,600
You'll know when it is.

696
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,700
You have good intuition.

697
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
And i can see that.

698
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,400
I'm late.
Nice to meet you.

699
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,500
You, too.

700
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,100
Oh...

701
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,900
Excuse me, sir.
We're looking for either one
of these people.

702
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,200
Have either of you
seen them?

703
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,500
You sure?

704
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,500
All right, let's split up

705
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,000
And search the building
and the surrounding area.

706
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,700
This way, guys.

707
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,600
Laurie ann morris.
Have you seen her?

708
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,100
Please, look close.
She was here.
Are you sure?

709
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,500
Excuse me.

710
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,300
Have either of you
seen these people?

711
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,700
All right, thank you.

712
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,900
Expired.
Triple-A?

713
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,700
I'll figure something out.

714
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,900
She was here
a minute ago.

715
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,800
Where'd she go?

716
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Maybe the parking lot.

717
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,700
Was she alone?

718
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,400
She was talking
to some guy.

719
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,400
Thank you.

720
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,100
Parking lot?

721
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,200
Other side
of the building.

722
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,500
How many exits
does it have?

723
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,100
3. North, east,
and west side.

724
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,600
All right, split up
and cover each one.

725
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,900
Morgan,
you come with us.

726
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,900
Where are you going?

727
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,700
Please, it's no bother.

728
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,700
Where?

729
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,100
Main street.

730
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,300
I'm just going
to meet a friend.

731
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,000
Just hop in the back.

732
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Blue chevy.
Do you know what kind
of car she has?

733
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
Wait.

734
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,200
I can help you.

735
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,700
Help me how?

736
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,600
With the pain of not even
being able to hold your son.

737
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
You think
you can help me?

738
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,500
Yes.

739
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,600
You just have to let go.

740
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,200
It's over there.

741
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,800
Is that what you did
for all those people?

742
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,600
Laurie ann!

743
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,800
Yes. I did
what they couldn't.

744
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You think
you can help me?

745
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,100
Laurie ann!

746
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,800
<i>You think
you can help me?</i>

747
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,400
Yes.

748
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,800
Laurie ann!

749
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,500
What are you doing?

750
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,200
Laurie ann!

751
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,800
Morgan: put your hands
where i can see them!

752
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,200
I'm going around!

753
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,900
Show me your hands!

754
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Ok. Don't move.
We've got help coming.

755
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,300
Morgan: do it now!

756
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,500
Yeah.
You got him?

757
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,400
I don't understand
what's going on.

758
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,000
Here.

759
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,100
Ow! Ow!

760
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,700
What's going on

761
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,800
Is you just took
your last breath
as a free man.

762
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,500
Shut up.
I've done nothing wrong.

763
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,800
Ow! Ow!

764
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Ow. Uh...

765
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,600
Hi.

766
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,000
You're gonna be ok.

767
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,700
Am i?

768
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,100
Laurie ann...

769
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,300
A mother isn't supposed
to outlive her children.

770
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah.

771
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,500
But she's gone.

772
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,100
Allie's dead.

773
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,900
Please. I don't...
care anymore.

774
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,800
But your son does.

775
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,500
Don't lose him as well.

776
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,200
I wanted to thank you
for all you did

777
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,800
And for believing me
when no one else did.

778
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,100
Ron....

779
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,100
Thank you.

780
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,000
Paul's journal...
I read it.

781
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,900
Ronnie, your brother paul
wasn't murdered.

782
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,200
In peter's apartment,

783
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,400
Unlike all the other
victims,

784
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,800
Paul's name
was nowhere to be found.

785
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,900
I... I don't understand.

786
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,100
You said the psychological
autopsy was inconclusive.

787
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,200
Further analysis
of the journal concludes
it was suicide.

788
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,500
I'm sorry.

789
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,800
You're wrong.

790
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,200
But like i said,
thanks for coming.

791
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,100
"the most
authentic thing about us

792
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,300
"Is our capacity
to create, to overcome,

793
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,900
"To endure, to transform,

794
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,100
To love, and to be greater
than our suffering."

795
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,400
Ben okri.

796
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,800
How did it go with jack?

797
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,200
I just told him
that i wasn't going
to be around as much.

798
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,700
How did he take it?

799
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,500
He gave me a hug
and he said that everything
was gonna be all right.

800
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,400
Smart kid.

801
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,600
Like his dad.

802
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,500
So tell me,

803
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,800
Back at the house,

804
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,900
When we found beth smoler.

805
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,300
I don't know.
Sometimes i just wonder...

806
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,200
If we're actually
changing anything.

807
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Do you know why
i have 4 properties?

808
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,200
Tell me.

809
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,500
If i'm not kicking down doors,
i'm smashing down walls.

810
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,900
At the end of the day,

811
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,600
They both make me feel
like i'm changing something.

812
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,300
For the better.

813
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,100
Good enough?

814
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,700
Good enough.

815
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:28,400
