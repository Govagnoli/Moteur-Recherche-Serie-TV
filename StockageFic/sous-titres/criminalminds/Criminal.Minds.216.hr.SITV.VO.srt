1
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Ken, go home.

2
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,200
Sandra, wait.
What ?

3
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,100
Just talk to me
for a second, ok ?

4
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,100
I can't.

5
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,400
Please ?

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,900
Fine.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What ?

8
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
I just want to know
where you're going.

9
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,300
It's none of your business.
Why ?

10
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,900
Because I'm not
your girlfriend.

11
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,500
What, are you too good for me now ?

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,200
I gotta go.
That's him ?

13
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Ken, don't !

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,300
Ken, stop !

15
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,900
Ken, don't !

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
Who the hell
are you ?

17
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,300
Ken !

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,500
Oh, my god.

19
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
What are you doing ?
That's my ex-Boyfriend.

20
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,600
Get in.

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,900
Oh, no, please !

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
Ow !  Ohh...

23
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,200
Good morning, emily.

24
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,200
Have a good weekend ?

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,200
Yeah.  No.

26
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,300
Yes.

27
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,800
Ha ha.
Oh, I've been there.

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,700
No, it wasn't--
Ugh.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,600
I don't want
to get into it.

30
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,700
No problem.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,200
It...  It just
feels weird for me

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,300
To talk about my personal life here, you know ?

33
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,300
I don't really know
you guys all that well yet.

34
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,400
I totally get that.

35
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,100
I think I totally
screwed up this date.

36
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,400
Ok.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
What happened ?
You have to understand,

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm a nerd.

39
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,700
Like, seriously.

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,700
And I can fool people for days,

41
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,900
Weeks even.

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,700
But sooner or later,
I blow my cover

43
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,100
And I say something so geeky.

44
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,400
And then he doesn't respond,

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,600
And I lose all confidence.

46
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,800
What did you say ?

47
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,000
"Kilgore trout. "

48
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,100
Guy has a problem
with kurt vonnegut ?

49
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,400
You know kilgore trout ?

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,000
<i>I read slaughterhouse-Five
when I was 12 and it blew my mind.</i>

51
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,000
Seriously, I couldn't get enough.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,300
So I just kept going
and I read 'em all.

53
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,500
Yeah, yeah.  Me, too.

54
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,900
<i>What's your favorite ?
Oh, mother night.</i>

55
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,100
The one about
the american spy.

56
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,000
Who pretends to be a nazi.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,500
"You are who you pretend to be. "

58
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,000
"So be careful
who you pretend to be. "

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,700
Oh, my god.  I can't believe
you're a vonnegut fan.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,200
You just made my day.

61
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,100
Anytime.

62
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,500
Conference room
in 5 minutes, please ?

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Got it.

64
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,100
Sandra davis, 16 years old.

65
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,000
This is her singing at her high
school talent show a month ago.

66
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,600
This is her on-Again,
off-Again boyfriend

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,700
Ken newcombe.

68
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,600
Their bodies were found
in a park

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,700
Near the male victim's car
in groton,

70
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,600
An affluent,
mostly white suburb

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,700
Of new york city
in westchester county.

72
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,900
It's the third
of 3 killings

73
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,800
Believed to be a series
of hate crimes.

74
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Hate crimes ?

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
The first 2 victims were keisha andrews, 15,

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
And vickie williams, 17.

77
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,200
They disappeared from their homes
in central westchester one night.

78
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Their bodies were found
in a wooded area

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
In a southern part
of the county near the city.

80
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,100
?  ?  ?

81
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,000
And this was painted
on their faces.

82
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,300
what about this couple ?

83
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,300
How were their bodies found ?

84
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,700
Another swastika.

85
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,400
This one
on the boyfriend's car.

86
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,400
It's a different
victimology.

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
Maybe just
an escalation.

88
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,700
or a different killer.

89
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,800
and it doesn't end there.

90
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Yesterday an african-American
community leader,

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A reverend williams,

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,300
Decided to take this on
as a political issue.

93
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Racial hate in the suburbs.

94
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,200
what we are seeing is pure apathy.

95
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,000
Black kids
are getting killed

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
And the police
are doing nothing to stop it.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,500
When will these racists
be confronted ?

98
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,200
Apparently, in response
to reverend williams' muckraking,

99
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,000
A black kid was beaten
on the streets of groton this afternoon.

100
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,700
Connecticut neo-Nazi group

101
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,100
Called the white stallions
claimed responsibility.

102
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,600
There are neo-Nazi groups
in connecticut ?

103
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,700
The mayor of groton
called me this morning, frantic.

104
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,500
?  ?  ?  Rate
to solve these crimes

105
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,100
Before it escalates even more.

106
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,800
What are the racial demographics of groton ?

107
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
Population 42,000.  8% black.

108
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,600
I'd say the mayor
has reason to be worried.

109
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,500
If it doesn't stop soon, it could flare up  ?

110
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
"from the deepest desires

111
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
"Often come
the deadliest hate. "

112
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,500
Socrates.

113
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,200
New York,
New York.

114
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,500
Too bad we're flying straight to the suburbs.

115
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,300
Hey, this is weird.

116
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,500
?  ?  ?

117
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,800
?  ?  ?

118
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,500
But no sign
of sexual assault.  So...

119
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Why would the unsub
use a date-Rape drug

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,900
To commit
a hate crime ?

121
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,800
Maybe he wants
to weaken them so they can't fight back.

122
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,900
But there was
no g. H. B.

123
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,800
In the victims
of the double homicide.

124
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,900
There's a lot that's different
about the double homicide.

125
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,300
The question is why.

126
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,100
All right, we just got
new information.

127
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,700
A few weeks before the murder

128
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,200
Of sandra davis
and ken newcombe,

129
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,500
A threatening letter
was delivered to sandra davis' door.

130
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,000
She showed it
to her parents,

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,400
Who then notified
the police.

132
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,000
The police never figured out
who wrote it.

133
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,900
"We see ken with you
and it makes us sick.

134
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
"Take care to stop this now,

135
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,300
"Or you will pay.

136
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,900
If you tell anyone about this,
you will pay. "

137
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,200
Strange.
Doesn't seem real.

138
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,000
What do you mean ?

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
First of all,
the use of "we"
in a threat this direct

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,100
Is almost always bogus.

141
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,800
One individual trying to
diffuse responsibility.

142
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,900
Also, the message itself
seems contradictory.

143
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,300
On the one hand,
"take care to stop this now,

144
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,400
Or you will pay" ?

145
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,600
Presumably, they want them
to stop seeing each other.  But then,

146
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,000
On the other hand, they don't want
them to go public with it.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,500
"If you tell anyone about this,
you will pay. "

148
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
The point of hate crimes
is to increase publicity,

149
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,600
Not decrease it.
It's like terrorism.

150
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,700
An effective threat let's everybody
know that they're in danger

151
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,100
If they do this behavior.

152
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,600
The author would want sandra
to tell people about the note.

153
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,000
Doesn't sound like a guy
who's actually prepared to kill.

154
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,000
Actually, it... doesn't sound
like a guy at all.

155
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,300
"Take care to stop this"

156
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,600
Implies empathy.

157
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
"Take care" ?

158
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,800
Males don't use
this type of language,

159
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,900
Especially when
they're trained to threaten somebody.

160
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,600
This message
is certainly written by a female,

161
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,700
And based on the lack
of psychological sophistication,

162
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,800
I'd say it's most likely
an adolescent.

163
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,100
You think a girl
killed these kids ?

164
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,000
I think a girl
wrote this note.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,500
Let's call that
mystery number one.

166
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,700
You got a number 2 ?

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Maybe.

168
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Says here the autopsy
on sandra davis was inconclusive.

169
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,500
She suffered blunt force trauma to the face,

170
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,100
She had some bruising
around her neck.

171
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,400
Cause of death
is still unclear.  Coroner's working on it.

172
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,500
A lot of questions.

173
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,100
Let's get started
on some answers.

174
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,500
?  ?  ?  ?

175
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,300
Agent jareau,
gregory hughes.

176
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,700
Mayor hughes.
Yes.

177
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,000
This is detective rick ware

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,700
From the state police department.

179
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,000
We haven't had a murder here
in 2 years, you understand.

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,500
This was way above our heads.

181
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,200
So we put rick in charge.

182
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,800
These are agents
gideon, hotchner,

183
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,000
Morgan, and prentiss.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,200
I have to say that what's been
happening here the last few weeks

185
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
Is...  It's just hard to fathom.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
I mean, we're 30 minutes
from the city.

187
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,000
What do you mean ?

188
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,400
Well, this isn't the de south.

189
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,600
For the most part, these are
sophisticated new yorkers.

190
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,500
Are you saying
you don't think this is a race issue ?

191
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,400
All we're saying is
whatever happened here

192
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Is way out of the norm
for this community.

193
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,000
I wouldn't want you
entering this investigation

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Under assumptions
that...  Well, aren't true.

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,900
Fact is, we don't know
what this is about yet.

196
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,400
We need to concentrate
on the double murder

197
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,300
And make sure
that it's the same killer, first of all.

198
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,700
You mean there could be
more than one ?

199
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
We don't know that yet.

200
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,600
All we do know is the threat sent
to sandra davis

201
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,000
Was written
by an adolescent girl.

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
You can tell that
just from a half a page note ?

203
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,200
It's pretty straightforward
profiling.

204
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,200
Is there a problem, officer ?

205
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,300
Uh, there was a girl
that we suspected at first,

206
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,400
But then
we talked to her and dismissed her.

207
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I'd like to meet her.

208
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,000
I think it's a waste of time.

209
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,800
I'd like to decide that for myself.

210
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,800
Sandra showed us
the note 2 weeks before she was killed.

211
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,400
We asked around the school for who might have

212
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,200
A grudge against sandra and ken.

213
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,000
The only girl's name
that came up was tonya mathis.

214
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,100
Rumor was ken dumped her
for sandra,

215
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,400
Although ken told me

216
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,500
Tonya was never his girlfriend.

217
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,100
You said you talked to tonya about the note.

218
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
What'd she say ?

219
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,700
She swore up and down
she had nothing to do with it.

220
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,300
I find it pretty hard to believe
she'd write a racist note.

221
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,100
Why's that ?

222
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
See for yourself.

223
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,800
That's tonya ?

224
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,900
In the flesh.

225
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,200
Leave her in there
for a few minutes.

226
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
You're gonna make
a 17-Year-Old girl sweat ?

227
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,600
I want
to scare the hell out of her.

228
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,600
?  ?  ?

229
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,200
Did these kids live
near here ?

230
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Sandra davis lived
about 1/2 mile west.

231
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,000
Ken newcombe
about a mile east.

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,200
What were they doing here ?

233
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,800
When I was a kid, I used to hang
out in the park at night,

234
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,400
Drink beers, hook up
with a girl.

235
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,600
Maybe, but I don't think
these two were out on a date.

236
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,100
Why do you say that ?

237
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,300
Well, as ken
was wearing a sweatshirt and tennis shoes,

238
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,400
Sandra was wearing a dress,

239
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
High heels, and makeup.

240
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,200
She was definitely dressed to go out.

241
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,300
Ken's body was found here ?

242
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,200
Yeah.  And sandra here.

243
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
But from the bloodstains,

244
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,000
It was obvious that she was killed there

245
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,900
And then dragged here.

246
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,200
So the unsub
shot ken first,

247
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,000
Sandra started
to run and he chased her down.

248
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,100
Beat her and strangled her.

249
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,900
He had a gun, why didn't he shoot her, too ?

250
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,000
He could overpower her,

251
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,800
Maybe he didn't think he could overpower ken.

252
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,400
No, it's more than that.

253
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
The killer took the time
and risked her escaping

254
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,200
To track her down
and strangle her with his bare hands.

255
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,900
He was completely focused on her.

256
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,300
Sandra didn't have
a date with ken.

257
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,700
She had a date
with the unsub.

258
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,800
Hello, tonya.

259
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm agent morgan,
this is agent prentiss.

260
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We're with the f. B. I.

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,200
F. B. I.  ?

262
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,200
I'm gonna get
right to the point.

263
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
Writing a threat like this ?

264
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,000
It's a federal crime.

265
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,300
I told him
I didn't write that note.

266
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,600
Oh, I know
what you told him.

267
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,300
But this is not
the principal's office,you understand ?

268
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,700
The people you threatened are dead.

269
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,300
I didn't kill anybody.

270
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,100
I know that.

271
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,400
I got it.

272
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,100
But we need to know
why you wrote that note.

273
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,000
You were angry with ken

274
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,000
Because he didn't
acknowledge you.

275
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,200
I get it.

276
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,400
He didn't admit
that you were his girlfriend.

277
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,700
I was his girlfriend.

278
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,500
Yeah.

279
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,300
What about sandra ?

280
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,500
She's the one
who got the note.

281
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
Why were you
so angry with her, tonya ?

282
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,400
Oh, this isn't
just about her going with ken,

283
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,600
Is it, tonya ?

284
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,300
That note says "we. "

285
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,700
You wanted to make it look like
other people were in on it.

286
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,400
Like the whole town
was against her. Why ?

287
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,300
Is that the way
she made you feel ?

288
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,100
Like everybody
was against you ?

289
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,800
It was that stupid
talent show.

290
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,100
What talent show ?

291
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,500
I was just as good as her.

292
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,800
She was just
this quiet little girl who nobody liked.

293
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,600
Then she sings,
and suddenly she's all little miss popular,

294
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,800
And ken's all over her.

295
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,600
It's not fair.

296
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,800
So, tonya...

297
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,500
Look at me.

298
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,900
You wrote this note
for revenge, didn't you ?

299
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,600
I know it was stupid.

300
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,900
But I just wanted
to scare them.

301
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,800
I'm sorry.

302
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
We called tonya's family
and friends.

303
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
We're checking her out,
but...

304
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
That girl
didn't kill those kids.

305
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,800
It's how you've had to learn.

306
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,000
anybody seen reid ?

307
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,400
Where's reid ?

308
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,300
Coroner's report.

309
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,100
"Victim had been beaten
so extensively,

310
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,700
"The cause of death
was indeterminate.

311
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,100
Post-Mortem stab wounds
were also discovered. "

312
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,400
Post-Mortem stabs, huh ?

313
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,500
What ?

314
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,400
Post-Mortem stab wounds
almost always indicate sexual homicide.

315
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,800
Uh, this is also
a fairly extreme overkill,

316
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,700
Which is markedly different
from the other 2 girls.

317
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,000
So you're saying
this was a different killer.

318
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,500
No, we're saying
if it was the same killer,

319
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,900
The overkill indicates he didn't get
what he wanted from someone...

320
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,200
?  ?  ?

321
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,700
Derek: sexual predators kill
for sexual needs.

322
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,200
And in this case, there's no sign
of sexual assault on his victims.

323
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
That tells us
that he probably fetishises.

324
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,100
Takes some souvenir
from his victims that

325
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,100
He uses to get off.

326
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,200
Correct me if I'm wrong,

327
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,100
?  ?  ?  Like the m. O.
Of a hate crime.

328
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,200
No, we're pretty certain
that hate

329
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,800
Wasn't the primary motive at all.

330
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,000
He has a specific
physical type

331
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,900
And he tries
to cover his tracks.

332
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,600
He is a serial killer.

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,500
Hi.
Hi, naomi.

334
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,600
It's nice
to see you again.  Hop in.

335
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,800
Thanks.

336
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,000
Thanks for picking me up.

337
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,600
?  ?  ?

338
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,200
Reverend williams: and when
did the f. B. I.  Finally arrive ?

339
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,500
Only after a white boy
was killed.

340
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,100
We cannot rely
on the police.

341
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,600
We must protect ourselves.

342
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,500
Let the people
who are taking our daughters

343
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,700
Know they will not
get away with this.

344
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,000
That's enough.

345
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,200
Explain this to me.

346
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,700
The swastikas
on the bodies.

347
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,200
What do they mean ?

348
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,400
They're a distraction.

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,900
Hotch: perhaps
this killer isn't driven by hate,

350
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,900
But he wants us
to think so

351
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,100
So we won't guess
his real motive,

352
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,700
Which is serial
sexual homicide.

353
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,900
I'm confident the unsub's
from this county.

354
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,200
He knew
the kind of hysteria

355
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,000
That would flare up
from these swastikas.

356
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,200
Reverend williams
took the bait.

357
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,700
Judge is trying
to buy us some time.

358
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,900
She's talking
to the reverend to see

359
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,600
If he'll cool
his rhetoric a little bit.

360
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,100
Hate crimes are political.

361
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,400
If we're right,

362
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,100
This was personal.

363
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,700
Well, we need to confirm
that the double homicide

364
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,300
Is linked
to the first 2 murders.

365
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,700
We need to speak
to the families of the victims.

366
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,900
We know how difficult
this is for you.

367
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,700
Thanks for talking
to us.

368
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,700
She just disappeared
that night.

369
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,100
I know she must
have just walked out the front door,

370
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,800
But I thought
we'd hear that.

371
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,000
What about the window
in your daughter's bedroom ?

372
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,500
She couldn't have climbed out there.

373
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,900
It's been painted shut
for years.

374
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,100
No, it hasn't.

375
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
What are you talking
about, bree ?

376
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,400
I fixed it
so I could get out.

377
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,800
You've been sneaking
out in the middle of the night ?

378
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,800
I'm sorry.

379
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
You're not in trouble.

380
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
But just tell me,

381
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,700
Did she sneak out before ?

382
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,000
No, I swear.

383
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,800
She always told me
not to do it.

384
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,600
She was the good one.

385
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,300
She didn't deserve this.

386
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,900
Nobody deserves this.

387
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,400
Your daughter liked to sing ?

388
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,300
We dug up everything
on the first 2 victims,

389
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,800
And basically these girls
were good students

390
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Who stayed out of trouble.

391
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,200
Just like sandra davis.

392
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,300
And we found something else.
They both liked to sing.

393
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,800
One in church,
and one in a band.

394
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,400
Their parents said
that this was their passion.

395
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,800
Just like sandra davis.

396
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,700
African-American girls

397
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,000
Between the ages
of 15 and 17 who like to sing ?

398
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,800
That's a pretty
specific type.

399
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,200
Sounds like
the same unsub to me.

400
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,900
And the fact
that they all sing,

401
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,000
That could be part of his m. O.

402
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,400
Maybe part of a ruse.

403
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,000
Another girl went missing.

404
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,600
A naomi dade.
16 years old.

405
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,900
When ?
Last night.

406
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,700
Why are we just
finding out about it now ?

407
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,200
First victims
weren't found for a couple of days,

408
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,500
There's a chance
she's still alive.

409
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,700
Let's get to the profile
before it's too late.

410
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,300
Girl, on tape:
hey, I'm naomi.

411
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,000
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

412
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,300
?  ?  ?  ?

413
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,400
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

414
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Suspect we're looking for
is a black male,

415
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,000
Statistically between
the ages of 20 and 35.

416
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,500
We know he's black
because of his victims.

417
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,000
Sexually motivated killers
almost always kill

418
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Within their own race.

419
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
The victims he's chosen
are good girls.

420
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,800
They're good students.

421
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,400
No behavioral problems.

422
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,000
They're what we call
"low-Risk. "

423
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,600
And the lower the risk
of the victim,

424
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,700
The higher the intelligence
of the unsub.

425
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
Guy's a smooth talker.

426
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,300
Makes people feel
at ease.  Gains their confidence.

427
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,700
You'd be amazed
what these guys can talk people into.

428
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,800
Jeffrey dahmer
was once pulled over by police officers

429
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,500
For driving over
the center line.

430
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
He'd thrown the garbage bag
full of body parts

431
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,700
In the back seat
of his car,

432
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,000
But he was so calm
and so self assured,

433
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,100
That he convinced the officers
not to look in the bag.

434
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,200
He then went on to kill
at least 15 more people.

435
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
This guy's a hustler.

436
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,900
He may not have
a lot of education,

437
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,200
But he knows how to treat
impressionable young girls.

438
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,500
Victor paleologus
used to troll shopping malls

439
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,300
Pretending to be
a movie producer.

440
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,700
He told kristine johnson

441
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,400
For a james bond movie.

442
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,900
And that was the last time
she was ever seen alive.

443
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,300
We think that because
all these girls are singers,

444
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,300
That the unsub
may be connected in some way

445
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,600
To the recording industry.

446
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,200
We know the unsub
has a vehicle.

447
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,400
Big enough to transport a body.

448
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,800
It's clean.

449
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,300
It's not too old.

450
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,000
Nice enough
to make a girl feel comfortable inside,

451
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But it's not flashy.
This is not a guy

452
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,400
Who wants to attract
attention to himself.

453
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,300
Probably a large,
dark sedan.

454
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,900
We recommend
putting this profile on the news,

455
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,300
The paper, anywhere
it might be seen by the people in this town.

456
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
This guy's ruse
didn't work on everybody.

457
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,600
Somewhere out there
is at least one woman

458
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,900
Who didn't fall
for his game, and...

459
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,900
That's who
we need to find.

460
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,600
The key to this unsub's
psychology

461
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
Is the souvenir he takes.

462
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,600
We don't know
what it is yet, but...

463
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,500
We know that
once he has it,

464
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,700
His victim tn becomes
disposable,

465
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,800
And that's when he kills her.

466
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
The unsub's ritual
was interrupted

467
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,200
When he killed
sandra davis.

468
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,500
We don't believe
he was able to take a souvenir from her.

469
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,800
We think he may
revisit her house

470
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,600
Or any place
she may have frequented.

471
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,700
We recommend surveillance
in locations

472
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,800
Where the unsub
might approach young girls.

473
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,200
Churches, high schools,

474
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,000
Libraries, coffee shops.

475
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,700
Stick with the community.

476
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
The people of this county

477
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,400
Should be able
to offer some good leads.

478
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,100
Thanks a lot.
Good luck.

479
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,100
Gid...

480
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,500
Whoa.  Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

481
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,400
You think
community vigilance will be enough ?

482
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
If it were,
we'd be out of a job.

483
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,100
I'm telling you not to do your job.  Jason.

484
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,000
Just want to make sure
that we don't get ahead of ourselves.

485
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,900
What's he doing ?

486
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,300
So please
just sit tight one more minute.

487
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,300
What's the problem ?

488
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,400
Well, the problem
is I would have to be crazy

489
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
To release this profile to the public.

490
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,200
What are you talking about ?

491
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,700
Reverend williams
has already stirred up enough trouble

492
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
By choosing
to make this town a soapbox

493
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,100
For his anti-Racism
campaign.

494
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,500
What do you think
is gonna happen if I go to the press

495
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,800
And tell them
the killer is black ?

496
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,300
Hey.  The best way
to stop all this is to find that killer.

497
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,800
And we just gave you
the best way to do that.

498
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Right.  By telling everybody
to look out

499
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,100
For an anonymous black man ?

500
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,300
They're gonna say
that's racial profiling.

501
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,500
It's not
racial profiling.

502
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,800
Racial profiling
is targeting suspects because of their race.

503
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,200
We gave you
a complete profile which includes race.

504
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
All right, look.
The point is

505
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,400
I've never even heard
of a black serial killer.

506
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,600
And neither have
all the african-Americans in this community

507
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,900
Already upset
by what's been happening here.

508
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,500
You can believe
in black serial killers or not,

509
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,000
But the fact is
they do exist.

510
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,200
And it's only a matter of time
before he kills another girl.

511
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,700
All right, look.
I am not interested in debating this.

512
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,500
Detective ware
is more than capable

513
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,700
Of heading
this investigation.

514
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
You gonna let this happen ?

515
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,900
Let what happen ?
Make every black man

516
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,800
In this county a target ?

517
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,600
Rick.  What ?

518
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
We found naomi dade's body.

519
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,600
Damn it.

520
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,200
We got a mass
of reporters out there.

521
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
What's it gonna be, detective ?

522
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,600
Please.

523
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,500
Let us help you.

524
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,800
Finally, I want to assure you
we considered all options,

525
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,200
<i>And we're certain this is
the best course of action.</i>

526
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,100
Thank you.

527
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,100
Detective, I think you made the right choice.

528
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,300
I hope this doesn't
come back to bite us in the ass.

529
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,400
Why would it ?

530
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,500
Why ?  Last thing I need
is to spread fear

531
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,400
That a dangerous
black man running around this county.

532
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,400
Hotch: best way to solve
your problem is to stay focused

533
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
On what we need to do
to catch this guy.

534
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,800
Tell me.

535
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,300
Tell me what to do.

536
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,800
We need to get
the word out...

537
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Not just on the news.

538
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,500
We need to talk to
these kids face to face.

539
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,100
Gotta give them
the profile.

540
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,000
What about the talent show
that sandra davis sang in at her high school,

541
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,400
That could be
where the unsub saw her sing.

542
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
That's a good idea.
Talk to the kids at her high school.

543
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,600
Set up a tip line.
Yeah, you got it.

544
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,900
Well, I hate waiting around.
So, what do you say, ware ?

545
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
Want to join the patrols ?

546
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,700
Get back on the street ?
Pretend to be a beat cop again ?

547
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,500
Yeah.

548
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,700
Beats waiting around
here for more bodies, don't it ?

549
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,200
Let's do it.

550
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,500
Tips have just started
to come in.

551
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,300
So far, we have fingers pointed
at a minister...

552
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
You don't have to do this.

553
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,400
A janitor
at his school, and...

554
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,100
Oh !
The reverend jesse jackson.

555
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,300
Is anything useful ?

556
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,200
Not so much.
Keep diggin'.

557
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Hey, uh, I got someone
who remembers seeing

558
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
A black guy they didn't
recognize driving around in a black lincoln

559
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,800
In front of our last victim's
house yesterday.

560
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,500
That's the second sighting
for that vehicle.

561
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,200
It fits the profile...
Large, dark sedan.

562
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,900
Include it
in the press release.

563
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,700
Yeah.

564
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,100
Yeah, I got it.

565
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,700
suspect may be
driving a black town car.

566
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,600
May be ?

567
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,900
It's something.

568
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,900
No, I'm good.

569
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,900
For what it's worth, um...

570
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,900
Took balls to stand up
to the mayor like that.

571
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,400
You would've done
the same thing.

572
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,500
I don't have to work
for the guy.

573
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,000
I know that was
a tough decision.

574
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,000
Don't you ever wish
it didn't matter ?

575
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,900
It ?

576
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,300
Color.

577
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,300
Hmph.

578
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,300
Judge me by the content
of my character.

579
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,000
I mean, why does it
even have to be part of the equation ?

580
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
People are dying.
We need to get the bad guy.

581
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,700
That should be it.

582
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,200
No half-Cocked reverends
running around,

583
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,000
Getting people mad
about the wrong thing.

584
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,000
No mayors so afraid of
offending black folks,

585
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,100
He doesn't even want
to tell the community what to look out for.

586
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,500
It's exhausting
sometimes.

587
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,700
It's the way
it's always been, man.

588
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,900
Politicians,
community leaders...  They do what they do.

589
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,100
You and me...
We do what we do.

590
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,900
We're the foot soldiers
in these streets getting the job done.

591
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Hmph.  Foot soldiers.

592
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,300
Right.

593
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,300
Only ones
who ever really get results,

594
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,200
You know what I'm sayin' ?

595
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,900
Ware.

596
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,400
Right there.

597
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,600
It's a black town car.

598
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, just a few blocks
from sandra davis' house.

599
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
He's turning right.

600
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,700
Turn right here.

601
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,500
There it is.

602
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,500
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

603
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,700
Nothin'.

604
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,000
You hear that ?

605
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,300
Ware.  Yeah.

606
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,300
It's a false alarm.
It's just a car service.

607
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,200
All right.  I'll be right out.

608
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,600
I got him !
I got him !

609
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,200
What the hell are you doing ?  !

610
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,000
Freeze !
Put down your weapon.

611
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,100
The cops, damn it.
I'm f. B. I.

612
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,400
What ?
Listen to me.  Do not shoot.

613
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,100
I'm gonna reach
in my back pocket and grab my wallet.

614
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,000
All right ?

615
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,600
All right ?  !

616
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm f. B. I. , man.

617
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
I didn't know.

618
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,700
Give me your gun.

619
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,000
Give me your gun !

620
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,700
Call 9-1-1.
This man needs help.

621
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,900
Go !  Call 9-1-1 !

622
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,600
Ware, nah, nah, nah.
Come on, man.

623
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,500
Nah.  Hey.  Look at me.
Look at me.

624
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,400
Ware, you're going
to be all right.

625
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,600
I'll get you some help, ware.

626
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,300
Talk to me.

627
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,000
Hey, just talk to me.
I'm right here.

628
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,200
Tell me about
that family of yours.

629
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Huh ?  You got
2 kids, right ?

630
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,500
Yeah.  I saw
those pictures in your car.

631
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,000
What's your
little one's name ?

632
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,400
Huh ?

633
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,200
D-Dwayne.

634
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,000
Dwayne.
All right, that's good.

635
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,600
That's good.  Come on.
I got you, man.

636
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,100
You ain't going nowhere.

637
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,300
All right ?  All right ?

638
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,300
Tell me about dwayne ?
How old is he ?

639
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,100
Uhh.  Uh...

640
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,300
Come on.  Ware,
talk to me.  Say it.

641
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,400
Hey...  Hey.
Don't you leave me.  No.

642
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,300
Come on.
Don't you do this.

643
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,700
Ware !  Ware !
No.  Come on, man.

644
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,200
Ware !  Ware !

645
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,900
What the hell happened ?

646
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,000
Man: I didn't know
he was a cop.

647
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,900
W-We saw this black car
parked in front of our house.

648
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,700
This black guy with a gun
sneaking around the yard.

649
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,000
So, you shot him ?

650
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,000
I...  I was scared.

651
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,400
I got a family.

652
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,900
So did detective ware.

653
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,900
Where's morgan ?
Back here.

654
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,500
You ok ?

655
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,500
Yeah, j. J.

656
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,700
You're kidding.

657
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,500
Another girl
just went missing.

658
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,900
All right,
we're on our way.

659
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,000
The girl's name is ally hadley.

660
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
She told her mom
she was sleeping over at a friend's house,

661
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But she never showed up there.

662
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,600
Well, I'm sure
she's just out

663
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
With some other friends
or a guy or...

664
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,600
She says she never
does this.  She a...

665
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,500
Good girl.

666
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,900
Yeah.  She's african-American.

667
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,400
15 years old.
She loves to sing.

668
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,700
Guys we got a witness.
A girl who saw the report on the news.

669
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,300
She says a guy came up
to her about a month ago,

670
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,500
Claiming to work for
a record company.

671
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,600
She's on the way in.

672
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,500
I'll call the others.

673
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,100
It was after choir practice
at the church.

674
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
He came up to me outside...

675
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,800
This black guy.

676
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,400
Told me he was
an executive at some record company

677
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,900
And he goes to churches
in the area to scout talent.

678
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,600
He said I had a great voice,
and he'd like to record me.

679
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,300
What did you say ?

680
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,400
I told him
I wasn't interested.

681
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,600
He gave me
some kind of business card

682
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,700
And told me to call him
if I changed my mind.

683
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,500
It didn't even have
a company name on it...

684
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,700
Just his name
and a phone number.

685
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,600
It looked so fake.

686
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,200
How could anyone fall for that ?

687
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Do you have the card ?

688
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,800
I didn't have to keep the card.

689
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,800
Why ?

690
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,100
I knew him.

691
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,800
I was beginning to think
you guys had forgotten all about me.

692
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,700
Well, we need you now
more than ever, hot stuff.

693
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,900
Aww, it's like candy
to my ears, sugar.  Go.

694
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,100
All right,
here's the scoop.

695
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,300
The guy's a freelance musician.

696
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,500
Played keyboard
for the girls' high school musical.

697
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,300
We contacted the school,
and they gave us a name...

698
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,000
Terrance wakeland.

699
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,800
In the new york
metropolitan area

700
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,700
Including westchester county.

701
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,100
Computer says 3.

702
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,800
He may work at
a recording studio or record company.

703
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,100
Ok, I'm going
to cross reference with i. R. S.  Records.

704
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,400
Gotcha.

705
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,500
Mount vernon,
just outside the bronx.

706
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,500
A & l studios...  Looks like
they went bellyup a few months ago.

707
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,800
But he still works there
as a security guard.

708
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,700
Thanks, mama.
You're the best.  Let's go.

709
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Man: you're lucky the studio
was available tonight.

710
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,300
You're not nervous,
are you, ally ?

711
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,000
No.
Good.

712
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,100
Good.  Good.
Don't you worry.

713
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,200
I'll have you back
before your parents even know you're gone.

714
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,300
Hey.  Let's go.

715
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,200
Man on police radio:
all units to a & l studios,

716
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,500
5663 vincent boulevard.
Mount vernon.

717
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,500
What are the chances
of us catching ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

718
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,600
* mama may have *

719
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,900
* papa may have *

720
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,600
* but god bless the child *

721
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,400
* that's got his own *

722
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,700
* that's got his own *

723
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Man: oh, that was it.
You killed that last take !

724
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
I'll...  I'll be right out.

725
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,100
I've never been in
a real recording studio before.

726
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,800
Yeah.  Well,
you wouldn't know it.

727
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,900
I mean,
you're so comfortable.

728
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,600
It sounded like you were in
your own living room singing.

729
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,000
It felt good.

730
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,100
Yeah.

731
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Hey, I'm sorry.
Your...  Your throat must be tired.

732
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,100
You want some water ?
Sure.

733
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,600
Hotch: hey, our road's closed.
Construction.

734
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Isn't there
a faster way ?

735
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,500
Not that I know of.  No.

736
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,000
Hey, you know
not a lot of girls your age

737
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,100
Would have chosen
a song like this.

738
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,100
Really ?

739
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,900
Oh, yeah.

740
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,300
And that look...
That face you got.

741
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,100
I mean, you got this
real smokey kind of tone.

742
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,600
Like something you hear in
a thirties harlem supper club.

743
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,800
I mean, do you have any idea
what your music does to me.

744
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,500
No.

745
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,400
It takes hold.

746
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,500
You get a song
stuck in your head.

747
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,600
But for me,
it gets stuck right here.

748
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
Once it's there,

749
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,800
There's just no letting it go.

750
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,600
It's just...

751
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
?  ?  ?  ?

752
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,700
U  all right

753
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,600
you all right ?

754
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,900
Yeah.  Just...
a little dizzy.

755
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,600
What I'm saying is that
it's so beautiful.

756
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Ally, I just can't...

757
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
Let it live.

758
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,900
You ever feel that ?
Like there's something so beautiful...

759
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,500
so beautiful you can't
let it live to show you...

760
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,700
To remind you
of how ugly you are ?

761
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,100
I...  I don't feel
so good.

762
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,800
Son of a bitch !

763
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,200
you think I'm ugly ?

764
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,300
Aah !

765
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Help !

766
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,000
Somebody help !

767
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,700
Police officer:
i'll cover the door.

768
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,900
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

769
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,500
Right there.  Go.

770
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,900
Check the back.

771
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,200
Morgan !

772
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,200
Yeah.

773
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,700
Door are wide open,
lights are on.  Somebody left in a hurry.

774
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,100
There was definitely
a struggle.

775
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,500
So, maybe she's still alive.

776
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,200
They were here.
And maybe she tried to flee.

777
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,600
She could be in
the neighborhood, trying to get away.

778
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,800
Hotch, look at this.

779
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,500
It's the voices, man,

780
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,000
His souvenirs.

781
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,300
Let's go.

782
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,000
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

783
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,900
Help me.

784
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,100
What's the matter ?

785
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,800
Where...  Where am i ?

786
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,200
Whoa.  What did you take ?

787
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,100
Ally !  Ally, there you are !

788
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,700
You know this girl ?

789
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,800
Thank you, officer.
This is my baby cousin.

790
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
Her parents are
out of town,

791
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,800
And I'm taking care of
her right now.

792
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,000
And, uh,
she snuck out and obviously got herself

793
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,100
Some kind of wasted.
I'm very, very sorry.

794
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,600
Come on, ally.  Come on.
Party's over.

795
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,900
Hey, you want me
to tell your parents what you've done ?

796
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,500
I mean, look around you.
This is a dangerous neighborhood, ally.

797
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,700
You could have gotten
yourself killed.

798
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,700
You know this man ?

799
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,100
Again, officer,
I'm very, very sorry.

800
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,700
She's...  She's really
out of it.

801
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,700
Come on, ally,
you can sleep it off when you get home.

802
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,900
Can I go now ?  Or am I gonna
have to stand here all night

803
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,900
While you mess with this kid ?

804
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,100
There they are.

805
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,300
Wakeland, f. B. I.  !
Don't move !

806
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,700
Whats going on ?
Let her go.

807
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,800
What did I do ?
Let her go.

808
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,300
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? Right ?  !

809
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,300
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

810
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,500
He won't let her go.
He could be armed.

811
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Just calm down !

812
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,700
Hey, what the hell
are you waiting for ?  !

813
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Do not shoot !
I want you to calm down,

814
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,700
Put your weapons down
so we can move in.

815
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,100
Do it !

816
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,500
Do it !

817
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,100
Wakeland,
get away from the girl.

818
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,200
Turn around.

819
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,300
Hands on your head.

820
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,700
Let's go.

821
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
You all right ?

822
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,700
I was just thinking.

823
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,200
I know what it's like
to grow up without a father.

824
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,000
Their father died a hero.

825
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,400
So did mine.

826
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,000
Doesn't make it
any easier.

827
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,000
Jacob: "the life of the dead
is placed in the memory of the living. "

828
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,800
Cicero.

829
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,500
Oops !  Sorry.

830
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,400
Oh, wait a minute.

831
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,400
No, you didn't.

832
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,500
Where did you find this ?

833
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,800
In the airport.
Can you believe it ?

834
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,600
Haven't read this in
fift...  Like...  12 years.

835
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,000
Ok, that's funny.
Hmm.

836
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,000
Chapter 3's
where it starts to get good.

837
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,500
Ok.  I will let you know
when I get there.

838
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
All right, you do that.

839
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,700
You all right ?

840
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,400
Reid.

841
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,300
Hmm ?

842
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,900
I said, are you all right ?

843
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,300
I'm fine.

844
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,200
Thanks
for broadcasting it.

845
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,500
Hey, talk to me.

846
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
Whatever you say to me in
confidence is between us.

847
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,000
You know that right ?

848
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,600
I don't have anything
to tell you.

849
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,100
Reid, listen to me.

850
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,300
What you went through
out there,

851
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,200
Nobody expects you
to rebound...

852
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,100
I can still do my job,
all right. I'm not gonna freak out.

853
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,100
You think
I don't know that.

854
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,900
It's the crime scene
photos.

855
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,800
Crime scene photos ?

856
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,500
The dead girls
in the leaves.

857
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,700
Reid, we've seen worse.

858
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I know.

859
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,900
I know
we've seen worse, but...

860
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,100
For the first time, I know.

861
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,900
I look at them, and...

862
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,900
I look at them and I...
I know what they were thinking.

863
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,900
And I know what
they were feeling, like, right before.

864
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,000
That's called empathy.

865
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,300
And it's a good thing.

866
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,900
It's not.
It's got me all messed up.

867
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,300
I don't know how to focus.
I can't do my job as well.

868
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,200
So, what do I do ?

869
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,400
You use it.

870
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,100
Let is make you a better profiler,

871
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,000
A better person.

872
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,300
A better person.

873
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,100
Hmph.

874
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,100
