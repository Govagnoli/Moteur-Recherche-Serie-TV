1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,300
How much farther?

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,100
What?

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,600
Are we almost done?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,100
You want to stop?

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,900
No.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Let's rest a while.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,800
I promised I wouldn't slow you down.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,000
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,500
I can wait.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,400
Adam, please. It's your workout.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,400
Go. I'll meet you at the point.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,000
You're out of shape, cheerleader.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, yeah?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,800
Let's see you do 3 back flips and land in the splits.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,500
The point?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,900
The point.

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Hello?

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,000
Is somebody there?

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,100
Adam...

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,200
if you're trying to scare me, I'm gonna kill you.

21
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,200
Adam?

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
Adam. Adam!

23
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,300
Adam!

24
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,300
Oh, my god. Adam, please wake up. Adam.

25
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,500
Baby, please, baby. Please!

26
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,800
Noooo!

27
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,700
Victim's the Lloyd boy, isn't it?

28
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,800
The quarterback?

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,600
Adam.

30
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,000
Just saw his parents yesterday heading up to Nantucket.

31
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
Listen get me their number up there, will you?

32
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,900
Sheriff Bridges.

33
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
There's something here.

34
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,400
What is it?

35
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,700
You're gonna want to see this, sir.

36
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,500
Looks like the head is busted open.

37
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,700
Just like Adam Lloyd.

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
You want me to get the crime scene folks down here?

39
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Yeah.

40
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Wait. Hold on.

41
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,000
We're gonna need a lot more than the crime scene folks.

42
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,300
Easy there, tough guy. Have some coffee with your sugar.

43
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,100
I need something to wake me up.

44
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,400
Ooh. Late night?

45
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Very.

46
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,900
My man.

47
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,700
Not that kind of late night.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,300
Ok, so tell me, what does keep
young Dr. Reid awake at night?

49
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,500
Wait, let me guess.

50
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,600
Memorizing some obscure textbook.

51
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,400
No, no, no, no.

52
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,000
Working on cold fusion.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,400
No, I got it.

54
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,900
Watching Star Trek... and laughing at the physics mistakes.

55
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,100
Actually, there aren't that many scientific errors in Star Trek.

56
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,400
Especially considering how long ago it was made.

57
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,500
There are certain improbabilities, but not that many outright errors.

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,700
Right.

59
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
Hey, Morgan?

60
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,100
Uh, do you ever have dreams?

61
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,200
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,400
I guess nightmares would be a more accurate description.

63
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
Is that what's keeping you up?

64
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,500
I used to get them occasionally

65
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,300
but lately it's like I have them every night.

66
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,100
What are they about?

67
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,600
This. What we do.

68
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,200
Do you have nightmares?

69
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,000
Reid, I'm not sure if I'm the right person for you to talk to about this.

70
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,200
Why not?

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,700
It's just, uh...

72
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,800
did you ask Gideon about it?

73
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,700
No.

74
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,300
You should.

75
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,300
Hey, Hotch wants everyone in the round table room.

76
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Something up with you two?

77
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,100
No.

78
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Mcallister. Western slope of massanutten mountain in Virginia.

79
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,300
2 bodies discovered in the woods

80
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,400
both with apparent blunt trauma to the head.

81
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Skeletons?

82
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,800
One of them. The second victim was just killed this morning.

83
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,100
How do we know there's a connection?

84
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,600
They were found about 75 feet apart with nearly identical head wounds.

85
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,800
Where's the rest of the case file?

86
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,700
There isn't one. The sheriffs are on the scene waiting for us.

87
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,100
Their location is only a half hour away by plane.

88
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,200
What's the rush?

89
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,700
Well, there was evidence on the scene that

90
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,900
could cause a bit of a public uproar.

91
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,600
A satanic cult.

94
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Criminal Minds
Season 1 Episode 10

95
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,700
So Peter Ustinov said, "unfortunately

96
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,300
a super-abundance of dreams

97
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,700
is paid for by a growing potential for nightmares."

98
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,000
JJ, we need to obviously, keep this out of the press for as long as possible.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,300
I'll do what I can.

100
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,200
Why is that so important?

101
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,900
There was a nationwide scare in the 1980s

102
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,500
involving satanic ritual killings and abuse.

103
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
The satanic panic, it was called.

104
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,100
It began after the publication of a book

105
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,800
about repressed memories being recovered through hypnotherapy.

106
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,700
Memories of growing up with devil worshippers

107
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,000
who use children in their rituals and ceremonies.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,300
Most of the claims were later found to be false or just impossible.

109
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,500
Still, numerous therapists accepted the assertions as true

110
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,500
and began searching for similar signs in their own patients.

111
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,900
After one year, thousands of people reported the exact same repressed memories.

112
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,100
The bureau conducted an investigation and concluded that

113
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,800
most of the most of the ritual killings or abuse were more

114
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,100
urban legend than anything else.

115
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,400
You're saying that there's no such thing as devil worship?

116
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,600
Not at all.

117
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
But most of the satanism that we've seen is

118
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,900
juveniles damaging property,
desecrating churches, cemeteries.

119
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,000
To my knowledge, there has never been a proven case

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
of a satanic ritual killing in the united states.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,400
Well, maybe there is now.

122
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,400
Mornin'.

123
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,200
John bridges.

124
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,500
Yeah. We spoke on the phone.

125
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,800
I'm agent Jareau, and this is agent Gideon and Dr. Reid

126
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,600
with the FBI's behavioral analysis unit.

127
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,200
Hi.

128
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,100
Thanks for coming out so fast.

129
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah. Of course.

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There was an in-service in Charlottesville last year

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,200
said if we ran into any unusual homicides

132
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,800
we were supposed to call you folks sooner rather than later.

133
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah, they were right.

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,100
Is this unusual enough?

135
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,500
It certainly is interesting.

136
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,900
You guys must get a lot of this, huh?

137
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,800
Satanic stuff?

138
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,900
Not really.

139
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Who found the bodies?

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,700
A hiker found the first one at the trail

141
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,300
and my deputies located this one while searching for evidence.

142
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,700
We don't even know if it's a man or a woman.

143
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,200
It's a man.

144
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,000
The male pelvis is more narrow

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,900
and the opening at the bottom is heart-shaped, as opposed to oval.

146
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,600
Melted wax?

147
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,700
Candle wax?

148
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,200
Candles are used in rituals.

149
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,100
They're also used on birthday cakes.

150
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Actually, they were originally used to protect the birthday celebrant

151
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
from demons for the coming year.

152
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,000
As a matter of fact, down to the fourth century

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,800
christianity rejected the birthday celebration as a pagan ritual.

154
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,300
What kind of doctor are you?

155
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,500
He was kind of a local hero.

156
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,200
A high school football star.

157
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,000
So a pretty strong kid, huh?

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I know he used to run out here on the mountain all the time.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,100
That's not easy.

160
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,200
Was he out here running today?

161
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,000
He was wearing sweats.

162
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,600
A crime of opportunity

163
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,100
or was the unsub laying in wait for this kid specifically?

164
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Unsub?

165
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,700
Unknown subject. The killer.

166
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,200
If it is a cult, do you think they cared who the victim was?

167
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Maybe. Maybe not.

168
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,000
So we're talking about a blitz attack on a high-risk victim--

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
one who could defend himself--

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,700
with a weapon picked up at the scene.

171
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,100
Disorganized offender. It could be a cult.

172
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,700
The manson crime scenes were textbook disorganized murder.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,100
This looks like a heavily traveled area.

174
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,200
A lot of the locals walk these paths.

175
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Some tourists, too.

176
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
If you are gonna conduct a ritual killing?

177
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Would you do it in the middle of a traveled path?

178
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,200
Well, if the other crime scene was a ritual site where the pentagram is

179
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,300
I might blitz the victim here and drag him to the other scene.

180
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,500
Why didn't they?

181
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,000
Does "lod" mean anything to you?

182
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,200
Uh-uh. I don't know of any significance in satanism, either.

183
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,900
Well, I could have Garcia research this "lod" thing

184
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,100
if I could get a call out.

185
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,000
Not much of a chance of that out here.

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,100
Are there any cults in the area that you know about?

187
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,400
Secret groups?

188
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,200
People you see you don't know much about

189
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,400
people who stay to themselves mostly.

190
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,100
This is a very religious area.

191
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,900
Church on sundays, fellowship on wednesday, bible classes.

192
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,200
If there was a secret group, I'd probably know about it.

193
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
That's an inherent contradiction.

194
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,700
Excuse me?

195
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,100
He means if there was a group being secretive

196
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,600
you probably wouldn't know.

197
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,300
Look, people out here just want a quiet place to raise their kids.

198
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,600
What I know is none of them are capable of doing this.

199
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,000
Find anything interesting down there?

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,400
Yeah, it does look like some kind of ritual site.

201
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,800
Have any of you ever heard the expression "lod" or the acronym "L.O.D."?

202
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,600
Not me.

203
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,100
Cherish? Cherish?

204
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,400
Sheriff Bridges!

205
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,200
It's ok, Harris. Let her in.

206
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,300
Was Adam Lloyd killed out here?

207
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,000
Who told you that, Veronica?

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,500
Was he? My daughter was with him.

209
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
They were out running together this morning.

210
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,800
Oh, my god. I can't find her. Cherish is missing.

211
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,400
Cherish is missing!

212
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,300
Help me, please.

213
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,400
Take her home.

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,900
We're looking for someone who can overpower our victim

215
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,800
abduct a girl from a traveled path without being seen.

216
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,400
It certainly fits with the cult theory.

217
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,000
More than one unsub to control multiple victims.

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,300
But if the attack were ferocious enough

219
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,000
a single unsub could, too.

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,400
Kill Adam and grab the girl while she's in shock.

221
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,200
This is some rough country.

222
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,000
We only went 1/4 of a mile, and we almost got lost.

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,200
The unsub has to be from this area.

224
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,100
You don't just stumble onto a place like this.

225
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,600
JJ, where'd the sheriff go?

226
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,600
He's setting up a search party.

227
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,000
Tell him I want him to use volunteers from the area. Locals.

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,400
Do you want him to know why?

229
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,500
No, not yet.

230
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,900
Is it wise to alienate him?

231
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,200
Well, he thinks we're looking for a monster.

232
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,700
If we tell him we're looking for volunteers

233
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,900
so we can profile who shows up

234
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,500
he might call the whole thing off.

235
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,200
State won't be here for over an hour. We're not gonna wait.

236
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,800
I want you to gather everyone up

237
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,600
and I'm going to assign grid locations.

238
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,300
Yes, sir.

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,500
You have a moment, sheriff?

240
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,400
I've got a missing girl, 100 square miles of woods, not enough men

241
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,000
and in a couple of hours it's going to be dark.

242
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,300
Have you considered using the people that live in the area?

243
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm not gonna have civilians messing up the crime scene.

244
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,500
We can instruct them not to touch anything

245
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,200
until a member of law enforcement arrives.

246
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,300
What if they get lost, too?

247
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,900
We can have them sign in to a volunteer sheet

248
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
and keep track of what grid square they're in.

249
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,400
Look...I grew up in a small town.

250
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,800
You have the state police coming in?

251
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,500
Yeah.

252
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,600
Your locals can do a better job of finding this girl than any statie.

253
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
You know that.

254
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
You'll keep track of 'em?

255
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,000
I've coordinated searches all over the country.

256
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,700
Let's go.

257
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,000
Harris, I'm going downtown.

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,600
Don't do anything until I get back, all right?

259
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,300
Hey, can I come with you guys?

260
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,500
I need to call Quantico and have them research that whole "lod" thing.

261
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,600
Yeah, sure. Hop in.

262
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,900
What's happened, John?

263
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,100
Reverend Paul Burke, this is--

264
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,300
I'm sorry, I forgot your names.

265
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm agent Jareau. This is Dr. Reid.

266
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
They're with the FBI.

267
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,000
FBI? It's true, then? Adam's dead?

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,900
Cherish Hanson's missing, too.

269
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,100
Is there anything I can do?

270
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,500
Actually, yes. We're putting together a search party.

271
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,000
Could you call the congregation?

272
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,300
Of course. Of course. I'll go make some calls.

273
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,700
Thanks, Reverend. This way.

274
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,600
Use any phone, doc, you just dial 9 to get an outside line.

275
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,500
I've got an emergency phone list back here in my office.

276
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,100
Did you play ball?

277
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
No.

278
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,500
Yeah, I probably wouldn't have, either, if not for my father.

279
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,600
I'm Cory.

280
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,700
Spencer Reid.

281
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Who's that, nietzsche?

282
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,900
"Thus spake zarathustra" was rather antagonistic of

283
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,700
the judeo-christian world view for this town, isn't it?

284
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,100
I don't think too many people here would've bothered to read it.

285
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,600
If they had, they wouldn't understand it.

286
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,900
Might as well be a hawking essay on quark theory.

287
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,100
Nobody ever got that reference before.

288
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,300
Is my father around?

289
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,000
The sheriff?

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He's in his office with another agent.

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,600
Agent?

292
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm with the FBI, behavioral analysis unit.

293
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,900
Profilers?

294
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,500
Ha. This is mad cool.

295
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,900
I got, like 100 questions I go--

296
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,900
wait. Why would FBI profilers be here in McAllister?

297
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,400
There was a murder outside of town on the mountain.

298
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,100
A murder?

299
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,400
A girl's missing.

300
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,300
It's Cherish, son.

301
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,600
Cherish Hanson?

302
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,800
We're putting together a search party.

303
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,900
I need you to get the rest of the team together

304
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,300
and meet us out at the trail about 1/2 mile south of the point.

305
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,700
Yeah. Ok.

306
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,100
Came as soon as I heard, sheriff.

307
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,400
Good morning, Henry.

308
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,200
Sign in with this lady here

309
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
then just stand by for a few minutes.

310
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,700
Everyone, please, as soon as you've signed in

311
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,200
make your way back to the police cars.

312
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,200
That's where you'll be assigned your groups. Thank you.

313
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,900
I grew up in Brooklyn.

314
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,900
You couldn't get this many people out for anything less than free money.

315
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,600
Well, here come the jocks and cheerleaders.

316
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,100
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?

317
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,000
Now, you're all assigned grid squares to search.

318
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,500
Each grid has a deputy or an FBI agent.

319
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,100
You find anything, do not touch it.

320
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,300
Just let your grid leader know.

321
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,200
Now, are there any questions?

322
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,400
All right. Everyone get in your group now.

323
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,100
All right, you guys, let's head out.

324
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
You have the sign-in sheets?

325
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,500
Yeah.

326
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,200
Is Garcia standing by to do background on them all?

327
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,300
I got a deputy waiting to take me back to the station.

328
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm gonna fax her soon as I get there.

329
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,900
Good. This type of unsub can't resist injecting himself into a show like this.

330
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,200
He's here with us.

331
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,700
Man, this is one peyton place of a town.

332
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,100
Most everyone lives well above the median income of the country.

333
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,600
You got doctors, lawyers...

334
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,800
one guy owns a bunch of shoe stores up and down the eastern seaboard.

335
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,500
Ha. Is he married?

336
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,700
Yeah. Story of my life, sunshine.

337
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,400
Reverend Paul Burke, looks like he became born again in prison.

338
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,900
Prison?

339
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,400
Yeah, 2 years as a guest of
the state of Ohio for embezzlement.

340
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm seeing a lot of tax sheltering and various hanky-panky here

341
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,000
but I'm not sure what would suggest potential satanic cult members

342
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,500
hold on.

343
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Wait, you got something?

344
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,300
Yeah, I got a guy with a ton of debts

345
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,600
spotty work history, his house is in foreclosure.

346
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,400
He's got a record, too

347
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,900
assault with a deadly weapon 3 years ago.

348
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,600
Wait. Does it say what the weapon was?

349
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,400
Baseball bat.

350
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,300
Our unsub used a blunt object.

351
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,800
Bats are blunt, aren't they?

352
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,100
What's this guy's name?

353
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,000
Dent. Henry Dent.

354
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,100
Ok. Here he is. "Grid b-5." Ok, that puts him with...Elle.

355
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You all right there?

356
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,500
Way to scare a girl.

357
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,500
Saw you bent over.

358
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,000
I was tying my shoe.

359
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,700
These almost never come untied.

360
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Good for you.

361
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,800
My name's Henry.

362
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,800
Well, then good for you, Henry.

363
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
I'm Elle.

364
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,800
Like the letter?

365
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,700
That's a different kind of name.

366
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,200
Had it all my life.

367
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,200
That's funny. Your whole life.

368
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,800
You're with the FBI, right?

369
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,400
That must be exciting.

370
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,800
It has its moments.

371
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,100
It's dangerous, too, right?

372
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,400
I mean, you go after killers and things.

373
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,900
Really bad guys.

374
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,300
You ever have to shoot--

375
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,500
"satan commands the virgin be sacrificed at the next full moon."

376
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,800
That's tonight, isn't it?

377
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,900
Wh--what's that?

378
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,100
Blood.

379
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,700
Tired?

380
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,500
I'm fine.

381
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,500
We all get them sometimes.

382
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,800
Get what?

383
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
Nightmares.

384
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,400
It's not that bad.

385
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,100
You want to talk about it, you know where I am.

386
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,000
Uh, they're ready.

387
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,700
Okay.

388
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,900
Contrary to popular belief

389
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,300
there has never been a proven case of satanic ritual killing.

390
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,200
Never a verified human sacrifice.

391
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,300
Having said that, there have been
isolated cases of animal sacrifice...

392
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,000
Many, many cases of vandalism in the name of satan.

393
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,500
But that doesn't mean that ritual satanism is impossible.

394
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,700
More importantly, for our purposes

395
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,900
there have been cults that killed, just not in ritual fashion.

396
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,400
The Reverend Jim Jones and the peoples temple...

397
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,100
his followers killed a U.S. Congressman and 3 people

398
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,700
before committing mass suicide
and leaving over 900 people dead.

399
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,000
And perhaps the most widely-known of the killer cults

400
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,700
the Manson family under the direction of Charles Manson

401
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,000
killed 9 people in a 4-day period
in an attempt to initiate a race war.

402
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,300
Killer cults do exist, and they all have one thing in common...

403
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,100
invariably they're headed by charismatic megalomaniacs.

404
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,900
You're looking for that leader. He's who will stand out.

405
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,600
He'll be memorable to somebody, people who aren't in his group

406
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,400
will see him as strange, weird, scary.

407
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,700
Since we're dealing with professed satanists

408
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,000
which is often practiced by younger males

409
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,700
we may be looking for teenagers.

410
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,100
Heavy metal music is often associated with satanism

411
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,200
and these kids and their leader may reflect that in their look.

412
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,900
Most likely, there'll be sex, drugs and alcohol.

413
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,600
And the leader, he'll be older.

414
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,500
It's part of his charm.

415
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
And he is from this area.

416
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,100
He's definitely local.

417
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,400
These woods are too thick and
confusing for a visitor to get around in.

418
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,600
You think one of our own people is doing this?

419
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,500
We're sure of it.

420
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
I would know if someone was capable of doing--

421
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,600
Dad. I know somebody like that.

422
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,900
His name's Mike Zizzo.

423
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,800
He graduated about 5 years ago.

424
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,300
He's in his 20s, but he still hangs out with high school kids.

425
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,800
He's got a group of them.

426
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,500
They follow him everywhere.

427
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,900
They all get high and listen to heavy metal.

428
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,700
He calls them the lords of destruction.

429
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,500
LOD.

430
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,000
How do you know this, Cory?

431
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,300
It's all right, son.

432
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,000
I've been there, where they hang out drinking beers.

433
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
He talks about Satan all the time.

434
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,800
Says he's the one true god.

435
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,000
Where is this place?

436
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,800
On the other side of the mountain. The old Jenson house.

437
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,400
It's out of my jurisdiction.

438
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Not ours.

439
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Sorry, dad.

440
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,700
I'm not going on the raid.

441
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,600
What's up?

442
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,900
I don't know yet.

443
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,700
FBI! Don't move!

444
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,400
I said turn the music down now!

445
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,400
Up against the wall! Everybody up against the wall now!

446
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,516
Up against the wall!

447
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,300
Do you believe in god?

448
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,500
Excuse me?

449
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
Do you believe in god?

450
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,900
Yes.

451
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,300
How about the devil?

452
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
Is someone going to tell me why I'm here

453
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,600
or are we just going to play staring games all night?

454
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,400
This was found where Cherish Hanson went missing.

455
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,900
No wonder everyone's all freaked out.

456
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,100
Mcallister's perfect debutante is in trouble.

457
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,400
Read the note.

458
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,800
You think someone threatening to kill this girl is funny?

459
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:18,700
No, I think someone calling Cherish Hanson a virgin is funny.

460
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,600
You're a satanist, Mike?

461
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,700
Sure.

462
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,800
And you worship the devil?

463
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,400
You know what satanism is?

464
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,700
Educate us.

465
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,200
The word Satan comes from ancient Hebrew. It just means opposer.

466
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,500
Satan opposes the hypocritical morals and dogmas

467
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,100
of the so-called holy church and its followers.

468
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,700
If you grew up in this town with god shoved down your throat every day

469
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
you'd oppose it, too.

470
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,100
It's all hypocrisy. Do this. Don't do that.

471
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,900
And all the time, the adults are the ones screwing up.

472
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,200
So basically we're just atheists. Aggressively atheist.

473
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,400
How aggressive, Mike?

474
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
You're one of the FBI agents, aren't you?

475
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,800
Is there something you want to tell me?

476
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,600
Do you think god is vengeful?

477
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
I don't know.

478
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,700
You don't think he punishes us?

479
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,600
After hurricane Katrina, I read some essays by religious scholars.

480
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,700
One writer said god was punishing America for its immorality.

481
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,200
New Orleans was a wicked city, like sodom and gomorrah.

482
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,100
Another one, a priest from New Orleans

483
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,800
he thought the hurricane was proof of god's love.

484
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Those levees didn't break until after the storm was over.

485
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,600
If they'd broken sooner, thousands would've died.

486
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
So...

487
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,200
I guess the answer to your question depends on whether or not

488
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,400
you think you have something to be punished for.

489
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,600
My friend Cherish...

490
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,900
she's missing.

491
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,100
And it's my fault.

492
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
I've got to give the sheriff a report.

493
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,900
I'll be back as soon as I can.

494
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
You guys need anything?

495
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,400
Coffee would be nice.

496
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
He takes about a quart of sugar in it.

497
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,200
2 teaspoons is fine.

498
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,300
You got it.

499
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,100
Morgan.

500
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,200
You knew I didn't want you to tell Hotch about my nightmares.

501
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,500
Reid, that's something they need to know about.

502
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,700
What do you mean "they"?

503
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,000
Hotch and Gideon.

504
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,400
You told Gideon, too?

505
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,700
Yeah, and it's ok, kid.

506
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,900
What if they think I can't do my job?

507
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,700
What if they want to pull me off the team?

508
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,900
- They won't.
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?

509
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,700
I just do.

510
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,100
You had no right, man. I--I confided in you.

511
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,900
You know, this is exactly what I get when I trust someone.

512
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,400
It gets thrown back in my face.

513
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,000
Mine started 6 months after I got into the B.A.U.

514
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,100
Yeah. Mine.

515
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,900
We were working a strangler case in Montana.

516
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,900
Four victims.

517
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,400
Me, I was still pretty young at the time

518
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,100
so you know, I was feeling myself.

519
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,400
I was cocky, I was arrogant.

520
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,800
The locals, they didn't have anything, so I stepped up.

521
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,100
I said I can nail down a profile for you

522
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
just as soon as I can get what I need.

523
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,500
More victims?

524
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,400
She was found the next day.

525
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,000
So I went down to the scene to do my thing.

526
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,800
And as I was looking over the body, that's when I saw them.

527
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,500
Her eyes, Reid.

528
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,700
They were wide open.

529
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,500
And there was something different about them

530
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,300
it was like they were looking right at me.

531
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,700
Like she knew.

532
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,300
I asked for a victim.

533
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,500
Well, here she was.

534
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,600
That's when they started for me.

535
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,000
Night after night I would fall asleep and I would see those eyes.

536
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,900
They were dead eyes. Accusing eyes.

537
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,100
And it got to the point where it was
happening even when I wasn't asleep.

538
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,200
Reid, everywhere I went, I saw those eyes.

539
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
What did you do?

540
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,000
Gideon.

541
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,900
He knew. I didn't tell him.

542
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,500
I was like you. I didn't want anybody to know.

543
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,800
He just...he knew.

544
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,100
And he sat me down and he just kind of talked me through it.

545
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,800
I still have the nightmares to this day, just not nearly as often.

546
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,600
But when they come back, I know how to handle them better.

547
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,200
What did he say?

548
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,500
Did you find her?

549
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,400
Cherish?

550
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
No.

551
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,900
Did Zizzo say anything?

552
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,800
We don't know. We've been here the whole time.

553
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,100
Cory, calm down.

554
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,900
How am I supposed to calm down?

555
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,800
Cherish is missing. Did you check all over?

556
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,000
We searched the whole house.

557
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
What about the outbuilding?

558
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,100
Outbuilding?

559
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,900
Did you check the other area? Back in the woods?

560
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,300
I didn't know there was another area.

561
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,100
Yeah, it's like a sluice structure or something.

562
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,600
He took me there once. It's this way.

563
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,300
Let's go.

564
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,600
The skeleton under the tree, he died a year ago.

565
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,200
He fell off the trail, cracked his head open.

566
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,500
He was just some tourist or something.

567
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,700
How do you know that?

568
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,800
We went to see the body all the time.

569
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,400
We watched it decompose.

570
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,200
Who did?

571
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,600
We did. Everybody, the whole group.

572
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,200
What the hell is this?

573
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,600
Why don't you tell us, Mike?

574
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,000
I've never seen this before.

575
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,100
Pentagram, body, candles, L.O.D.

576
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,400
Lords of destruction.

577
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,300
I've never seen this.

578
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,100
From where I stand, Mike, it looks like you signed it.

579
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,900
At first we were just curious, you know?

580
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,600
We would go, a couple of us at a time, show each other.

581
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,200
None of us had ever seen a dead body before.

582
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
And then it kind of became our thing.

583
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,000
Something that we had that our parents didn't know about.

584
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,000
It was ours.

585
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,400
This was a human being.

586
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,300
I told you that we're being punished.

587
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
It's up here.

588
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,000
This is our secret place.

589
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,300
Reid?

590
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,900
I can't believe this is happening.

591
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,300
This kind of thing doesn't happen in McAllister.

592
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,800
You said you read the profiling books.

593
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,500
You know bad things happen anywhere. Anywhere at anytime.

594
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,700
She in there?

595
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Is she all right?

596
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,800
Cory, she's in there.

597
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,900
Is she dead?

598
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,800
She can't be dead.

599
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,900
Look, we drew our stars upside-down, get drunk, and listen to metal.

600
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,200
That's it. Hey, we don't kill people.

601
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,800
This is your chance to make this right, Zizzo.

602
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
You don't want to make it right.

603
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,800
You wanna blame someone who doesn't conform

604
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,300
to your view of how people should act and think.

605
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,400
I need to talk to you, all of you.

606
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,800
Reid, I want you to go to the house

607
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
and see if the deputies have come back.

608
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,800
What?

609
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,900
We need the sheriff and the crime scene team here.

610
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,600
- But--
- Reid. Do it.

611
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,500
I can't--I can't believe Cherish

612
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,500
I'm sorry about your friend.

613
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,800
I saw her the other day.

614
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,600
It was a pep rally.

615
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,900
I've been with Brandy Dreifort. Do you know her?

616
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,300
She's a friend of my son's.

617
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,200
She's a friend of Cherish's, too.

618
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,900
And?

619
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,700
Well, they all knew about the skeleton.

620
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,500
Who did?

621
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,300
Football team, cheerleaders, everyone.

622
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,200
They all watched this man decompose

623
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,500
like it was a game for their amusement.

624
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,200
What?

625
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,000
As far as I can tell

626
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,400
the only kids in that area who didn't know

627
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,300
were Mike Zizzo and the L.O.D.

628
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,500
It's ridiculous.

629
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,600
Sounds impossible, it's unbelievable.

630
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,100
She told me all about it.

631
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
The guy was a hiker or something.

632
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,100
Probably have him listed, missing person somewhere.

633
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,300
Jason how do you know the L.O.D. wasn't involved?

634
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,600
Well, she said the pentagram and the candles

635
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,600
they weren't there a few months ago.

636
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,200
Which means?

637
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Someone wanted us to believe there were satanists here.

638
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,400
Reid tells me you've read all the profiling books.

639
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,100
Actually kinda hoping to be one of you guys someday.

640
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,200
Are ya? So then you know what profilers do?

641
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,400
The unsub likes to inject himself into the investigation.

642
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,300
That's what this type of killer does.

643
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,800
Who gave us is Zizzo?

644
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,100
Who knew all about him?

645
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,200
You're talking about Cory?

646
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
It was convenient, wasn't it?

647
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,200
Lucky we had a kid right in the room

648
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
who could tell us where the L.O.D. was.

649
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,700
A group of fringe kids nobody in the town would like.

650
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,200
But you called us here to advise you.

651
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,100
My advice would be to get in front of this

652
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,700
before your son hurts himself or anybody else.

653
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,900
You know where he is, sheriff?

654
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,900
He went up to the Jenson house to see
if your guys found anything on Cherish.

655
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,800
Morgan and Reid are out there right now.

656
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,500
Hey, sheriff. Did you open the gun locker?

657
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,400
No.

658
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,600
Someone did. There's a revolver missing.

659
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,200
You know that we look at a crime scene

660
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,600
from a different perspective than regular cops, right?

661
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,000
We look for more than just the evidence.

662
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,200
We try to pick up on the behavior of the killer.

663
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,100
For example, the guy we're looking for in this crime

664
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,500
would be classified as a disorganized killer.

665
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,400
Sounds like Zizzo, doesn't it?

666
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,100
Yeah. Sure it does.

667
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,100
But then again, sometimes
a disorganized killer only looks disorganized.

668
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Sometimes it's actually an organized guy, and pretty smart guy.

669
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,800
Somebody who can manipulate a crime scene to make it look like somebody else did it.

670
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,000
Because of that, we also gotta look for someone

671
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,200
who might try to put himself right in the middle of an investigation

672
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,300
so that he can influence things.

673
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,800
Especially if he knows exactly
what it is that we're looking for.

674
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,400
I mean, he wants to control this, right?

675
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,300
And that would extend to discovery.

676
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Wantin' the body found when and
especially where he wants that body found.

677
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,100
You mean me?

678
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,400
This was more than just a lucky guess, wasn't it?

679
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,200
I knew about the building.

680
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,100
You also knew about Zizzo and the satanism.

681
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,300
I was only trying to help.

682
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Well, you did that.

683
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,600
We couldn't have found this place without you.

684
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,800
Hey Morgan, no one's up there.

685
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,900
- Get over here.
- Reid. Reid.

686
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,700
- Cory.
- This got all messed up.

687
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,200
Don't be stupid.

688
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,800
She wasn't supposed to be with him.

689
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,700
It was his run. He runs it every day, not her.

690
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,900
Cory, listen to me. We can fix this.

691
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,800
But you've got to let Reid go.

692
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,400
I never meant to hurt her. But make no mistake

693
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,900
I will shoot your boy right now.

694
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,000
No, you won't.

695
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,700
Tempt not a desperate man.

696
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,500
- Put the gun down.
- Okay all right. You win.

697
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,900
Drop it. Drop the gun!

698
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,500
Ok. Ok. You win.

699
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,900
I'm putting the gun down.

700
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,100
You're in control, Cory. Let him go.

701
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,900
For the evil is man's best force. Man must become better and eviler.

702
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,600
That's what this is about, right?

703
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,700
Zarathustra? The superman?

704
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,600
There's no moral obligation for killing someone if you're superior to them?

705
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,000
But nietzsche was speaking metaphorically about evolving as a species.

706
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,300
You're just a horny kid who wanted to get rid of the cheerleader's boyfriend.

707
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,900
- No.
- Yes.

708
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,500
That was never my intent-

709
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,200
c'mon.

710
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,400
You all right?

711
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
What happened?

712
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,500
Him bringing us down here was way too much of a coincidence.

713
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,300
I got that.

714
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,800
But did you have to tackle us both?

715
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,500
You're welcome, Reid.

716
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,100
C'mon. Let's go, Cory.

717
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,200
Playwright Eugene Ionesco said

718
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,900
"ideologies separate us, dreams and anguish bring us together."

719
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Reid.

720
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,800
Deborah Louise Addison. Her husband Tim.

721
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,800
The kids are Amber and Keith. Eight and six.

722
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,300
In 1985, Deborah Louise was walking home from school.

723
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,900
She was abducted. She was 13.

724
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,500
We profiled the unsub.

725
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,400
And we were able to locate her before he harmed her.

726
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,900
She writes a letter to the B.A.U. every year.

727
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
She updates us on her life.

728
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,900
It's nice, but--

729
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,100
We all have bad dreams.

730
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Everyone on the plane. Who wouldn't?

731
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,000
We hunt the worst of humanity

732
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,900
we see the depths of depravity, we dream of monsters.

733
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,500
In my dream there's a baby in the middle of a circle

734
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,300
and there's someone on the other side.

735
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,800
And I can't get to her before--

736
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,500
Every night I look at Deborah

737
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,100
helps me to go to sleep thinking of the victims we've saved.

738
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
We don't always beat the monsters to the babies

739
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,200
but we do enough to make the job worth it

740
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,900
keep the nightmares bearable.

741
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,900
