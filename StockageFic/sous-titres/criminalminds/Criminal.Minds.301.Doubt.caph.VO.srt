1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,110
last season on criminal minds.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,770
I believe you are no longer
effective in your post.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,310
I am questioning your
ability to lead your team.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,860
Sarah. Sarah,I'm so late.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,430
I got caught up at the office.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,180
He butchered her,hotch.

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,200
He came after me. He came in my home.

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,070
It's my fault.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,970
It's time for agent hotchner's
career to come to an end.

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,370
Agent prentiss,you're going
to help me make that happen.

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,330
I knew it would be you who came
to the cabin to check on me.

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,440
You must be frightened.
I apologize for that.

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,540
I never meant to cause you any pain.

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,250
And I also never envisioned
writing this letter.

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,300
I've searched for a satisfactory
explanation for what I'm doing.

16
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,760
All I've come up with is.

17
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,310
a profiler needs to have solid footing.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,200
I--I don't think
I do anymore.

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,740
The world confuses me.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,090
The cruelty,the indifference.

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,090
the tragedy.

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,880
When my dear friend sarah was
murdered,it tore a hole in me.

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,500
And I truly believe the way I handled the pain
was to get back to our work as quickly as possible.

24
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,870
Get on to helping somebody else
until I could handle sarah's murder.

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,830
Work through it.

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,540
Remember the first case we had after?

27
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,750
It was on a college campus.

28
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,380
FLAGSTAFF,ARIZONA

29
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,420
Jim griffith.

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,260
Hi.Jennifer jareau.
Thanks for meeting us here.

31
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,090
- Thanks for taking us on so quickly.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,460
The faster we get here,the faster
we can help stave off panic.

33
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,260
I hear that.

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,240
What can you tell us
about the university?

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,270
It's small,tight-knit.
Dorms are still single-sex.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,900
Draws from all over the county,but
students are mostly the arty type.

37
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,560
Have you increased
uniform presence on campus?

38
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,490
Yeah. Doubled it.

39
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,390
Any other measures?

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,710
I got security shuttles running 24/7,and
as of tonight,I've imposed a 10:00 curfew.

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,270
We need a corner of your
precinct so we can set up shop.

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,980
You got it.

43
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,790
- You need to get to the hotel first?
- No.

44
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,610
Spree killings in a
confined area are a race.

45
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,970
He's racing to kill as many as he can.

46
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,780
We're racing to stop him.

47
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,690
hey,wait!

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
damn.

49
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,420
Ok,so talk to everyone on the floor
and we'll hang out in my room tonight.

50
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,270
I'm gonna study for russian lit.

51
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,690
There's a maniac trying to
kill us all. Don't worry.

52
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,840
They'll grade on a curve.

53
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,470
It helps me feel normal.

54
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,630
Ok,just be nice to her. Please.

55
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,400
She's making it worse.

56
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,460
She's scared.

57
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,390
And using it as an excuse to
get into everybody's business.

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,660
Kate.

59
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,510
Ok,fine. You win.

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,550
Where have you been?

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,540
Uh,the library.

62
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,740
Curfew's in 5 minutes.

63
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,610
That's why we're here.

64
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,180
I don't want anyone
drinking on the hall.

65
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,650
If you do,I'll write you up.

66
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,880
You see,I met sarah at college,on a
campus just like that one,31 years ago.

67
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,840
Campuses are supposed to be
places of life and excitement.

68
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,770
They're supposed to be about the future,

69
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,270
figuring out who you are
and who you're gonna be.

70
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,860
They're supposed to be
about dreams,not nightmares.

71
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,760
They're supposed to be about hope.

72
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,730
I just apparently don't
understand the world anymore.

76
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,720
All homicide scenes are tragic,but
when the victim is someone young,

77
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,040
their life ripped away before
they've even had a chance to live.

78
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,540
I've got men at every
exit point on campus.

79
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,970
She had her mace out,but
she didn't use it?

80
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,290
And it's well lit.

81
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,220
He's not afraid of being seen.

82
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,360
How often do the shuttles run?

83
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,200
Every 10 minutes.

84
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,710
Were all the other victims posed
like this,with their arms crossed?

85
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,530
Yeah. Why?

86
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,560
It's a classic sign of remorse.

87
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,300
The unsub kills the victim,then
immediately feels bad about it,

88
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,450
so he poses them like this
so they'll rest in peace.

89
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,790
You can tell that just by the arms?

90
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,170
That's why you called us here,to build
a psychological profile of your killer.

91
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,910
How long will it take your
men to clear the scene?

92
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,310
A few hours.

93
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,440
Lucky there's a curfew,otherwise
there'd be a mob scene.

94
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,680
Have hotch set up at the precinct.
We'll run everything through him.

95
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,840
By the time this campus wakes
up,I want a handle on this.

96
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,660
What the hell?

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,340
Dean suzanne cable,special
agents morgan and gideon.

98
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,590
Thank you for being here.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,960
Wish we didn't have to be.

100
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,320
I spoke to amy's parents.

101
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,890
Funeral services will be
held on sunday in chicago.

102
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,930
They're arriving later
today to bring her home.

103
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,720
They asked me to let you know that they will
be staying downtown at the mainline hotel.

104
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,880
If any of you would like to visit or pay your
respects,they'd like you to feel free to do so.

105
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,400
How did you all let this happen?

106
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,230
What?

107
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,480
Everybody is thinking it.

108
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,260
You are the fbi,the campus
is crawling with police,

109
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,590
and she gets murdered waiting
for the security shuttle.

110
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
That's not helpful,katie.

111
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,600
Actually,it is.

112
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,860
The fact that your friend was killed in such a
well-lit area with a police presence indicates

113
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,750
that the killer is most
likely part of this campus.

114
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,090
He's not an outsider.

115
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,130
He's someone who wouldn't raise alarm
with the police or potential victims.

116
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,890
You should also be aware that
the 3 victims were brunette.

117
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,730
- What?
- At this point,we do consider it an intentional pattern.

118
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,190
So tell me,how am i supposed
to keep these women safe?

119
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,490
I have security cameras being installed
in virtually every corner of the campus,

120
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,740
and that's coming out
of the city's budget.

121
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,290
It's not the school'S.

122
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,350
I want to shut down the school.

123
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,700
- That's a viable choice.
- But?

124
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,250
If the killer is part of the campus,he may
simply leave once the school shuts down.

125
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,900
When classes restart,there's
a good chance he'll kill again.

126
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,270
What would you do in my place?

127
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,870
I can't say.

128
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,730
Shut it down.

129
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,330
I can't justify keeping these kids locked
up in a pen while someone hunts them.

130
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,900
In this line of work,I was afraid
I would lose the ability to trust.

131
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,480
But I realized I can't really look
at anyone without seeing their death.

132
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,370
And as bad as losing
faith in humanity seems,

133
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,970
losing your faith in happy
endings is much worse.

134
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,160
Did the other victims
have this much overkill?

135
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,300
Death was caused by a single,very
forceful stab wound to the heart.

136
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,460
Yeah. He broke through the breastbone.

137
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,360
And after that,he just
lashed out at random.

138
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,270
Well,no defensive wounds.

139
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,740
She didn't even hold her
hands up to fight him off.

140
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,600
The first 2 victims were the same.

141
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,400
Did you run toxicology screens?

142
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,690
None of the others were drugged.

143
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,540
Considering that she was standing waiting
for a shuttle,my guess is she wasn't either.

144
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,240
I'm sorry about before.

145
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,420
I'm sorry about your friend.

146
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,230
Uh,your R.A.Told us that you guys
were at the library last night.

147
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,070
Did you see amy there?

148
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,060
We didn't go with
her,but we saw her there.

149
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,830
I thought she left before us.

150
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,960
Her bag wasn't in her cubicle,or
else we would have waited.

151
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,820
Did you notice anyone she might
have been talking to earlier?

152
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,890
Was it like her to be walking alone,even
in a dangerous situation like this?

153
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,990
She wasn't the victim type.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,520
It's almost impossible to
pinpoint who's the most vulnerable.

155
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,520
That's why we're trying to teach
you how to best protect yourselves.

156
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,790
I just mean that she was
strong,and she was smart.

157
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,250
I don't know why she
didn't at least mace him.

158
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,550
Are a lot of girls carrying mace?

159
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,710
Pepper spray,mace,switchblades.

160
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,480
If you can buy it online or find it at
the army-navy store,we've all bought it.

161
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,400
Are you sure about who he's killing?

162
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,250
I mean,brunettes?

163
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,240
Pretty sure. Yeah.

164
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,180
Prentiss.

165
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,380
Good morning,emily.

166
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,440
Agent prentiss?

167
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm here.

168
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,520
I'm just checking in.

169
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,170
Checking in?

170
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,440
On your case. The college girls.

171
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,980
Uh,we don't know that much yet,ma'am.

172
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,740
But you will let me know if there's
anything to report,won't you?

173
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,600
I really have to get back to work.

174
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,700
Of course. You know
where you can reach me.

175
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,780
Realistically,it'll take 2
or 3 days to empty campus.

176
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,950
I'm afraid that'll be our
window for catching this guy.

177
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,310
What do you need from me?

178
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,820
You said you're installing
security cameras?

179
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,770
Yeah,this afternoon.

180
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,070
Can they be functional by nightfall?

181
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,830
I'll make sure.

182
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,680
We'll need as many
men as you can on duty.

183
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,900
If the unsub's part of campus life,he's
gonna know it's about to shut down.

184
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,710
Next few days,that's
his last chance to hunt.

185
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,280
Uniform presence helps,but it'd also be good to have some
of your younger officers go in plainclothes,try to blend in.

186
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,660
I can ask my men to work double
shifts till we're evacuated.

187
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,510
I'll call campus security
and have them do the same.

188
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,180
Good.

189
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,310
Good morning.

190
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,490
How many victims have we seen?

191
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,730
How many crime scenes?

192
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,310
Hundreds? A thousand?

193
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,270
Pictures,families,victims,both
alive and dead.

194
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,200
I was always able to stay
objective,to stay at arm's length.

195
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,970
Now all I see is sarah in them.

196
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,770
Have many days will it take
to evacuate the students?

197
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,710
2,3 days,tops.

198
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,380
You think it's premature?

199
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,490
Do we have a choice?

200
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,580
Detective,can you gather your men?

201
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,570
- We'd like to present a rough profile.
- Got it

202
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,850
All right,grab a seat.
Let's go.Anywhere.

203
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,050
We know everyone's
tired,working overtime.

204
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,390
We want to tell you how
much we appreciate it.

205
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,440
We'd like to give you a rough profile
of the man we're all looking for.

206
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,970
This is someone with access.

207
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,110
He's managed to move in a small community with
a high police presence without raising suspicion.

208
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,750
Which means there's a good chance
that this is someone you've seen.

209
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,940
This unsub has killed 3 women in 4 days.

210
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,470
That's what we call a spree killer.

211
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,850
Now,most likely,something has happened
in the past few days to set him off.

212
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,780
Because he kills white,brunette women,.

213
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,000
that stressor probably has to do with a woman
in his life who fits the same description--

214
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,110
wife,mother,girlfriend

215
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,890
Women he's killing,they're
most likely a substitute.

216
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,550
What we need you to do is look at
people who are part of the campus fabric.

217
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,370
See if anyone fits the bill--
students,professors,support staff.

218
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,480
I'm sorry,but how are my men supposed
to know about somebody's home life?

219
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,850
Well,the people around him
have seen him devolving.

220
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,630
If you suspect someone on
campus,talk to anyone who knows him,

221
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,110
find out if he's recently
found religion,been drinking,

222
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,830
even if he's been harming himself.

223
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,020
He may feel emasculated.

224
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,830
Considering the stressor
and the victimology,

225
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,450
there's a good chance that rejection
is a recurring theme in his life.

226
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,270
This unsub displays a
great amount of anger,

227
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,370
stabs his victims repeatedly,even
after they're dead.

228
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,950
Seconds later,he feels remorse.

229
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,420
It's possible that his guilt is because
his victims were in a position to trust him.

230
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,350
How's that?

231
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,850
As we said,we think he's
a part of campus life.

232
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,120
The victims,they feel safe around him.

233
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,470
He's able to get close.

234
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,710
He's also able to kill these
women without them fighting back.

235
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,860
Not one of them has defensive
wounds on their hands.

236
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,760
Like if they'd been tasered first.

237
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,530
That's possible. Why?

238
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,180
Security guards on campus
aren't allowed guns.

239
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,130
They carry tasers.

240
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,400
Can you get me an employment
list fouscampr security?

241
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,750
What is it?

242
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,430
These markings could have
easily come from a taser.

243
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,940
Employment list,campus security.

244
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,680
How we gonna narrow this down?

245
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,960
This unsub chose a closed
community on purpose.

246
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,280
He'd want to inject himself
into the investigation.

247
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,920
Can you check the records,find out if any of these
security guards responded to every crime scene?

248
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,850
You got it.

249
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,220
In the meantime,call garcia. Have her
check the list against criminal records.

250
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,280
Talk to me,girlfriend.

251
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,710
I need to give you a
list of security guards.

252
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,740
I got nothing.

253
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,280
- Nothing?
- Nada.

254
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,240
Security guards are all clean,squeaky.

255
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,260
No criminal records.

256
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,910
What about a recent rejection?

257
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,240
Something set him off.

258
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,910
Any of these guys get fired
recently,or did their wife leave?

259
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,670
I'm sorry,em.

260
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,220
Thats ifar too general,even
for my powers of snooping.

261
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,680
Ok. Ok.

262
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,240
you're a security guard.

263
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,550
I'm not sure I like where this is going.

264
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,920
- You probably had higher ambitions.
- Easy.

265
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,850
Could you cross-check these guys
against police and military records?

266
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,660
See if any of them got
kicked out or rejected.

267
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,060
I got one,but it's not recent.

268
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,210
Give it to me anyway.

269
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,390
Nathan tubbs,rejected from
the police academy,2003.

270
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,290
Failed his psych eval.

271
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,640
I got a list of responders.

272
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,280
Only 4 guards were at every scene.

273
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,920
Nathan tubbs.

274
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,800
Garcia,what else can
you give me on tubbs?

275
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,930
I got a court appearance 6 days ago.

276
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,610
Looks like the judge gave his wife
full custody of their daughter.

277
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,590
No visitation rights.

278
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,900
How much you want to bet
his ex-wife is a brunette?

279
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,190
- You are the best.
- Word.

280
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,640
We've got a possible.

281
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,220
Clear!

282
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,150
Bathroom's clear!

283
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,000
Gideon.

284
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,460
I've got his work schedule here.

285
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,600
He's not on duty.

286
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,050
Where is he?

287
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,960
You shouldn't be walking alone.

288
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,020
My car's just 2 blocks
ahead in the parking lot.

289
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,100
Well,I'll drive you.

290
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,980
It's ok.

291
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,650
No,it's not.

292
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,550
It's my job to keep you safe.

293
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,470
Hop in.

294
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,580
- Ok.
- No,no,no.Front.

295
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,210
you like music?

296
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,600
Not sure what you're all into.

297
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,210
This is good.

298
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,460
I have a daughter,but
she's younger than you.

299
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,040
She's pretty.

300
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,320
Judge says I can't see her.

301
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,340
I'm sorry.

302
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,290
You wouldn't do that,would you?

303
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,380
What?

304
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,720
Make a baby with somebody
and then take her away.

305
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,320
No. No.

306
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,230
You swear?

307
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,490
What?

308
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,900
Swear to me.

309
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,480
I swear.

310
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,670
you're not a liar,are you?

311
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,430
No.

312
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,620
My ex-wife is a liar.

313
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,790
Um,this is my parking lot.

314
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,870
I'll drive you to your car.

315
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,320
It's ok.

316
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,630
No,the entrance is
right around the block.

317
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,690
- Please.
- Don't argue with me!

318
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,390
Nathan tubbs!

319
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,720
Hands where I can see 'em!

320
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,340
Hands where I can see them!

321
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,640
- Get out of the car.
- What's going on?

322
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,860
- Get out of the car.
- What is this about?

323
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,400
Get out of the car.

324
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,840
- I didn't-
- get down!

325
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,560
Get down! Get down!

326
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,590
You ok?Did he hurt you?

327
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,260
- No.
- Ok.

328
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,240
It's ok.

329
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,380
Ok.It's ok.

330
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,280
Don't move.

331
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,550
Don't move.

332
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,360
I was protecting her.

333
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,580
What's this?

334
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,880
This is over.

335
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,520
Nathan tubbs--
he was easy.

336
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,790
There was a time in my career when I would
have asked the question I should have asked.

337
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,050
The worst trap for a profiler
to fall into is pride,

338
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,600
forgetting that for all your
skills,profiling is just.

339
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,610
a tool.

340
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,460
Am I under arrest?

341
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,180
I just want to visit for a while.

342
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,150
I didn't murder anyone.

343
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,330
You weren't supposed
to be working tonight.

344
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,700
They asked us to pick up extra shifts.

345
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,400
There's a killer out there.

346
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,750
Oh,I know.

347
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,880
You were at every crime scene.

348
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,850
It's my job.

349
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,630
You seem to be doing it better
than any of your coworkers.

350
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,820
People should be thanking me.

351
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,650
Thank you.

352
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,880
You think just because I'm a security
guard,I don't understand sarcasm?

353
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,400
Are you angry?

354
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,580
I--I know how
interrogation works.

355
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,970
Do you lose your temper easily?

356
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,600
Is this fun for you?

357
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,250
No.

358
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,170
How's it going out there?

359
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,540
Gideon's winding him up.

360
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,440
Smart.

361
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,970
Yone who exhibits that much
overkill is bound to explode.

362
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,510
How goes it in here?

363
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,310
Means of subduing the victim,potential
weapon,source of displaced rage,

364
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,220
stressor,evidence of a
self-destructive spiral,

365
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,930
and trophies of his kills.

366
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,600
Everything that points to the
profile,yet nothing we could hold him on.

367
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,310
That looks like it hurts.

368
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
I've been under a lot of stress.

369
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,020
The murders?

370
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,050
Your job?

371
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,480
A lot of things.

372
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,850
You keep clips of the
murders on your wall.

373
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,720
Rkm woi'in' on the case.

374
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,070
You had a knife on you.

375
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,510
We're not allowed guns.

376
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,000
Are you allowed knives?

377
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,280
She's pretty,isn't she?

378
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,910
The girl you picked up
tonight was a brunette.

379
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,950
Oh,was she?

380
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,950
Telling me you didn't notice?

381
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,930
Do you like brunettes?

382
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,690
Used to.

383
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,390
Not anymore.

384
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,040
Not so much.

385
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,310
You know,I wouldn't mind
some actual physical evidence.

386
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,330
Do we have anything?

387
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,330
The knife tubbs had
on him is inconclusive.

388
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,720
The taser didn't have any prints on it,

389
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,990
which I guarantee means we're
not gonna get a dna match either.

390
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,330
I'll stop by the security offices.

391
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,150
If tubbs kept any trophies linking himself to
the crimes,he might have kept 'em in his locker.

392
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,900
I'll go with you.

393
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,230
No,let reid do it.

394
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,260
Go to the hotel. Check in.

395
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,890
They're not gonna
hold our rooms forever.

396
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,900
We'll go in shifts.

397
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,520
I'll sleep when he confesses.

398
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,180
We all will.

399
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,100
Why don't you charge me?

400
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,090
Are you guilty?

401
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,540
Well,you seem to have already
made up your mind that I am.

402
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,230
I told you you and i are just visiting.

403
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,450
Right.

404
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,280
Do you really want to know what I think?

405
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:49,320
I think you chew your cuticles to punish
yourself over what your hands have been doing.

406
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,660
I think you hate your ex-wife.

407
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,660
I think you want to kill her.

408
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,920
But you can't because she's the mother
of your daughter,so you find girls

409
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,470
who remind you of her
and you kill them instead.

410
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,550
You stab them over and
over,'cause they deserve it.

411
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,850
If not now,they will sooner or later.

412
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,590
You're just saving someone
else the nightmare later on.

413
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,280
And then.

414
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,110
you remember your daughter,

415
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,960
how you're actually supposed
to be looking after these girls.

416
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,170
So you feel bad,and you.

417
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,150
cross their arms over their chests,try
to give 'em back some of their dignity.

418
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,270
My job is protecting these girls.

419
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,800
Like you can't protect your daughter.

420
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,860
I am a good father.

421
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,400
Why won't the judge let you see her?

422
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,660
I'm not gonna talk about that.

423
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,560
Why did you fail your police
psychological evaluation?

424
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,300
I want a lawyer.

425
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,800
Bag these,get 'em to a lab.

426
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,740
Jim,do you mind giving me a
reason you're holding my client?

427
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,920
We were looking for someone
who was part of the campus,

428
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,020
who had motive and opportunity and
injected himself into the investigation.

429
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,310
So you had a hunch.

430
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,610
We have a comprehensive
psychological profile.

431
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,200
Your client fits exactly.

432
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,080
You did tell him we
deal in facts here,right?

433
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,320
Don't be a jackass,paul.

434
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,110
I invited him here.

435
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,470
My client was working
during each of the murders.

436
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,510
He was present at every scene.

437
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,480
Because it's his job.

438
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,430
There's not one witness placing him
anywhere near one of the murders.

439
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,490
There's not a shred
of physical evidence.

440
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,640
Your client was apprehended
with a young woman.

441
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,750
She fits the description
of each of the victims.

442
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,830
Could you imagine the
uproar on this campus

443
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,750
if a brunette woman was killed and people found
out a security guard let her walk to her car alone?

444
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,990
Excuse me.

445
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,370
Did you get tubbs' psych eval?

446
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,180
Yep.

447
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:30,080
Police shrink diagnosed him borderline
with antisocial and sociopathic tendencies.

448
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,190
He's gonna be all over me.

449
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,430
I need to make a decision.

450
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,550
You can hold him for 72
hours without charging him.

451
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,550
What do you think,gideon?

452
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,360
I think only a guilty man can
lay his head down and sleep

453
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,800
when he's facing 3 murder charges.

454
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,070
It's physically
exhausting--

455
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,420
the killing,the
secrets,evading the police.

456
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,380
It's almost a relief when you
don't have to hide anymore.

457
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,750
Tell me you're doing the right thing.

458
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,530
We're holding him for 72 hours.

459
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,450
Everyone is so much younger
than I remember being.

460
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,310
It's a weird age.

461
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,860
You want to be treated like an adult,but you're still
used to someone else solving your problems for you.

462
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,860
All I remember is trying
to figure out who I was.

463
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,420
You move around enough,you get used
to being whoever people want you to be.

464
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,960
Hey,J.J.

465
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,920
Hey,there's a rumor going
around that you caught the guy.

466
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,690
Is it--is
it true?

467
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,920
We have someone in custody.

468
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,790
Thank you.

469
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,870
It was like you could physically
feel the mood change on the campus.

470
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,140
Kids--they're
so resilient.

471
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,980
They trust and believe in a way I
remember but can't reach anymore.

472
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,490
Like a very old picture.

473
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,740
If she was a cartoon character,she'd
have steam blowing out of her ears.

474
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,160
She is a cartoon character.

475
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,020
You remember the circumstances
with the feelings,the emotions.

476
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,630
They're just out of your grasp.

477
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,040
All right. See ya.

478
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,180
No. No.

479
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,000
Well,I can't study here.

480
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,480
- That's the point.
- Ok.

481
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,160
I'm going to the cafe. It's open late.

482
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,620
Technically you still have a curfew.

483
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,820
Yeah,well,technically I don't care.

484
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,010
Go crazy,girl.

485
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,680
They believed in us. Believed in me.

486
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,990
The way sarah believed in me.

487
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,790
And,as with sarah,I feel that I
led them right to the slaughter.

488
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,930
was I even doing there?

489
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:27,130
How many times have I told you that a profiler
cannot do the job if the mind is unfocused?

490
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,110
If anything is going on in your personal
life that would cloud your judgment.

491
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,060
my mind has never been more
unfocused than it was on that campus.

492
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,370
Griffith,we gotta get this barrier
pushed back. We're gettin' pressed.

493
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,590
Joe,give me 10 more
feet on the tape,huh?

494
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,220
I thought you had someone in custody.

495
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,160
We do.

496
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,030
- Ma'am,can you help me with the students?
- How?

497
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,820
Tell them we understand that they're
upset,but we need room to do our job.

498
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,060
Yeah.

499
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,740
I guess we can release tubbs after all.

500
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,450
Well,I think that'd be a mistake.

501
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,580
What are you talkin' about?

502
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,900
I don't think it was the same killer.

503
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,930
You gotta be kidding me.

504
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,700
She has blunt-force trauma to the head.

505
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,680
She was knocked out,not tasered.

506
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,770
She's a brunette,stabbed
to death on this campus.

507
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,010
These stab wounds are shallow.
They're hesitation marks.

508
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,230
Whoever killed her either wasn't sure they wanted
to be killing,or they never tried it before.

509
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,510
There are no defensive wounds,just
like every other victim.

510
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,610
- That's not surprising,considering the head wound.
- Excuse me.

511
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,110
Sir,uh,this was dropped at the precinct.

512
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,990
There were no prints on it.

513
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,730
"He's innocent. I'm still out here.

514
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,310
" Now do you believe
we have the wrong guy?

515
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,530
The first unsub showed remorse.

516
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,050
He wouldn't brag about
or flaunt his latest kill.

517
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,950
I don't believe this.

518
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,680
This victim wasn't posed.

519
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,720
The papers never included
details abt outhe bodies.

520
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,120
If this was a copycat,he could only do it
the way he assumed the first killer did.

521
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,630
Look,I asked you guys here
because I needed your help.

522
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,210
You're the experts,but right now,it sounds to
me like you're trying to cover your own asses.

523
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,450
Hey,look around. This is not
the place for this conversation.

524
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,240
I am so sorry.

525
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,530
You said you caught him.

526
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,980
I--I said we had
someone in custody.

527
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,500
Alisa's dead and you're
arguing over wording?

528
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,180
No. I--I'm
so sorry.

529
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,690
You need to keep people out of here,man.

530
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,690
What? I'm fine.It's nothing.

531
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,110
Just wait here for a second.

532
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,520
Tubbs' lawyer's been here for the
last hour demanding we release him.

533
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,290
What's happened out there?

534
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,720
I think we got a copycat.

535
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,880
Do you want to tell me why the
hell my client hasn't been released?

536
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,060
Cut me some slack here,paul.

537
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,320
You've got another murder and
a note from the real killer.

538
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,190
We're discussing that.

539
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,770
I'm not saying he's not a creep.

540
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,350
I'm just saying he didn't do this.

541
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,290
Just take a seat,please. Ok?

542
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,950
Come on.Give us a second.

543
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,170
- Everybody still in the conference room?
- Yeah

544
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,770
How long can you hold that lawyer off?

545
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,990
You kidding? I was a prosecutor.

546
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,850
I can hold him off for days.

547
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,890
So you think we're makin' a mistake,huh?

548
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,970
I know we're tired.

549
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,910
There's a lot of pressure. We all
want to believe that profile is right.

550
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,510
I believe it is.

551
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,650
What if we're wrong,gideon?

552
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,200
Tubbs enticed that
girl to get in his car.

553
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,960
There's nothing to suggest that
the unsub has ever done that before.

554
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,620
There's also nothing
to suggest he hasn'T.

555
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,380
I know how bad cops want to
believe they got the right guy.

556
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,630
I've been on both sides of that.

557
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,730
- This last kill had a different signature.
- I know

558
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,160
I also know that richard jewell fit the
profile of the olympic bomber to a "t,"

559
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,230
and he was innocent,

560
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,400
but the accusations tore apart his life.

561
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,420
I can't believe we're actually
thinking about letting tubbs go.

562
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,960
J.J.,We got no evidence.

563
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,960
Tubbs' lawyer's not gonna let him talk,so
we're not about to get a confession out of him.

564
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,990
Yeah,but we can still hold
him for another 48 more hours.

565
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,370
You can't hold a suspect
indefinitely with no evidence.

566
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,600
Not indefinitely,48 hours.

567
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,920
It's enough time to clear the campus.

568
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:00,300
Can we please forget about tubbs for a
minute? Let's just say we have a copycat.

569
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,220
What are we talkin' about?

570
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,870
The most common examples are ones that people
don't always think of of being copycats--

571
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,250
uh,kids who commit school
shootings,also teen suicides.

572
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,550
They tend to come in clusters.

573
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,700
Both models,we're talking about an age
range that's consistent with the campus.

574
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,840
School shootings fit the
classic copycat model.

575
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,710
They want their own piece of
the glory,they're competing.

576
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,480
Ok,but that doesn't jibe
with whoever wrote this note.

577
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,840
"He's innocent."

578
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,100
It's about freeing tubbs,not
trying to steal any credit.

579
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,940
So could tubbs have a partner?

580
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,250
Yeah,sure. That's possible,but
I think it's highly unlikely.

581
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,890
I mean,come on,look
at tubbs. He's a loner.

582
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,680
He's antisocial. He's
not the partner type.

583
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,850
Could be more like a groupie.

584
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,760
After kenneth bianchi was arrested,

585
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,970
he actually convinced a woman he
hardly knew to attempt a murder

586
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,670
so the police would think the
hillside strangler was still at large.

587
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,230
But tubbs subdues his victims
first. He's not powerful.

588
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,810
Not to mention the stabbing
most likely means he's impotent.

589
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,090
Groupie doesn't have to know that.

590
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,900
All they have to believe is that
tubbs answers some need inside them.

591
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:53,670
And whoever wrote this definitely
needs something from nathan tubbs.

592
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,720
"I'm still out here.

593
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,200
I can't believe he's
walking out of here.

594
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,330
It's the right thing to do.

595
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,390
Remind me of that the next time i have to tell
someone their friend or daughter's been murdered.

596
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,830
You still think he's guilty,don't you?

597
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,770
Your security cams up and running?

598
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,930
- Yeah.
- Good.

599
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,220
We're gonna need 'em.

600
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,890
- I know you can't
stand me- - no offense.

601
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,380
I'm just not up for this right now,ok?

602
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,950
I need your help.

603
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,940
I went to tell anna begley that the dorm
is officially closing tomorrow at curfew.

604
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,840
She wouldn't even open her door.

605
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,400
She told me she won't leave campus.

606
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,510
What do you want?

607
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,400
- You dyed your hair dark.
- So?

608
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,960
What do you want?

609
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,500
stephanie is flipping out
about closing the dorm.

610
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,850
She wants me to make sure that you understand
that we can't stay here past tomorrow night.

611
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,120
Tell her after tomorrow,I
won't be anybody's problem.

612
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,440
Freak.

613
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,070
*******

614
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:24,390
Was my judgment clouded by a need to
make someone pay for sarah's death?

615
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,600
Somebody take my clothes?

616
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,320
I didn't know who else to call.

617
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,850
What is it?

618
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,830
CAMPUS SAFETY

619
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,650
I want to talk to you.

620
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,590
Um,I'm sorry. I don't work here anymore.

621
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,190
Do you like it?

622
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,530
Um,do--do
I know you?

623
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,340
Do you want to?

624
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:28,900
Every girl I know is either
bleaching her hair or buying a wig,

625
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,830
and she goes and dyes her hair dark?

626
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,140
I agree it's weird,but ...

627
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,840
I don't think it's anything
to be overly alarmed about.

628
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,040
Is there something else?

629
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,470
I think I saw stories about
the murders taped to her wall,

630
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,260
and there was,like,blood
or something all over them.

631
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,910
What can you tell us about
anna's usual mental state?

632
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,220
I don't know.

633
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,800
No one really knows her very well.

634
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,330
She doesn't play well
with others,you know.

635
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,160
Anything?

636
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,180
I know she cuts herself.

637
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,070
She covers it up,but people know.

638
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,100
Has she ever been
violent towards others?

639
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,350
I don't think so.

640
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,870
Does she ever talk about suicide?

641
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,710
Talk to us.

642
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,030
She talks about it all the time.

643
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,370
But everyone makes fun of her,like she
thinks she's some goth chick sylvia plath.

644
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,990
Hey,gideon,it's reid.

645
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,450
Are morgan and prentiss
still following tubbs?

646
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,130
I think I know who we're looking for.

647
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,120
It's good that you called us.

648
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,470
It's not just the others
who make fun of her.

649
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,800
It's me,too.

650
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,090
Gideon,we ga otbrunette that just approached
tubbs outside the security offices.

651
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,970
Good. Hotch is having them
uplink the security monitor.

652
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,230
Got it.

653
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,130
Ok,they're on the move.
What do you want us to do?

654
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,870
Stick with 'em. Keep your distance.

655
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,750
We have video. Hotch and I
will be your eyes and ears.

656
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,440
Got it. Let's go.

657
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,590
I picked this spot because
no one walks back here.

658
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,570
We'll be all alone.

659
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,900
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

660
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,750
No. You're the one I need.

661
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,690
Yeah,they just walked into a courtyard.

662
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,730
We can't get an eye line
without them seeing us.

663
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,170
- Got an image?
- Got 'em.

664
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,800
Uh,the security camera
microphone is unidirectional.

665
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,670
The audio pickups are
only good for so far.

666
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,860
We've got it as loud as it
can go without distorting.

667
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,260
All we got to go on
right now is a profile.

668
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,470
I need you to get as close as you
can until he makes a move on her

669
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,730
or either one of 'em admits to murder.

670
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,790
Ok. Just give us the go.

671
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,750
Let's get close.

672
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,460
Maybe we should go somewhere else.

673
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,240
The other girls were all on campus.

674
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,540
What other girls?

675
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,350
I know what you did.

676
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,280
We could go to my apartment.

677
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,960
- You killed those girls.
- You're wrong.

678
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,690
Police let me go.

679
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,840
Only because someone else
committed another murder.

680
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,210
We can't move.

681
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,840
No,he hasn't done anything.

682
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,350
Hey,guys,talk to me. What's going on?

683
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,000
She's offering him a knife.

684
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,630
- Did he take it?
- No.

685
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,400
She wants to be a victim.

686
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,190
This is a trick.

687
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,880
It's not.

688
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,630
I want you to do it.

689
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,670
I'm ready.

690
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,260
I told them I'm not stupid.

691
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,020
Please.

692
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,590
I can't do it myself.

693
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,030
You're crazy.

694
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,770
I killed someone for you.

695
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,690
I even liked her.

696
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,590
Go,go,go.

697
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:59,180
- Listen,you stupid bitch,I'm not gonna say or do anything to you.
- Where are they?

698
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,360
Fbi!

699
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,760
- Fbi!
- Put down the knife!

700
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,430
Put the knife down!

701
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,230
Morgan: Listen to her.

702
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,650
Drop the knife!

703
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,860
- Are you gonna shoot me?
- Just put the knife down.

704
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,920
Nobody's gonna shoot you.

705
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,110
- No!
- No!

706
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,580
No!

707
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,470
Call an ambulance!

708
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,310
Stay with me.*******

709
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,100
Two more dead.

710
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,730
Was it a price that needed to be paid?

711
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,670
Is death ever worth it?

712
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,620
Was the world always this gray?

713
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,180
Is it only in the movies
that it's black and white?

714
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,540
Is that just an illusion?

715
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,580
I used to know.

716
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,450
I used to understand my place,my
direction,where I was headed.

717
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,330
Profiling requires belief.

718
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,040
Belief in the profile.
Belief in yourself.

719
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,030
After sarah,I no longer
trust myself at home.

720
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,890
But after tubbs,I no longer
trust myself in the field.

721
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,250
And without that,I have nothing.

722
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,280
I didn't even know you
could take off this early.

723
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,020
Ah,we wanted to leave at first light.

724
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,410
I get it.

725
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,600
So I guess. thank you.

726
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,520
- Thank you.
- Bye

727
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,080
Gideon.

728
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,110
you knew how this was
gonna end,didn't you?

729
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,020
I never thought anyone would die.

730
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,020
No,of course not. I know that.

731
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,620
I mean the copycat.

732
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,340
You knew the two of them would find each
other. That's why you let tubbs go,isn't it?

733
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,750
Look,I trusted the profile.

734
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,290
At best,it's always
just an educated guess.

735
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,530
- It was the best chance of catching them.
- I know.

736
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,190
Anna begley was ill. Her
suicide may have been inevitable.

737
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,530
And tubbs?

738
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,230
He killed 3 women.

739
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,250
Right.

740
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,980
What if we were wrong?

741
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,560
I've been on the phone with the
flagstaff,arizona,police all morning.

742
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:58,240
Did you actually allow a
disturbed college student

743
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,680
to meet with a man you
believed to be a serial killer?

744
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,610
We didn't know who,but we knew
a meeting would take place.

745
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,090
We?

746
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,300
I,ma'am.

747
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,480
It was my decision.

748
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:12,270
And now that student is dead.

749
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,610
She committed suicide,yes.

750
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,890
After killing the unsub.

751
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,800
How could you let this happen?

752
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,200
It was not the outcome we had hoped for.

753
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:25,270
It wasn't the outcome you had hoped for?

754
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,090
- That's your answer to me?
- Yes,ma'am.

755
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,870
- Give me your badge.
- Ma'am?

756
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,580
You're suspended for
2 weeks without pay,

757
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,530
pending an investigation
of your conduct.

758
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,740
And,agent hotchner.

759
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:44,760
if it were solely up to me,you would
never get these credentials back.

760
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,200
Always a pleasure.

761
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,200
And that was the last domino.

762
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,240
the death of that girl.

763
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,330
Hotch being suspended over
something that was my fault.

764
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,180
I said at the beginning of this letter
that I knew it would be you to come up here.

765
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,310
I'm sorry the explanation
couldn't be better.

766
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,620
And I am so sorry that
it doesn't make more se E.

767
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,250
but I've already told you

768
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:19,190
I just don't understand
any of it anymore.

769
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,200
I'm sorry.
