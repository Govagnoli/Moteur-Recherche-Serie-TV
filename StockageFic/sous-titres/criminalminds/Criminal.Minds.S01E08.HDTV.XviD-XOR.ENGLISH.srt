00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's go, Jimmy, I'm late already

0
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,000
OK, grandma
Let's do this

0
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,300
You, boy, perhaps your bed time?

0
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,900
We got a place to be, right?

1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
You remember what's like to being young, don't you?

2
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,800
You're kidding right?

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,300
You don't remember what you eat for lunch.

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,400
You hear that, regular ...

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Jimmy.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,700
Hey!

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,100
Where have you been?

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,400
With your old lady. How about you?

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,900
Is it your friend?

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,800
What friend? This guy pinched me a few years back.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,100
Right. You keep it clean these days?

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,900
Oh yeah, I'm a nine-to-fiver...

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm a re-ha-bili-tated.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,400
Yeah, but you step out of the line again

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,700
when you do, your ass is mine.

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,000
Since when your friend is a cop?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
What? You see him as my friend, do you?

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,200
It's not what I'm saying.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,900
The people that I work for ...

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,800
...

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,300
You don't trust me, friend?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,100
You make up your mind.

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,200
All right, all right. Let's go.

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,200
You'll gonna ...

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,900
You ever gonna stop bitching?

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,200
Why don't you come in?

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,900
You know my landlord set a place for you.

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,000
Rain check, Fredi.

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,300
I see you later.

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,300
All right.

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,900
... Do you know what time it is?

32
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,100
...

33
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,100
Oh my god!

34
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,600
Somebody help me!

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,000
...

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,400
Baltimore PD see ...

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,700
We got two bodies id as ...

38
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,800
retired, 37 years old, no kids.

39
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,500
Neighbor reports white male, 20 to 40 years old ...

40
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,800
...

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,300
I went to ...

42
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,900
So far it sounds like a standard double homicide. Why we were here?

43
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,900
Massive...

44
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,500
... was found here. Tied to the chair in front of ...

45
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
No defensive...

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,800
Look at the marks on the bricks.

47
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,200
One clean ...

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,400
What ...

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,300
The husband ... was found in shower.

50
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,200
But he wasn't quite as lucky.

51
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,200
Look at the marks on the bricks and ankles

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,800
...

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,300
Despite all the blood, this crime scene chose

54
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,500
method, order, control, it's pretty organized.

55
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,900
There's also evidence of torture with the husband.

56
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,800
burns, ...

57
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,000
The tortures the unsub ...

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
So maybe we have more than one killer 

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,600
we have one killer with more than one personality.

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,100
...

61
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,600
For...

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,600
whoever...

63
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,300
...

64
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,500
Which means the victim was dismembered.

65
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Looks like our guy took all the parts with him.

Hemingway wrote

67
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,300
"There is no hunting like the hunting of man.

68
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,600
and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it

69
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
never really care for anything else".

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,400
Possible suspect is a white male, 20 to 40 years old.

71
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,300
Okay. What do we know about the unsub ...

72
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,800
Typically torture falls into two categories, sadistic and functional.

73
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,700
Functional torture use to extract information or punishment.

74
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,000
... impersonal, completely disinterested.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,100
Like a ...

76
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,600
Exactly. The sadistic torture which is used to extract some sort of

77
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
emotional lead.

78
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,900
But sadists are sexually deviant

79
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,000
yet there is no evidence of sexual contact.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,500
...

81
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,400
What do you mean?

82
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,800
We don't have their body yet.

83
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,100
Okay, so I have ...

84
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,400
He probably killed her first.

85
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,100
Proved to be ...

86
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,800
Psychological torture before the physical pain.

87
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,800
...

88
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
It was too brief.

89
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,400
It was over too quickly.

90
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,600
And the husband ... with him he took his time.

91
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,700
There doesn't seem to be any wasted effort

92
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,400
no hesitation on the unsub part.

93
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
I mean, Gideon, look around. What he did...

94
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,600
it's a lot of work.

95
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,300
We're either dealing with a professional or--

96
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,800
a pure psychopath.

97
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,800
Hey it's me. I got trouble man, serious trouble.

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,600
Don't tell me to relax, damn it!

99
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,700
I ran into a detective I know last night.

100
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Freddy saw it.

101
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,600
I'll meet you at 8:00.

102
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,100
Nothing more we can do here until the third victim turns up.

103
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm guessing there's a connection to him.

104
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,600
He doesn't want that victim identified.

105
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,000
Have Garcia go through open files in Maryland

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,400
see if any of them involve this level of torture.

107
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,300
Got it.

108
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Have her check the surrounding states as well if...

109
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,900
the guy's a pro, why do jobs only close to home?

110
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,300
How far back do you want her to go?

111
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,700
At least 10 years.

112
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
The guy's no rookie.

113
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,300
Third victim was positively id'd as a low-level mob guy.

114
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,000
Frederick "freddy" Condore.

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He was the nephew of the older couple.

116
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,700
Body parts were found in 7 different
trash cans 2 blocks from the crime scene.

117
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,100
Were they able to completely reassemble the body?

118
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,500
Killer didn't keep any trophies.

119
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,300
Is there any evidence that he got off?

120
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,300
No.

121
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,400
Garcia has a number of unsolved murders in D.C., Virginia

122
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,600
and Maryland over the past 15 years.

123
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,300
Many of them have ties to organized crime

124
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,700
all different M.O.S.

125
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,900
What's the connection?

126
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,700
Torture.

127
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,400
Marks on the bones are consistent with the same cutting tool.

128
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,800
Tortured victims, most tied to organized crime...

129
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,200
no signs of sexual sadism.

130
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,000
We're looking for a hit man.

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,400
No, a hit man doesn't need to torture to get the job done.

132
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,000
Two things--

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,300
Baltimore just forwarded a sketch of the man running from the scene

134
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,900
and, uh, you've got some agents out there

135
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,900
who think that you're poaching on their turf.

136
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll handle it.

137
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,900
SSA Hotchner.

138
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,700
Josh Cramer, special agent in charge of organized crime, Baltimore.

139
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,000
- SSA Gideon.
- Jason gideon.

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,600
BAU's pretty famous.

141
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,000
Brought the whole team, huh?

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,300
Yeah, we were in town.

143
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
We were just going over the case. You want to join us?

144
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
I'd love to, but I can't stay.

145
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,100
I just wanted to come down and say thank you

146
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,400
for going to Baltimore yesterday looking into this for us

147
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,100
but now that it's pretty obviously an organized crime case

148
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,900
we're gonna go ahead and take over for you.

149
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,900
I'm sure you guys have enough to do with your psychos.

150
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,200
You don't think that the guy who killed the Dimarcos is a psycho?

151
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,900
What he is now is my problem.

152
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,000
But again, thanks for coming out.

153
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,600
Anything we can do to help.

154
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,000
Appreciate that. We're pretty good at this.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,100
- You got it.
- All right.

156
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,000
You know where we live.

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,700
Okay.

158
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,500
So we just gonna drop it?

159
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,200
These guys don't know what they're dealing with.

160
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Our unsub is male, intelligent, organized, and methodical.

161
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,600
He has the confidence of a man
who's been killing for a long time.

162
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,300
Only victim removed from the scene is Freddy Condore

163
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
indicating some tie to him.

164
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,400
Elle, you and Reid stay on Condore's background with Garcia.

165
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,000
Dig deep, see what turns up.

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,100
Condore worked as a supervisor

167
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,800
at a scrap metal yard in Baltimore.

168
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,900
It's owned by a guy named Michael Russo, boss of a small mob crew.

169
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,500
I'm gonna grab Hotch and go check him out.

170
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,100
Michael Russo?

171
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,800
Agents Hotchner and Morgan, FBI.

172
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
What do you want?

173
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,600
Freddy Condore.

174
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,100
He didn't show up for work today.

175
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,200
He didn't call, nothin'.

176
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,100
Probably because he and his aunt and uncle were murdered last night.

177
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,600
Really?

178
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,500
It's too bad.

179
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,300
I can tell you're all busted up about it. 

180
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,600
Look, I don't speak smart-ass

181
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,000
so you got something to say to me...

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,200
It was a professional hit.

183
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,500
Either you're in charge of our business or you're not.

184
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,500
This is you think I'm in, huh?

185
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Look around. I'm in scrap metal.

186
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,000
It's all about recycling. That's where the money is, my friend--

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
saving the earth.

188
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,300
You've got a big problem.

189
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,100
You know, the mob isn't what it used to be.

190
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,700
Ain't easy always fighting for respect, is it?

191
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,300
You always gotta fight for what's yours.

192
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,900
One of your boys steps out of line--

193
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,600
you hit him hard, you make it count, right?

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,100
Is that what happened to Freddy?

195
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,000
Look. You got a case to make,
you run along, get your papers

196
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and come back with the bracelets.

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Otherwise, I got a business to run.

198
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,600
You're breathing on my neck.

199
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Um, sorry. Sorry for that.

200
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,900
You two having fun?

201
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Oh, yeah. Sifting through the life and times

202
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,700
of Freddy Condore with Dr. Reid here

203
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,400
is a party I wouldn't want to miss.

204
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,000
Credit card receipts show Freddy loved crab cakes

205
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,100
preferred light beer

206
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,200
and used to spend his Thursday nights with a woman in fells point.

207
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,000
An, uh, expensive woman.

208
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
What about his associates?

209
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,700
Most of them have criminal records.

210
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,900
That much I guessed.

211
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,900
But one of them is particularly interesting.

212
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Pull up James Baker's rap sheet.

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,600
He spent time in juvenile detention for attempted murder

214
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,100
was released at age 21, and then subsequently arrested for--

215
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,300
and this is in order--

216
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:48,500
armed robbery, petty theft, burglary, narcotics sales, and rape.

217
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,100
But there's no other sexual assault complaints in his file.

218
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,500
Absolutely nothing.

219
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,200
I told you it was interesting.

220
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,400
What's so interesting about that?

221
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,900
When it comes to psychological behavior, anything is possible

222
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,800
but this criminal history--it just isn't probable.

223
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,500
I mean, as a minor, he began with attempted murder

224
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,100
and then devolved into pettier crimes?

225
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,100
It's the criminal history of a fractured schizophrenic

226
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,000
with multiple personality disorder.

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,400
It just does not make sense.

228
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,800
Unless someone made that rap sheet up

229
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,100
and they weren't thinking about the behavior--

230
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,000
they just plugged in whatever sounded good.

231
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,300
Hold on. His mug shot's coming up.

232
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,100
I got an address for you to hit.

233
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,700
Clear.

234
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,700
- Clear.
- Copy that.

235
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,200
It's clear here.

236
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,700
Morgan, this is weird.

237
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,000
There's nothing here.

238
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,100
It's like nobody lives here.

239
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I guess he wasn't expecting company.

240
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Something's wrong.

241
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah, I know.

242
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,800
Look at this place.

243
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,800
It's an artificial dwelling...

244
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,200
to match an artificial past.

245
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,400
Come on, Josh.

246
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,600
Hotch! We got a hot weapon.

247
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,300
Oh, no.

248
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,600
It's a glock 19.

249
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,000
And this round is standard law enforcement issue.

250
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,000
So you're saying Baker's an undercover cop.

251
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,200
I'm saying I did 18 months deep cover

252
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,700
and this place has got all the makings of a crash pad.

253
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,400
All right, where is he?

254
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,300
No, no, he is not here.

255
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100
Baker's missing.

256
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
I told him we'd pick him up at 8:00.

257
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,100
Damn it, damn it, damn it, Jimmy, where the hell are you?

258
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Get in, get in. Come on, let's go.

259
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,300
What the hell is wrong with you people?

260
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,900
Sorry?

261
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,900
I told you, this is my case!

262
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,600
All right, first of all, don't shout at me.

263
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,400
And secondly, you don't decide what cases the BAU works on.

264
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
You ran my agent's gun through ibis?

265
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,900
'Cause I wanted to know who he worked for

266
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
and now that I do, I'd like to talk to him.

267
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,000
You don't have him.

268
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,400
No. You don't know where he is?

269
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,700
He's missing.

270
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,400
How long?

271
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,800
About 12 hours.

272
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,300
Before or after the murders?

273
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,700
You think Jimmy's a suspect?

274
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,300
Well, there's a sketch of someone

275
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,200
who looks an awful lot like him leaving the scene.

276
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,800
That's because he was there. After.

277
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,600
Look, he ran into a couple of Baltimore detectives

278
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,800
and they made him while he was with Condore.

279
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,700
Now, Jimmy tried to play it off

280
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,500
but he didn't think that Condore had bought it

281
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,700
so he wanted to go back and talk to him.

282
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,900
When he saw what was left of the Dimarcos

283
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,000
he called us for a pickup. We showed up.

284
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,900
He didn't.

285
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,900
You think he ran?

286
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,200
No. Jimmy's too experienced to run without contact.

287
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,900
If he's not calling in, then someone's keeping him from doing it.

288
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,200
Who's Jimmy Baker's target?

289
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,500
Michael Russo.

290
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,300
We've been after the guy for 3 years.

291
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Jimmy's been under for almost 2.

292
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,200
We talked to Russo yesterday.

293
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,400
He seemed genuinely surprised by the murders.

294
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,600
And you bought that?

295
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,700
Let me tell you a little something about Michael Russo.

296
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,500
The guy is a liar, and a good one.

297
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,000
If he didn't do it, he knows who did.

298
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,100
You know what? I'm wasting my time with you.

299
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,700
You obviously don't get it.

300
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,500
Agent Cramer, we're not the enemy.

301
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Please sit down.

302
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,100
We're dealing with a very dangerous killer here...

303
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,000
and we need your help.

304
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,400
You know these people better than we do.

305
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,000
This guy--

306
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,200
if he is what you say he is and he has Jimmy

307
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,000
did he kill him already?

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We don't know.

309
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll help you in any way that I can.

310
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,900
You help me get this man back to his family.

311
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,100
Who knows about me, Jimmy?

312
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
What did you tell them?

313
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,500
Nothing.

314
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,800
Nothing.

315
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,800
I promise. Nothing.

316
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
I think you're a liar and a rat.

317
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,700
Oh, please...

318
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,300
you're gonna need a bigger board.

319
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,500
Please tell me you brought some breakfast.

320
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,100
Huh. Trust me, sugar

321
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,200
you are not going to want to eat when you see what's in here.

322
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,400
How many more are there?

323
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,700
Well, I've gone back 15 years and there's over 100.

324
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,600
100 unsolved murders.

325
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah, that we know of. And then there's more coming in.

326
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,500
Well, the torture's consistent.

327
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,000
You know, we thought this guy might have been at it a while

328
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,400
but this many victims, Garcia?

329
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,500
John Wayne Gacy killed at least 30 people.

330
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,200
This guy's more than tripled that.

331
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,300
But this guy gets paid for it. He's a hit man.

332
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,900
No...

333
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
he's more than that.

334
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,800
Not all these victims were mob hits.

335
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,400
You know, my guess is he probably started hunting when he was really young...

336
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,000
perfected his craft, moved on to bigger prey.

337
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,200
Hey, Garcia, look at this.

338
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,100
There's no hesitation wounds on the body.

339
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,600
One clean cut through flesh and bone.

340
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,700
Ok, so what does that tell us?

341
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,500
Most people wouldn't imagine doing something like this

342
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,800
to another human being, but this guy

343
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,200
he doesn't even flinch.

344
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,500
He's got no conscience.

345
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,400
We've got ourselves a serial killer with the perfect career.

346
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,100
Russo has no idea what he's dealing with.

347
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,800
I think we can shake him. Keep looking.

348
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,500
How can I help you, agents?

349
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,700
We're worried about you.

350
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,800
What's causing you to lose sleep?

351
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,800
We hear you didn't order that hit on Freddy.

352
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,600
I told you I had nothing to do with that.

353
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,000
Why don't you take a look in that folder?

354
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,700
Hey...

355
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,500
It looks like you must have
a problem within your organization.

356
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,700
Is that right?

357
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,300
So your hitter doesn't just kill for a paycheck.

358
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,600
He kills for pleasure.

359
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,900
It's what makes him good at what he does.

360
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,100
He's paranoid, he's a psychopath, and he's free-lancing.

361
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
He's killing civilians now

362
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,600
and he's drawing a lot of attentions.

363
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,900
And you can't control him.

364
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,100
That's what he did to Freddy's uncle.

365
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,000
Russo, if he's not a problem for you now, he will be.

366
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,700
What if you let me worry about that?

367
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,700
Russo.

368
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,300
I just got a question for you.

369
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,500
How do you think your paranoid little killer's gonna feel

370
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,800
about you being friendly with FBI, huh?

371
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,400
Just a thought.

372
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,800
Success.

373
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,400
Hotch and Morgan just shook
Russo's confidence in his hit man.

374
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,500
He'll want to bring him in and get a read on him.

375
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,600
What if by playing them against each other

376
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,000
we made Russo as paranoid as his hit man

377
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,500
what would stop them from trying to kill each other?

378
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,000
If that happens, then we'll never find Jimmy Baker alive.

379
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,900
We got a surveillance team outside of Russo's office. Stay on it.

380
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,700
Is this gonna work?

381
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,500
The beam is reflected from the window pane

382
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,300
according to the law of optics.

383
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,100
Yeah, the angle of instance is
equal to the angle of reflection.

384
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
Is it gonna work?

385
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,000
Hey. It's me. I need to see you tonight.

386
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,600
I'll call you from a secure line.

387
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
Apparently.

388
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,500
Hey.

389
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,900
Listen, you brought a lot of heat taking down Freddy like that.

390
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,400
What--I'm dealing with the feds.

391
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,300
Listen, meet me here at the office.

392
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,800
They don't know nothin'.

393
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,500
I'm dealing with them.

394
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,600
Stop being paranoid, Vinnie.

395
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,100
Bingo.

396
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,800
No. Vinnie.

397
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,200
It's pretty remarkable, really.

398
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,700
Nature's got her own cleanup crew.

399
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,200
Flies, larvae, maggots, beetles.

400
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,500
Then there's the big guys, of course.

401
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,400
Rats, squirrels, crows, buzzards.

402
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,400
I learned a long time ago never to kill anybody above 5,000 feet.

403
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,900
It's cold up there.

404
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,100
The evidence tends to linger.

405
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
They'll be along soon.

406
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,700
They like the scent of blood.

407
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,600
Please...

408
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,700
Russo's got 11 associates named Vincent.

409
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,000
No, make that 10. Vincent Cellito died last summer.

410
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,000
You know, here's something.

411
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,000
What can you tell me about Vincent Sartori?

412
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,800
I was still drinking that.

413
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,900
Not only is this equipment expensive, it's also extremely sensitive.

414
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,200
Vincent Sartori.

415
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,400
Currently doing 6 at dannemora for racketeering.

416
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,700
How about this Perotta? There's not much on him.

417
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,500
Can you get into those records?

418
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,600
Despite the fact that they were probably expunged

419
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,900
she can find the faintest echo of deletion and successfully recreate the file

420
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,700
thereby sending us all to prison for computer felony fraud counts.

421
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,600
We can make bail. Garcia?

422
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,900
Already in.

423
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:18,400
Alcohol addiction at 14. Violent outbursts. Assaults.

424
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,500
Once threw a molotov cocktail at someone sitting in their car.

425
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,300
Several notations for aggression.

426
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,900
He once scheduled a visit to an infirmary

427
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,700
to gain access to a boy who looked at him for too long?

428
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,000
No fear. No remorse. Quick temper.

429
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,800
And he was smart enough to stay off the radar as an adult.

430
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,200
Paranoid personality. He could be our guy.

431
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,500
There's absolutely no information on him as an adult.

432
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,900
No driver's license, no utility bills, nothing.

433
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,100
It's like he became a ghost.

434
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,800
Let's just hope they can catch him.

435
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Remember, we need this man alive.

436
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,600
It's all clear.

437
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,700
Nothing.

438
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,000
Hotch.

439
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,300
Hotch, let me take him!

440
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,700
Gideon, I got a head shot. That's it.

441
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,200
Don't take it. We need him alive.

442
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,000
You Okay?

443
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,200
Take your time for once in your life.

444
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,200
It's all right.

445
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,500
There's a van around the corner.

446
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,300
Looks like blood all over.

447
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,900
It's being processed right now.

448
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Whatever they find they're going to send over to Quantico.

449
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,500
They got Jimmy's jacket.

450
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,200
Take off.

451
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
We don't have time for this little show.

452
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,900
Interrogation techniques say make the guy comfortable

453
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,500
make him your friend. Give him a way out.

454
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,700
That's how you get a confession.

455
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,500
That may work with a common criminal. It's not gonna work here.

456
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,200
Why is that?

457
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Because anti-social personality disorder means never trust anyone with anything at any time.

458
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,500
Then what are you supposed to do?

459
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,400
Make him uncomfortable.

460
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,900
This was all in his van?

461
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,300
Yep. They guy wasn't exactly neat.

462
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,600
Classic anti-social personality. What are these tapes?

463
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't know.

464
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,200
Why don't you and Garcia go take a look, let us know all right?

465
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,800
Yeah. Movie night. I'll make popcorn.

466
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,100
Go home.

467
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,200
I'm fine. He's got a little slack.

468
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,800
Morgan says he's secure, he's secure.

469
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,500
- Uh, Jason.
- Yeah?

470
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,000
Let's not give him a weapon.

471
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,500
He's kind of strong.

472
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,200
Hey, Hotch. I'll be ok.

473
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm supervisory special agent Jason Gideon

474
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,900
federal bureau of investigation.

475
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,600
You afraid of me, Jason?

476
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,200
You were advised of your rights?

477
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,400
Take these off and we'll really talk.

478
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,800
Were you advised of your rights?

479
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,900
I know my rights.

480
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
You want to talk?

481
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,800
I got nothin' to hide.

482
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,100
Good.

483
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,500
How's it going? Don't turn your back on him, Gideon.

484
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,000
Hotch, you know how he is.

485
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,200
He's just trying to show him that he's not intimidated.

486
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,500
It's not about fear. It's about being dismissive.

487
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Perotta could assume that he's disrespecting him.

488
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,600
Why don't we turn these cameras off?

489
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,300
I'll get him to tell us where Jimmy is.

490
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,100
That wouldn't work.

491
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,600
You sure about that?

492
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah. He was probably abused by one or both of his parents.

493
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,400
He's learned to take the pain.

494
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
And that's why he has no compassion for anyone else's.

495
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,500
You gotta trust us.

496
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,500
Your not organized crime.

497
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,000
No. We're behavioral analysis.

498
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What's that mean?

499
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,200
Well...we study how you think, why you do what you do.

500
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
No kidding?

501
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,500
We have a word for you.

502
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
You got a word for me?

503
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,000
Oh, yeah. Actually, we have a few.

504
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,700
Psychopath. Paranoid personality disorder.

505
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,900
That's quite a mouthful, Jason.

506
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Yes, it is.

507
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,700
Michael Russo set me up, didn't he?

508
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,300
Do you recognize this man?

509
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,000
No.

510
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,900
How about them? Anyone look familiar?

511
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,800
Wait a minute. The third guy over.

512
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,700
I think he does those late night commercials for the dead worms.

513
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,300
You know, softies.

514
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,000
That's funny to you?

515
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,300
It's just interesting that you'd choose that expression.

516
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,800
You have problems performing?

517
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Not me.

518
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,100
Where's he going with this?

519
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
There's no evidence this guy can't perform.

520
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,400
Gideon knows that. He's just pushing his buttons.

521
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,900
Does murder excite you?

522
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,700
Is it the only thing that can give you a sexual release?

523
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,100
Vincent.

524
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,700
I believe you're an extremely impotent man.

525
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,500
Take these off we'll see.

526
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,800
Where's Jimmy, you son of a bitch?!

527
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,000
He's a federal agent!

528
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,800
I will personally execute you! Personally!

529
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,300
Baker is a federal agent. I knew it.

530
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Where is he, Vincent?

531
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Hey, Jason.

532
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,100
Is it still called paranoid if I'm right?

533
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,900
10 bucks says this involves naked coeds and a plumber.

534
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,200
What?

535
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,500
Never mind.

536
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,000
Ok, who's that?

537
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,700
I have no idea.

538
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,800
Put another tape in.

539
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Oh, my god.

540
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,900
I'll be back.

541
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,500
What the hell is wrong with you?

542
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,800
We don't have time for this, all right?

543
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,500
My friend might still be alive out there somewhere.

544
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,800
You just told him Baker was a federal agent.

545
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,400
He may never tell us now.

546
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,200
I told him to hang tough.

547
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,900
What?

548
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,800
Jimmy.

549
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
When he called me, I told him to stick with the assignment

550
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,700
that we didn't need to bring him in right away.

551
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,600
Hey, I had too much invested, all right? Too much time.

552
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,900
And I wanted Russo.

553
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
So we waited 24 hours to go in for him.

554
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,200
By the time we got there--

555
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,500
guys, there's a chance agent Baker's being tortured

556
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,800
and I think I know how.

557
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,400
After you.

558
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,700
Oh, my god.

559
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,900
Oh, no.

560
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,900
You needed me?

561
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,200
Yeah. These are faces of new victims off the videotapes we found.

562
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,000
Check with local PDs

563
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,600
see if they have any open homicides or missings that might correspond.

564
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,000
Are those rats?

565
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,700
Yeah.

566
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,000
What are we gonna do?

567
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,900
Well, we looked at all the stuff in the van and beside the videotapes

568
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,100
there's nothing that interesting.

569
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,800
I got Garcia going over the sound on the tapes

570
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
trying to isolate the background noise.

571
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Maybe something there will help.

572
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,600
The good news is

573
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,500
it seems like they were all filmed in the same space.

574
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,300
It could be some sort of home base for him?

575
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,500
Yeah, but where is it?

576
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,900
What do we know about Vincent Perotta?

577
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,700
He's off the grid.

578
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,400
Garcia can't find a registered phone

579
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,300
utility bill, or home address on this hump.

580
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,600
Come on, everybody lives somewhere.

581
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
There's gotta be a paper trail.

582
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,000
If there is, we can't find it.

583
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,700
If this day and age you can't live without leaving some sort of trace.

584
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,800
Unless someone pays your bills for you.

585
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,200
What about Russo? Could he be taking care of him?

586
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,100
No. No, no, no.

587
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
Russo's not paying anybody's bills but his own.

588
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,300
Well...

589
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,900
he has to have a weakness.

590
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,900
It's in his crime. It's in his behavior.

591
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,100
You know, something's just been bugging me.

592
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,100
Freddy.

593
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,100
Wasn't he easy to find?

594
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
He cut up the body.

595
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,400
He removed it from the crime scene.

596
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,700
But then he leaves it a couple of blocks away

597
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,400
where's he's gotta know we're gonna find it.

598
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,300
It's the whole reason we were able to connect Perotta to the crime.

599
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,700
He made a mistake.

600
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,100
Yeah, he did. He went off script.

601
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,300
What does that mean?

602
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,200
Something knocked him off his game.

603
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,300
That's right.

604
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,200
His behavior.

605
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,000
Well, what does he do?

606
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,800
He tortures.

607
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,900
Always?

608
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,900
The difference is Mrs. Dimarco.

609
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,300
Right.

610
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,100
Want to finish this?

611
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:49,900
Yeah.

612
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,500
Keep working.

613
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,200
Hey, look who's here. My old friend. Feeling better?

614
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,800
Where's Jason?

615
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,800
You grew up in a house that looked normal and happy, didn't you, Vincent?

616
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,800
Did I?

617
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,000
But your father beat you every chance he got.

618
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,500
He smacked me around some. Didn't everybody's old man?

619
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,000
No.

620
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,200
Well, maybe if yours had, you would have learned to fight.

621
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,500
There.

622
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,300
Did you hear that?

623
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,000
What is that?

624
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,800
I don't know.

625
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,300
I think it's moving.

626
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,200
Getting closer.

627
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,900
Airplane.

628
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,500
Paranoid personalities develop in childhood.

629
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,700
You know, you're saving me
thousands of dollars in therapy bills.

630
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,100
You learned to take the beatings, the abuse.

631
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,300
You learned to smile.

632
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,600
But in the back of your mind you probably thought...

633
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,800
"one day...

634
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,500
one day when I'm big enough."

635
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,500
So you were bullied and abused

636
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,600
and you became an abuser and a bully. It's a logical progression.

637
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,200
Really?

638
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah.

639
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Your father beat your mother, too, didn't he?

640
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,800
My mother's got nothing to do with this.

641
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,400
Hell, who eats this much food in their car?

642
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,300
Anyone who spends hours and hours in it waiting...

643
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,500
hunting.

644
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,800
Look.

645
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
Weird.

646
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,500
This is crazy. There's not one address, no paperwork, no registration.

647
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,600
It's all garbage.

648
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,800
Pizza boxes... nasty-looking chinese food, and...

649
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,200
hamburger joints.

650
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,500
Wait. Pizza.

651
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,500
What about it?

652
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,700
Ooh. Where do you order your pizza from?

653
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,600
I get my pizza from my own neighborhood.

654
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,100
Frenetti's.

655
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,900
Your mother knew.

656
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,100
She knew that he beat you every day

657
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,000
and she did nothing to help you.

658
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,700
And you still loved her.

659
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,000
Even though she let you get hurt, you loved her.

660
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,800
And I wondered why.

661
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,800
Why you didn't hate her.

662
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,700
Then of course I realized that he beat her as much as he beat you.

663
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,000
Don't talk about my mother.

664
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,300
You killed all these people, hundreds of them, and only one woman.

665
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,400
That's what made you get sloppy, isn't it?

666
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,900
Killing mrs. Dimarco was hard.

667
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,400
That's why you killed her first and you made it quick.

668
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,500
I thought it was to establish dominance, but it wasn't.

669
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,900
He was a bastard, all right?

670
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,700
Your father?

671
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,700
I call him Frank. He was a mean son of a bitch.

672
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,000
Is that what you want to know?

673
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,200
Gideon. I think we got something here.

674
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,400
Uh, he's got a bunch of pizza boxes from Frenetti's pizza.

675
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
It's in Glen Burnie

676
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,200
a suburb that backs up right to the airport.

677
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,300
Which makes sense, since we can hear
airplanes in the background of the video.

678
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,400
Check property records for Frank Perotta.

679
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,900
- Who?
- His father.

680
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,600
Why?

681
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,300
He still lives in his father's house.

682
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,600
I'll get Garcia on it.

683
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,900
That's why nothing is in his name.

684
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,600
You got that address?

685
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,200
In Glen Burnie like you thought.

686
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,200
And it looks like Frank Perotta died in a suspicious hunting accident.

687
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,300
With his son.

688
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,800
How long ago?

689
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,100
30 years. He was 17.

690
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,600
And my guess is it was no accident.

691
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,600
Well, you said Vincent was looking for bigger prey.

692
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,700
Sounds like he found it.

693
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,700
Garcia...you're my girl.

694
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,900
Clear!

695
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,600
Clear!

696
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,200
Upstairs?

697
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,000
Clear!

698
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,700
We got a friendly! It's Baker!

699
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,800
Get out! Get an ambulance!

700
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,300
Jimmy, you all right, man?

701
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,100
Is he Ok?

702
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,600
He's gonna live.

703
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,400
Get out!

704
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,000
You gonna be all right Jimmy.

705
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,200
You were just responding to what you learned, Vincent.

706
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,100
When you grow up in an environment like that

707
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,800
an extremely abusive, violent household

708
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,600
it's not surprising that some people grow up to become killers.

709
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,100
Some people?

710
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,200
What's that?

711
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,900
