Excuse me.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,590
Yes.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,780
Insurance card.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,890
Can't find you in the system.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,060
No,I--I'm

Are you still on foxborough drive?

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,860
Everything is still the same.

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,600
Sign here.

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,760
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,480
He's back. He found me again.

20
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,990
Fear is the weapon.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,580
If his target is afraid
and affected,then he's won.

22
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,780

I know. Big fan of your books.

29
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,160
And I followed your work
as a federal prosecutor.

30
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,720
- So you didn't come here for the terrorism seminar.
- No.

31
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,160
Two days ago,a woman named audrey henson did this
to her husband of 20 years while he was sleeping.

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,030
She confessed while sitting next
to the body at the crime scene

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,350
and repeated her confession
to me at the lockup.

34
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,330
Care to guess what her lawyer's
already working on for the defense?

35
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,650
Battered woman syndrome.

36
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,580
After years of systematic abuse,his client
suddenly had no option left to her but a 12-gauge.

37
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,020
And yet there's never been a domestic
violence report filed from that home.

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,630
Not a single medical
record documenting injury.

39
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,960
And not one witness who can say they
ever saw or even suspected abuse.

40
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,340
So what do you need from us?

41
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,660
I think I can win
this case anyway,but...

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,730
I'd like you to help me
prove that she's lying.

43
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,620
Proving a negative,that something
didn't happen,is always a long shot.

44
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,960
Yes,but you can show she doesn't
fit the profile of a battered woman.

45
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,780
What if she isn'T... lying?

46
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,500
That's not gonna be a problem.

47
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,000
Her husband can't defend himself from what she's saying
about him any more than he could against the shotgun.

48
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,560
Doesn't that bother anyone?

49
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,470
Will she talk to us? Has
she waived her rights?

50
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,400
Her attorney's already
agreed to let her.

51
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,660
He practically insists on it.

52
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,050
Claims she's got nothing to hide.

53
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,120
Well,I can't promise that what
we'll find is gonna help your case.

54
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,270

emily prentiss.

63
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,720
I'm sorry to rush in,but when I got
the message you'd see me this morning,

64
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,220
I could barely sleep last night.

65
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,340
But that's nothing new.

66
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,870
I haven't been able to
sleep for about 2 years.

67
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,620
We read the letter you wrote
to the silver spring police.

68
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,510
Begging and pleading wasn't
getting their attention.

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,690
They needed to know I wasn't going away.

70
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,470
So you've been getting these
notes for the past 2 years?

71
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,970
I used to be in atlanta.

72
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,070
I moved here 6 months ago,and
then out of nowhere another note.

73
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,610
I can't live like this
anymore. I want my life back.

74
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,940
What did the police tell you?

75
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,190
The detective I met with was...

76
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,170
very sympathetic,but his hands are
tied unless something happens to me.

77
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,560
Then it will be too late.

78
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,150
Will you help me?

79
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,620
I'm presenting the case
to our team this morning.

80
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,800

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,210
We shouldn't wait on this.

91
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,970
Jj pulled me in early. I agree.

92
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,370
This is keri derzmond.

93
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,630
2 years ago in atlanta she
started receiving anonymous notes

94
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,920
that meticulously described her
whereabouts throughout the day.

95
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,630
Local authorities never
found out who was responsible.

96
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,610
Recently,she moved to
maryland,brought the stalker with her.

97
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,100
They think it's the same person?

98
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,700
He includes photographs of himself.

99
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,840
None of his face. That's very telling.

100
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,670
He's either trying to protect his
identity or he has self-image issues.

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,180
He's controlling the parts of
his body that he shows to her.

102
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,010
He writes to keri in these letters about their
"future" together-- having kids,growing old.

103
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,610
He believes keri is in love with
him and just doesn't know it yet.

104
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,680
Ok,so the guy's clearly delusional,but
what makes this a bau case?

105
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,720
He is so obsessed that he
tracked her over 600 miles away.

106
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,860
That is unusual.

107
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,460
Typically,a stalker will change his focus to another
woman if the object of his affection moves away.

108
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,140
I mean,I get that,and he's way past the
first level of escalation,but... still.

109
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,200
When keri received the first letter in
maryland,she went to the locals for protection.

110
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,270
They told her they couldn't help her.

111
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,660
This woman is in serious danger.

112
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:53,690
This case is in my hands now,and if we
do nothing and something happens to her...

113
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,530
I'll be the one notifying her family.

114

Nothing,nothing,nothing.

Aside from a birth certificate

127
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,120
there's no actual record that
audrey henson even exists.

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,710
How many years in the current home?

129
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,320
It looks like they've lived in
that house their whole married life.

130
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,250
And we're certain there are no medic
ralecords that point to a history of abuse?

131
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,590
Actually,sir,there's no medical record at all
beyond the birth of their second child nathan.

132
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,300
What about life insurance? Any assets?

133
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,720
Any financial motive for
audrey to kill her husband.

No. I mean,there's insurance,but mrs. Henson
isn't the beneficiary of any of the policies.

135
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,190
She's not?

136
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,050

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,860

138
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,810
So we can use this area until
something bigger comes along.

139
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,330

agent jareau requested.

140
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,180
Is she coming,by the way?

141
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,100
She and another agent
are at keri's office.

142
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,990
Aren't you guys a little
overqualified for this case?

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,390
I mean,this guy's no serial killer.

00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,880
We construct behavioral profiles for

145
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,380
That includes stalking.

146
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,870
We've seen this kind of thing
before,and it can get ugly real fast.

147
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,840
Hey,I wanted to help this
girl the day she came in.

148
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,410
I just--I didn't
have the manpower.

149
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,650
Listen,we understand what
it's like to be shorthanded.

150
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,670
We're just here to help.

151
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,470
Look,don't get me wrong.I
got a sister keri's age,

152
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,520
and if some guy was doing this to
her and I got my hands on him...

153
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,070
- I'd probably get thrown off the force.
- You and me both.

154
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,650
What was that?

155
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,850
Bureaucratic red tape.

156
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,800
Every case we take,I have to explain why in
terms of cost and size relative to the bau.

157
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,660
They don't always think it's worth it.

158
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,540
They do have 4 agents doing
the work that locals should.

159
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,720
Just because there isn't a dead body
doesn't mean we shouldn't take the case.

160
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,540
Hey,the fact that law
enforcement,including the fbi,

161
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,140
can't help someone until they've
been injured is appalling.

162
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,160
All I'm saying is it is
a drain on the system.

163
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,210
Emily.

164
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,720
Last year in denver,a woman was
being harassed by her ex-boyfriend.

165
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,700
Cops knew who he was,but
they couldn't arrest him.

166
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,620
We didn't take that case.

167
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,710
She was finally granted a restraining order
3 days after he threw acid in her face.

168
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,980
Right now,I don't care
about limited resources.

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,610
I cannot make that same mistake again.

170
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,890
Ok. When keri lived in atlanta,the
initial communication happened at her job.

171
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,660
But then they got more personal
and started going to her home.

172
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,000
The first card is likely an
anniversary date of sorts.

173
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,390
The first time he saw her or
the first face-to-face meeting.

174
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,530
He actually wrote the date on the card.

175
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,010
March 21,2006.

176
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,160
That was a tuesday.

177
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,410
Ok,so we should look at other tuesdays,

178
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,170
previous months on the
21st,and march of 2005.

179
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,310
If we can figure out what
this date means to the stalker,

180
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,900
it could trace his
connection back to keri.

181
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,460
Prentiss: Why the move to maryland?

182
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,730
Ryan lives here,and my
firm just opened an office.

183
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,730
The move wasn't because of the stalker,although the
police back in atlanta thought it was a good idea.

184
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,730
I'm always cautious,but
for the first time,

185
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,600
I felt that if I looked over my
shoulder,no one would be there.

186
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,990
We need you to make a list of names.

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,330
Of everyone you know,even
acquaintances,both here and in georgia.

188
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,920
Don't forget ex-boyfriends
or any indiscretions.

189
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,700
Nothing is insignificant.

190
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,540
If I knew what I was doing to
make this guy so obsessed,I'd stop

191
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,590
when your paths crossed,something
clicked with him.

192
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,870
If you were smiling,he probably
thought you were smiling at him.

193
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,520
We have no way of knowing
what his fantasy is.

194
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,210
What we do know is
you're the star of it.

195
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,180
It's ryan. He says it's an emergency.

196
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,550
You ok? Yeah,they're here now.

197
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,220
Ryan's at home. There's another
card and a box at the door.

198
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,870
Tell him not to touch
it. We're on our way.

199
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,120
Ok,so every tuesday,keri's
firm has a staff meeting.

200
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,020
And it's catered by a lot
of different restaurants.

201
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,900
I'll add it to the list.

202
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,130
What do you see?

203
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,500
Look at the new photograph
keri received in maryland.

204
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,280
Now look at the old ones from
atlanta,the muscle tone has changed.

205
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,320
The bicep is far more defined.

206
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,680
Also,skin color. He's tan.

207
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,340
Why do we care if he's lifting
weights and out in the sun?

208
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,720
Well,we're looking at this
from a behavioral standpoint.

209
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,900
He's making improvements to his
appearance and it's likely to impress keri.

210
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,740
What does her fiance look like?

211
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,950
Here it is.

212
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,890
I appreciate you driving keri home.

213
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,510
Ever since this guy showed up
again,I've been taking her everywhere.

214
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,270
Would he send something
that could hurt me?

215
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,770
Probably not,but we don't
want to take any chances.

216
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,800
You really think this guy would do
something like that after all this time?

217
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,140
At this point,you haven't
done anything to provoke him.

218
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,990
It's just a pair of earrings.

219
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,520
They look like antiques.

220
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,920
He says there were his
grandmother'S. Family heirloom?

221
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,610
He wants to make you
a part of his family.

222
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,260
Well,we have the back of his head now.

223
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,360
He hopes that,uh,you
give him a gift soon,too.

224
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,950
What does that mean?

225
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,860
We should probably get this back
to the station and start a trace.

226
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,470
You can find him that way?

227
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,040
First-class mail's harder
to track,but we'll see.

228
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,690
Officers will be driving by your house
periodically looking for anything suspicious.

229
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,610
And you have my number
if anything happens.

230
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,930
We'll call and let you
know if we find anything.

231
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,100
Thank you.

232
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,090
His confidence is building,and now he
wants something what do you think that is?

233
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,170
I don't know. I'm scared about what
happens when she doesn't give it to him.

234
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,020
Is that what my mother
said,that he hit her?

235
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,290
We haven't spoken to your mother yet,but we
understand it's being suggested by her attorney.

236
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,250
Unbelievable.

237
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,100
She's actually blaming him?

238
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,010
So you don't believe she was abused?

239
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,710
If anyone was abused,it was my father-- what
he had to put up with being married to her.

240
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,970
She was a lousy cook. She
couldn't do the laundry right.

241
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,080
The house was always filthy.

242
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,690
Hell,she couldn't even grocery shop
without some kind of supervision.

243
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,240
Supervision?

244
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,020
She'd get all the wrong things.

245
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,580
Wrong brands,too much or
too little of something.

246
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,870
And my father was always
patient with her. Always.

247
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,150
She's just... she isn'T...

248
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,150
she's not bright.

249
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,060
You mean she's mentally challenged?

250
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,620
No,I mean she's stupid.

251
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,950
This is your mother
we're talking about here.

252
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,540
No,we're talking about a woman who killed
the only real parent we've ever had.

253
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,870
Our father was kind
and gentle and loving.

254
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,940
He always had time for us. Always.

255
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,210
He was at every game,every
school event,everything important.

256
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,290
And what about your mother?

257
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,380
She never went to anything.
Not once in my whole life.

258
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,960
I guess she just couldn't be bothered.

259
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,890
So if your father didn't abuse
your mother,why did she kill him?

260
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,710
Probably just to take him away from us.

261
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,110
She was jealous that he
loved us more than her.

262
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,530
Why would she think that?

263
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,700
Because he said so all the time.

264
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,090
Come on.

265
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,090
Let me guess. You don't want me to read?

266
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,740
We're gonna fix dinner,and
we're gonna do it together.

267
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,000
Are we gonna pretend there's not some
weird guy leaving me presents,too?

268
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,640
What weird guy?

269
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,850
I'll take that as a yes.

270
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,380
- Will you go check on him?
- Ok.

271
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,640
- The gate's open.
- What?

272
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,400
Brodie?

273
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,870
Keri derzmond? Silver spring P.D.

274
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,420
I just saw your dog
take off down the street.

275
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,600
The only way to open the
gate is from the inside.

276
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,880
Which means someone scaled the
fence so they wouldn't be seen.

277
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:51,470
I want you both to go back inside the
house and lock the door behind you.

278
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,700
I should go look for brodie.

279
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,430
Keri,we need to go inside.

280
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,840
Where is he?

281
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,900
This was on your neighbor's lawn.

282
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,890
it's ok,it's ok.

283
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,480
I miss her,too,brodie.

284
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,090
I miss her,too.

285
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,450
this guy's definitely
trying to mirror ryan.

286
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,850
He's even got the same haircut.

287
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,140
He's trying to replicate
what keri's attracted to.

288
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,440
He starts feeling good about himself,he's gonna
find the courage he needs to actually meet her.

289
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,180
We charging him with dognapping now,too?

290
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,200
Taking the dog might not
seem like much to you,

291
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,070
but it tells us that he's desperately
trying to feel close to her.

292
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,850
He was bold enough to
break in her backyard.

293
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,620
Add that to his proven determination and
we've got ourselves a serious escalation here.

294
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,240
I thought he was just messin' with her.

295
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,770
We had keri put flyers up.

296
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,650
We may get him to
call to return the dog.

297
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,100
- Would he do that?
- He wants to prove how much he cares.

298
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,810
Or he won't call if he's jealous of
how much attention the dog is getting.

299
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,600
If he really believes that he's ready to eliminate
all of his competition,ryan could be next.

300
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,710
You think he's got the
guts for a confrontation?

301
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,320
He moved here,took brodie.

302
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,410
He's not going to let
anything get in his way.

303
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,020
He cares about keri.

304
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,720
Maybe he won't hurt her. He hasn't yet.

305
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,320
He doesn't want to,but if he feels
like he's gonna lose her,Then he will.

306
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,180
lose her?

307
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,520
He's been rejected his entire life.

308
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,420
To escape,he built a vivid fantasy
world in which someone accepted him.

309
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,290
Me.

310
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,210
Worst-case scenario--
he gets you alone.

311
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,460
In which case it would be important for
you to play along with his delusions.

312
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,760
You mean like tell him I love him?

313
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,750
Within reason,do what he wants.

314
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,820
By gaining his trust,he'll let his guard
down,and that's when you can make your vemo.

315
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,120
You think it could come to that?

316
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,020
Well,not if we can help it.

317
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,820
We're gonna have to comb through your
life ever since he's been a part of it.

318
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,570
Haven't we already done that?

319
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,400
We're talking about each and
every moment for the last 2 years.

320
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,360
The answer could be
in the smallest detail.

321
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,700
Ok.

322
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,410
The perfect family.

323
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,160
Two mattresses.

324
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,030
That's less intimate.

325
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,800
She passed the murder weapon every day.

326
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,050
And the kids said she
couldn't keep house.

327
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,400
I can't see anything out of place.

328
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,880
Look. Even the hangers are
uniformly spaced. And the shoes.

329
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,990
I bet if we measured,they'd
be almost perfect.

330
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,450
The kids obviously adopted their father's
skewed perspective of their mother.

331
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,350
Rossi: The family
that abuses together...

332
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,350
you know,I thought it was just the
angle of the crime scene photos.

333
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,970
There's obviously something missing.

334
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,720
The rest of the blood.

335
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,970
Somebody cleaned up.

336
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,220
This man's an incompetent suitor seeking
intimacy with a woman unavailable to him.

337
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,310
He thinks he's courting uls sohi mate
who in reality is a total stranger to him.

338
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,550
He's making some physical improvements.

339
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,870
But even if he's able to get enough
confidence together to speak to keri,

340
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,400
she'd find it more like
talking to a 12-year-old boy.

341
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,730
A very dangerous one.

342
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,870
His obsession has heightened,as
indicated by his following her to maryland

343
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,110
and the amount of
detail in those letters.

344
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,900
He writes instead of calls,which could
mean that he's afraid of how he'll sound.

345
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,950
He might be less educated or have some sort
of physical issue,like a speech impediment.

346
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,110
He wouldn't have written march 21,2006,

347
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,780
in that first letter if that date
didn't actually mean something to him.

348
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,950
It could be the first time he
saw her at the bank or the movies.

349
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,890
I mean,the possibilities are endless.

350
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,750
Their paths crossed somewhere
in atlanta,he followed her.

351
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,550
So we need to focus on what she's doing
here and how she's living. He's watching.

352
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,380
His move here means that he's
committed,and unless he's caught,

353
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,180
he'll never break that commitment.

354
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,850
Yet if he perceives that she has...

355
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,350
we all know domestic disputes
can be some of the most violent.

356
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,730
And there's nothing else pending?

357
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,150
No,no,it's ok.

358
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,280
Um,we'll be back tomorrow. I'm gonna
need the rest of you back then as well.

359
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,890
Ok. Thanks.

360
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,610
They're working on a
single stalker case?

361
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,630
All of them?

362
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,340
Jj seems pretty passionate about it.

363
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,740
You know,sometimes u
yocasen e it,but,uh...

364
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,370
they all look pretty happy.

365
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,760
Happiness is easy to fake when
you only have a split second.

366
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,480
You should see how many y-happlooking
photos I have of me with my exes.

367
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,380
Were you ever happy in
any of your marriages?

368
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,820
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not.

369
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,130
If I was,I can't remember.

370
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:18,890
I'm not sure if me and the idea
of being married is a good mix.

371
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,560
You kept trying.

372
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,520
Well,I didn't have any kids.

373
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,880
What do you mean?

374
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,260
Well,I mean I might have tried harder
if there were children involved.

375
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,130
I tried.

376
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,280
Hotch.

377
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,080
I gave absolutely everything to...

378
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,420
haley and jack and my job.

379
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,860
So something had to give.

380
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,620
Yeah. You're right.

381
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,750
But it doesn't mean that
I am any less committed...

382
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,990
or try any less hard for my son.

383
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,690
Hey,hotch,what the hell do I know?

384
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,360
The only people I've ever made
happy were divorce lawyers.

385
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,600
Well,we've got 4 failed marriages
between us. We're experts at something.

386
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,020
Where does it all go wrong?

387
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,520
Everybody has their breaking point.

388
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,370
Your wife reached hers.

389
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,610
Jj,I'm used to doing this
to america's most creepy,

390
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,400
but digging through keri's life like
this makes me feel all gross and ugh.

391
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,350
We have to in order to help.

392
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,970
I know,but it's her business why she
takes a large cash withdrawal out in vegas.

393
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,360
Bachelorette party.

394
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,720
Or who she sends flowers
to every month in wisconsin.

395
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,680
Her grandmother.

396
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,280
And,you know,she
has,like,awesome health insurance.

397
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,440
YeP.

398
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,200
and her private doctor
was voted atlanta's best.

399
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:15,640
So why did she go to the atlanta women's
health clinic not once,not twice,but 3 times?

400
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,370
Thanks.

401
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,330
Prentiss: We're looking for
a connection to march 21.

402
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,160
Is it anyone's birthday or annerivsary?

403
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,610
No,the 21st doesn't mean anything to me.

404
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,090
What's up?

405
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,090
Why'd you go to the clinic last year?

406
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,000
We need full disclosure,keri.

407
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,610
Bryan doesn't know.

408
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,320
Back when...

409
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,890
we were figuring out what this is...

410
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,170
if I was moving...

411
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,870
I was pregnant.

412
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,900
And I couldn't-- I couldn't
have a baby,not then.

413
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,530
That was your decision.

414
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,150
You don't have to
explain that to anyone.

415
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,830
I know.It's just,ryan's
career was taking off,

416
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,230
- I didn't want to trap him,
- Keri.

417
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,470
- I didn't want us to have any regrets.
- Keri.

418
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,360
Ryan.

419
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,190
Were you ever gonna tell me?

420
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,350
I thought you wanted to have kids.

421
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,210
I do.

422
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,820
You didn't think I'd drop
everything to raise a baby?

423
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,130
I knew that's exactly what you'd do.

424
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,840
I gotta go.

425
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,890
Wait,ryan. I'm sorry.

426
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,930
Keri.

427
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,910
Oh,damn it!

428
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,840
Thanks. That was detective berry.
He just took ryan's police report.

429
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,150
He's got about $500's
worth of damage to his car.

430
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,970
Hey,why are you taking this so hard?

431
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,340
Keri's life has been turned
upside down for the past 2 years,

432
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,640
and then we just come on
in and tear it up some more.

433
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,580
But to catch her stalker,we
have to ask those questions.

434
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,850
She knew it would be uncomfortable.

435
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,550
That's an understatement.

436
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,210
Jj,you fought for this case.

437
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,480
You wanted to help keri. That's
what we're sitting here trying to do.

438
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,690
Then why do I feel like
we violated her,too?

439
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,890
You do understand why you're here?

440
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,440
I killed my husband.

441
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,560
And you're aware that you
don't have to talk to us?

442
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,780
What else is there to say? I shot him.

443
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,070
Why?

444
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,140
It's what I had to do.

445
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,000
Had to?

446
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,040
It sounds... terrible.

447
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,960
- Did philip ever hit you?
- Hit me?

448
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,070
- Was he abusive?
- No. Never.

449
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,800
Not even when
I probably des--

450
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,290
no,he was very patient with me.

451
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,720
Why did he need to be patient?

452
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,680
Well,are you kidding? Look at me.

453
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,990
After nathan was born,I
completely let myself go.

454
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,740
I'm fat,I'm a terrible
housekeeper,I'm a terrible cook.

455
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,320
No,believe me,I needed a
husband with a lot of patience.

456
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:53,820
Audrey,nathan tells us that you never
attended any of his sports or school functions,

457
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,140
that you were never there,not even once.

458
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,970
He's probably right.

459
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,140
Why didn't you?

460
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,460
Well,I was doing such
a terrible job at home,

461
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,570
I didn't want to embarrass
my kids out in public,too.

462
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:17,880
I knew I'd seen him before-- at
my dry cleaners,at a restaurant.

463
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,530
I didn't know where else to go.

464
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,670
You did the right thing coming here.

465
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,100
Keri,you're gonna get
through this. You're strong.

466
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,100
You've been smart. You're taking
every necessary precaution.

467
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,820
You're not helpless,keri.

468
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,010
You're prepared and you're protected.

469
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,010
I needed to hear that.

470
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,030
Sounds like he's gonna
try to talk to her.

471
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,020
It could be a risky situation for him.

472
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,190
Why him?

473
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,670
He's setting himself up for
rejection,and if he feels anger or shame,

474
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,020
there's a possibilit
yhe could turn violent.

475
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,430
All right,I'm going to
get this picture out.

476
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,110
Jj ok?

477
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,970
Yeah,she will be,once we get a lead.

478
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,940
That was ryan.

479
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,880
He's taking off for a couple
of days to clear his head.

480
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,050
But he wants to talk first.

481
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,720
I'm going to meet him at the house.

482
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,240
All right,guys,tell me what you've got.

483
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,770
- No one ever hit this woman.
- I knew it.

484
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,830
And yet she's been profoundly abused.

485
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:28,800
What?

486
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,620
Her abuse was psychological. He
had complete control over her.

487
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,500
He cut off all her contact
with the outside world.

488
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,320
You've heard of
stockholm syndrome,right?

489
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,310
You're kidding me.

490
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,710
Prisoners of war,patty hearst,elizabeth
smart,they all say the same thing.

491
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,270
They had no place else to go.

492
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,020
Why is it that men so easily believe
that the woman must somehow be the victim?

493
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,920
You asked our opinion.

494
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,180
Come in with us.

495
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,360
There's one thing we haven't asked
her yet that might interest you.

496
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,660
That's my dog!

497
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,890
It's not your dog,buddy. Back off.

498
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,580
Look,I said it's not your dog. Back off.

499
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,150
Hey,will you back
off. It's not your dog!

500
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,340
You son of a bitch! Stay away from keri!

501
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,480
Get off! Help!

502
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,270
what the hell happened?

503
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,930
Says some guy in an old brown van paid him 50
bucks to walk the dog up and down the street.

504
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,830
Told him to be careful,someone in the
neighborhood was kidnapping people's pets.

505
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,970
Back door's off its hinges.

506
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,480
Her cell's still in
the house,her wallet.

507
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,490
Her purse is on the bed. He just...

508
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,940
he just took her.

509
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,040
I was right here.

510
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,790
Let's go inside.

511
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,960
What now?

512
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,340
Well,he finally got her.
He's not about to let her go.

513
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,260
Do you like it?

514
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,690
It's really nice.

515
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,040
How about the pictures of me?

516
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,250
It's good to finally see you in person.

517
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,600
Ah,you've seen me before.

518
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,800
- Yeah,no,I know.
- Where?

519
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,220
You mean the first time?

520
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,370
On the 21st?

521
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,610
You do remember.

522
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,260
Your haircut looks nice.

523
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,040
You didn't like it long.

524
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,960
No,I-- that was
good,too,I thought.

525
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,330
I've thought about cutting my hair.

526
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,490
No,don't you do that. Don't you
cut your hair,do you understand me?

527
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,990
There aren't any vans in georgia that
have been transferred to maryland,

528
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,110
so I am sending you registrations
and I.D.S for both states.

529
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,800
Pictures coming at you.

530
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,140
Let's start with jeffrey
cramer,chris geezy,and mike hicks.

531
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,960
Ok. Cramer works at a grocery store.

532
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:38,730
Geezy is a heating and air
tech,and hicks is on unemployment.

533
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,200
But he's an I.T.Guy.

534
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,830
Last employed at legal
grind,tech support for law firms.

535
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,850
Keri's a lawyer. He might
have worked on her computer.

536
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,220
He's got no criminal record.

537
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,940
And his social's listed at a bank there.

538
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,240
And the account lists...

539
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,310
mike hicks,404 lark lane,silver spring.

540
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,130
Thanks,baby girl.

541
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,660
All right,we got a name and an address.

542
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,660
Would he really take keri to his place?

543
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,580
It's unlikely,but we
should still check it out.

544
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,540
All right,I'll send a cruiser.

545
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,580
Every second we're
here,she's alone with him.

546
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,630
***********

547
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,210
He wants********

548
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,350

549
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,040
*********

550
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,840
**********

551
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,320
Yes.

552
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,820
We'd like for you to take us
through the killing step by step,

553
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,120
as well as you can remember.

554
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,940
I had just-- I was
finishing up the laundry,

555
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:57,280
and,uh,I was hanging up my
husband's shirts in the closet.

556
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,780
I looked over and I saw him on the bed,

557
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:06,990
and I knew it had to be
then,that that was my only chance.

558
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:11,380
And so,I decided I had to kill him.

559
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,030
I picked up the gun...

560
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,680
and I shot him.

561
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,690
I shot my husband.

562
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,570
And then you...

563
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,250
sat there and waited
for someone to come home?

564
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,630
Oh,no,no,no,no. I had to clean up.

565
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,290
- Why?
- Well,there was blood everywhere.

566
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,270
And did you clean up to
hide what you had done?

567
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,790
No. No,I was going to tell sarah
what I had done when she got home.

568
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,470
I wasn't hiding anything.

569
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,520
But then why clean all the blood up?

570
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,310
Because the police
were going to be coming.

571
00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:01,590
Philip would have been furious if I allowed all
those strangers into the house with a mess like that.

572
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,610
Her life's been punishment enough.

573
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,580
I'm gonna have to drag
her through a trial.

574
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,850
I'll recommend she's charged with
criminally negligent homicide.

575
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,890
By the time it's over,she'll probably
get off with probation and time served.

576
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,380
Thank you for taking me away.

577
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:36,060
It's a really good place
for us to start over.

578
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,500
Can we take these
off,now that we're safe?

579
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,700
oh,they're softer than I remember.

580
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:13,110
When you got up from your
desk and I sat in your chair...

581
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:19,450
and you... You said,"oops."

582
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,840
And I knew then that you felt it,too.

583
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,940
It's kind of stuffy in here.

584
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,460
Let's go for a walk.

585
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,720
We can look at the water.

586
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,470
Now.

587
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,550
Ok.

588
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,440
It's so beautiful here.

589
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,000
Ok,ok.

590
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,930
Let's put these away. I
just want to talk to you.

591
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,740
Don't make me hurt her.

592
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,830
You don't have to do that.

593
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,680
Michael,we don't want to
take her away from you.

594
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,220
Keri told me she wants to be with you.

595
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,250
It's true. I'm so happy now.

596
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,320
They think you're gonna hurt me.

597
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:03,560
Put it down so we can be together.

598
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,820
Where do you want to go first?

599
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,900
We could,uh,we could go back to atlanta.

600
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:13,220
We could find a little house.

601
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,050
Come here. Come here!

602
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,530
Take that.

603
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,830
Get up. Get up!

604
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,430
How could you do this?

605
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,890
After everything I've done for us?

606
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,520
They can't keep us apart!

607
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,420
You did great.

608
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,100
He worked on my computer.

609
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,850
That's where I met him.

610
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,580
It's ok.

611
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,990
I found this in his van along
with about 100 photos of keri.

612
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,130
- Keri.
- February 21,2006.

613
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,100
A month later,he sent his first letter.

614
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,210
He thought it was their anniversary.

615
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,610
- It's over now.
- Thank you.

616
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,700
Susan B.Anthony said,

617
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,710
"a woman must not depend
on the protection of man,

618
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,700
but must be taught to protect herself."

619
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,050
Everyone's waiting.

620
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,720
You should go.

621
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:09,190
Keri's gonna be ok.

622
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,090
I know.

623
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,770
Ok. Then what is it? Because
you've been a little off.

624
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,500
Really,I'm
just-- I'm tired.

625
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,460
Ok. Well,go home. Get some sleep.

626
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,430
Hey,it's me. Got a minute?

627
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,960
Yeah,I'm fine. Fine. Uh,we
just really need to talk.

628
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,850
I'm pregnant.
