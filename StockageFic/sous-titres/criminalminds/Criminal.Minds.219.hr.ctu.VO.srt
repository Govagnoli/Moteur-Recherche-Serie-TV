00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,080
Mom,dad! Dad,we have to go!

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,680
What?

4
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,430
The house is on fire,we have to get out of here!

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,790
Come on,we have to go!

6
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,740
The phone's dead--go!Come on,we gotta go!

7
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,510
Come on.Stay down.

8
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,000
Stay down.

9
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,970
Somebody!

10
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,350
Somebody!

11
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,220
Somebody,please help us!

"The torture of a bad conscience is the hell of a living soul."

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,500
John calvin.

15
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,780
Two fires,two families in three weeks.

16
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,120
The first family,the jarvis',

17
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,610
all died.

18
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,370
Last night,the cutlers.

19
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,650
Only one survivor,charlotte cutler,

20
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,730
she's in critical condition with burns to over 60% of her bodY.

21
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,780
Well,it's no accident.

22
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,730
It's the same M.O. No fuses,kerosene,

23
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,550
multiple points of origin,

24
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,430
families targeted at home while they slept.

25
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,340
The bay area has a serial arsonist.

26
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,430
Statistically,94% of all serial arsonists are male,

27
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,030
75% are white,and few,

28
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,520
if any,are ever caught.

29
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Few?

30
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,800
You don't have a percentage?

31
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,850
About 16%,

32
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,930
and those 16% set 30-plus fires before they were ever apprehended.

33
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,630
I'm trying to be more conversational.

34
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,840
Oh.It's not working.

35
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,610
Most serial arsonists don't intend to inflict harm.

36
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,700
Injuries or death,those are accidental.

37
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,090
It's not about violence.

38
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,150
For this one it is.

39
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,360
It's also about power.

40
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,110
Seeing the destructive force of their fires.

41
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,660
Watching the chaos,

42
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,090
for them,fire's just a substitute for sexual release.

43
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,030
Oh,great,so if these guys don't get laid,they start fires?

44
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,530
Or in this case,burn entire families to death.

45
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,060
-No statistic? -Nope.

46
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,510
They don't have statistics on this guy.

47
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,440
One of a kind.

48
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,850
Thank god.

49
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,390
Three weeks ago,this serial arsonist escalated into a serial killer whose weapon is fire.

50
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,580
Why?

51
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,090
Major event.

52
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,340
Possibly the breakup of his primary sexual outlet.

53
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,520
The separation,the loss.

54
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,140
all right What about the victims?

55
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,830
Sfpd can't connect the jarvis' and the cutlers,

56
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,880
but witnesses put an unidentified late model gold sedan near both fires.

57
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,670
Run the car.

58
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,340
Garcia,run the victims through the system,

59
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,910
if there's any connection we need to find it.

60
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,560
Yes,sir.

61
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,640
We need victimology.

62
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,980
I'll go see charlotte cutler.

63
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,940
You took the burn one last timE.

64
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,480
It's all right.I got it.

65
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,070
Has she said anything about the fires?

66
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,500
I'm giving her as much painkiller as I can.

67
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,540
She asked about her husband and son.

68
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,230
She passed out again before I had to answer.

69
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,520
So she doesn't know.

70
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,940
Whatever you tell her,

71
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,130
she won't live long enough to know different.

72
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,670
I'll be right back.

73
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,710
-Did she just tell us to lie to a material witness? -No.
-

74
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,630
She told us that we could.

75
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,970
Welcome.Ricardo vega,sffdr.

76
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,670
Hi.Jason gideon,this is derek morgan.

77
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,980
Most likely the arson suspect is a first responder

78
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,060
who set both fires with premeditative intent to return to it within a professional capacity.

79
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,960
You read my paper.

80
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,270
"Profiles of a serial arsonist,"

81
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,810
I make everyone on my team read it.

82
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,680
I've run the first responders of both fires,

83
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,080
these are the pedigrees of everyone that was here that night.

84
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,800
No fire,police,or emt responded to both.

85
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,700
-No one -except me,

86
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,670
which is why I've included copies of my department performance reviews,

87
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,000
medical records,and psych-evals.

88
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,810
-It's unnecessary. -No,it's not.

89
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,640
Your best suspect is a fireman who saw both fires burning.That's me.

90
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,120
I'm saving you time.

91
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,100
Come on,I'll walk you through it.

92
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,290
Mrs. Cutler?

93
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,910
I'm special agent aaron hotchner,

94
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,280
-this is special agent emily prentiss. -Hello.

95
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,130
Where's paul?

96
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,770
Your son

97
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,580
was with you the night of the fire.

98
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,720
That's why we're here.

99
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,900
I don't understand.

100
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,680
We're fbi agents.

101
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,710
We think that the fire may have been set intentionallY.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm very tired.

103
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,360
I understand.

104
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,050
This is very important.

105
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,570
Do you think you could just give us a couple of minutes?

106
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,110
I want you to think back to that night.

107
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,450
Was there anything out of the ordinary?

108
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,840
Think about the things that you normally do.
·

109
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,250
Uh,get undressed,

110
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,330
wash your face

111
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,290
I couldn't brush my teeth.

112
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,040
Dennis?

113
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,610
The water's not working.

114
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
I'll check it out.

115
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,610
Dennis got the water back on.

116
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,720
Then

117
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,180
then you went to bed?

118
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,330
Do you remember what woke you up?

119
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,710
-Paul. -Not the smoke alarms?

120
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,210
It was paul.

121
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,780
What else do you remember?

122
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,160
Dennis unlocked it and it wouldn't open.

123
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,430
He unlocked what?

124
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,910
The front door!

125
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,330
Somebody please help us,please!

126
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,510
What's wrong?!

127
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,780
I cant

128
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,720
Somebody!

129
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,560
Somebody,Please help us,please

130
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,170
And then I saw the fireman.

131
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,670
and****ok

132
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,680
Dennis?

133
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,140
Paul where's my baby?

134
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,280
Paul.Where are they?Are they ok?

135
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,050
They're fine.

136
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,420
They're just outside in the waiting room.

137
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:23,280
Ohh  oh,right.

138
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,340
I don't want them to see me like this.

139
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,920
No,I'm not ready.Could you...
.

140
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,990
please tell them to wait a minute,please?

141
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,470
I'm not ready.

142
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,740
Agent prentiss will tell them.

143
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,580
You call gideon and morgan?

144
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,840
I can stay with you until you're ready.

145
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,230
If you'd like.

146
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,630
I'd like that.

147
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,220
She told her husband there was no water.

148
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,110
Where's the shut-off?

149
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,660
Runs up the sidewalk.

150
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,970
Ok,so I'm the unsub.

151
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,260
I need to get in the house.

152
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,900
So I turn the water off right here.

153
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,230
And then I wait.

154
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,190
I wait for him to come outside.

155
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,110
I wait for them to go to sleep

156
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,430
and then I carefully pour the fuel.

157
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,860
Cutting access to the back door.

158
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,570
I leave them only one way to get out.

159
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,540
S.F.F.D. Headquarters SAN FRANCISCO,CA

160
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,600
This place is great!They have their own espresso machine.

161
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,320
Dr. Reid,this is detective castro,
´

162
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,460
she is with the sfpd liaison.

163
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,570
Burned my hand on that espresso machine.

164
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,540
Ooh!

165
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,630
A genius,you said?

166
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,240
Yeah,uh,

167
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,770
his coordination drops off when he's thinking.

168
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,320
Good.

169
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,480
'Cause we need to figure out why this psycho chooses these families.

170
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,770
He's most likely targeting the men.

171
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,100
They're the only similar members of the two families.

172
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,600
C. Jarvis,29,worked full-time.

173
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,970
Charlotte cutler,39,was a stay-at-home mom.

174
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,870
The jarvis' had two girls in public grade school,

175
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,740
cutler's had a son in private high school.

176
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,670
The jarvis' went to church,the cutlers didn'T.

177
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,780
Nothing holds.

178
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,570
Except with the men--

179
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,150
both in their late thirties,white,

180
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,490
approximately 6-feet tall,brown hair,

181
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,180
nice homes,nice families,good jobs,

182
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,490
that's the connection.

183
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,830
What connection?

184
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,920
Cutler was a lawyer,

185
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,170
jarvis an executive.

186
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,530
There's no evidence they ever met.

187
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,710
But they're of the same type.

188
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,040
We know that most serial arsonists are white males.

189
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,110
A complex M.O.Develops over time.

190
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,880
This guy is in his mid-thirties,

191
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,080
he sees the victims as successful versions of himself.

192
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,540
And he resents them for it.

193
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,270
I'll issue an A.P.B.

194
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,250
For a resentful 6-foot white guy.

195
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,780
Ok,great.I got it.Thanks.

196
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,440
Charlotte cutler died.

197
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,250
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,130
Next time I'll go.

199
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,550
What have we got on the vehicle?

200
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,950
Uh,it is a 1999 gold ford taurus.

201
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,410
85% of that model color-combo were sold domestically as fleet vehicles.

202
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,360
Company cars,

203
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,880
rental fleets.

204
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,240
Did you check all agencies?

205
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,070
Yeah,none of them kept them for the past three weeks,

206
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,070
or rented during both fires,

207
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,160
so

208
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,320
who keeps a rental car for three weeks?

209
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,190
Then it's not a rental.

210
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,630
It would have to be a company car.

211
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,200
This guy,he had to have time to stalk his victims.

212
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,220
And if his job involves driving--

213
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,250
there was a serial arsonist up in seattle,early nineties

214
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,830
-paul kenneth keller. -Yeah.

215
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,620
He used to drive around all day selling

216
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,370
advertising for his dad's agency,

217
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,220
picking out places to burn.

218
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,390
Company car.Good work,J.J.

219
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,940
Let's do the profile.

220
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,070
The unsub we're looking for is a highly intelligent,

221
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,100
under-achieving,35 to 45-year-old white male

222
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,470
with a severe narcissistic character disorder.

223
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,900
Nothing in his life works for long.

224
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,390
If he was married,he's now divorced.

225
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,650
If employed,it won't last.

226
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,580
What he wants is admiration,

227
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,590
but he's got no respect for others--

228
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,070
not their feelings,and most certainly not their safety.

229
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,410
He feels entitled.

230
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,230
He's like a petulant adolescent.

231
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,010
He both resents and he absolutely expects everyone to take care of him.

232
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,240
And given that a male relative wouldn't tolerate this behavior,

233
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,610
he most likely lives with a female relative

234
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,140
his mother,grandmother,aunt,whom he exploits.

235
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,790
His arson kit is expensive.

236
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,590
Fire suit,

237
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,660
oxygen mask.

238
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,170
This suggests that he may be employed,

239
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,250
but his personality will not allow him to work closely with others in an office setting.

240
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,400
This along with the information about his vehicle lead us to believe that

241
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,040
he's a traveling salesman of some sort,

242
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,470
who works for a company big enough not to notice that he's a sociopath.

243
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,420
Ok,this scumbag has issues,we all get it.

244
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,840
But why fire?

245
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,860
He's like a drug addict.

246
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,630
Only fire's his drug.

247
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,090
Each time an addict needs a fix,

248
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,910
they need more of the drug to get off.

249
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,180
So his crimes most likely get much worse.

250
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,460
It would be almost impossible for him to quit without help.

251
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,360
Thank you very much.

252
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,610
She shoots  she scores!

253
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,450
The crowd goes wild.

254
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,810
I just put the entire department on tac alert.

255
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,430
Garcia's on line one.

256
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,850
Brace yourselves.

257
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,860
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of lust.

258
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,450
-Did she say lust? -Mm-hmm.

259
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,510
I cross-referenced every known fact on the victims,

260
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,300
and I just found a website that links both dennis cutler

261
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,240
and matthew jarvis' companies on a list of businesses guilty of L.U.S.T.

262
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,290
I'm missing something.

263
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,980
Leaking underground storage tanks.

264
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,550
The website belongs to a recently founded san francisco chapter of the earth defense front.
´

265
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,560
The edf?

266
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,160
The eco-terrorist group?

267
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,380
They aren't eco-terrorists,they're environmental activists.

268
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,610
Dennis cutler and matthew jarvis may disagree with you.

269
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,360
I'm pretty sure some edf people were sent up for torching an suv dealership a while back in san diego.

270
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,630
Nobody died in those fires.

271
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,040
Maybe they got lucky.

272
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,310
No,it's not luck.

273
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,270
This group's dedicated to protecting life.

274
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,010
What,do they wait until no one's home and then light the place up?

275
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,230
That's exactly what they do.

276
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,420
So tell me who we're playing again today.

277
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,040
We play the jets.

278
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,380
The jets,right,ok.

279
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,380
I'll be-- in a second.

280
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,970
Katie!
Katie!

281
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,920
Come on.We're not gonna be late twice in one week.

282
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,240
-Yeah? -I'coming!

283
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,220
Come on,sweetie.

284
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,800
RighT.

285
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,940
No,I got that.

286
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,960
Yeah.

287
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,620
No,we're leavin'--

288
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,920
we're leavin' right now.

289
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,020
Yeah.

290
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,540
All right,guys.

291
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,760
We ready?

292
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,690
Belt.

293
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,070
Oh,yeah.

294
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
-What's wrong? -I don't know.

295
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,090
It's not opening.

296
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,120
Are you telling me that the fbi doesn't have

297
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,630
files on organizations like this?Lists and members?

298
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,740
Domestic groups like the edf aren't the bureau's top priority right now.

299
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,250
Besides,they're more of a movement than an organization.

300
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,050
There's a central ideology,

301
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,550
but-- chapters are independent,

302
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,050
they don't pay dues and they don't keep membership lists.

303
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,890
What if one of the chapters has broken ranks and has a new belief?

304
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,450
dad?

305
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,340
What are you doing?!

306
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,910
Hey!Get out,guys,

307
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,640
get out!Get out!

308
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,820
-get out!kids,Get out now! -dad,It's not opening!

309
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,500
-Come on,It won't open,dad! -Open the door!Get out!

310
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,370
Hurting people's never been part of it.

311
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,230
Doesn't track.

312
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,550
Doesn't fit the profile.

313
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,250
Garcia,can you identify how many members are in this particular edf chapter?

314
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,900
Uh,it looks like  a hundred to 150.

315
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,920
-What are you doing?!
-It's not opening!

316
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,250
-I'm scared,dad!I'm scared!
-Doors open--open!

317
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,090
Start the car!I'm trying-- it won't start.

318
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,130
Hurry!

319
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,280
I'm scared,dad,I'm scared!

320
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,790
Come on,get out!

321
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,180
Get out!Keep trying!Keep trying!

322
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,160
Come on!Keep trying-- what are you doing?!

323
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,820
Thomas R. Dunleavy,dunbrook development group.

324
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,820
On the list.

325
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,470
Ok,I'm sending you a file on the edf leader.

326
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:15,010
Evan abby,41,5'11'',185 pounds.

327
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,260
Thanks,garcia.

328
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,910
Pardon me for asking,sir,but how do we even know he's involved?

329
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,340
We don'T.That's why we're interviewing abby at the crime scene.

330
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,010
If he is the leader of the edf,

331
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,990
his reaction to all this should tell us exactly what we need to know.

332
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,380
Where do you guys want it?

333
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,830
This is the spot.

334
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,790
When he arrives,

335
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,620
bring the fake bodies right past us

336
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,790
nice and slow.

337
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,770
I want him to get a good look.

338
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,120
Remind me to never play poker with you guys.

339
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,900
So what do we have on this guy?

340
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,080
-Hotch! -What?

341
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,900
What do we have on the edf leader?

342
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,630
Evan abby,41,divorced,father of liam,14.

343
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,060
Environmental engineer,

344
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,750
does consults on real estate projects,

345
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,770
has worked with every company on the edf list.

346
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,700
Can't wait to meet him.

347
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,250
Mr. Abby,these are special agents jason gideon and aaron hotchner.

348
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,640
Thank you for coming.

349
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,870
Um,agent prentiss said you needed my help with a L.U.S.T.Related fire?

350
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,470
Yeah,it's pretty bad.

351
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,130
Tom,brad,katie dunleavy.

352
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,860
All burned to death.

353
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,610
Whew.

354
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,320
Uh so,um,where's the--

355
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,980
uh,where's the leaking storage tank?
¨

356
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,080
Katie was only 12.

357
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,760
You've got a son about that age,don't you?

358
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,430
Did you know tom dunleavy?

359
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:40,920
What is this?

360
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,680
He worked for dunbrook development group.

361
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,560
Why are you asking me these questions?

362
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,180
You posted dunbrook on your website.

363
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,710
My website?

364
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,730
Look,I came down here voluntarily

365
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,050
because I was told you needed help with a L.U.S.T.Related fire.

366
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,540
Three fires .

367
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,670
three families

368
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,680
three fathers

369
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,900
who worked for companies posted on your edf website.

370
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,930
All burned to death.

371
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,550
You worked for these companies-- every one on your list.

372
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,470
Are you accusing me of a crime?

373
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,210
What do you think?

374
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,440
Mr. Abby,I support your cause.

375
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,360
But I reject these methods.

376
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,990
I don't know what cause or methods you're referring to.

377
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,000
You created the site,

378
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,100
you posted the list,you're the leader of the edf.

379
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,300
Well,if you could prove that,we wouldn't be having this conversation,would we?

380
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,710
Mr. Abby,people are dying.

381
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,810
Children,mr. Abby.

382
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,220
We know edf's strategy has always supported violence.

383
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,270
I'm asking you,has edf's strategy changed?

384
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,110
No.It hasn'T.

385
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,770
He could barely look at this.

386
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,440
A serial arsonist wouldn't be able to peel his eyes away.

387
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,880
He's hiding somethinG.

388
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,120
More than just his support for the edf.

389
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,100
Hey,it occurred to me

390
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:57,060
if all I knew about the edf was that they went around burning down suv dealerships

391
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,300
and housing developments

392
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,810
well,that's a common misconception.

393
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,300
That's my point.

394
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,500
What if our profile is right--

395
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,960
and the unsub held the same misconception?

396
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,920
He wants to fit in,

397
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,440
he wants people around him to appreciate what he does,

398
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,550
isn't it possible that the unsub joined the edf  thinking--

399
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,150
it was an arsonist's club?

400
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,830
Sure.That's possible.

401
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:22,000
If we give abby our unsub's profile could he help us identify him?

402
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,250
We can't give abby the profile,

403
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,960
not until we find out what he's hiding.

404
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,980
Still,it seems abby's our best chance of finding the unsub.

405
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,440
You want abby or the ex-wife?

406
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,800
Abby.

407
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,970
At berkeley 20 years ago,evan was a different person.
evan was a different person.

408
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,200
In every way.

409
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,120
Warm,funny,honest.

410
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,120
Even naive.

411
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,110
What happened?

412
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,510
We had school loans,

413
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,570
I got pregnant

414
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,150
his job

415
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,790
evan was an environmental consultant.

416
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,900
Builder's hired him to help them clean up their sites.

417
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,250
Make sure they were up to epa code.

418
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,110
Evan thought they hired him to do the right thing.

419
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,950
- Did he? - No.

420
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,150
Developers don't care about mercury in the groundwater.

421
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,200
They just want to pass inspection as fast and cheap as possible.

422
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,740
He had a budget,

423
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,790
it was never enough,

424
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,050
but they didn't care how he spent it,

425
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,590
as long as they passed inspection.

426
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,510
Well,how did evan deal with that?

427
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,140
He drank.

428
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,200
It got bad.

429
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,870
How bad?

430
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,000
I thought he might hurt himself.

431
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,020
I didn't know if he could live with it.

432
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,410
How's his relationship with your son liam?

433
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,080
He doesn't have one.

434
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,850
I had to threaten to take him to court to get him to pay child support.

435
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,650
Must've either scared the hell out of him or really pissed him off.

436
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,740
Why's that?

437
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,040
Because every sunday night for the past 9 months

438
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,160
he tosses $2,000 cash through the mail slot.

439
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,540
He left long before I threw him out.

440
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,960
I don't know.

441
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,740
I will.

442
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,700
But I promise I'm going to give it to you.

443
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,550
Ok.

444
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
I love you,too.

445
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,550
Everything ok?

446
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,580
Yeah.

447
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,210
You know, for a guy claiming to be innocent,

448
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,030
he's acting pretty guilty.

449
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,720
I never underestimate the effect being confronted by the fbi will have on a suspect.

450
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,920
I don't think he's affected,

451
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,380
I think he's freaked out.

452
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,760
In the time we've been watching him,

453
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,380
he's packed his belongings into cardboard boxes,

454
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,010
hit his attorney's office and 4 banks.

455
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,210
It does look like he's getting ready to run.

456
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,870
The question is,what do we do?

457
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,870
For now,nothing.

458
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,710
We just watcH.

459
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,650
All those people?

460
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,380
No booze or music?

461
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,050
That's either a very lame going away party or an edf meeting.

462
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,450
We need to set surveillance up. Grab your camera.

463
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,550
Where should I set up?

464
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,600
Right here.

465
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,270
If he's hiding something,

466
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,150
we don't have a warrant,

467
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,550
we don't have supplies,

468
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,270
you want to intimidate him.

469
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,980
I want another chance to find out what he's hiding.

470
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,770
Ok

471
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,680
smile,everybody.

472
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,780
it looks like intimidation worked.

473
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,770
So what is it with you?

474
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,200
Shoving a bunch of dead kids in my face wasn't enough?

475
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,700
Thought I needed a little harassment,too?

476
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,400
It's over,all right?

477
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,630
I denounced the fires and the people responsible for them,

478
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,530
and I just disbanded the edf.

479
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,240
If the edf had nothing to do with the fires,

480
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,550
why would you disband?

481
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,950
Do you have kids,agent hotchner?

482
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,220
I have a son like you.

483
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,340
Good.Then I'm gonna tell you this,

484
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,790
one father to another.

485
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,060
I started the edf for my son.

486
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,010
And yours.

487
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,970
Not to have some other guy's son burn to death.

488
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,780
Hope your pictures come out.

489
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,130
Prentiss,does he look like he weighs 185 to you?

490
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,880
165,maybe.

491
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,940
Why would he hold a meeting when he knew we were watching?

492
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,330
He wanted us to see it.

493
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,770
He wanted to make sure that we saw him trying to do the right thing.

494
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,380
You don't believe him?

495
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,810
I don't know.

496
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:01,120
He seemed pretty angry for a guy who's trying to do the right thing.

497
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,560
That's why we need to get those photos to garcia.

498
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,880
What do you mean?

499
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,670
Either he's angry because he's guilty of a wrongdoing,

500
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,520
or he's angry because his attempts to do the right thing with the edf have gotten people killed,

501
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,670
but either way  the arsonist was here tonight.

502
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,330
Yeah,I'll show you a sick,deranged coward,

503
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,450
you ignorant son of a bitch.

504
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,170
Deranged coward.

505
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,510
I'll show you a deranged coward.

506
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,050
The victim was a cpa.

507
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:01,300
Greg ballou,39,white,6-feet,handsome.

508
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,540
He was talking to his fiance on his cell when it happened.

509
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,590
This kerosene is the same exact type used in the other fires.

510
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,790
Well,hotch had abby under surveillance at the time of the attack,

511
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,180
so we know abby's not the unsub.

512
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,500
Witnesses put the gold sedan here,

513
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,590
so we know this is our guy.

514
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,520
And given that the attack occurred less than 30 minutes

515
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,710
after the edf meeting and abby's house is less than a mile from here.

516
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,890
Chances are the unsub was at abby's house.

517
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,230
He parked some distance away and walked.

518
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,740
This victim wasn't even connected to the edf list.

519
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:28,030
He was just a guy who looked like he had a nice life like the others.

520
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,550
The unsub didn't go into a house,

521
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,650
he barely even got out of his car.

522
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,670
There was no planning whatsoever. Why?

523
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,950
He's evolving.

524
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,090
He's doing it fast.

525
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,360
He's smarter than that.

526
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,330
This was random,impulsive,adolescent.
{

527
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,150
Like a tantrum.

528
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,060
He's got displaced aggression.

529
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,920
He listens to abby denounce him and his work,

530
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,540
it enrages him,

531
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,550
and so that's the trigger.

532
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,700
Unsub lashes out immediately.

533
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,530
Well,if he was at abby's we have him on camera.

534
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,100
It's just a matter of time before garcia has a suspect list.

535
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,200
He's evolving too rapidly.

536
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,050
He's gonna attack again soon.

537
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,470
We're gonna have to trust this abby guy with the profile.

538
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,430
Let's go.

539
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,010
He's leaving, but not the way we thought.

540
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,780
What do you mean?

541
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,560
He's seeing his oncologist.

542
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,060
Ohh,god.

543
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,210
It makes sense.

544
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,890
The banks,

545
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,380
the attorney.

546
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,510
He's putting his affairs in order.

547
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,610
Yeah.

548
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,440
Which one is your son?

549
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,010
Catcher.

550
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,380
Does he know you're here?

551
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,850
I think so, but we have an arrangement.

552
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,200
What's that?

553
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,490
We both pretend I'm not.

554
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:57,760
I'm sorry.

555
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,850
How long do you have?

556
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,560
6 months would be a miracle.

557
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,610
And you haven't told anyone?

558
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,760
No.

559
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,860
It's leukemia.

560
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,200
Lust can be lethal.

561
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,330
I started the edf right after I was diagnosed.

562
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,740
How did you know?

563
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,090
My father,when I was in high school

564
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,800
everyone knew he had affairs

565
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,530
even my mother-- but nobody talked about it,

566
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,660
so i decided to confront him.

567
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,910
And I followed him--

568
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,670
the lawyer's,the doctor'S

569
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,590
the banks, the weight-loss,

570
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,860
and it all came back.

571
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,190
He had lung cancer.

572
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,000
Well,you know what benzene is?

573
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,110
I know it causes cancer.

574
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,920
Leukemia.

575
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,220
It's also highly flammable.

576
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,220
They kept it in underground tanks.

577
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,430
It's expensive to clean up--

578
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,650
cheaper to hide.

579
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,990
My specialty.

580
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,640
Most of the properties were zoned "cr",

581
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,050
commercial-- warehouses where nobody worked,

582
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,510
so what's the harm,right?

583
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:34,670
I just found out that one of those jobs was sold and rezoned "es".

584
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,470
Elementary school.

585
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,770
And you didn't report it?

586
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,660
I report it,

587
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,330
they come after me

588
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,540
and I leave nothing for my son.

589
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,130
That's why I started the edf,

590
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,740
the L.U.S.T. List.

591
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,890
I was trying to do the right thing.

592
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,530
You still can.

593
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,820
I don't know who he is.

594
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,590
He was at your house last night

595
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,040
and he was angry.

596
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,960
Everybody was angry last night,

597
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,490
they were furious that I shut it all down.

598
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,890
He was angry for a different reason.

599
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,730
What you said enraged him.

600
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,040
But he's a coward, he wouldn't confront you.

601
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,490
He was probably the only one who wasn't angry at the time.

602
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,770
He didn't express anything

603
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,620
until after he left.

604
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,940
Vincent stiles.

605
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,210
Thank you.

606
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,320
Vincent stiles.
Vincent Stiles

607
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,960
Abby's leaving, keep a trail on him

608
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,950
until we have stiles just to be sure.

609
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,620
Copy that.I have abby.

610
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,100
Clear.

611
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Gideon,he's not here.

612
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,920
He got the company names from the edf website,

613
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,440
then he watched the offices until he found employees that suited his taste.

614
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,120
He just left.

615
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,260
A neighbor saw him leave.

616
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,940
He's a pharmaceutical sales rep,

617
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,900
he's been living here since his divorce 6 weeks ago.

618
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,110
That's the stressor.

619
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,890
Yeah,talk to me.

620
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,020
Yeah,I'll let him know.

621
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,010
What?

622
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,230
Abby shook the tail we had on him.

623
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,350
Bet you were afraid I wasn't coming,huh?

624
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,800
Look.

625
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,110
Those things that I said about you

626
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,040
I'm sorry.

627
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,960
I had to say them.

628
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,330
I know  you're an artist.

629
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,720
A genius.

630
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,310
I appreciate your true value.

631
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,880
So what, you just came here to apologize?

632
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,920
No  I came here because I respect your talent.

633
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,930
And I want to take full advantage of it.
¨

634
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,540
Garcia checked abby's phone records,

635
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,770
and he called stiles right after I left him.

636
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,220
Well,you saw someone abby identified with.

637
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,910
I can't killers, I save lives, I'm a hero,

638
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,540
until my key hits my front door,

639
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,430
and then i'm just the father and the husband who's never there.

640
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,850
I got that one.

641
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,430
Here's the thing.

642
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,080
When I'm home,

643
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,380
I'm in this silent panic

644
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,550
because I know that I have to be as good as I can as fast as I can,

645
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,970
because any minute the phone is gonna ring and my time is up,

646
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,600
and that panic is exactly what I saw in abby.

647
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,600
Good. You're abby.

648
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,280
You're a dead man walking, you gotta make this right.

649
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,160
You have no time left, how do you do it?

650
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,090
Come on,don't think about it, you know the answer.What is it?

651
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,170
I'd stop him.

652
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,200
How?

653
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,590
I'd burn him.

654
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,720
The same way he killed them.

655
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,270
I'd do it where nobody could get hurt.

656
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,610
Which is why I would call it in first.

657
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,650
We got a 9-1-1 anonymous tip for a fire in the harbor district.

658
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,390
Is it a warehouse?

659
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,280
Yeah.6000 san alameda.
¹

660
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,400
- Can you call garcia? - She's right here.
-

661
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,460
Hey,garcia, can you check the zoning code on a warehouse at 6000 san alameda?

662
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,910
Yeah,I certainly can.

663
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,930
The sfpd chopper circled the harbor twice.

664
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,230
There's no sign of fire.

665
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,900
Ok,6000 san alameda is a commercial storage facility.

666
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,610
But it looks like the property was just sold

667
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,470
and the lot was approved for zone conversion.

668
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,440
"Cr" to "es".

669
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,290
Yeah,that's right.

670
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,040
"Cr",commercial,what's "es"?

671
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,420
Elementary school,and there's a leaking benzene tank underneath it.

672
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,670
It's not a false alarm.

673
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,990
But there's no fire there.

674
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,280
There's about to be.

675
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,500
I started without you.

676
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,040
This is how you do it, right?

677
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,590
Well,fire's a fire.

678
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,880
Once it gets going, it don't matter.

679
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,400
That's not--

680
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,870
that's not really true,though,is it?

681
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

682
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,880
There's something missing from this scenario, don't you think?

683
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,750
I'm sorry, you lost me.

684
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,130
The innocent family.

685
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,140
You know, the victims.
Ì

686
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,470
That's what the suit's for, right?

687
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,820
So you can see the terror on their faces as they burn?

688
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,930
But of course,then, you're here to kill me,right?

689
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,520
You're dead right.

690
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,140
We can't put a benzene fire out with water.

691
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,730
All water does is spread it around,

692
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,120
it burns too hot.

693
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,810
Contaminates the ground table.

694
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,870
So we'll let it burn.

695
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,680
We exhaust the fuel.

696
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,700
All we can do is cordon it off, stop it from spreading,

697
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,040
and let the benzene burn out.

698
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,980
Do you understand?

699
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,010
Yeah,I got it.

700
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,430
Does hotchner?

701
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,990
Yeah,what's up?

702
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,460
Don't put me on speaker.

703
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,850
Just listen.

704
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,290
Well,you know, you can go ahead and shoot me,

705
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,800
and then you set this place off like a bomb.

706
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,930
No?

707
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,010
you know,this suit can handle over 1,500 degrees.

708
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,880
Benzene burns so fast,

709
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,300
I won't go through half my air before it goes out.

710
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,440
Oh,you won't even go through that much.

711
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:30,080
See,benzene burns at twice that.

712
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,910
What are you doing?

713
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,890
The right thing.

714
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,950
Why?

715
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,760
You didn't know any of those people.

716
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,970
Neither did you!

717
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,370
This fire will spread!

718
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,880
Fire department's on its way.

719
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,590
They can't fight a benzene fire.

720
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,780
They'll contain it.

721
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,920
Seriously,what--
.

722
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,010
how do you plan on getting out of here?

723
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,100
I don'T.

724
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,000
**********6000 block of san alameda

725
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,450
Morgan,what are you doing?

726
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,270
Hotch,it's too late, man, I'm sorry.
_

727
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,520
Hotch--stop!

728
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,950
Stop,stop!

729
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,060
He's burning to death and we're just gonna stand here?

730
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,790
Look at it, man! It's over!
!

731
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,800
He wanted his death to mean somethinG.

732
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,920
I found this in abby's car.

733
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,790
Gandhi said, "live as if you were to die tomorrow.

734
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,690
Learn as if you were to live forever."

735
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,000
- Here he is. - Thanks.

736
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,070
Mom,what's going on?

737
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,420
It's ok,liam.

738
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,330
Liam?

739
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,940
My name's aaron.

740
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,900
I was a friend of your dad'S.

741
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,700
I saw you with him at my practice.

742
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,930
That's right.

743
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,950
You weren't at his funeral.

744
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,510
I couldn't be there.

745
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,080
I had to be with my family.

746
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:07,330
But I was thinking of him  and you.

747
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,960
Your dad asked me to give you this.

748
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,540
Why you?

749
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:20,890
I don't know.

750
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,290
Maybe because I was young when my dad died.

751
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:31,660
Anyway,you may have some questions some day,

752
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:35,300
and,uh  please feel free to call me,

753
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,160
I'll do everything I can to answer them.
