Criminal Minds
Season 1 Episode 4

2
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,000
Get a good shot at her face

3
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,300
Make a wish!

4
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,100
Come on man! Blow, baby blow!

5
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,400
I thought you are a ********

6
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,300
Come on, Reid.

7
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,000
They're trick candles, Spence Okay?

8
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,300
They gonna come back on every time.

9
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh, mommy to rescue you!

10
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Mommy?

11
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,200
Is it amazing you knows what he knows he's only 24?

12
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,500
*******I'm about 50.

13
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,900
Hope you like chocolate.

14
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Agent Hotchner?

15
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,000
You having fun?

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,100
Yes, definitely. I'm definitely having fun.

17
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,200
Make a wish?

18
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,900
Can I take this hat off?

19
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,000
I wouldn't.

20
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,500
Hey Spence, first piece for the birthday boy.

21
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,800
Do you know she's the only person in the whole world
who calls me "Spence"?

22
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
- Thank you.
- Birthday boy.

23
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
Sorry, guys, the party's over.

24
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,400
We're going to San Diego.

25
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,300
Not for the surfing, huh?

26
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,700
They're calling him the Tommy killer.

27
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,400
6 women raped and murdered in their homes in the last 3 weeks.

28
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,900
6 in 3 weeks?

29
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,000
That's a short fuse.

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,300
And getting shorter. The first 2 were 8 days apart

31
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,900
then the next 4 in 2 weeks.

32
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,100
Rapid escalation. Do you think

33
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,400
he's regressing to a psychopathic frenzy?

34
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,100
No, he's too controlled for that.

35
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,600
See you on the plane.

36
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,200
Why the Tommy killer?

37
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,700
You know the rock opera?

38
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,900
This unsub glues the victims' eyes wide open.

39
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,000
He wants them to see him.

40
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,300
And feel him.

41
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,700
French poet Jacques Rigaut said

42
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,500
"don't forget that I cannot see myself

43
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,000
that my role is limited to being the one
who looks in the mirror."

44
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Brenda Samms was found yesterday by her children

45
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
when they got home from school.

46
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,700
She had been strangled with a thin ligature, possibly a wire.

47
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,500
No weapon left at the scene.

48
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,200
Residue on the wrist and mouth

49
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,600
indicate that duct tape was used and then removed.

50
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
Also not found at the scene.

51
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,200
Brought it with him, took it with him.

52
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,600
He also started leaving messages at the fourth scene.

53
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,600
This was on the mirrors.

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,300
"Fair lady, throw those costly robes aside.

55
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,700
No longer may you glory in your pride.

56
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,100
Take leave of all your carnal, vain delight."

57
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,700
"I've come to summon you away this night."

58
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,500
It's a ballad from the late 1600s.

59
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,800
A dialogue betwixt death and a lady.

60
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,900
A 17th century ballad?

61
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,900
Essentially, a woman begging death to live.

62
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,500
What kind of person knows this ballad?

63
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,900
Are we looking for a literature professor?

64
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,700
Anyone with an internet connection, actually.

65
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,400
You should see what comes in

66
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,500
when you type the word "death" into a search engine.

67
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,500
Reid, no wonder you can't get a date.

68
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,700
Reid, you stay on the messages.

69
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,600
See if there's a deeper meaning.

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,500
It definitely looks like

71
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,200
he ransacked the crime scene pretty well.

72
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,800
A lot of damage, nothing taken.

73
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
The eyes are the thing, the signature.

74
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
The behavior that isn't necessary for the murder,

75
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,300
but necessary for the emotional release.

76
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,200
That's what he's there for.

77
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
There used to be a widely held belief

78
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,700
that the eyes record a snapshot of the last thing
a person sees before they die.

79
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,100
Yeah, that's right.

80
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,400
People used to write poems about talking to death.

81
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Ballads.

82
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Whatever.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,900
You think they'll ever run out of new things
to do with their victims?

84
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,700
Well, finding new ways to hurt each other
is what we're good at.

85
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,100
Captain Griffith, task force commander.

86
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,700
Sorry, we all get tunnel vision.

87
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,500
I'm special agent Hotchner,
this is agent Jareau, our liaison.

88
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
I appreciate you coming out.

89
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,700
Thanks, hope we can help.

90
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,600
Hi, you've reached the Chandlers.

91
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Leave a message, and have a beautiful day.

92
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,700
What a good soccer game.

93
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,100
I'm so proud of you.

94
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,200
When's mommy coming in?

95
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,600
Happy anniversary, honey. Love you.

96
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,300
Ready for bed, mom. Will you tuck me in?

97
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,500
This unsub glues the victims' eyes wide open.

98
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
They're calling him the Tommy killer.

99
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,600
It definitely looks like he ransacked the crime scene.

100
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,700
Do you have a lot of homework, sweetie?

101
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,000
Mom? Mom? Mom, where are you?

102
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,700
"My name is death. Have you not heard of me?

103
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,400
You may as well be mute..."

104
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,900
creepy, huh?

105
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,700
Actually, conversations between death and his victims

106
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,800
was a fairly popular literary and
artistic theme throughout the renaissance.

107
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,500
Yeah, creepy.

108
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,800
He strikes during the day
in upper-middle-class neighborhoods.

109
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,000
Extremely high-risk victims at a high-risk time.

110
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,400
He's confident in his ability.

111
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,500
Looks to be about a 5-square mile radius.

112
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,800
So he probably has a vehicle.

113
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
You wanna see that crime scene?

114
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,400
It's still taped off.

115
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,900
The husband won't go back inside.

116
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,000
Let's go.

117
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,300
All right, so we need answers to these questions.

118
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,600
What does the evidence tell you about the sexual aspect?

119
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,200
What kind of rapist is he independent of the homicides?

120
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,100
I'm on it.

121
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,900
It looks like what he's written at the scenes

122
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,800
are most of the first 3 verses of the same ballad.

123
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,400
Most of?

124
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,500
It's only one part of the conversation.

125
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,000
There's no "betwixt".

126
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,800
Death speaks, but the lady never answers.

127
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Maybe he feels like their bodies are answer enough.

128
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
Very nice.

129
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,100
This profiling really works?

130
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a tool.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,200
You can tell all about a guy from looking at the scene.

132
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,300
Well, the scene's only part of it.

133
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,400
We also use victimology, precedent.

134
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
We can usually get a fairly clear picture of the guy.

135
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,000
Our guys went over it pretty well.

136
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm sure they did.

137
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,600
Local officers aren't trained to look for the things we look for.

138
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
What's that?

139
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,600
Hate, insecurity, fear, anger.

140
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,100
That's all at the scene?

141
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,900
It's all in his behavior.

142
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,000
You know anything about our guy yet?

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,500
Yeah. He isn't gonna stop until he's caught.

144
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,400
You increased patrols in these neighborhoods when the pattern was identified?

145
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,600
After the fourth victim.

146
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,700
Bosses cancelled days off, vacations.

147
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,900
Neighborhood full of cruisers,
and he still struck 2 more times.

148
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,500
He blends. Gideon.

149
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,900
There may have been another attempt 6 blocks from the station house.

150
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,600
Attempt?

151
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,400
The husband interrupted, and the attacker got away

152
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,100
but Elle and I are headed over there right now.

153
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,900
Well, we're already at the last crime scene.

154
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,700
Let us know if you identify a suspect.

155
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,100
Suspect?

156
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,800
There might have been another attack not far from your station.

157
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
Hey. Hey. Hey. Where you going?

158
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,300
Over there.

159
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,500
Well, units are already heading that way.

160
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,100
We can get more accomplished here.

161
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,300
You're kidding me, right?

162
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,700
No. If there's an arrest

163
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,600
what we find here will help you prosecute.

164
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,200
The scene won't be pristine forever.

165
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,700
- Guys, knock yourselves out.
- Thank you.

166
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,900
Hey, wait a minute.

167
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,900
The unsub went through the back, right?

168
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,100
The family room. It's the window full of print dust.

169
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,900
Gideon, I'm going around the house.

170
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,700
Ok, not that easy to maneuver.

171
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,800
That means I'm a little bit athletic.

172
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,300
All right.

173
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,200
I messed with something in here.

174
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,200
Broken cappuccino machine.

175
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,300
Took the appliances, which are upstairs. Why?

176
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,800
Why would I take the time?

177
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Lucky woman.

178
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,600
You know what, she's probably not feeling so lucky right about now.

179
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,000
You're absolutely sure about that, Mr. Gordon?

180
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
He was black and 6 feet tall.

181
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,300
I watched him run out that back door.

182
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,200
Get a description out in the field A.S.A.P.

183
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,200
Inter-racial serial sex crimes are rare.

184
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,800
Are they impossible?

185
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,700
No.

186
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,700
Then what's your point?

187
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,800
Only to provide you with information.

188
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm gonna go talk to her.

189
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,500
May I ask why?

190
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,400
She's surrounded by men.

191
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,100
Mrs. Gordon? I'm Elle.

192
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,800
Would you like to go outside?

193
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,800
It's all right.

194
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,500
We're just gonna go some place quiet.

195
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,800
Here's where I got the china.

196
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,800
The silver.

197
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,500
I didn't take it, I broke it.

198
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,300
Why wouldn't she hear me?

199
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,300
Because I did it after.

200
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,000
"You may as well be mute.

201
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,500
There is no time at all for vain dispute

202
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,100
your riches, gold, and garments, jewels bright

203
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,100
your house and land must on new owners light."

204
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,900
I really don't know that much about him.

205
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,500
Well, you don't have to.

206
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,600
Just take a little time to collect your thoughts

207
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,900
to just sit here, breathe.

208
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,100
You don't want to ask me questions?

209
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,100
Not until you're ready.

210
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,400
I'll be right behind that doorway.

211
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,500
I didn't even know he was in the house.

212
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,900
Is that common?

213
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,100
Very.

214
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,100
She had a workout video on.

215
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,800
Step aerobics.

216
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,100
Step aerobics?

217
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
With the platforms?

218
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,900
Step up, step down, step up, step down?

219
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,300
Where's the platform?

220
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,300
He spent a lot of time here.

221
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,600
What, so he vacuumed?

222
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,100
I mean, there's no marks from the platforms.

223
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,200
A lot of time.

224
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,400
The broken things.

225
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,700
She must have already been dead or incapacitated when he did that.

226
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,900
Cappuccino maker from the kitchen, dishes, vases, broken jewelry.

227
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,000
Symbols.

228
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,100
"Your riches, gold, garments, jewels bright.

229
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,500
Your house and land must on new owners light."

230
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,800
Her riches.

231
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,200
Right.

232
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,100
Ever feel like there's something obvious right in front of you,

233
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,400
you just can't see it?

234
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, usually right before a woman dumps me.

235
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
He slapped me from behind

236
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,100
he pulled me down on the floor.

237
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,500
I tried to scratch him and bite him, but he was so strong.

238
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,400
And then my husband came home from work.

239
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,900
He screamed, and the man ran out the door.

240
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,000
He was a black man.

241
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,500
Bill was sure of it, but I...I only remember his eyes.

242
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,800
When we were fighting, I kept staring him right in the eyes.

243
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,000
I remember thinking, "if he's gonna kill me

244
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,200
then he's gonna have to look at me while he does."

245
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,700
And he just kept staring back at me through the ski mask.

246
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,700
A ski mask.

247
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,800
Yeah.

248
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,600
It's all right. You did good.

249
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
The verses.

250
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Found something?

251
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,800
Not an answer, a question.

252
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
I found the full text.

253
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
He's pretty much following it to a t,

254
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,600
at least the death side of the conversation.

255
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,500
But?

256
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,700
Why didn't he leave them at the first 3 murders?

257
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,500
I mean, this ballad is 10 verses long just on the death side.

258
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,900
He's got plenty to work with.

259
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,500
But if it's not part of his signature

260
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,000
it isn't something that he has to do for an emotional reason

261
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,300
then, I mean, why start?

262
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,400
JJ, find out when the press ran the first story on this unsub.

263
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,200
When?

264
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,300
After which victim.

265
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Yeah, you got it.

266
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,800
What're you thinking?

267
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
He wasn't getting enough attention.

268
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,200
The police department sometimes
don't even realize they're looking at a pattern.

269
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,700
Yeah, until somebody tells 'em.

270
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,300
The first story ran the morning
after the fourth victim was found.

271
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,800
The increased patrols didn't begin until after the fourth victim, either.

272
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,300
Yeah, the police didn't realize what was happening

273
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,100
he writes his verse, and--

274
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,700
and everyone knows that he was there.

275
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
The offender in this new attempt is a black male.

276
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Black male? That's cross racial. That doesn't happen.

277
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,000
What about Herbert Mullin?

278
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,500
He killed 14 different people of
completely varying ages, races, and creeds.

279
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,200
But there was no sexual component to his crimes.

280
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,800
And he wore a ski mask.

281
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,600
This attacker wore a ski mask.

282
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,200
Tell 'em we're ready.

283
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,800
For a profile?

284
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,000
We're gonna make Tommy contact us.

285
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
The unsub brought the weapons with him

286
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,200
tape, glue, wire.

287
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,400
He did not leave them at the scene.

288
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,200
He took them when he left.

289
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,200
He has a kind of killing kit that he carries.

290
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,800
Organized killers usually have
a skilled job, likely technology related

291
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,600
which may involve the use of the hands.

292
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,400
The crime scenes are far enough apart that he needs a vehicle.

293
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
This will be well kept, obsessively clean, as will be his home.

294
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,600
He's diurnal, the attacks occurred during the day

295
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,900
so the vehicle may be related to his work, possibly a company car or truck.

296
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,200
We believe he watches the victims for a time

297
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
learns the rhythms of the home, knows his time frame.

298
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
You're not gonna catch him accidentally.

299
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,000
He destroys symbols of wealth in the victim's homes.

300
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,800
He harbors envy of and hatred toward people of a higher social class.

301
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,600
He feels invisible around them.

302
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,100
Class is the theme of the poem
which he left at the various crime scenes.

303
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,200
At one point in the poem, the women attempts to bribe death

304
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
but he doesn't accept it.

305
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,500
He says this is the one moment when riches mean nothing

306
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,600
when death comes, the poor and the rich are exactly alike.

307
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,500
So he's poor.

308
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,000
Probably middle-class.

309
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,200
A decidedly lower-class person would
stick out in a highly patrolled neighborhood.

310
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
This guy appears to belong there. He blends in.

311
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Why does he glue the eyes open?

312
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,000
The unsub is an exploitative rapist.

313
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,600
Most rape victims close their eyes during the attack, turn their heads.

314
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,400
For some rapists, this ruins the fantasy.

315
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,600
For this type of rapist, the goal is more related to

316
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,600
the victim watching him than the act itself.

317
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,200
The verses, the staging, the aggressive language, "I am death,"

318
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,800
this is a guy who, while being in control of the crime scene

319
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,800
almost certainly feels inadequate in the rest of his life.

320
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,400
That's why he couldn't wait for you to figure out what he'd done.

321
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,000
Why he needed to make sure all his crimes were counted.

322
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,900
His victims, they represent whatever it is that's controlling him

323
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
and he wants that control back.

324
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,300
He is under the thumb of a powerful woman who frightens him.

325
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,500
And a final point. He is white.

326
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,200
We have witnesses that identify him as a black male.

327
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,800
The attacker was black.

328
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
He is not the Tommy killer.

329
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Mrs. Gordon's husband came home
at the same time that he always does.

330
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,200
The Tommy killer would've known that.

331
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,900
And Mrs. Gordon's attacker wore a ski mask.

332
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,200
The unsub knows when he walks into a house

333
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,700
he's going to kill the woman who lives there.

334
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,900
If you're not leaving any witnesses, why wear a ski mask?

335
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,800
And he wants the victim to see him anyway.

336
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,900
Your attempted rapist is a garden variety disorganized young man.

337
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,700
As the victim's age goes up, generally

338
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,200
the attacker's age goes down.

339
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,600
Mrs. Gordon is about 60, which puts her rapist at about 20.

340
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,600
And it takes years to develop the level of calm and sophistication

341
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
that Tommy displays at a crime scene.

342
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,000
The rapist is far too young for that.

343
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,900
Mrs. Gordon told me that there's a young man

344
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,000
who delivers groceries to their home.

345
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,100
He fits a lot of what we're describing here.

346
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,400
Great. So we're back to zero on Tommy.

347
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,000
Not at all.

348
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,600
May I see you in your office for a moment?

349
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,200
You have a tip line for the public?

350
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,100
Yes.

351
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,300
We have a technician at quantico
who can tap into your phone system.

352
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,600
He's gonna call us?

353
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,200
Well, he's gone out of his way to show you how scary he is.

354
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,100
And when the 11:00 news leads with the capture

355
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,200
of a 6 foot tall black man in connection with his crimes

356
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,900
he's gonna be furious.

357
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
Furious enough to call.

358
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,300
Later, man. See ya.

359
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
FBI. You're under arrest.

360
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,700
You're under arrest for the attempted rape of Marcia Gordon.

361
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,600
What?!

362
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,500
The FBI's behavioral analysis unit was called in yesterday afternoon

363
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,200
by the San Diego police department to assist in the ongoing Tommy killer investigation.

364
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,900
The unit is headed--

365
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,200
I can now announce that our office has assisted

366
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,200
in making an arrest in connection with the investigation.

367
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,100
That's all I can say at this time.

368
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,900
He confessed to Mrs. Gordon's attack before we even got to the car.

369
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,700
Thanks, Elle.

370
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,500
Should just make the 11:00 news.

371
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,600
Did they get good footage?

372
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,800
Yeah, couldn't miss him.

373
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,300
Good. Now we wait.

374
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,400
Contact Garcia.

375
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,400
Go for Mrs. Penelope Garcia.

376
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,700
Ready with the trap and trace?

377
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,400
Peaches, this is the office of unmitigated superiority.

378
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
I am always ready.

379
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,100
With the awesome power I have in this room

380
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,700
all I need is 15 seconds on the phone to nail this skeevy perv.

381
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,000
15 seconds?

382
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,700
If that.

383
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,100
I can now announce that our office has assisted

384
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,200
in making an arrest in connection with the investigation.

385
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,100
That's really all I can say at this time.

386
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,500
Turn that damn television down!

387
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,700
I'm sorry.

388
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,200
We're still waiting, Garcia.

389
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,300
God, I hate waiting like this.

390
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,400
Do you think it's weird that I knew that ballad?

391
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,300
I don't know how it is that you know half the things you know

392
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,300
but I'm glad you do.

393
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,100
Do you think it's why I can't get a date?

394
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,700
You ever ask anyone out?

395
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,400
No.

396
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,100
That's why you can't get a date.

397
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,400
Detective Martin.

398
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,500
Hey. Hey.

399
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,500
Line 6, Penelope. Line 6.

400
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
You stupid, incompetent sons of bitches!

401
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,700
I don't make mistakes! I am death! You hear me?!

402
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,900
I am death! You'll see now.

403
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,200
Tomorrow, mark my words, you will see.

404
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,200
And while I'm taking her, I'm gonna be thinking of you.

405
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,600
Anything?

406
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Are you kidding me?

407
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
I don't know how this is possible

408
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,800
because there was definitely
enough time for me to get a location

409
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,700
but I got nothing. I got absolutely nothing.

410
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,800
Let me work on this.

411
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,900
She said she got nothing.

412
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,700
Nothing?

413
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,000
We missed him?

414
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,200
We have an undercover car for each of your teams

415
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,700
and the entire damn department out there, too.

416
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,700
Remember, a truck. Maybe a work truck
in excellent condition.

417
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,000
Everyone knows.

418
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,100
All right, he might make a mistake today.

419
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,800
He's angry, and he probably hasn't
done the kind of surveillance he'd like.

420
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,100
Yeah, well, neither have we.

421
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
Let's go, Reid.

422
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,700
I'll bring the car around.

423
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,600
We'll find him.

424
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,000
That's the last place he watched.

425
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,800
That house.

426
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,900
Morgan said the family hasn't moved back in.

427
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,800
Probably never will.

428
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,800
It's the eyes.

429
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,100
Excuse me?

430
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,700
It's the eyes, Elle.

431
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,200
Just something not right about the eyes.

432
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,500
If you mean what he does to them, yeah, I agree.

433
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:56,100
No. It's almost a classic move for
an exploitative rapist to force a victim to watch.

434
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,300
But?

435
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,400
We're missing something about it.

436
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,400
It's 10:30 already.

437
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,500
All he said was tomorrow. He didn't...

438
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,000
specify morning.

439
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,200
Reid, this guy's gotta spend a lot of time in that house.

440
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,100
A lot. He needs it to be morning.

441
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,200
Are we sure this is a good spot?

442
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,300
3 of the victims lived within a block of this street.

443
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,700
It's the main artery through the neighborhood.

444
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,600
True, but 3 victims in the same block could mean he's done with the area.

445
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,800
Or that he's just really familiar with it.

446
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,700
And comfortable in it.

447
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,200
But then, on the other hand

448
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,600
the other victims lived more than a mile in either direction.

449
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,700
Right.

450
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,600
God, I hate not having a plan.

451
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,500
We're looking for a needle in a haystack here.

452
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,800
Actually, it's more like we're looking for
a needle in a pile of needles.

453
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,800
What?

454
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,200
A needle would stand out in a haystack.

455
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,000
Ok. And we're not looking for someone who stands out?

456
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,300
No. We're looking for a
particular needle in a pile of needles.

457
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,400
Can I help you folks with something?

458
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,500
FBI.

459
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,600
Oh, sorry.

460
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,300
After the fourth killing, P.D. Doubled the patrol in these neighborhoods,

461
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,300
then double them again after the fifth and sixth.

462
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,200
Yet our unsub still watched the houses.

463
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,600
How could he not have been seen?

464
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,200
Is that an oriole?

465
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,000
No. A black-headed grosbeak.

466
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,900
Grosbeak?

467
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,400
Grosbeak, female.

468
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,800
Orson Welles said all the birds that
belong to our sex have prettier feathers

469
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,800
'cause males have got to try to justify their existence.

470
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,300
We spend all our time screaming, "look at me. Look at me."

471
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,900
"Mommy, mommy. Look at me."

472
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
Yeah?

473
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,600
25?

474
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,800
Look at me.

475
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,700
Ok.

476
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,900
Garcia couldn't get a fix on the call

477
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,800
because it was routed through 25 different substations.

478
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
25 substations.

479
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,400
He wanted them to see him.

480
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,900
We established that.

481
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,400
He's meticulous. Nothing is an accident.

482
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,300
He vacuumed.

483
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Seeing is about domination.

484
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,600
His creation.

485
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,500
He positioned everything exactly the way he wanted it.

486
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,900
And?

487
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,200
If the eyes were so they could watch the attack

488
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,000
why are they all facing away from it?

489
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,600
In that position, they couldn't see him during.

490
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,100
He wanted them to see him afterward.

491
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,300
Office of unfettered omniscience. Penelope Garcia is in.

492
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,900
Speak, oh fortunate one.

493
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,600
Garcia, it's Elle.

494
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,300
Could you get into the phone repair records in San Diego?

495
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,400
Sunshine...

496
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,900
I can run centcom from here and still
participate in simultaneous tetris tournaments.

497
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,400
I'm looking for repairmen cross-referenced with the murders in San Diego.

498
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
It could be as much as four or five days prior.

499
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,600
See if there are any common names.

500
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,300
Total cake. Stay on the line.

501
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,100
What you got?

502
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,800
He's a phone technician, Hotch.

503
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,300
Police are looking for someone walking around the neighborhood in broad daylight.

504
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,000
Who notices a phone guy up on a pole?

505
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,600
He can watch for husbands leaving for work

506
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,300
watch for police patrols, know when the neighborhood's quiet.

507
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,600
He knows when he'll have plenty of time.

508
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,200
He can even tap into a phone line to make sure someone's home.

509
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,700
How about routing a call through 25 substations?

510
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,400
Backyard? Hey, he's just looking for a pole.

511
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,700
Got tape? Course he does.

512
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,400
Wire? He's a repairman.

513
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Sounds right, Jason.

514
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,900
It is right, and we have his name.

515
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,900
There you go. Oh, that's a good boy.

516
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,500
You want some juice, big boy?

517
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,200
You want some juice? Ok.

518
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,000
Mommy.

519
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,400
Ooh, yes, I know. We're gonna have some apple juice, pookie.

520
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,100
That's your favorite.

521
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,600
I know. I know you love it.

522
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
FBI.

523
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,000
I need to know where one of your technicians is.

524
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,600
FBI?

525
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,900
Where are your technicians?

526
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,900
They're all out in the field.

527
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,200
Listen! I need Franklin Graney right now.

528
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Now you'll lay down.

529
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:35,100
Please. Please don't hurt me. I have a baby.

530
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,000
Cooperate and you'll be all right.

531
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,400
Please. Oh!

532
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,800
Cooperate and you'll be all right.

533
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,800
He's on service calls in the area of Orange and Chandler.

534
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,300
Get a hold of Hotch.

535
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,100
Tell him to bring the team and any S.D. Cops he can round up.

536
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,400
This is his truck.

537
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,700
Fan out. Go through yards. Look at telephone poles.

538
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,000
He's around here.

539
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,400
Let me out. Let me out.

540
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,400
875 Orange, Hotch. Back door.

541
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,400
Never acknowledge me. Never...think of me.

542
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,800
I'll shoot her.

543
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,200
No, you won't, Franklin.

544
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,700
Yes, I will.

545
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,100
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

546
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,500
I'll just say we caught a low-life burglar.

547
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,400
You didn't turn out to be Tommy after all.

548
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,000
You will remain uncaught.

549
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,600
After a while, people will forget you. You'll be nothing.

550
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,600
Once every 5 or 10 years, they'll do a TV show.

551
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,900
They'll ask, "what ever happened to
that Tommy guy? Why'd he disappear?"

552
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,000
Then they'll stop talking about it altogether.

553
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,400
Put the gun down.

554
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,900
Come on. Walk outta here with me.

555
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,100
I'll make sure your face is splashed across every newspaper and TV in the country.

556
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,500
Tommy killer: Franklin Graney.

557
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,300
Everyone will see you then.

558
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,700
Bundy, Dahmer, Graney.

559
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,100
Whole world will know who you are.

560
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,700
It's up to you, Franklin.

561
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,800
You can be famous, or you can be invisible.

562
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,300
You'll tell everyone?

563
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,000
I have a media specialist outside right now.

564
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,300
It is your choice.

565
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,100
Promise?

566
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,600
Yes, sir. I promise.

567
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,400
Back away from the gun.

568
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,900
Where's my baby? My baby!

569
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,700
He's fine. He's just fine.

570
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,000
You're ok.

571
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,400
Thank you.

572
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,300
It's ok.

573
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,100
It's ok.

574
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,300
Rose Kennedy once said, "birds sing after a storm.

575
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:43,400
"Why shouldn't people feel as free to delight in whatever sunlight remains to them?"

576
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,300
Oh, I almost forgot. I have something for you.

577
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,000
Oh, yeah?

578
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Forgot to give it to you at the party.

579
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,700
But you don't give birthday presents.

580
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,100
The "red....skins."

581
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,400
It's a V.I.P. Box.

582
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,100
Thank you so much.

583
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,000
Every been to a pro football game?

584
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,800
No, I honestly didn't even know this was football.

585
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,300
You're gonna love it.

586
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,100
We are. You're coming with me, right?

587
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,500
No.

588
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,300
Someone else on the plane is a huge skins fan.

589
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,800
Who?

590
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,100
Only person in the world who calls you Spence.

591
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,000
JJ?

592
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,100
She's a huge redskins fan.

593
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,100
Wh-what should I say?

594
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,400
Checkmate.

595
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,900
Heard you're, uh, a fan of football.
