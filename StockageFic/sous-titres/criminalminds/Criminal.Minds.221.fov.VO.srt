1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,580
Boise National Forest 
BOISE,IDAHO

2
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,410
- Hey,paul,you hear that?
- Yeah.

3
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,340
Hey,you gotta challenge yourself,johnny.

4
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,500
That's the only way 
you're ever going to get better.

5
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,280
Ok,so,you aim straight for the heart

6
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,450
Try to avoid the shoulder blades,and

7
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,990
Uh,should be a quick,clean kill.

8
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,660
Ok,so,don't over think it.

9
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,960
You know what to do,just-- just aim and shoot.

10
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,100
Well,don't worry.

11
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,440
Took me a long time to get my first big one.

12
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,490
You just need more practice.

13
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,420
Hey,hey,easy.

14
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,080
I think we've been here 5 minutes.

15
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,800
Yeah,but look at her,broke away from the group

16
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,670
Guy saw her alone,felt confident,
and made his move.

17
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,260
It must be serious.

18
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,910
Ladies,this is brad,a real F.B.I.agent.

19
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,900
- Really?
- Really.

20
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,200
No way.

21
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,770
That's exciting.
What's it like at quantico?

22
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,720
It's,uh,quite impressive.

23
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,470
- What department are you in?
- That's classified.

24
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,750
Ooh,must be really tough keeping 
all those secrets.

25
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,730
You know,it's a skill like anything else.

26
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,880
Carpenters are good at building stuff,measuring.

27
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,700
F.B.I.is good at keeping secrets 
and kicking criminal ass.

28
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,940
Well,somebody has got to do it.

29
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,110
Oh,do you have to carry your gun and 
badge with you everywhere you go?

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,630
Affirmative.

31
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,350
Can we see it?

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,260
- See what?
- Your badge.

33
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,100
- Please.
- I'm sorry,that's...

34
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,030
Classified.

35
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,100
Figures.Of course.

36
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,620
Tell me,brad,does it look anything like this?

37
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,550
Or,uh,this?

38
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,710
Or maybe this?

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,580
Poor lass,it's a tough job.

40
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,690
Agent jareau.

41
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,890
Lady,you are officially in my top 8,
and I am so blogging about this later.

42
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,940
Clink me.

43
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,970
Sorry,ladies.

44
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,000
A year ago victims and their vehicles 
disappeared from washington state.

45
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,830
They were found over 200 miles away 
in the remote woods of idaho.

46
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,180
Courtney jacobs,24,and shane everett,25.

47
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,970
Autopsy revealed similar entry 
and exit wounds through the chest.

48
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,180
Ballistics?

49
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,610
No bullets were found.

50
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,090
Looks like they were out there for a long time 
before they were killed.

51
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,760
- At least 6 or 7 days.
- Then,what happened in that week?

52
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,850
I don't want to know.

53
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,180
Look at the way they're dressed,they didn't 
voluntarily go into the woods like that.

54
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,470
Yeah,neither did this man.

55
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,580
Found yesterday with similar wounds,
there's still no I.D.

56
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,620
Ok,so,I'm gonna look for missing persons 
in washington.

57
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,800
Look everywhere,we don't know 
where this victim came from

58
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,190
We only know where he ended up.

59
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,780
Kills both males and females.

60
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,610
Victims were found with their clothes on,
no degradation

61
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,470
No experimentation,doesn't look like
 he's interested in either.

62
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,830
A serial killer with no sexual preference?

63
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,150
That'd be a first.

64
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Broken nose and bark is embedded in his face,
looks like he ran into a tree.

65
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,150
Now,how do you miss a huge tree?

66
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,080
Too busy looking behind you.

67
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,860
None of these are defensive wounds.

68
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,860
Courtney jacobs' hands are torn up.

69
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,830
Shane everett has only got one shoe on,
it's like he ran out of the other one.

70
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,220
He sustained numerous injuries 
and just kept going.

71
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,080
Only one thing you run that hard for-- your life.

75
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,540
One man's wilderness is another man's theme park.

76
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,880
Author unknown.

77
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,650
Transporting young,fit victims from washington 
to idaho poses huge risks.

78
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,250
Must have a good reason to chance getting 
pulled over,or have the victims escape.

79
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,120
It says here that every year 100 or 
so people go missing in idaho's wilderness.

80
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,850
With millions of acres to cover,
1/3 of them are never found.

81
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,990
Sounds like the reason as to why this place.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,050
Well,it offers privacy and the possibility 
the body will never be recovered.

83
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,720
An area this remote and rugged suggests that 
the offender is more comfortable in the woods.

84
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,670
Something like a second home.

85
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,920
My grandfather retired to the french alps.

86
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,720
He lived there until he died.

87
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,070
There was a good 10-year stretch 
where he didn't come down off the mountain.

88
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,200
He had no running water,no electricity

89
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,060
And his food supplies,everything,
all of it came from the land.

90
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,720
You spent a lot of time up there?

91
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,820
Yeah,whenever we were in france,which was a lot.

92
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,640
Guess who's getting a gold star?

93
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,300
Oh,that'd be you,baby girl,
if you got some good news for us.

94
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,220
Well,I started my missing persons search 
in spokane county

95
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,040
And wouldn't you know,there's been 10 in the 
last 5 years,all in their early twenties.

96
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:53,920
And isn't this interesting?

97
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,980
It's always in the spring 
and their cars are never recovered.

98
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,910
And fret not,I'm looking for the cars,too.

99
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,480
- Anything else?
- Mmm,oh,local P.D.

100
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,210
I dentified the latest victim 
through dental records.

101
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,270
His name's alex harrison,he's from washington.

102
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,730
Where was he last seen?

103
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,850
Family statements say 
he was traveling to work in spokane

104
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,500
And both victims last year were 
traveling outside of spokane,too.

105
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,020
All victims headed to the city.

106
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,410
And none of them reached their destination.

107
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,900
- Garcia?
- Already on it.

108
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,550
There are 4 major roadways into spokane,
highways 395,195,and highway 2.

109
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,830
There's also interstate 90.

110
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,100
Were there any police reports or 
roadside assistance calls from those highways?

111
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,730
You're going to know that as soon as I do.

112
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,590
Ok,we've got 2 locations.

113
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,370
I'm happy to go to idaho.

114
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,340
Woods is like your second home,right,prentiss?

115
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,400
Yes,sir.

116
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,390
Hey,reid,why don't you go to spokane?

117
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,070
I could use the fresh air.

118
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,160
We'll touch base every couple of hours.

119
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,100
I'll call you when we get on the mountain.

120
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,820
We've got 2 male and 1 female victim,
all about the same age,

121
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,230
But from different socio-economic backgrounds.

122
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,340
The only thing they seem to have in common is 
they were traveling to the same city.

123
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,890
And broken bones.

124
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,230
There's a hairline fracture in the wrist,
a sprained ankle,and a broken nose.

125
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,580
Also,early autopsy reports show soft,
clean tissue damage 

126
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,270
And deep puncture wounds through the major organs.

127
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,680
Bullets flare out when they hit the body,
it's gotta be something else.

128
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,110
Whatever weapon was used cut completely 
through the front of the chest 

129
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,810
And went right out of the back.

130
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,710
It's interesting,given the point of entry,
that each victim has 2 wounds.

131
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,360
And it's always 2.

132
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,360
Uh,raymond schaeffer.

133
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,130
- You must be agent jareau.
- Nice to meet you.

134
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,640
This is special agent aaron hotchner.
Dr.Spencer reid.

135
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,380
This is sheriff raymond schaeffer.

136
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,000
Well,I see you're getting settled.

137
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,400
- Thank you for the space.
- Well,thank you for flying out.

138
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,170
Um,has alex harrison's family been notified yet?

139
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,540
Not yet.

140
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,290
Uh,parents were divorced,he lived with his father.

141
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,560
I was waiting for your unit to arrive.

142
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,350
- I could use the company.
- I'm happy to come along.

143
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,470
- Hotch,I'll let you know what I find.
- Thanks.

144
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,760
Is this your first notification,sheriff?

145
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,220
Uh,is it that obvious?

146
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,340
Uh,I can give you a few tips.

147
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,830
I just got this promotion

148
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,690
And the sheriff I replaced retired after 30 years.

149
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,750
So,I got big shoes to fill.

150
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,380
I'm just happy deaths in our county are down.

151
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,470
Well,believe me,it never gets easy.

152
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,840
This father's worst nightmare 
is about to come true.

153
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,110
Boise National Forest 
BOISE,IDAHO

154
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,500
How was the drive up the mountain?

155
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,250
Well,before or after the flat tire?

156
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,620
That good,huh?

157
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,080
I'm the head ranger,lizzie evans.

158
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,040
Hi,agent prentiss,this is agent morgan.

159
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,540
Agent gideon's still in town.

160
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,060
You must be exhausted from the trip,
but we need to keep moving.

161
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,010
We want to be out of here by nightfall.

162
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,170
Then,by all means,after you.

163
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,180
- Yes?
- Sir,are you timothy harrison?

164
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,160
Is this about alex?

165
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,740
Politely ask them to sit,and,uh,
be prepared for a physical reaction.

166
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,480
I once had a woman faint and hit her head

167
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,060
And I had to give her the news a second time 
at the hospital.

168
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,350
That wasn't fun.

169
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,430
Mr.Harrison,can we sit down?

170
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,300
If you don't mind,I'd like to stand.

171
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,430
Sir,I wish I didn't have to tell you this

172
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,200
But we've found your son alex 
in the boise national forest.

173
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,370
So,he's ok?

174
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,760
I'm so sorry,Mr.Harrison,
but alex wasn't alive when we found him.

175
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,010
Denial is the first emotion

176
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,390
so be prepared to explain to them 
how you know that this is their child.

177
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,300
This is a mistake.

178
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,600
Alex doesn't know anyone in idaho.

179
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,410
How do you even know it's him?

180
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,440
Well,sir,when you file a missing persons report

181
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,740
You gave us access to his dental records.

182
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,610
You're lying.

183
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,180
Be gentle,allow yourself to show emotion.

184
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,600
It'll validate what the family is feeling.

185
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,870
First rule on the police force,
agent jareau,no crying.

186
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,690
God,tell me this isn't true.

187
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,300
I'll do anything,please help me.

188
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,440
We can't imagine what 
you're going through,Mr.Harrison.

189
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,090
He's all I've got,my boy.

190
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,520
Don't you understand?

191
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,750
I do.

192
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,780
Sir,we're investigating alex's death 
as a possible homicide.

193
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,710
Murder?

194
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,060
We were hoping that maybe 
you could answer some questions.

195
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,650
Alex was the best wide out 
the huskies had seen in years.

196
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,210
He was physical,strong.

197
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,560
He had great instincts.

198
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,590
After graduation he wanted a career.

199
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,590
Didn't want to be known as a jock.
This can't be happening.

200
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,750
- I need to call alex's mother.
- Of course.

201
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,250
We'll stay here until your family arrives.

202
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,880
How long have you been a ranger?

203
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,320
5 years now,but I've lived in these woods 
my whole life.

204
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,360
Growing up out here help you do your job?

205
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,730
Look around.
Do you see or hear anything right now?

206
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,870
- No.
- No.

207
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,420
There's a black bear about 25 yards to your right.

208
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,100
How long before we're able to do that?

209
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,360
Depends on how well you use your instincts.

210
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,550
Well,this gives new meaning to the word remote.

211
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,180
Yeah,it'd be awfully hard to find this location 
if you weren't familiar with the area.

212
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,710
There must only be a handful of people 
who know the terrain well enough to survive.

213
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,570
Boot tracks.

214
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,140
They're the same tread,
but they're different sizes.

215
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,550
Well,there's at least 2 people 
who know this terrain.

216
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,100
Ok,so,this is where 
alex harrison's body was found.

217
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,260
Morgan,from this particular spot

218
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,750
There are areas of higher ground 
that look down to where the victim died.

219
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,570
Yeah,I got a perfect view of you 
through the trees right here.

220
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,800
Those are basic tactics that hunters use.

221
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,270
They use vantage points to watch their prey.

222
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,600
If these are tactics that hunters use...

223
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,740
They were precise enough to cover each other 
and take out their prey at the same time.

224
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,140
If both victims have 2 wounds,
could be one for each offender.

225
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,800
I think we know how alex harrison died.

226
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,140
You think this guy looks bad,
you should see the driver.

227
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,040
He needed 10 stitches.

228
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,620
You better hurry,all the groups are filling up.

229
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,830
You like the challenge of a bear,don't you?

230
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,640
Actually,I prefer picking up my meat
 at a grocery store.

231
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,700
Oh,you're one of those,huh?

232
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,380
Better be careful out there

233
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,170
Because in 3 days it's going to get busy 
as hell up on our mountain.

234
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,070
Hunting season?

235
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,580
Yeah,ever since somebody wrote about us 
in some fancy travel magazine

236
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,920
We've got loads of tourists migrating up here.

237
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,270
If I was going to take out an animal anywhere 
from 100 to 200 pounds

238
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,840
what type of weapon would I use?

239
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,350
A shotgun and compound bow are the tops

240
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,480
but buckshot can be a bit messy.

241
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,710
I love arrows.

242
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,470
It can completely penetrate the body 
of a small animal.

243
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,540
It's the most effective kill.

244
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,380
Arrows.

245
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,180
Hotchner.

246
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,090
Hold on a minute,I'll put you on speaker.

247
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,500
Hunting season officially opens in 3 days.

248
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,920
Does it look like the victim's wounds 
could be from an arrow?

249
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,110
Whatever punctured the organs had to be 
long enough to penetrate the chest 

250
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,590
and mimic a 22 caliber bullet,
so,yeah,it's possible.

251
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,840
I think these victims are being caught,
taken to the woods

252
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,240
and hunted like wild animals.

253
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,970
Oh,not again.
Come on,ruby.

254
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,760
Come on,baby,a few more miles.

255
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,580
Damn it.

256
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,790
Hi,hello?

257
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,090
Hi,I called before,my car's broken down for good.

258
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,960
Highway 2.

259
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,860
Can you hear me?
Never mind.

260
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,290
You need some help,miss?

261
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,980
So,I started pulling hunting licenses.

262
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,180
You should narrow down the suspect list 
before you dive in.

263
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,820
Well,what else are we looking for?

264
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,050
You're about to find out.

265
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,040
We're looking for at least 2 offenders 
in good physical condition.

266
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,400
You'd have to be fit to make it 
through this terrain.

267
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,930
And nobody would go that deep into
 the woods without backup.

268
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,090
Killing teams are like most partnerships,
one weak,the other strong.

269
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,390
These men haven't exhibited any sexual interest 
in their victims

270
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,970
So they're either developmentally prepubescent-
- Or they could be related.

271
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,940
Immediate relatives wouldn't
 discuss sexual encounters

272
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,190
Let alone perform them in front of each other.

273
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,930
If they are related,
they could have an us-versus-them mentality.

274
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,710
Their bond will be unbreakable 
because it's all they know.

275
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,050
Most hunters put animals out of their misery.

276
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,960
The men we're looking for,
they don't show any mercy.

277
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,820
These guys take pleasure in watching 
their casualties die a slow death.

278
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,550
Every spring for the past 5 years,
people have gone missing.

279
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,850
We think the killers wait for their prey 
to migrate through these woods.

280
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,740
Courtney jacobs,shane everett,
and alex harrison were all healthy

281
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,180
Smart adults who survived for days 
by following their instincts.

282
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,360
They found themselves in the middle of nowhere.

283
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,860
They were either approached in a way 
that wasn't threatening...

284
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,270
Or the offenders waited for a moment of weakness.

285
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,580
The perfect time to attack.

286
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,460
These particular hunters are very seasoned,
they're very efficient.

287
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,990
It's no surprise that they've chosen 
a weapon to be a compound bow.

288
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,850
It requires the utmost precision

289
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,290
And it provides them with a challenge every time.

290
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,450
Like the trophy hunter,these men,
they plan their killings with care.

291
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,370
They decide the type of victims they want,

292
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,800
How and where they want to kill them,
and with what weapon.

293
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,090
Hunting is their sport.

294
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,150
Humans are their targets.

295
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,600
Use every hunter's instinct in your bodies.

296
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,760
Good luck.

297
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,420
Yeah,garcia?

298
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,510
If they were buying their weapons close to home

299
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,110
We need a list of hunting stores 
in spokane county.

300
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,760
Let me call you back.

301
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,420
You should hear this.

302
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,440
The newspaper said the F.B.I.
was here investigating those homicides.

303
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,870
I didn't know where else to go.

304
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,850
When bobbi didn't show up or call

305
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,570
- When was the last time you talked to her?
- Yesterday.

306
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,560
She was going to stay with me before 
this big job interview in spokane.

307
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,880
She was really excited about it.

308
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,840
So,when she didn't show up,
I knew in my gut that something was wrong.

309
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,240
I was the one that convinced her 
to stay with me,and,now...

310
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,730
This isn't your fault.

311
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,880
Ok.

312
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,740
Should we get some fresh air?

313
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,170
She's only been missing since last night.

314
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,430
You sure it's related?

315
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,990
I'm not going to wait to find out,
I'm going to fax this to gideon.

316
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,430
It's been 3 days since they killed alex harrison.

317
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,140
Why'd they take another victim so soon?

318
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,930
This is their hunting season.

319
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,240
Then they can't waste any time.

320
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,100
Only 2 days before it gets crowded around here.

321
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,500
They won't have any more privacy.

322
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,230
If bobbi baird is their next victim,
she could be on her way.

323
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,690
This is evans,I need road blocks now.

324
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,370
* It's more than a feeling more than a feeling *

325
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,970
* When I hear that old song they used to... *

326
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,190
* More than a feeling *

327
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,310
You got that down good.
Man,it reminds me of uncle joe.

328
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,940
Whoa,we got a live one.

329
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,270
Get away from me!

330
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,070
Get it out!

331
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,560
- There you go.
- Are--are you done?

332
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,310
- What are you doing?
- Nobody can hear you.

333
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,500
Yeah,you gotta save your strength.

334
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,400
What the hell do you want from me?

335
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,240
You want to have some fun?

336
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,750
Go ahead,you-- you want to tell her?

337
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,980
Run.

338
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,990
Go!

339
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,860
Bobby baird's last 2 cell phone connections
 were both to 911.

340
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,680
Looks like each call only lasted 
a couple of seconds before they dropped out.

341
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,160
She was on highway 2.

342
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,210
It's a dead zone for cell phones.

343
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,710
Any idea what the trouble was?

344
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,780
None,cruiser was dispatched to check it out

345
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,050
But by the time he got there,
there was no sign of her or her car.

346
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,140
And speaking of vanishing vehicles,
I'm still looking for alex harrison'S.

347
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,680
We're standing in the middle of 3 million acres.

348
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,670
She could be anywhere.

349
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,550
We've only got 2 murder sites,miles apart.

350
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,340
There's no pattern yet.

351
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,240
Both sites are low lying,
they could be tracked from above.

352
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,290
Maybe there are blinds built into the trees,
or at least access to them.

353
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,100
With good vantage points
 they could see their prey for miles.

354
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,310
Why'd we have to bring all this stuff?
Anyone head of beenie weenie?

355
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,100
We're not 10 anymore.

356
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,300
Help!Help me!Help me!

357
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,550
Help,they're coming.

358
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,980
- Who?
- There--there's 2 guys.

359
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,050
They're trying to kill me.

360
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,670
Oh,my god

361
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,270
Joe

362
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,110
Run!

363
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,600
She's really a lot faster than we thought.

364
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,710
Yeah,now it's going to get fun.

365
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,800
Stop,I can't keep up.

366
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,410
You stay the hell away from her!

367
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,890
Hey,um,look...

368
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,290
I'm really sorry about 
what happened to your friends,ok?

369
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,650
Our friends are dead,
and those guys chasing you weren't after us.

370
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,970
Well,it doesn't look like it mattered 
much to them,did it?

371
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,970
Look,all I know is if 
she's around we could be next.

372
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,150
What are we supposed to do?
Leave her for those maniacs?

373
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,240
We don't know who she is!
What if she did something to them?

374
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,620
2 psychos abducted me.
All right?

375
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,780
The next thing I know,
I'm running for my life in the woods.

376
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,050
Yeah,that's your story.

377
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,490
All right,look,we're gonna lose daylight.

378
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,790
We got 2 choices,we can either stick together 
or,or we go our own way.

379
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,890
- We should stick together.
- What?

380
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,070
You just be sure to keep a good distance 
between us.

381
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,260
Instead of referring to me as she and you,
try using my first name.

382
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,510
Look,I don't want to know your name.

383
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,790
If anything else happens,
I don't want to feel like I ever knew you at all.

384
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,480
What have you got?

385
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:49,830
Uh,there are 3 stores outside spokane that sell 
the exact type of arrows you were looking for.

386
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,740
And before you ask,of course 
I've already sent the addresses to your handheld.

387
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,610
Garcia?You're the man.

388
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,670
Oh,no.You're the man.

389
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,570
Do you keep records to document 
who buys hunting arrows?

390
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,470
After a week we only keep receipts 
if they pay by credit card.

391
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,630
You get a lot of repeat business up here,
don't you?

392
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,950
Every year people get their ammo and supplies here

393
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,750
Before headin' up to the mountains.

394
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,500
Uh,groups of men?
Like,uh...

395
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,400
- Fathers and sons?
- Sure.

396
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,430
Can I ask you gentlemen,
why is this a police matter?

397
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,610
We're looking for 2 men,possibly related.

398
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,620
You might remember them 
because one always does all the talking,

399
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,260
And the other one would become very uncomfortable 
if you spoke to him.

400
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,240
It'd be even worse if that person were a female.

401
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:39,170
Well,there are these 2 brothers that
 have been coming here for years.

402
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,470
They got some supplies here a few days ago.

403
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,500
The younger one's so painfully shy,
it's almost sweet.

404
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,250
And after all these years,
he still hasn't warmed up to me.

405
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,460
Their uncle was a quiet man,
he passed away some time ago.

406
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,690
- You find a receipt?
- No,they paid in cash.

407
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,280
I'm pretty sure their name was mulford.

408
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,230
I think their uncle's name was joe.

409
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,480
- Thank you very much.
- I'll call garcia.

410
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,360
Garcia,I need everything you have on a man 
named joseph mulford.

411
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,840
Ok,it says here joseph mulford was 
convicted of multiple assault and batteries.

412
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,010
He owned a service station,
but it changed hands when he passed away.

413
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,260
He gave it to his nephews,paul and john mulford.

414
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,070
I don't have to ask where it's located,do I?

415
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,020
No,you don'T.

416
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,590
But since you did,gorgeous grey matter,
I'll have you know,I'm pulling it up right now.

417
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,710
And the computer says...

418
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,560
-What is it?
-That service station...

419
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,740
It's located on highway 2.

420
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,650
Let me guess,close to 
where our victims have gone missing?

421
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,110
Bulls-eye.

422
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,740
Still no sign of bobbi baird.

423
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,380
Search teams are in until morning.

424
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,900
We're running out of time.

425
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,700
It's getting dark,I don't know 
what else we can do.

426
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,430
Well,you never know how someone's going to react 

427
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,870
When they're forced into circumstances like these.

428
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,380
If bobbi's still alive,we just have to hope
 she's found a safe place for the night.

429
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,380
Just,uh,stay close.
It'll keep us warm.

430
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,100
Did you hear that?

431
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,570
Why don't you turn off the light,
so they can't see us?

432
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,580
It's probably just an animal or something.

433
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,680
Well,something's not good.

434
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,920
Whatever that noise is,it's right behind us.

435
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,130
Footsteps are too light to be them.

436
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,340
If they were that close,
they--they'd just shoot us.

437
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,980
Look at them,they look pretty scared.

438
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,140
We should take them now.

439
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,420
No,we wait till first light.

440
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,980
It's more fun when they're not expecting it.

441
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,530
All right.

442
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,820
We've got a missing person's report.

443
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,240
2 couples camping over the weekend didn't 
show up for work

444
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,240
and they didn't check out with the rangers.

445
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,500
I'll organize a search and rescue.

446
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,510
Where was their campsite?

447
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,980
Several miles from 
where alex harrison's body was found.

448
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,870
Do we think there's a connection?

449
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,860
Well,if these hunters are looking for
 more challenges,absolutely.

450
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,920
Let's go.

451
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,480
It's still not open,how convenient.

452
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,720
Let's take a look around.

453
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,860
It's clear

454
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,310
It's a mustang.

455
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,260
Same make and model as bobbi baird.

456
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,290
These are definitely our guys.

457
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:06,230
No animal did this.
That depends on your definition of animal.

458
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,930
Looks like somebody shredded it with a knife.

459
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,530
All the supplies have been dumped,not eaten.

460
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,780
They wanted to make sure 
if anyone found their way back here

461
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,250
everything would be worthless.

462
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,540
Blood on the ground,2 spots,here and there.

463
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,900
Hey,guys,we've got blood over here,too.

464
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,990
Ok,if I'm standing right up there,
this is wide open,

465
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,950
and I've got a clear shot at these victims.

466
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,530
It would explain all the blood on the ground.

467
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,090
- What about over here?
- That's another clear shot.

468
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,420
So,what do we think happened?

469
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,830
2 pools of blood,I say 2 victims.

470
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,600
Could be the campers.

471
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,950
Uh,question is,where are they now?

472
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,000
What is that?

473
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,090
They've already got one victim in these woods,
why'd they attack this couple?

474
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,180
Well,maybe they had to.

475
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,600
Bobbi baird's their target

476
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,910
if she ran towards voices,well,
she had to come right through this camp.

477
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,540
These people were in the wrong place
 at the wrong time.

478
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,310
They weren't supposed to die.

479
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,180
No,just got in the way.

480
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,760
Hotch found bobbi baird's car at 
mulford's service station.

481
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,530
Hiding them in plain sight.

482
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,040
- It's run by 2 brothers
- You heard of the mulfords?

483
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,760
We go by first name basis around here.

484
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,530
But you tell me what they're driving,
my people will find it.

485
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,190
Oh,my god.

486
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,510
- Oh,did you see that?
- Oh,ho ho ho!

487
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,200
Luke,look at me!Come on!
Don't do this!

488
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,100
Help me stop it!

489
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,400
There you go!
Told you you'd get your first buck.

490
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,380
- We gotta go!
- I cannot leave him out here alone!

491
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,530
Come on,heather.Come on.

492
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,590
I can't just leave him.

493
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,370
- Go!
- Come on!

494
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,020
- Go.Go.
- We gotta go.

495
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,080
Come on!

496
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,840
Come on,it's too easy.

497
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,180
Oh,my god.

498
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,990
Come on!Come on!

499
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,350
All right,let's go.

500
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,430
So,what'd they do?

501
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,190
Just patrol the highway,
looking for broken down cars?

502
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,830
We've got a 210 in progress.

503
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,820
- Picked up dispatches.
- Hey,hotch!

504
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,280
You should see this.

505
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,660
- Hey,what color was alex harrison's car?
- It's blue,why?

506
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,550
I think we found it,along with some others.

507
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,260
If all these have cars...

508
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,110
We're looking at a lot more victims.

509
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,060
I got at least 3 sets of footprints here.

510
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,890
I lose them in the pine needles.

511
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,780
They pick back up over here.

512
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,580
Ok,evans,can we get your team to help us out?

513
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,210
Yeah,bunting!
Help these agents follow the tracks.

514
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:29,050
Everybody in before sundown!

515
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,150
Guys,look at this.

516
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,290
- First one expired in 1980.
- Boys weren't even born yet.

517
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,030
The uncle must have started the killing,
the boys have continued the tradition.

518
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,810
What are you doing?

519
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,430
- I don't know where we're going.
- We can't just stop.

520
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,760
It's part of their game.
They love the chase.

521
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,960
As long as we're running,
we're just giving them what they want.

522
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:31,240
We don't get the hell out of here right now,
we're both going to die.

523
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,290
Not necessarily.

524
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,360
Paul and john mulford,26 and 22,
were orphaned as toddlers.

525
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,790
Abandonment issues.

526
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,880
State kept them together by
 finding their only living relative,their uncle.

527
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,320
He raised his nephews completely off the grid.
They never went to school

528
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,770
No socialization other 
than the patrons of the station.

529
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,200
He was drafted in 1968.

530
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,670
He was only 18 years old.

531
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,290
He was relieved from duty 2 years later,
reports of hallucinations and delusions.

532
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,930
The boys were raised with no social compass
 by the only relative they ever knew.

533
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,080
Psychotic possessed with bizarre beliefs,
who taught them how to hunt and who to kill.

534
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,500
Look at this.

535
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,670
They've been hunting in those woods 
their whole lives.

536
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,900
It's from her sweater.

537
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,560
******

538
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,990
No!Don't!

539
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,060
I'm sorry.

540
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,480
Whoa,ok,ok.
It's ok.It's ok.

541
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,920
You're ok.You're ok.

542
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,580
Johnny,johnny!
Look at me!Look at me!

543
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,110
It's oK.It's ok.

544
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,600
I found the I.D.s of joel and taylor brause

545
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,370
2 of the missing campers.

546
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,950
- Married?
- Yeah.

547
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,810
This is agent morgan,go for gideon.

548
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,670
Gideon here,where are you?

549
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,820
We followed the tracks for several miles,
and now we can see something in the distance.

550
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,950
Can you get to higher ground?

551
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,480
- You see it?
- Smoke.

552
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,040
You're all right.
It's gonna be all right.

553
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,020
- I don't think so!
- I know--I know so.

554
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,680
But you gotta be strong.

555
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,780
It's a lot of blood.
It's just a lot of blood,it's all right.

556
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,200
Oh,god,please,no...

557
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:07,310
I'm gonna go take care of that friend of ours

558
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,910
then I'm gonna come back,come back and 
we're gonna get you fixed up as good as new.

559
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,170
- I promise,I promise.
- Ok.

560
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,220
Where are you,you son of a bitch?

561
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,930
I'm tired of running!

562
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,400
You're a coward,just like your brother.

563
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,240
I see the fire.
It's right through those trees.

564
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,880
There's a man lying next to it.

565
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,190
Could just be a couple campers.

566
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,260
Let's be prepared if it isn'T.

567
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,690
F.B.I.

568
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,420
He's covered in blood.

569
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,190
- We gotta get him out of here.
- I'll call for an evac.

570
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,800
Son,can you hear me?

571
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,170
My name's jason gideon,we're with the F.B.I.

572
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,890
We're gonna get you out of here.Ok?

573
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,420
Can you hear me?
Are you here alone?

574
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,700
Over there.

575
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,580
She's gone.

576
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,050
- It's a woman.
- She was shot with an arrow.

577
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,160
There's a compound bow about 25 feet away 
from the body.

578
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,360
What?The other victims were shot 
in the chest area.

579
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,510
This boy has wounds in his lower abdomen.

580
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,120
You don't think he was shot with an arrow?

581
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,220
It looks like he was stabbed.

582
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,830
Son...

583
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,100
Are the men who did this to you 
still in the woods?

584
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,640
We have a team of F.B.I.Agents looking for them.

585
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,660
It's all right.

586
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,200
They've got an order to shoot if necessary.

587
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,650
- No!No,no,no.
- It's ok,it's ok!

588
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,000
You are safe-- you are safe here.

589
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,210
Don't shoot him!

590
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,560
He's all I have.

591
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,670
Is your brother out there?

592
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,900
- What's your name?
- Johnny.

593
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,840
Johnny,you need to tell us where paul is.

594
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,950
Before it's too late.
Just tell me where he is.

595
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,960
Tell me where he is.

596
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,170
- He said about half a mile due east.
- Let's go.

597
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,340
Paul mulford!F.B.I.

598
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,130
Put down your weapon!

599
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,770
No!

600
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,290
It's ok,it's ok.
It's ok,it's ok.

601
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,690
He's clean.

602
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,790
Johnny...

603
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
it's ok,it's ok.

604
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,620
- You got him?
- Yeah.

605
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,420
I'm going to call gideon.

606
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,970
- Is he dead?
- Soon.

607
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,130
How can these guys do something like this?

608
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:12,450
Because they don't think like you and me.

609
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,070
How does it feel,you son of a bitch?

610
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,770
Looks like I had all the fun.

611
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:35,560
* Awful people they surround you *

612
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,110
* ain't they just like monsters *

613
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,920
* they come to feed on us *

614
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,040
* giant little animals for us *

615
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,600
The british historian james anthony froud 
once said

616
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,940
wild animals never kill for sport.

617
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,660
Man is the only one to whom the torture and 

618
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,660
death of his fellow creatures
 is amusing in itself.

619
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,980
You ok?

620
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,770
- I've never seen you look so,um--
- Quiet.

621
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,820
What's up?

622
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:41,070
Bobbi baird asked me a question
 that's sticking with me.

623
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,050
What was it?

624
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,980
She asked me how they could do it.

625
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,640
How those men could...

626
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,190
hunt and kill people in the woods.

627
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,100
What did you tell her?

628
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,140
That they don't think like we do.

629
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,630
But...the truth is...

630
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,650
that we do think like them.

631
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,350
Yeah,we do.

632
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,400
Because it's our job.

633
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,400
We need to know how it feels.

634
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,720
We hunt these people every day.

635
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,570
The question is,how different are we?

636
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,570
Us and them?

637
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:35,050
