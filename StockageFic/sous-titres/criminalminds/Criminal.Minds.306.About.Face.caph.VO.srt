LITTLE CREEK RESERVIOR, VA

2
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,560
Go on, mudgie! Go on, boy.

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,880
Attaboy!

4
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,010
Go on, boy.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,990
Come! Come!

6
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,400
Strauss, I'm coming in to
see you this afternoon.

7
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,350
Well, then cancel it.
I'll be there at 2:30.

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,590
That's it. Come on, boy!

9
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,910
Come on! Yeah.

10
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,740
I really don't understand this, david.

11
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,010
What's to understand, erin?

12
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,420
You've been retired for nearly 10 years.

13
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,700
B.A.U. Is a man down.

14
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,700
I'm offering to help.

15
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,080
You've written... how many books?

16
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,320
World tours.

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,520
Speaking engagements.

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,330
Big payday private consultations.

19
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,170
You've made quite a name for yourself.

20
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,870
Well, this is getting boring.

21
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,540
You know, you won't be in charge.

22
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,440
Agent hotchner's the S.A.C. And
I'll be seeking his endorsement.

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,390
I'm not looking for
anyone's permission here.

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,040
So you're coming in in
a subordinate position.

25
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,830
- Is that a question?
- The question is, why?

26
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,150
To help.

27
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,720
A completely selfless act.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,030
Is that so hard to believe?

29
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,790
Yes.

30
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,240
I missed you too, erin.

31
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,560
You'll meet the team tomorrow.

00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,420
CARROLLTON, TEXAS

33
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,920
HAVE YOU SEEN ME?

34
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,290
It was next to my front
door when I got home, frank.

35
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,920
God, I hate halloween.

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,530
- Here you go, sir.
- Halloween?

37
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,720
Less than a week away.

38
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,190
{\a6}Police Department,
CARROLLTON, TEXAS

39
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,950
It's a prime time for stupid pranks.

40
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,540
So you think it's just a prank?

41
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,790
Well, you're obviously
not missing, michelle.

42
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,690
Where'd they get a picture of me?

43
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,420
It's probably one of your friends.

44
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,270
I don't know anybody
that'd think this is funny.

45
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,510
Molly didn't think it was funny.

46
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,270
She's the one who told me
to come right down here.

47
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,120
If my wife had just called, I
probably could have saved you the trip.

48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,150
I'm sure it's nothing, really.

49
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,000
You sure?

50
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,810
Look...

51
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,770
I'll come by and check on you after
work and make sure you're safe.

52
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,930
I appreciate that, frank.

53
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,890
Hey. Serving and
protecting is what I do.

54
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,690
No, no, I didn't say it was funny, molly.

55
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,400
I said
someone might--

56
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,720
I--I know she's your best
friend. That's why I'm here.

57
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,770
No. No, I don't think it's
weird she didn't call--

58
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,890
look, I'm here already.

59
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,870
All the lights are out.

60
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,280
She--she probably
went to bed early.

61
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,630
I'll have her call you.

62
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,510
Yeah,20 minutes. I love you, too.

63
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,970
This wasn't funny the first time.

64
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,740
Michelle?

65
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,930
Michelle?

66
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,860
Michelle, it's frank!

67
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,720
Michelle?

68
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,010
Oh, my god.

Erasmus wrote, what else is the whole
life of mortals but a sort of comedy,

72
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,640
in which the various actors, disguised
by various costumes and masks,

73
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,250
walk on and play each one his part,

74
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,710
until the manager waves
them off the stage?

75
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,880
I'm waiting for you!

76
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,260
Reid...

77
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,110
happy all hallows eve, folks.

78
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,200
To paraphrase from celtic mythology,

79
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
tomorrow night all order is suspended,

80
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,370
and the barriers between the natural and
the supernatural are temporarily remooooved!

81
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,590
See, that right there is
why halloween creeps me out.

82
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,730
You're scared of halloween?

83
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,150
I didn't say I was scared, I
said I was creeped out.

84
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,080
There's a difference there, youngster.
You should look it up.

85
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,170
What creeps you out about it?

86
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,870
I don't know. People wearing masks.

87
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,540
I don't like folks in disguises.

88
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,890
That's the best thing about halloween.
You can be anyone you want to be.

89
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,940
Nah, I'm pretty good just being me.

90
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,370
Yeah, why is it that neither of
those points of view surprise me?

91
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,160
You know what, though? On the flip side,

92
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,180
it does provide a pretty good
reason to cozy up with a scary flick

93
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,300
and a little halloween honey.

94
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,970
Halloween honey. Now I'm creeped out.

95
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,980
Guys, he's here.

96
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,240
Agent hotchner.

97
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,610
- I'm sure you
remember-- - Dave.

98
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,650
how are you, aaron?

99
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,880
- I'm good. I'm great.
- I would say so.

100
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,270
Saw you on tv last week.

101
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,410
Can't believe you
want to come back here.

102
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,610
Well, I'll let the two of you catch up.

103
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,190
- If you need anything, I'm in my office.
- Thanks.

104
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,140
So how long's it been?

105
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,710
Dinner, almost 3 years ago.

106
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,260
But the last time I was in the B.A.U.

107
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,830
You were sharing a desk with 2 other
agents in that god-awful bunker we were in.

108
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,720
I remember.

109
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,120
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

110
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,360
Well, there's one just like this
next door if you're interested.

111
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,280
I'm ready to give the briefing.

112
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,280
Agent jareau, this is ssa david rossi.

113
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,960
Hi. Everyone calls me J.J.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,040
It is such an honor to meet you, sir.

115
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,310
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Thank you.

116
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,620
And what's your function here?

117
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,170
I'm the communications
coordinator and liaison.

118
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,220
Pretty much the go-between for
the team and the rest of the world.

119
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,540
So I'll gather everyone.

120
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,870
We'll be right there.

121
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,750
- It is so nice to have you here, sir.
- Great.

122
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,400
We didn't have that 10 years ago.

123
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,110
What do you mean?

124
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,790
- Communications coordinator.
- Right.

125
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,390
Oh, lots has changed. Come meet the team.

126
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,680
Ssa david rossi, this
is ssa emily prentiss.

127
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,200
Sir.

128
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,810
Ssa derek morgan.

129
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,010
It's an honor, agent rossi.

130
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,080
Please, just dave.

131
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,390
And dr. Spencer reid.

132
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,680
Sir, if I could talk to you later about
your work with the scarsdale skinner.

133
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,880
Psycho-linguistics is an
incredibly dynamic field,

134
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,560
and the fact that your profile of his
reading habits ultimately led to his capture

135
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,060
- is something I find so incredibly
intrig-- - reid, slow down.

136
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,350
He'll be here for a while. You
can catch up with him later.

137
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,380
- Sorry.
- No problem, doctor.

138
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,770
Maybe you guys can talk on the jet.

139
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,150
- Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
- The jet?

140
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,980
We have a jet now.

141
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,160
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. It comes in pretty handy.

142
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,910
Come on. J.J.'S waiting.

143
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,770
Carrollton, texas, is a suburb
just outside of dallas.

144
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,180
4 days ago, michelle colucci found
this flier on her front door.

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,820
She found it?

146
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,350
Meaning she wasn't actually missing?

147
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,850
Yet. She took the flier
to a friend's husband,

148
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,580
detective yarbrough,at
the carrollton P.D.

149
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,350
Who told her it was probably just a
halloween prank, and he sent her home.

150
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,560
Well, I don't blame him.

151
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,150
Halloween brings out
the fool in everyone.

152
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,890
Still, he stopped by michelle's
house later to check on her.

153
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,140
The door was open, and when
he went inside, he found this.

154
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,420
He still thought maybe it could be
some kind of a prank, until yesterday.

155
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,490
Michelle was found floating in a
small creek just outside of carrollton.

156
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,410
She had been sexually assaulted...

157
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,390
and her face had been removed.

158
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,930
Removed? It wasn't animals or fish?

159
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,540
The dallas county M.E. Say that the
edges of the wounds were smooth,not torn.

160
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,590
A very sharp instrument had been used.

161
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,470
He also found water in her lungs.

162
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,380
Oh, my god!

163
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,930
What is that?

164
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,100
Technical analyst penelope
garcia, this is ssa david rossi.

165
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,650
Is it gone,J.J.?

166
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're safe.

167
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,090
OK. Just to, um...

168
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,790
carrollton,texas,has
nearly 117,000 residents,

169
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,290
a diverse population with
A... it's all in there.

170
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,580
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,910
Very happy to meet you, sir.

172
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,900
I'll be in my office.

173
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,280
Sorry.

174
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,420
She's different.

175
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,300
You have no idea.

176
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,410
Uh, so, the unsub tells her she's going to
go missing to psychologically torture her,

177
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,560
then tortures her physically.

178
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,780
Textbook sadist.

179
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,320
A sophisticated one.

180
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,470
That's elaborate.

181
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,500
Number one.

182
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,540
That particular mask is
known as a false face.

183
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,330
It's most commonly worn during
halloween and mardi gras.

184
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,000
Creepy. I rest my case.

185
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,870
False face.

186
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,150
Her face-- he mocks
it, then destroys it.

187
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,250
Oh, and, hotch-- local media
has the story. It broke big.

188
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,490
Tell carrollton we'll be there
first thing in the morning.

189
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,090
- Let's stop this one at one.
- Yes, sir.

190
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,150
If you want to take some time to get
situated, maybe start on the next case?

191
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,900
I'm not back to get
situated, hotch, I'm here to work.

192
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,660
Everybody get your things
together. We're going to texas.

193
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,460
Abbey, what's the latest?

194
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,130
Police sources tell me they
have no leads in the case

195
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,700
they are calling the
"have you seen me"Murders.

196
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,950
Where the hell do you get this stuff?

197
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,640
No, not you, agent jareau. The television.

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,110
The press is saying we gave
this thing a stupid name,

199
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,040
like it's some kind of
damn game or something.

200
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,630
Just...

201
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,520
call me when you all get in tomorrow.
I'll take you wherever you need to go.

202
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,910
All right. Good night.

203
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,550
Abbey, do we know when
this flyer first surfaced?

204
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,810
We have heard reports that ms. Colucci
received this flier late tuesday afternoon

205
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,590
when she returned home from work.

206
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,620
*****

207
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,400
Never saw the point at
throwing an egg at anything.

208
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,450
{\a6}DALLAS, TEXAS

209
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,520
Or even the connection to
halloween, for that matter.

210
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,730
What the hell...

211
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,030
oh, my god. That's me.

212
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,230
Oh, my god!

213
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,420
Let's go over victimology.

214
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,560
Would you like to join us, dave?

215
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,460
Reid, what have you got?

216
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,920
Uh, michelle colucci was single,

217
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,710
lived alone, no boyfriend
and no ex-husband.

218
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,510
Dating?

219
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,860
There's nothing in the reports.

220
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,730
She was an architect.

221
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,150
Friends and co-workers say
she's a class workaholic.

222
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,390
Basically a loner who
rarely went out of the house.

223
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,210
So she's extremely low risk.

224
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,920
If it wasn't someone she knew personally,
it's possible she was being stalked.

225
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,500
- Interesting.
- What's that?

226
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,730
Oh, I'm just thinking out loud.

227
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,120
- Something to add?
- No.

228
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,430
Sorry to interrupt.

229
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,100
Well, she's pretty.

230
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,760
It could be that the unsub
met her casually and...

231
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,420
made her part of some kind of fantasy.

232
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,500
And he tries to act on
it and she rejects him?

233
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,870
So he tortures her, out of anger?

234
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,680
Masks often represent a state of mind.

235
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,240
This one's blank, expressionless.
Doesn't really coincide with anger.

236
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,300
Reid, it's hard to imagine he did
this out of anything less than rage.

237
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,960
Hey, guys.

238
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,450
What's up? You got something for us?

239
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,250
A list of michelle colucci's clients.

240
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,310
She designed office space. Mostly
big corporate remodeling plans.

241
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,270
No private
clients, one-on-one contact?

242
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,060
Doesn't look like it, no.

243
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,360
- Thanks, baby girl.
- Yeah.

244
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,950
It's right this way, ma'am.

245
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,270
Police Department CARROLLTON. TEXAS

246
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,980
- Detective yarbrough?
- Fbi?

247
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,970
We got another flier--
this time metro dallas.

248
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,930
Enid white.

249
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,360
Her roommate called
dallas P. D. This morning.

250
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,210
Enid never game home after
walking her dog last night.

251
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,300
So she is missing.

252
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,790
Well, he wallpapered the neighborhood with
fliers for 2 blocks around their apartment.

253
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,200
Outside. That's different.

254
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,880
No one saw him putting them up?

255
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,500
Dallas P. D. Is still
canvassing, but nothing so far.

256
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,020
They're waiting for
you on the new scene.

257
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,790
- Mind if I keep this?
- Not at all.

258
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,990
Morgan, you and prentiss go
to michelle colucci's house.

259
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,130
J. J. And I will talk to enid's roommate.

260
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,700
Dave, do you mind walking the disposal
site with the detective and reid?

261
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,540
Whatever you need.

262
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,660
We'll regroup in an hour.

263
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,820
These houses sure are close together.

264
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,540
Yeah.

265
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,460
So how do I get a woman out of
her house without anyone seeing me?

266
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,350
Well, he must have been watching her for
a long time and knew that it was safe.

267
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,300
There isn't a lot of
cover on this street.

268
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,300
I have a vehicle.

269
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,670
Big enough so I can
watch without being seen.

270
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,670
But not so big as to
draw attention to itself.

271
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,760
No.

272
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,360
Neighbors will notice a strange vehicle parked in
front of their house day after day, night after night.

273
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,250
It's human nature.

274
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,530
You would notice something out
of place in your own neighborhood.

275
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,360
And you would definitely notice a man
repeatedly standing on your street.

276
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,570
Yeah. It just doesn't make any sense.

277
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,740
He didn't watch from here.

278
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,040
As we reported earlier, enid white
is still considered missing...

279
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,380
big story.

280
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,570
Leeches.

281
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,170
Haven't had something this
big to play in a long time.

282
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,910
Did the press run with
the story about the mask?

283
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,270
Mask?

284
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,290
A mask was left at michelle
colucci's apartment.

285
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,920
First time I'm hearing about it.

286
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,730
Good.

287
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,290
- Let's make sure that stays ours.
- Yeah.

288
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,640
Miss white's roommate says that enid walks
her dog every night at the same time,

289
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,110
takes the same route, right
down this street.

290
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,360
Nothing a stalker likes
better than routine.

291
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,960
Well, she definitely would have seen this

292
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,230
if this was here
before she went missing.

293
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,460
A couple of neighbors say they may have
seen a guy putting up a flier during the day,

294
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,070
bueaey rt thlly couldn't
remember anything about him.

295
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,540
All right, well, we're gonna have to
know everything we can about the victim.

296
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,920
I know you sent some
stuff over to quantico,

297
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,410
but it would help us if we could
interview the roommate ourselves.

298
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,040
We have her downtown now.

299
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,420
- Where's her dog?
- Excuse me?

300
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,350
If she was abducted while she was
walking her dog. Where's her dog?

301
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,430
We went over this
area pretty thoroughly.

302
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,530
There's no evidence left.

303
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,650
I just want to stand where she was.

304
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,600
Dr. Reid, do we still keep all the old
files in the fourth floor storeroom?

305
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,570
I think some are up there. You know, most
of our information's on computer now.

306
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,210
Right.

307
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,110
Have you had a chance to go through
our data since you've been back?

308
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:11,940
Not yet.

309
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,900
You'll be amazed.

310
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,140
The original
team--

311
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,730
I mean, you interviewed something like,

312
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,020
- uh,45 serial killers, right?
- Something like.

313
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,880
Today we have interviews
with over 1,000 offenders.

314
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,160
Serial killers, child
abductors, sex offenders--

315
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
I'll go through it with you sometime
if you like, answer any questions--

316
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,000
sounds good.

317
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,160
Michelle's body was found right here.

318
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,800
I really thought it was a prank.

319
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,530
You can't really blame
yourself for that.

320
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,090
She made herself dinner.

321
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,590
Excuse me?

322
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,380
She had time to make herself dinner.

323
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,640
I mean she was home
for a while before he...

324
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,680
there was time to help her.

325
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,680
Water.

326
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,650
Obliterates a body...

327
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,500
destroys evidence.

328
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,090
But you weren't in the water
that long, were you, michelle?

329
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,740
She had rocks tied to
her to weigh her down.

330
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,250
She floated to the surface
before there was any other damage.

331
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,940
Just what was done to her already.

332
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,300
The salient point is that it was the
first thing the unsub wasn't good at.

333
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,700
Green river dumped most
of the bodies in the water.

334
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,500
- But they weren't weighed down.
- Yeah.

335
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,560
We know now it's'ause he
didn't care if they were found.

336
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,860
He had no connection to them.

337
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,310
This is where I'd wait.

338
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,720
Yeah.

339
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,750
I'd never be able to
see you from the house.

340
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,350
Prentiss.

341
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,980
He was here a lot.

342
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,180
Watching everything she did.

343
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,150
we got anything?

344
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,520
Agent rossi pointed out that since
the victims were weighted down,

345
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,430
it suggests the unsub
didn't want them found.

346
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,450
It suggests some sort of
connection between them.

347
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,300
Detective, how long was michelle missing?

348
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,980
She was found on the fourth day.

349
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,130
So if she wasn't in the water
long, then he held her for 3.

350
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,440
Garcia?

351
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,910
I've been running all of
enid white's credit cards.

352
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,660
And?

353
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:04,360
She made a purchase at 9 A. M. This morning
at a sporting goods store in dallas.

354
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
This morning?

355
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,490
What did she buy?

356
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,570
A shotgun.

357
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,550
Thanks.

358
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:21,280
The man was seen posting fliers around the
neighborhood where enid white was known to walk her dog.

359
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,860
The police are still unable to give
us any information at this time,

360
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,840
and they are saying they
still have no possible leads.

361
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,630
We will continue to keep you posted

362
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,960
as we receive more details
about the hunt for enid white...

363
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,590
she can buy a gun that easily?

364
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,830
This is texas.

365
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,000
There's no license or waiting
period for most rifles or shotguns.

366
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,520
Is there video surveillance of
guns sales in sporting goods stores?

367
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,680
There's supposed to be.

368
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,640
J.J.,Call the store.

369
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,200
Find out if it was enid or the
unsub using her credit card.

370
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,690
Right away.

371
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,640
Detective yarbrough.

372
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,900
There's an urgent call
from a woman on one.

373
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,620
Detective yarbrough.

374
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,420
My name is enid white.

375
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,370
Where are you, enid

376
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:04,260
The news reports said that the police didn't believe
that other woman when she saw the missing fliers.

377
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,290
That was a mistake, enid.

378
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,220
I have a gun.

379
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,170
I don't think I can stay
awake very much longer.

380
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,460
Enid, this is agent hotchner of the fbi.

381
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,890
We believe you, and we want to help you.

382
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,380
Can you tell us where you are?

383
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,540
El royale motel in dallas.

384
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,060
It's room 6.

385
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,510
I saw the fliers.

386
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,860
Hurry, please.

387
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,100
He's gonna kill me.

388
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,760
Don't move, enid. We're on our way.

389
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,380
Fbi!

390
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,520
Clear.

391
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,560
She's gone.

392
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,800
20 minutes.

393
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,030
We were here in 20 minutes.

394
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,210
I can't believe we lost her.

395
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,450
We may not have lost her.
He kept michelle for 4 days.

396
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,520
But we got nothing.

397
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,530
That's not true. Look at
the difference in the scenes.

398
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,250
What do you mean? There's
the masks, the fliers.

399
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,980
Yeah, but these fliers weren't tacked up,

400
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,200
they were just thrown around the room.

401
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,990
So?

402
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,540
He left in a hurry like
he knew we were coming.

403
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,760
OK, this was under the bed.

404
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,090
972 area code.

405
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,480
That's carrollton.

406
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,740
The hotline number.

407
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,650
She used a cell phone.

408
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,020
You can get a cell interceptor
at any electronics store.

409
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,830
You can?

410
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,370
Yeah. They don't cost that much.

411
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,020
He probably sat right out here
and heard everything she said.

412
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,490
But if he followed her here from dallas,

413
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,500
why wait till she
calls us to move on her?

414
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,600
To make sure it was the
police who found the mask.

415
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,390
We need to gather your
men and give a profile.

416
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,160
He's a white male.

417
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,680
His shoe prints have been examined
and put him at about 5'11,165.

418
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,120
So we've narrowed it down to
anyone of average weight and height.

419
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,750
Exactly.

420
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,880
Speak and be recognized
by your empress, mortal.

421
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,070
Is this the technical analyst girl?

422
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,800
Who's this?

423
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,750
Dr. Reid said this was your
direct line from the team.

424
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,330
It is.

425
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,940
This is agent dave
rossi. We met yesterday.

426
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,780
Of course, of course.
I'm sorry--sir.

427
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:35,130
Uh, yeah, I already started processing the
footprint information on michelle colucci--

428
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,160
no, no, no. This is about something else.

429
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,070
All the past open cases the
B. A. U. Worked on are on computer now?

430
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,880
Most of them.

431
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,770
There may be a few left to catalog.

432
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,120
If I give you a victim's
name, could you find the old records?

433
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,100
Oh, records are my specialty, sir.

434
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,640
The original case--
I'm going back 20 years.

435
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,190
Won't be a problem.

436
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,810
The name is galen.

437
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,560
Diana and richard galen.

438
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,450
They had 3 children.

439
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,680
OK. I will get back to you
super fast. Scout's honor.

440
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,080
No, no, um, just put a file together.

441
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,860
I'll get it when I get back.

442
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,190
It's really no problem, sir. I
could just send it--

443
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,980
not necessary. I'll look
at it when I get back.

444
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:21,250
And let's keep this between
us, if you don't mind. For now.

445
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,500
OK.

446
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,070
Thank you.

447
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,880
My pleasure entirely, sir.

448
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:40,510
There's a sophistication and patience in what
this unsub does that suggests a level of maturity.

449
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,100
We believe this puts his age
in the mid-30s to 40s range.

450
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,480
Michelle colucci was taken
from the primary crime scene

451
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,500
and disposed of at the tertiary
crime scene 4 days later.

452
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,140
That means she was held
somewhere for at least 3 days.

453
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,410
You can't really just hold a
victim anywhere for days on end,

454
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,240
so he most likely has access
to a house of some kind.

455
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,220
And he's also fairly tech savvy.

456
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,950
The fliers were made on a computer.

457
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,020
And it's probable that he used a device
to intercept enid white's phone call.

458
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,620
Witnesses in enid
white's neighborhood say

459
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,770
they may have seen a white
man putting up fliers,

460
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:12,490
but none of them could describe him, even with
all the media attention this case has received.

461
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,320
Great.

462
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,190
Actually, what that tells us is that there is
absolutely nothing remarkable about this man.

463
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,390
He is exceedingly average.

464
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,670
As you said, detective
yarbrough, average height, average build.

465
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,610
It extends to his
professional life as well.

466
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:30,040
He most likely works in a field where he
doesn't stand out, doesn't really make a mark.

467
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,680
His lack of distinction
is part of his psychopathy.

468
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,690
We have hundreds of interactions
with people every day.

469
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,960
Most of those involve someone
overlooking someone else.

470
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,520
Most of us don't pay any attention to
being ignored, but to this kind of unsub,

471
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,650
each oversight is intentional.

472
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,920
Especially when it comes from
his object of sexual desire.

473
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,480
He begins to obsess over her
until she's all he can think about.

474
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,780
And the rage builds until
he has to attack that person.

475
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,410
So he's pissed off
that nobody notices him?

476
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,690
Have you seen me?

477
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,660
Wait. That's not about the women.

478
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,960
No. The masks are
about the women--

479
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,590
number one, number 2.

480
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,730
The fliers probably refer to him.

481
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:13,930
Removing his victims'faces transfers his
feelings of being ignored into a mission

482
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,100
and it gives him a sense of power.

483
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,070
And the power can make him arrogant, but
it doesn't make him notable.

484
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,210
So how the hell do we
catch an invisible man?

485
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,420
I'm pretty sure we can
get him to contact you.

486
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:24,990
What?

487
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,470
Well, the crime scenes show he wants
to deliver his message to the police.

488
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,660
He isn't going public.

489
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,650
Hopefully, by playing on his anger...

490
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,800
J.J.,How'd they get that?

491
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,670
Not from
me. I--

492
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,730
hotch, I called all the local police
departments and I stressed withholding the mask.

493
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,190
I called them.

494
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,050
What?

495
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:50,140
I said the fbi thinks the
masks mean he's impotent.

496
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,410
Can I speak to you for a second?

497
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,950
Why would you do that?

498
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,600
It'll make him contact us.

499
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,690
He's screaming for it.

500
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,020
We aren't prepared.

501
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,680
Prepared?

502
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,130
We need to set up a trap and trace.

503
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,180
Trap and trace?

504
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,820
They never stay on the
phone long enough for that.

505
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,630
Dave, they're a lot faster
than they used to be.

506
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,070
We also need to prep the
detective on what to say to him.

507
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,950
He's not gonna want to
talk to the detective.

508
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,640
He's gonna want to talk to the fbi.

509
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,830
We don't step over the
local police like that.

510
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,830
They called us in.

511
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,340
Yes, but if the perception is that

512
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,690
we're to embarrass the locals by telling
the media that we're gonna fix things,

513
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,360
then they'll stop calling us.

514
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,240
Relax, hotch. I've got this.

515
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,670
You see, that's the problem, dave.

516
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,460
There is no I.

517
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,960
We function as a team.

518
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,520
I've been doing this before
you were out of high school,

519
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,250
probably before the rest of
your team was in school at all.

520
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,470
I know that.

521
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,140
Things have changed.

522
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,730
The bells and whistles changed.

523
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,900
An unsub is still an unsub, and
I know how to deal with an unsub.

524
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,140
- No, dave, it's not just that.
- Hotch.

525
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,250
What?

526
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,210
Garcia found something.

527
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,410
Garcia, talk to us.

528
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,420
So, michelle colucci
recently drew up the plans

529
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,720
for a remodel of 3 floors of a
company called techco communications.

530
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,660
It's a high-tech communications
company in downtown dallas.

531
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,460
And enid white?

532
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,290
Worked there until 2 months ago.

533
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,430
He's on 2.

534
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,440
The unsub?

535
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,840
Demanded to speak to the fbi.

536
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,810
This is fbi supervisory
special agent david rossi.

537
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,870
You called me impotent.

538
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,720
Did I?

539
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,990
I'm not impotent.

540
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,810
Why are you whispering?

541
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,500
You lied.

542
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,430
You lied.

543
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,540
Is someone around you?

544
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,160
Are you at work?

545
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,700
You have to tell the news the truth.

546
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,330
I'll get you on the news, then
you can correct me yourself.

547
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:10,290
No, you, you, you correct it.

548
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,840
By the way, I was, um, looking
at the police security tapes

549
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,190
for the day michelle
colucci went missing.

550
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,490
What?

551
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,950
You watched her long enough to
know she didn't have visitors.

552
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,450
She was a loner.

553
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,580
Yet you knew that detective
yarbrough was coming over.

554
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:34,070
You must have been right here
in this station when he told her.

555
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,760
Now, your face is gonna be on one
of those tapes, and when I find it,

556
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,100
I'm gonna paper this city with
it, just like you did with those women.

557
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,110
Everyone will see it.

558
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,790
They won't be able to ignore you now.

559
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:54,390
But you won't inspire fear, you'll
inspire hatred and ridicule,

560
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,350
because the only power
someone like you has is a mask,

561
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,970
and once that mask is removed,

562
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,340
you'll be as insignificant
as you've always been--

563
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,630
a loser!

564
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:21,050
You just signed enid
white's death warrant.

565
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,440
Lieutenant, I need you to lock
the techco building down tight.

566
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,840
Nobody in, nobody out. It's vital.

567
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,120
Rossi, you really think the unsub's
still gonna be there after that call?

568
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,240
Of course. He thinks he has
all the time in the world.

569
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,760
You think they got an image off
the police security camera yet?

570
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,450
The security camera doesn't
work. I lied about that.

571
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,080
You lied about that?

572
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,810
He doesn't know.

573
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,180
Dave, that was incredibly reckless.

574
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,190
Hotch, he didn't weigh
the body down well.

575
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,280
What do you mean?

576
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,960
He didn't want michelle
found so quickly.

577
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,480
He screwed that up.

578
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,350
This kind of guy, when
he plans something,

579
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,690
if he has the time, if he's
in control, he's meticulous.

580
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,490
But being on the edge of the river, out
in the open, he was not in control.

581
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,220
He was in a hurry, and he made a mistake.

582
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,750
That's what you're hoping.

583
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,460
Trust me.

584
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,800
With an unsub like this, you
need to throw him off his game.

585
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,640
His hand needs to be forced.

586
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,670
I know that, dave, but the point
is, you did it by forcing ours.

587
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,010
- Is the building sealed?
- Top to bottom.

588
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,450
Yarbrough, make sure it stays that way.

589
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,900
Garcia, which floors did
michelle carlucci remodel?

590
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,220
Got
it--7,8,9.

591
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,250
Morgan, take 7.

592
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,940
We're looking for a
rank-and-file employee

593
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,800
who made a scene in the last
20 minutes or was here and gone.

594
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,900
Prentiss,8, reid,9.

595
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,490
Don't approach him. Just...

596
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,180
try to get a name, maybe a picture.

597
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,800
He's somewhere in this lobby.

598
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,420
Why?

599
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,850
Can't you feel it?

600
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,460
Display your credentials. Fbi.

601
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,050
He thinks we know what he looks like.

602
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,570
Yeah, reid?

603
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,740
Got him.

604
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,910
Sir?

605
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,400
Sir!

606
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,360
Max pool.

607
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,020
We have your address, max.
There's no place to go.

608
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,180
This is agent rossi, max.

609
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,490
If you do what you're thinking, you
won't get to tell them I lied.

610
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,620
Come on, max, slowly put your
hands on top of your head.

611
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,700
Listen to him, max.

612
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,800
I know what you're thinking
and you don't have to do it.

613
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,210
It doesn't have to end here, max.

614
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,000
Please.

615
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,790
Down!

616
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,740
- You OK?
- Yeah.

617
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,910
- He's gone.
- What about enid white?

618
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,080
We have his home address.

619
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,360
Is she there?

620
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,160
Let's hope so.

621
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:05,460
<i><u>"Home" by Chris Daughtry</u></i>

622
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,080
You said out there, the
team shares everything.

623
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,540
That's right.

624
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,430
There is no I?

625
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,930
It seems a big thing to withhold.

626
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,610
Separating from your wife, your child.

627
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,970
What are you talking about?

628
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,550
You used to call haley 10 times a day.

629
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,190
We've been together 48 hours, I
haven't seen you call her once.

630
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,680
Haven't mentioned her.

631
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,530
And you're not going home now.

632
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,820
What's your point?

633
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,940
I guess you're just not used to sharing.

634
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,380
My private life is
not the same as a case.

635
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,920
I'm just saying, sharing
is a learned skill.

636
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,620
You know...

637
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,250
when this all started...

638
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,370
there were only a few of us.

639
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,660
We'd go out on the road alone.

640
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,980
We didn'T... groupthink.

641
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,250
We don't groupthink.

642
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,470
We think as individuals, and we share
the thoughts with the rest of the team.

643
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,560
We don't write them down in a little
notebook and keep them to ourselves.

644
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,460
Dave.

645
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,630
All this-- the people we've
helped, the ones we've put away, it'S...

646
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,030
because of you and the
guys who started this unit,

647
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,830
who believed when nobody else did that

648
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:22,750
there was a way of understanding
these crimes and getting ahead of them.

649
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,890
And?

650
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:27,230
I don't see that you
have anything to prove.

651
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,290
You don't have to come back.

652
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,430
I know that.

653
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,540
So why?

654
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,390
Maybe I have unfinished business.
