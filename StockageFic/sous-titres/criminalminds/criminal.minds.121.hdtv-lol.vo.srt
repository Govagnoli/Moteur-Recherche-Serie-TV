3
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,090
Come on,let's go.

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,500
Everything is going to be ok.

5
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,680
I have to meet a friend,someone who will help us.

6
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,090
We've got to get out of here now.

7
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,630
--You promised you would protect my children.

8
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,720
That's exactly what I'm doing.Just get in the car,please.

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,100
We have to move!

10
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,820
You promised you would keep us safe.

11
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,770
And I will.But you got to trust me one more time.

12
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,790
Come on,kids. Let's go.

13
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,260
Everybody in. 

14
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,690
Everybody in?

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,630
You'll never find her.

16
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,570
I knew it had to be you.

17
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,610
I see the paper reported the death of our mutual friend.

18
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,420
I'll wait for your call.

19
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,170
You catch him?

20
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,850
Only after he drowned 8 women.

21
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,630
Sick bastard.--He was.

22
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,550
As of 3 days ago,john summers wasn'T.

23
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,530
Is that why you called me?

24
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,990
He was stressed,exhausted,a little paranoid maybe,but not suicidal.

25
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,870
I signed him off as fit for duty.

26
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,000
So you did.And so he was.

27
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,080
It wasn't suicide,was it?

28
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,100
Papers say it was.

29
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,060
Investigation too messy.You made it look like suicide.

30
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,370
Now,that is a mess.

31
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,720
This? That's just cleaning house.

32
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,040
So why do you look like crap?

33
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,000
You know me too well.

34
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,890
It was only the people in my unit that knew that john summers was cia.

35
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,060
And my bosses believe that someone in my team

36
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,740
is the one who had him killed.

37
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,620
We wanna know who and why.

38
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,420
A mole in langley.

39
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,810
It looks that way.

40
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,320
And I'm not high enough on the food chain to dodge the bullet on this.

41
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,450
No,no,jason.You know the rules.

42
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,910
No judge. No jury.This is strictly in-house.

43
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,420
You want my help?--Yeah.

44
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,450
Then I need my team.

45
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,090
Albert einstein said,

46
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,320
"whoever sets himself up as judge in the field of truth and knowledge

47
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,170
is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods."

48
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,200
He was cia escort,ok?

49
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,370
It's weird,a little scary.

50
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,200
What do you suppose this is all about?

51
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,350
Call me cynical,but considering it's 2 A.M.,I doubt it's good news.

52
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,930
You are a genius.

53
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,990
The cia's counterterrorism unit is engaged in a mission to save one of its informants.

54
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,990
They suspect one of their agents is a mole.Until the identity of that mole is discovered,

55
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,670
they've locked down the unit.

56
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,560
This gives us the opportunity to profile the unsub up close.

57
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,530
Go ahead.--Let's start the video feed.

58
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,730
John summers was the cia's best field agent in the middle east.

59
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,940
3 nights ago,he was found in his home in washington.

60
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,500
He'd been tortured and murdered.

61
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,480
The cia made it look like suicide.

62
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,740
How'd you like to have that job?

63
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,350
Guys,look at the wound patterns.

64
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,280
They come from 2 distinct angles.Different heights.

65
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,600
One's right-handed and one's left-handed.

66
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,270
Looks to me like he was tortured by more than 2 people.

67
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,280
Hotch,what was summers working on?

68
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,580
Aaliyah nadir 

69
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,850
had been beaten and sexually assaulted at the hands of her husband,hassan nadir.

70
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,360
That's how summers flipped her and got her to work for the cia. 

71
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,000
What's the husband's story?

72
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,050
He's a diplomat for the saudi government,

73
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,410
but he's a fund-raiser for major terrorist organizations.

74
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,820
Aaliyah gave summers intelligence

75
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,780
 on terrorist organizations the cia had never been able to penetrate,

76
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,420
organizations hassan,her husband,funneled money to.

77
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,630
And hassan realized he had a leak?

78
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,630
Yes,but he didn't know who.For aaliyah's protection,

79
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,860
summers never revealed her identity to the cia until about 8 weeks ago.

80
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,960
Cia arranged papers for her,

81
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,920
and summers brought her and her children to the U.S. about a month ago.

82
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,750
Only summers knew where he hid her.

83
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,840
What did hassan think happened to his family?

84
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,260
Car accident. Bodies too disfigured to identify.

85
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,630
Only the cia knew it was staged 

86
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,380
until hassan arrived in washington last week under diplomatic cover.

87
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,730
Only someone in this unit could have given hassan information about his family.

88
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,670
And now he's here looking for her. Why us?

89
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,310
Over the years,I've conducted psychological evaluations on every field agent in that unit.

90
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,920
You worked for the cia?

91
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,210
Not officially.

92
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,580
The train's running.

93
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,850
And if we stop this mission,even for a second,

94
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,740
aaliyah and her children are as good as dead.

95
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,470
Everything's going to be ok.We'll be out of here soon.

96
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,960
He's going to come back for us.

97
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,850
We just all have to be very brave.

98
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,140
Close your eyes.

99
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,330
Try to sleep.

100
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,320
Don't remove your firearm.

101
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,720
U.S. Soil.Federal building.Just your cell phones.Non-negotiable.

102
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,990
The moment we walk in there,the unsub's gonna know we got him cornered.

103
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,000
We don't hand jack him.

104
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,190
Hey.

105
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,190
Special agent hotchner.

106
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,470
Oh,I know who you are and your team,too.

107
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,200
I've got the personnel files all set up for you guys. 

108
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,210
Video,whatnot. It's all there in the conference room.

109
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,920
If you have any questions, feel free to talk to my senior officers.

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,260
This is gina sanchez.She's the associate director of field operations.

111
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,080
And that guy up there is kruger spence,the assistant director of operations.

112
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,920
The lady with him is his second in command,olivia hopkins.

113
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,200
And thank you for coming.

114
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,700
You never mentioned bruno hawks.

115
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,770
You never asked.

116
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,580
How long have you unofficially been working for cia?

117
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,980
Long enough to know who and what we're dealing with.

118
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,540
If I may ask,sir--

119
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,100
I don't know your name,nathan--

120
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,990
the thing that I don't get is our team's there.

121
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,780
Why can't we go to langley?

122
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,780
Do I look like a threat to national security to you? Seriously.

123
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,150
Your name is on a list.

124
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,320
A list? What list?I work for the fbi,

125
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,170
and you're telling me i'm on a list that says I can't go to the cia?

126
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,070
You're on a list.

127
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,670
Uh,garcia.

128
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,500
You do know what this means.

129
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,420
What?

130
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,110
We'll be able to find out whether princess diana's death was really an accident.

131
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,470
I think that's exactly the kind of thing that got you on their list.

132
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,350
Ok,we got a full roster of all the players here,including summers.

133
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,460
How many in total?

134
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,170
In bruno's department. 22.

135
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,220
21 and 22 are here with us.In the room.

136
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,810
What if it's one of them?

137
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,820
We're looking for what the cia classifies a type-a personality.

138
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,030
Overachiever,highly adaptable,well educated,virtually unshakable.

139
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,830
Manipulative enough to persuade a loyal foreign nationalto betray their country 

140
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,620
or a wife to betray her husband.

141
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,660
Most importantly,this unsub long ago accepted the reality 

142
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,060
they will be summarily executed if caught.

143
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,440
Life means nothing to this unsub.

144
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,460
Not his own life.Not his family'S.

145
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,500
Not his colleagues.Certainly not ours.And certainly not theirs.

146
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,320
One of those agents turned against everything they believe in. Why?

147
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,130
Well,he stopped believing.Maybe it was about ideology.

148
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,400
We need to find the stressor,a major event that caused him to turn love,

149
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,370
revenge,economics,sideology.

150
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,450
The intelligence community's mantra says,

151
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,240
"increase the parameter of your enemies' paranoia."

152
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,250
Right now we're the enemy.

153
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,410
Whatever you see or are told,please trust no one but me.

154
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,520
Gideon,you're gonna want to take a look at this surveillance video.

155
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,620
What is it?

156
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,650
It's you. It's your name next to a whole slew of mpegs.

157
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:54,020
There's one that says "john summers."It's 3 hours long. --Sure,go.

158
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,730
When was this?

159
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
3 days before he was killed.

160
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,790
Who called this meeting?

161
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,120
Does it matter?

162
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,970
Every detail matters.

163
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,640
Why?

164
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,420
It can only be 1 of 4 people.

165
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,750
Why is that important?

166
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,490
Whoever requested this wanted more than just an eval from you.

167
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,840
Did you know they were filming you?

168
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,620
I assumed they were.

169
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,480
Taking in all factors discussed--age,rank,

170
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,030
and field status and if you eliminated all non-field agents,

171
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,540
we're left with a total of 16 candidates.

172
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,290
All of whom are in this unit.

173
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,830
We have to assume the mole has an exit strategy.

174
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,490
Only now we're blocking the exit,

175
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,210
and the only way out is through us.

176
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,150
we all know why B.A.U. Are here.

177
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,490
They have their job and we have ours.

178
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,520
And we're down to the wire on this.

179
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,700
Aaliyah nadir risked everything,

180
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,770
and now she and her children deserve our fullest attention.Let's find her.

181
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,210
Agent gideon.

182
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,300
It's good to see you again.

183
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,250
You're not a very good liar.

184
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,480
I wasn't lying.

185
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,660
Your evaluation took me out of the field.

186
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,990
I simply wrote the truth. 

187
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,940
You're highly intelligent.You're impossibly strong-willed.

188
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,600
There's gonna come a time when you can't follow orders.

189
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,950
It hasn't happened yet.

190
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,930
It will.

191
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,130
You're wrong.

192
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,520
we uh...We think the agent who's tipping off hassan 

193
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,800
may have had some kind of extreme event in their life.

194
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,580
Something that distorted or redefined their belief system.

195
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,730
Every agent undergoes regular psych evals.You know that.

196
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,750
They're trained to cope with extreme events.

197
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,840
Whatever turned this agent,you can't train for.

198
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,020
You're welcome to everything I have.

199
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,680
Every op undertaken by these guys is on file.

200
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,350
What about the ones that aren't on file?Like the wiretaps of the saudi embassy.

201
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,380
Those don't even exist.

202
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,550
How long has your department been running operations in riyadh?

203
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,980
We have a declared presence in riyadh monitoring U.S. Interests there.You know that.

204
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,840
Now,if that's all,I have an informant to see.

205
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,470
Hey,guys,take a look at something.

206
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,130
Right there.

207
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,140
That's a woman sitting in the passenger seat of that car.

208
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,830
Looks a lot like aaliyah.

209
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,440
Why would he leave them in the car unless he knew he were being videotaped?

210
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,620
Who called this meeting?

211
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,640
Does that matter?

212
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,220
Every detail matters.--Why?

213
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,400
It can only be 1 of 4 people.

214
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,520
That's not true.

215
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,830
Anyone in this division could have insisted on an eval.

216
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,110
Why narrow it down to 4?

217
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,610
Well,he rightly suspected hassan came to the U.S.Because he knew his wife was alive.

218
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,270
And that someone in this agency was working for hassan.

219
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,310
If we don't discover who the mole is before they find her,she and the kids are dead.

220
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,080
Garcia.--Right here,boss.

221
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,770
How many agents in this unit were actually in saudi monitoring U.S. Interests?

222
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,900
4.

223
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,200
Let me guess.

224
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,330
Bruno hawks,gina sanchez,olivia hopkins,and kruger spence.

225
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,480
4 for 4.

226
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,250
See what else is on the tape.--Alright.

227
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,440
John summers would have only trusted seasoned agents,

228
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,990
of which in this unit there are only 4.

229
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,210
He guessed that the mole had to have been one of his 4 bosses.

230
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,820
Before he put in for aaliyah's extraction,he wanted to know which one not to ask.

231
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,900
We need to match up with them,one-on-one.

232
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,070
Kruger spence,assistant director of operations.

233
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,450
Recruited at the age of 18 after graduating from M.I.T.

234
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:06,680
It says here had 6 years experience as a weapons systems designer and an I.Q. Of 197.

235
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,500
He butted up against the system and didn't deal with authority.

236
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,990
They moved him into field operations in china for 8 years before transferring him here.

237
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,880
Olivia hopkins,divorced mother of 2.

238
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,510
She spent 9 years in field operations in europe.

239
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,470
She also visited riyadh with kruger.

240
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,440
I got gina sanchez.West point graduate.

241
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,340
Black belt in 2 martial arts.

242
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,290
Served in iraq doing psychological operations with military intelligence.

243
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,120
She joined the cia 5 years ago.

244
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,830
Speaks 3 languages including arabic.

245
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,470
Bruno hawks,deputy director of operations.

246
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,970
Extensive field ops in the middle east and europe.

247
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,400
Did his military service with jason gideon.

248
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,690
One thing I've learned over the years profiling cia agents,

249
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,580
spies are some of the smartest liars in the world.

250
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,760
Be smarter.

251
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,300
I'm thirsty.

252
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,810
Drink.

253
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,980
Share the last of it with your sister.

254
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,840
It's ok.He can have it.

255
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,790
I'm not even that thirsty.

256
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,770
We can't circulate a photo of a woman who's supposed to be dead.

257
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,490
I realize that,but--I appreciate you have a job to do,but so do I.

258
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,720
Start looking where aaliyah would feel the most comfortable.

259
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,390
Arab-populated areas.

260
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,040
Actually,you might wanna start by profiling summers.

261
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,070
Be my guest. 

262
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,260
Aaliyah's about to be brutally murdered in front of her children.

263
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,990
Got nothing?

264
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,590
Ok.

265
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,200
Where were we? Let's put some teams together.

266
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,010
Summers was obsessed with his own security.--Aren't we all?

267
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,880
He didn't care about money or possession or family.All he cared about was his job.

268
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,240
He was a classic control freak,a meticulous paranoid.

269
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,550
A loaner who chose to live outside the community.

270
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,560
In an environment that he could control.

271
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,590
All right. So he would have placed aaliyah outside the community 

272
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,140
in an environment that only he could control and have access to.

273
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,080
Maybe. On the other hand,he might--

274
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,660
new deal. I want you to search the areas surrounding summers' apartment.

275
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,560
We're looking for industrial sights,storage spaces,warehouses.

276
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,220
That's good. Thanks.

277
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,670
I don't think i could have a job where I had to sit and talk to people all day.

278
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,340
Ok,wait a minute.It's not all psychobabble.I get my fair share of action.

279
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,780
I'm sure you do.

280
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,750
Here's something you might find interesting.

281
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,010
Joystick,come around 30 degrees,15 by 13 north.

282
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,320
Zoom in 2 miles.

283
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,900
Wait a minute.

284
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,740
That looks like my neighborhood.

285
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,080
That is my neighborhood.That's my house.That's my bike.

286
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,490
You have a dog.

287
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,690
Yeah,yeah,I got a dog.That's clooney.

288
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,770
Well,it looks like clooney's on the couch.

289
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,810
Ok. So you know where I live. I like that.

290
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,900
You also knew where summers lived.

291
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,110
That's my job.

292
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,210
Your job to make it look like suicide?

293
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,710
You stood over the dead body of a friend and a colleague.

294
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,310
You stuck a shotgun in his mouth and you pulled the trigger.

295
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,600
Yep.

296
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,760
Must take a psychological toll,no?

297
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,530
Let's get one thing clear. 

298
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,910
We all write a letter just like the one summers wrote.

299
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,720
A suicide note?

300
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,540
That doesn't mess with your mind just a little bit?

301
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,820
I'm neither disillusioned or confused about what I am,what I do or what I have done.

302
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,030
Somebody here is.Why else would they rat out their own people?

303
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,490
You'll have to ask them.

304
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,940
Cia looks much like the fbi.

305
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,590
This is a real boy's club.Must be tough being a woman here.

306
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,680
Get to the point,agent.

307
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,910
Divorced. Lost custody of your kids.That didn't help your career,huh?

308
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,400
Are you interrogating me?

309
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,310
Just questions.

310
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,650
You want answers,look in my file.--I did.

311
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,740
During an operation in europe,you were taken hostage.

312
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,950
For which i received counseling.

313
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,280
But it didn't help.

314
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,480
Your marriage busted up pretty quickly.

315
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,280
How does this help you?

316
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,960
It would take a major event 

317
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,620
for someone to turn against their country,don't you think?

318
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,050
A major event like what?

319
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,330
Like one that's not in any file.

320
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,050
What happened to you over there?

321
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,080
They attack you?

322
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,380
They rape you?

323
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,110
Olivia.

324
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,960
That's enough.

325
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,250
This is in violation of her civil rights.

326
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,700
Until they find the sleeper and we find aaliyah,all rights are revoked.

327
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,920
Where were you on the night that summers was murdered?

328
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,340
I was with her.In her apartment.

329
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,980
Well,you're a married man.At some point you must have left to get back to your wife,right?

330
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,300
You wake to an empty bed?

331
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,840
Yes.I did.

332
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,190
Are we done here?

333
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,760
My wife will testify that i arrived home at 1:30 A.M.

334
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,420
We all know none of this will ever reach a court.

335
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,540
If you wanna arrest us for having an affair,be my guest.

336
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,270
I'll deal with you two later.

337
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,350
Olivia.--don't.

338
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,630
Riyadh,2003.

339
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,070
When I saw the cctv monitors were down and olivia hadn't returned,

340
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,390
I thought I'd better come looking for her.

341
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,230
Have any agents seen the body?

342
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,260
Good. We can use this to our advantage to get the others.

343
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,350
What? What's going on?

344
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,670
What are we doing here?

345
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,300
You're pulling us away from our assignments?

346
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,620
There's a woman out there whose life depends on us.

347
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,140
Where's olivia?

348
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,980
Olivia hopkins was murdered 10 minutes ago.Her neck was snapped.

349
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,100
Just like john summers.

350
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,570
What are you talking about?

351
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,600
You're lying.Where is she?

352
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,880
Look,people don't just get murdered inside the cia.

353
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,730
What are you looking at?

354
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,180
I realize the enormity of this,but hassan nadir 

355
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,790
is still out there looking to kill his wife,and I need every agent on this.

356
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,200
What do you think it would take for somebody to betray their country?

357
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,290
If I knew that,you wouldn't be here.

358
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,240
Or is this the part where you profile me?

359
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,810
I've done that for over 20 years and for free.

360
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,200
What did you come up with?

361
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,010
Well,you don't smile as much as you used to,

362
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,880
but the rogaine's working.

363
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,270
You need to quit your day job.

364
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,690
You've strived your entire life just to seek the approval of your father.

365
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,810
Obsessively tried not to make the same mistakes he made.

366
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,530
The emotional cost wipes the smile off your face.

367
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,700
You know,my kids,they don't even know who or what their father really is.

368
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,300
But they know there's absolutely nothing you wouldn't do for them.

369
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:57,300
Who says,you know,kids need to know everything about us?

370
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,320
Trust me.

371
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,480
We're not that interesting.

372
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,770
Who do you think it is?

373
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,400
I'm so close to it,jason,I honestly can't tell.

374
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,480
I will say this.I'm glad you're here.

375
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,690
You feeling ok?

376
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,650
I mean,you lost 2 of your people--2 colleagues,2 friends.

377
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,390
I've lost plenty of those along the way.

378
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,200
I just feel pissed off.

379
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:31,300
Someone is gonna pay dearly for what they've done.

380
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,800
You lined us all up to see how we'd react to olivia's death.

381
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,090
What did you see?

382
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,620
You stared straight at kruger like you were trying to deflect blame onto someone else.

383
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,740
You are wasting precious time,

384
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,470
time she doesn't have.Now,unless you have something useful to ask,

385
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,140
we're trying to save lives.

386
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,460
So are we.

387
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,710
Patch her through.It's for you.

388
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,950
Garcia? Talk to me.

389
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,020
That virus that knocked out the cctv.

390
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,930
What about it?

391
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,410
It was downloaded into the system 3 weeks ago.

392
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,510
By who?

393
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,670
Just because i lied about olivia doesn't make me the mole.

394
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,600
No,but the virus that took out the cctv monitors does.

395
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,690
It originated from your computer.

396
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,120
Then whoever put it in my computer is trying to frame me.

397
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,570
Olivia was looking for something.

398
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,400
She didn't find a thing.You know why?

399
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,410
Because all of your files had been erased.

400
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,660
Do you really think if I was the mole,I would keep files that would incriminate me?

401
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,290
Those files were erased to make me look guilty.

402
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,470
Looks like it's working.

403
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,410
Morgan,your girlfriend's back.

404
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,130
Garcia,it's morgan. Go.

405
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,440
That virus left a back door into the cia mainframe.

406
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,280
Yeah,so?

407
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,180
I sort of went ahead and used it to find out who ordered john summers' psych eval with gideon.

408
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,210
Who was it?

409
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,880
Well,that's what's so weird.

410
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,580
Who,garcia? Who?--John summers.

411
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,810
Summers? Why would he order his own evaluation?

412
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,770
So we'd ask that question ourselves.We missed something on that tape.

413
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,540
We better figure out what it was before hassan's friend in here beats us to it.

414
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,550
I have to find some water.

415
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,580
Ok?

416
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,420
No.

417
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:26,040
If mr. Summers comes back before I do,you tell him to wait for me.

418
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:31,160
Do not come looking for mommy.

419
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,320
Whatever happens,you're safe here.

420
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,680
Promise me.Do not leave here.

421
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,100
You both promise?

422
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,430
I promise.

423
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,450
Presidents come,presidents go.

424
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,840
One thing always remains:

425
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,840
The people that run those presidents.

426
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,650
People like you?

427
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,660
Me?No.

428
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,040
No. No. I'm an expendable pawn.

429
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,170
But I got wise to their game.

430
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,410
Game? What game?

431
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,730
Battleship.

432
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,170
I'm the ship at sea.

433
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,430
They try to sink me.

434
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,380
How do you cope?

435
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,740
Compartmentalization.

436
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,900
Separate and seal every aspect of my life.

437
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,310
How does that work?

438
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,250
If one part of the hull is compromised,

439
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,800
the rest of the hull remains intact.

440
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,850
I stay afloat.

441
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,260
And what about a direct hit?

442
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,910
Then I have a box that I put the really important things in,

443
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,290
a sort of insurance policy.

444
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,940
Against what?

445
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,180
Sudden death.

446
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,510
Keep it safe from those who appear to be friends.

447
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,650
He was trying to tell you about the mole.

448
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,070
If they were following summers,

449
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,540
how come they don't know where summers put aaliyah?

450
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,850
You couldn't follow summers through a desert.He was that good.

451
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,070
Somebody followed you.

452
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,030
Then summers must have known they'd be filming him.

453
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,400
They always are. So smile.

454
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,870
Garcia,let's review the tape again.

455
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,110
He sure likes boats.

456
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,520
He refers to compartmentalizing his life like the hull of a ship.

457
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,090
Yeah. And then he talks about a box.

458
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,660
And putting something inside the box as an insurance policy.

459
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,540
He was telling gideon how to find aaliyah.

460
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,080
Summers' cover in saudi was for a shipping company.

461
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,840
Ok. What about a shipping container?That's a box.That's a big box.

462
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,450
The only shipping port near summers' apartment in baltimore,

463
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,230
it's north up the I-95 from langley.

464
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,780
Garcia,I love you.

465
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,340
Garcia?

466
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,160
What happen?Someone just tapped into this feed.

467
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,300
We just found out where aaliyah is.

468
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,000
And so did someone else.

469
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,090
Stand right there.

470
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,840
I can have the chopper on the roof fueled and ready in 2 minutes.

471
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,220
There are thousands of containers at that port.

472
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,600
What makes you so sure aaliyah's in one of those containers?

473
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,420
Why don't we send in a swat team,split them up,

474
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,980
have them search in grids. 

475
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,250
Why? Because hassan has diplomatic immunity,this mission can't exist.

476
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,830
It's not gina.

477
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,720
Morgan,take gina with you.

478
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,610
Wait. This is my command.These are my people.

479
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,210
We have jurisdiction here,

480
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,570
and there's nothing you can do to stop us.

481
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,230
This is my career on the line here.

482
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,930
You always trusted me,right?

483
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,680
Trust me now. 

484
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,250
Come with us.

485
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,550
This is crazy. Bruno.

486
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,030
Go. Go,go,go.

487
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,030
Use the thermal imaging.Search every container for body heat.

488
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,280
You can walk us in and direct us when we get there.

489
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,410
Green,adams.Duncan,come with me.

490
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,260
Jason,you better be certain about this.

491
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,400
I am.

492
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,610
So convince me.

493
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,990
We see it all the time in suspects who kill their loved ones.

494
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,700
They try to immediately shift the focus away from themselves.

495
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,570
There's often an emotional detachment 

496
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,130
in the way the statement was constructed.

497
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,860
Kruger betrayed his wife,betrayed olivia.

498
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,880
After all that betrayal,his country was easy.

499
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,500
Excuse me a second.

500
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,230
Gideon.

501
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,800
You were right.

502
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,290
Right,but too late.

503
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,150
Hassan has beaten us to it.

504
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,780
Don't hurt them. It was me.It was all my fault.

505
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,290
Hurt them? I bury them!

506
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,890
I bury you!

507
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,120
Look at this.You see?

508
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:02,740
You betrayed me and took my children away from me. Why?

509
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,800
Do what you want to me.

510
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,770
Gina and morgan will arrive in 3 minutes.

511
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,520
They're somewhere on the east side of this port.

512
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,170
You guys,take that area over there.Morgan,let's go.

513
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,220
Don't make me do this.

514
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,260
What did you tell them?

515
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,620
Can't you people see what's going on?

516
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,370
All of this was part of their plan,and now hassan is going to kill aaliyah.

517
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,930
This is our one and only offer.

518
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,130
Consider it carefully before you respond.

519
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,460
What do you say?

520
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,300
If this is some kind of a trick,I'm not buying it.

521
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,620
You're gonna have to do better than that.

522
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,790
I am not the mole.

523
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,420
This is crazy,gina. We're just running in circles.

524
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,850
Reid,come on. Help us out.Give me something.

525
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,860
A hundred meters north of your current location.

526
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,770
Let's go. Let's go back.Come on. Let's go back.

527
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:39,700
We can't arrest him.This is still a cia matter.You do know that.

528
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,640
How will you explain this to the saudi government?

529
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,960
Explain what?This isn't happening.

530
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,810
Let's just get aaliyah and her children back alive.We'll worry about hassan's life later.

531
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,900
Morgan.

532
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,730
Yeah. I hear you.

533
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,670
They're right in front of you.

534
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,570
Make the arrest,morgan.It's fbi jurisdiction.You're in charge.

535
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,200
Wait a minute.Wait a minute.I think i find something.

536
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,200
Easy. Easy. Easy.Easy does it.

537
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,820
Fbi.

538
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,150
Let the lady go and put the gun down.

539
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,450
I said put the gun down.

540
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,480
Diplomatic immunity,my friend.

541
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,490
Uh-uh. You got it wrong,my friend.

542
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,530
This container hasn't passed through customs.Officially,we're not on U.S. Soil.

543
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,760
Summers was a smart man.

544
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,710
That he was.Drop the gun.

545
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,760
morgan?

546
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,320
Morgan,what's going on?

547
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,910
Still certain gina isn't the mole?

548
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,150
Morgan.

549
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,560
Morgan,what's going on?

550
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,380
Gideon,we got a situation here.

551
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,630
Gina,don't do this.

552
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,100
Gina,don't do this.

553
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,520
I don't take orders from you.

554
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,310
Bruno,what do you want me to do?

555
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,650
Cover their eyes.Cover their eyes.

556
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,720
Please. Please stop this.

557
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,560
Bruno.

558
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,690
You know what to do.

559
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,190
Say it.

560
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,780
It's not your call.

561
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,870
I told you from the start this was strictly in-house.

562
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,470
This is not your call.

563
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,250
Gina,what are you waiting for?

564
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,790
An order.

565
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,770
Finish him.

566
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,740
Finish him.--Gina,don't do this.

567
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,210
You're gonna cut the visual feed. Right,bruno?

568
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,390
Of course.Cut it now. Cut it.

569
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,580
I wanna thank you,jason,for your help.

570
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,620
Why?

571
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,330
Why did you turn against everything you believe in?

572
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,320
What are you talking about?

573
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:34,360
When someone asks you how you feel about losing one of your colleagues,

574
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:38,160
the only human answer is "I feel guilty,"isn't it?

575
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,350
But as you so brilliantly deduced,

576
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,070
kruger spence is the guilty one.

577
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,110
Ridiculous.

578
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,350
Absurd.

579
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,000
Only thing that's absurd is your arrogance.

580
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,330
To believe you could get away with this.

581
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,440
Unfortunately,with hassan now dead,you have no proof.

582
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,860
Sorry about that.I had to find out if I was right.

583
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,550
How did you know it was bruno?

584
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,170
Because agent gideon believed in me.

585
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:27,030
And there isn't a reason in the world to kill a man who knows as much as hassan does.

586
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,690
Except one.

587
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,150
The same one that made bruno and hassan kill summers.

588
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,160
Self-preservation.

589
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,540
Looks like gideon was right.

590
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,100
Yes,it does.

591
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,030
Actually,hassan is alive and well.

592
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,340
He's en route.That's all the proof we'll need.

593
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,470
You are a fool 

594
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,630
if you think they're gonna put me in prison with all that I know.

595
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,370
Why did you have to kill olivia?

596
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,040
Economics.

597
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,820
Olivia was looking into your financial records when you snapped her neck.

598
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,410
So she knew your dirty little secret.

599
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,550
Which one?

600
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,610
I have so many.

601
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,680
You were looking to cash out using hassan.

602
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,350
$20 million from hassan 

603
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:28,940
will go a very long way to helping occupy my mind on a beach somewhere.

604
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,330
Only beach you'll see is on a postcard i send you from my vacation.

605
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,160
Let me have your gun.

606
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,720
you know,I think the consequences of what you're doing to me,my friend,

607
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,790
are gonna be a lot harder to live with than you think.

608
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,540
We'll see you guys later,all right?We should this again sometime,ok?

609
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,580
Jerks.

610
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,960
Come on. Come on. Quick.I know you're in here.

611
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,350
What are you doing?

612
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,040
Looking for prince william's phone number.The cia is bound to have it.

613
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,610
Oh,garcia,come on.

614
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,460
Yep. Here it is.

615
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,910
No way. --Yes way.

616
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,610
Give me a pen.Garcia,no.

617
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,820
I need this pen.I need a pen.

618
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,950
Oh! It doesn't work. Garcia.

619
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,560
Ok.

620
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,070
Oh. That's too bad.

621
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:47,150
Sleep well,sweet prince.

622
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:53,420
Good night,crazy person.Good night.

623
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,280
What I don't understand is why he invited us here.

624
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,330
He didn'T. 

625
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,430
Summers did by asking for the eval.

626
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,860
When I put the call in,bruno had no choice.

627
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,490
He had to find out what I knew and keep me close.

628
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,510
Bad choice.

629
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:13,130
You said you'd send a postcard of a beach. You lied.

630
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,270
Yeah. You hate the beach.

631
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,980
Beaches are for storming.

632
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,560
Only if ordered to.

633
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,810
Thank you.

634
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:19,960
Thank you.

635
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,760
I could always rent a deck chair and reconsider my career.

636
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,010
You always know where to find us.

637
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,690
I know where you live.

638
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:42,120
George orwell said,"in a time of universal deceit,

639
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,090
telling the truth is a revolutionary act."
