13 and 0,13 and 0!

4
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,710
Next friday,our children will
be asked a question.

5
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,030
How they answer that will define us all.

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,010
The question is: When victory and defeat,

7
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,570
life and death,hang in the balance,

8
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,160
what are you capable of?

9
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,890
State championship!

10
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,580
Number one!
Number one!

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,530
Same speech he gives every year.

12
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,280
That's because it works every year.

13
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,960
What are you doing?
You hate football.

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,830
My brother's on the team.

15
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,820
You hate your brother.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,200
besides,did I ask you not to
go to the pep rally?

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,440
Did I ask you to dump the quarterback?

18
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,710
- Very nice.
- Come on,guys.

19
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,560
We're all tired,we're all hungry--

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,660
and we all know the second you
get some of this pizza,

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,610
you'll remember how much you love each other.

22
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,900
You ok?

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,280
Yeah.It's just a little cough,
it's not going to kill me.

24
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,560
Thanks for hanging with me.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,030
Always.

26
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,990
Besides,thank your daddy for leaving
us the house all weekend.

27
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,480
I need some air.

28
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,600
Give me this.

29
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,850
- Polly.
- Ye.

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,390
Go on,I'll be right in.

31
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,510
Ok,I'm going to go shower.

32
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,520
Ok.

33
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,110
Hey,garbage girl,
better not forget to wash your hands.

34
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,360
Do I what say polly,or brooke and kelly die.

35
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,970
Now,get dressed.

36
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,220
Are you ok?

37
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,740
What does this guy want?

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,520
I don't know.

39
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,610
Did you tell him our names?

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,060
- What?
- He called us by name.

41
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,750
Did you tell him?

42
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,340
No.

43
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,400
She's right.
He knew our names.

44
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,750
What does that mean?

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,970
That he knows us,that he's someone we know?

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,810
Well,if he knows us,
why hasn't he talked to us?

47
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,370
'Cause he's some kind of freak!

48
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,960
If he comes back,we have to fight him together.

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,900
Right.

50
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,720
This time,we fight,no matter what.
Ok?

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,040
He can't take all 3 of us at the same time.

52
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,140
We all attack him at once.

53
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,740
Are you sure you're ok?

54
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,320
God!
What does this guy want?

55
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,250
To choose.

56
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,270
To choose what?

57
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,950
2 of you will leave this room alive...

58
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,830
one of you will die.

59
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,110
You choose.

Mrs.Homefeldt?

65
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,680
Hi.I'm agent jareau.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,310
Thank you for seeing me.

67
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,520
- Miles said it was an emergency.
- Yeah.

68
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,190
She said to give this to you.

69
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,570
You played soccer.

70
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,910
I don't understand.

71
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,600
By daughter,polly,played soccer,
too,for north mammon--

72
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,420
the varsity team--
she got a scholarship to penn state.

73
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,430
Forgive me,ma'am.

74
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,990
My aunt didn't really explain
to me the nature of this emergency.

75
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,000
No one is looking for them.

76
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,150
Here.

77
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,860
My daughter and her 2 friends,

78
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,120
they've been missing for 5 days,

79
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,700
and I know someone took them,
but no one will believe me.

80
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,440
- Missing?
- Yeah.

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,560
This--
this herE...

82
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,100
this is you,right?
I mean,you found this girl,right?

83
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,640
No,no,not just me.
The team here did.

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,060
It's been 5 days now.
Can you ask them to help me?

85
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,400
Because no one is looking for my polly.

86
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,470
Well,as much as we might want
to take this case,

87
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,810
we have to be invited by local authorities.

88
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,850
I'm sure that this friend of
your aunt's is very concerned,

89
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,960
but it just doesn't work that way.

90
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,640
I called the police chief.He faxed over
an official request for our assistance.

91
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,050
This is brooke chambers.

92
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,490
Her father,peter,a widower,
left her home alone for the weekend.

93
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,730
Polly homefeldt and kelly seymour were
sleeping over saturday night.

94
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,820
At 9:35 P.M. During the town's pep rally
for the high school football team,

95
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,130
both kelly and polly called home.

96
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,570
It's me.

97
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,250
I know this is last minute,
but please don't be angry.

98
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,450
Brooke,kelly and i are going to
take off on a road trip for a few days,

99
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,080
sort of our last adventure before graduation.

100
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,560
We'll be back friday night.
Love you,bye.

101
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,650
Kelly seymour left this message on
her parents' machine 44 seconds later.

102
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,530
It's me.

103
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,340
I know this is last minute,
but please don't be angry.

104
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,680
Brooke,polly,and i are going to
take off on a road trip for a few days,

105
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,620
sort of our last adventure before graduation.

106
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,670
We'll be back friday night.
Love you,bye.

107
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,830
- Exactly the same.
- Word for word.

108
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,080
Both calls made were made from brooke's cell,
which has since been turned off.

109
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,530
And there's been no activity on
their cell phones or atm cards since saturday.

110
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,490
It does sound like they were
reading from a script.

111
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,290
And obviously,since the phone's turned off,
I can't use it to locate the girl,

112
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,990
but I have an open trap on the number
in case it gets turned back on.

113
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,230
Ok,guys,guys,not for nothing.

114
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,560
I remembery senior year in high school.

115
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,670
Isn't it possible these girls
just took off on a road trip?

116
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,890
No.

117
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,170
Absolutely not.

118
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,570
Polly accepted an athletic
scholarship to penn state.

119
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,180
I was a high school athlete,
just like these girls.

120
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,430
I was these girls.

121
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,620
They don't smoke,they don't do drugs,
they don't drink during the season,

122
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,340
and they did not jeopardize a fulbright
scholarship by cutting school and missing practice.

123
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,500
Ok.
I hear you,jj.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,840
It has been 5 days.

125
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,800
There's a chance these girls...

126
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,360
there's a chance we may not find them.

127
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,630
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

128
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,290
The phone messages.

129
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,730
If they were reading from a script,they said,
I'll see you next friday,not 2 days,not 2 weeks,friday.

130
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,940
Why be that specific?

131
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,900
My guess is we have until friday to find them.

132
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,470
2 days.

133
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,980
So,are we taking this case?

134
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,570
Wheels up in 30 minutes.

135
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,360
Legendary basketball coach john wooden once said,

136
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,340
"it's not so important who starts the game,
but who finishes it.¡±

137
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,610
Hi,I'm sergeant sykes,tom,if you want.

138
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,390
Derek morgan.

139
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,340
Agent gideon,Dr. Reid.
Jason gideon.How are you?

140
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,200
Hope we haven't brought you folks
out here for nothing.

141
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,520
You don't believe the girls are missing?

142
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,950
It's not really the kind of thing that happens
around here,you know?

143
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,230
You'd be surprised to know how
many times we hear that.

144
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,620
Still,I've been through the house myself
and nothing looks out of place at all.

145
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,120
You talk to chambers,the father?

146
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,000
- Haven't located him yet.
- Is that unusual?

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,670
Chambers is a lawyer.
He's always out of town on business.

148
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,070
November 3rd.
That's tomorrow.

149
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,120
State championship football game.
North mammon is finally back in it.

150
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,280
Show us inside.

151
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,480
Chief yates,jennifer jareau,
we spoke on the phone.

152
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,950
- Hi.
- This is agent hotchner.

153
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,030
Hi,jeff yates.
Hi,judy.

154
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,990
Hey,why don't you go on inside and make
yourself comfortable.

155
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,830
- We'll be in in a minute.
- Okay.

156
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,040
Chief yates,there's not much of
a case file yet.

157
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,790
Listen,I can't get anyone to agree
the girls are actually missing.

158
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,770
Mrs.Homefeldt certainly believes it.

159
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,830
Yeah,well,I wouldn't put too much
stock in what judy homefeldt thinks.

160
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,240
Why is that?

161
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,490
She's got a history of mental problems.

162
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,620
- What kind of history?
- Depression.

163
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,850
Just heard she's even on medication.

164
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:25,250
Didn't she raise polly on her own after
her husband abandoned her,what,12 years ago?

165
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,730
That's right.
Yeah.

166
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,530
If you were in her place,
don't you think you'd be a little depressed?

167
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,980
Point taken.

168
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,260
Chief,if you're not sure the girls are missing,
why would you request our help?

169
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,740
Listen,something happened.

170
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,660
I'm just not sure what and if it's bad,
I'll take all the help I can get.

171
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,860
Plus,your agent jareau can be pretty convincing.

172
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,590
Are the parents inside?

173
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,740
Well,kelly's parents are in there.We still
haven't been able to track down brooke's father,petE.

174
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,610
He's--
well,he travels a lot.

175
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,010
Listen,these people are my friends,ok?

176
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,210
They're my neighbors,good people.

177
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,480
I don't want anybody assuming
that they're involved.

178
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,140
We just got here,we're not assuming anything.

179
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,380
Go ahead.

180
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,200
You were right,sergeant.

181
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,330
No forced entry,no sign of struggle.

182
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,010
If someone did attack these girls,
they chose to comply pretty fast.

183
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,210
If there were only 2 ways to immediately
get compliance without the use of force,

184
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,680
that's either the threat of force
or previously established trust.

185
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,300
Whoever it was,it took a lot of planning.

186
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,140
Detailed information about the girls.

187
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,650
When brooke's father was gone,
when the other parents were out.

188
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,490
How do you mean?

189
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,440
He knew they'd have to leave messages.

190
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,000
With that script,they couldn't
talked to the parents directly.

191
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,440
Close family friend or a stalker.

192
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,020
The folks here look after each other.

193
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,790
There's no way an outsider stalker
stalked these girls without being noticed.

194
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,000
We have to assume the people who abducted
these girls were members of the community.

195
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,850
Would have needed a spot to watch her from.

196
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,030
Should we expect a ransom demand?

197
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,850
Kidnappers who want money contact the families
to prove they have possession of the victim.

198
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,760
They don't call to conceal it.

199
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,540
Kidnappers.
Are we sure they just haven't run off?

200
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,330
It's pretty unusual the girls
left identical messages.

201
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,570
They feel scripted.

202
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,970
- Why would kelly run off?
- Here's the thing.

203
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,340
This is a football town,
kelly plays girl's soccer.

204
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,640
Our son is on the football team.

205
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,660
This week,
the football is all anyone cares about.

206
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,520
That didn't always sit right with kelly.

207
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,900
Should it,gill?

208
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,390
Should her being told that she's not
as important sit right with her?

209
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,430
I didn't say she wasn't as important.

210
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,400
You never said it.

211
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,790
No,it's going to be all right.

212
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,960
She'll be back after the game,you'll see.

213
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,680
Come on,i got some tissue in the office.

214
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,730
You can see all the windows from here.

215
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,130
Someone's spent a lot of time here.

216
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:02,990
Aw,damn.

217
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,610
Has it rained since saturday night?

218
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,120
No.

219
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,410
He who seeks the queen of all knowledge,
speak and be recognize.

220
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,370
Garcia,we're sending you some cigarettes.

221
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,240
Yeah,why not a flesh-eating virus?
It'll be faster and far less painful.

222
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,060
We need some butts rushed to
the lab for dna analysis.

223
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,700
Oh,reid,I love it when you say butts.

224
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,350
Send away,sugar.
Bang bang for now.

225
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,030
Do you really think someone from
our town's involved in this?

226
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,990
You said it yourself,
an outsider would have been noticed.

227
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,050
Sergeant sykes.

228
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,080
What?

229
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,210
Looks like chief yates won himself
a title back in the day.

230
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,330
- They do like their football.
- Trust me,it's like a religion.

231
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,630
Do you think it strange that with 3 girls missing,

232
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,060
nobody's talking about canceling
tomorrow night's game?

233
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,840
Come on,hutch,it's football.
They know they can play without girls.

234
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,710
Just found brooke's car,abandoned.

235
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,740
I'm freezing.

236
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,770
We're all cold,we're all hungry.

237
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,580
She has a fever.

238
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,790
Complaining about it isn't going
to make it any better.

239
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,640
Do you have to be so mean?

240
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Mean?
Some jerk puts us in a box,and I'm mean?

241
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,090
You don't see brooke and me jumping
on you about it.

242
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,240
I don't see you or brooke a doing a damn thing!

243
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,550
Guys,this is what he wants.

244
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,610
How long have we been down here?

245
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,380
We don't even know where here iS.

246
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,440
He doesn't want us to know.

247
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,090
He wants to break us down.

248
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,070
It's called sensory depravation.

249
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,180
Well,it's not going to work!

250
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,770
You hear me,you son of a bitch?!
It's not going to work!

251
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,550
Yes,it will.

252
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,290
If he doesn't give us water and food...

253
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,460
it will work.

254
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,060
We could die down here.

255
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,150
It's covered in dust.
It must've been here for quite a while.

256
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,500
So much for the spontaneous road trip.

257
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,980
This isn't a very traveled area.

258
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,890
Not really.

259
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,760
So,the car's left in town where
it would eventually be found.

260
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,780
Eventually.

261
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,780
Gideon,it's from the football team.

262
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,340
It says K.E.
On the brim.

263
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,900
- Could be kip engler.
- Who?

264
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,430
Ah,he's the quarterback.
He and brooke were an item.

265
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,530
What,you think he had something to do with this?

266
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,590
Was he at the pep rally saturday night?

267
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,800
- Yeah,he was the star of it.
- Then no.

268
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,110
But I think we know the kind of
person we're looking for.

269
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,150
Brooke kelly and polly have been
missing for 5 days.

270
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,050
Usually in cases like this we wouldn't
expect to find them alive.

271
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,330
However,in this case,we don't believe that to be true.

272
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,530
The person responsible spent considerable
time and energy planning the abduction.

273
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,760
He did not do all this work to simply
kill the girls once he had them.

274
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,720
Otherwise,he would've done it
at the chamber's house.

275
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,500
He certainly seemed to know he had the time.

276
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,880
And he had kelly and polly reference friday
in the messages they left for their parents.

277
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,720
We think the unsub has something planned
for the night of your championship game.

278
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,100
We are certain the unsub is someone
from this community.

279
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,150
How do you know that?

280
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,000
Because,Mr. Chambers,he didn't have your
daughter leave you a phone message or a note,did he?

281
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,600
Not that I know of.

282
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,340
'Cause he knew you'd be out of town for a while.

283
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,610
Just like he knew the dump site for
the car would eventually be found.

284
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,750
Everything points to him giving himself time.

285
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,900
Time for what?

286
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,980
- I don't know yet,sir.
- Well,what's been done about it?

287
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,620
Sir,I'm with the fbi.
We're going to need some information.

288
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,250
Wait a minute.

289
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,120
If someone from this town's taken my brooke,
I want to know what the hell's being done about it.

290
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,310
Yes,I know,sir.If you'd just come with me.
I will explain everything.All right?

291
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,490
Thank you.

292
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,680
Predatory abductors like this unsub
are intelligent,patient,and cautious.

293
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,980
They like to watch everything--
the victims,the families,the police.

294
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,120
He's surely watching us now and may even
attempt to inject himself into our investigation.

295
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,320
We also know that predatory abductors
prepare a nest prior to the abduction.

296
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,900
A remote cabin,an underground bunker,

297
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:20,520
a safe and secure place that only
he has access to.

298
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:26,650
Designed to confine and conceal his
prey once his hunting is done.

299
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,280
Should we be looking for this nest?

300
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,630
You'd never find it.

301
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,480
For his nest,predatory abductor
john jemelske built

302
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,950
a sophisticated dungeon complex
under a suburban syracuse home,

303
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:42,370
where he documented every detail of torture he
carried out upon the victims he kept there for 3 years.

304
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,930
The man who kidnapped these girls
has a relationship or

305
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,730
a job that permitted them to get
close enough to watch them.

306
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,900
We must focus on those people who had access.

307
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,610
A family member,a teacher,
a next door neighbor,it sounds clich?

308
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,300
but often it is the person you least suspect.

309
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,090
One more thing to remember.

310
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,440
We're looking for someone who was
not at the pep rally.

311
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,190
Ask the community,I'm sure somebody videotaped it.

312
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,640
You can go through the tapes,
start eliminating townspeople.

313
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,450
I'm sorry,sir.
Mr. Chambers just took off.

314
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,000
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

315
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,180
That was garcia.She just ran the cigarette
butts through codus and got a name--

316
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,190
donald haas?

317
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,410
Don haas is the girls' soccer coach.

318
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,370
Was coach haas at the pep rally?

319
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,850
I don't remember seeing him there,no.

320
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,010
Where would coach haas be right now?

321
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:35,200
Now,I know that we're all upset about
polly and brooke and kelly,

322
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,740
but it is important that we
keep a positive attitude.

323
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,080
Those girls,they'd want you to be strong.

324
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,790
They'd want your prayers.

325
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,890
Where's my daughter,you son of a bitch?

326
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,580
I get the charge dropped,
and this is what you do for me?

327
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,760
- Take it easy,take it easy!
- He did it before in pittsburgh!

328
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,440
He was arrested,and I got him off.
I got you off,you son of a bitch.

329
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,140
That's enough!

330
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,800
Little help!

331
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,020
Are you okay?

332
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,140
They're all turning on each other.

333
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,190
I'm hungry.

334
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,060
Remember when we played ashland?

335
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,310
You stopped like a hundred shots on goal?

336
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,660
It wasn't a hundred.

337
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,950
You were on fire that day.

338
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,070
You're the great player,polly.

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,550
You're the one going to penn state.

340
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,760
You're going to come visit me,right?

341
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,580
There's got to be a way to get
him to come down here.

342
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,740
He's not coming down.

343
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,650
You know,some of us are trying to
come up with solutions,brooke.

344
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,150
Don'T.
She's sick.

345
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,520
She's sick,she's sick.

346
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
What about me?
I'm sick!

347
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,640
I'm sick of trying to come up with a plan
while little miss perfect over here just whines.

348
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,710
She has a plan.

349
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,210
What are you talking about?

350
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,300
She already has a plan.

351
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,660
Why hasn't she told us?

352
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,250
Because I'm not sick enough yet.

353
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,770
Hey.

354
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,230
What the hell is wrong with pete,huh?

355
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,160
Going crazy like that.

356
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,280
Like I had something to do with this.

357
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,440
- Mind if I smoke?
- Yes.

358
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,460
You smoke more than 100's,Mr. Haas?

359
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,050
Yeah.

360
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,230
We found 13 morley 100 cigarette butts

361
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,890
with your dna on them across the street
from the chamber's house.

362
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,150
This is a mistake.

363
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,640
Somebody has made a mistake.

364
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,930
You smoke those cigarettes and left
something for yourself on them,sir.

365
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,410
That's a fact.

366
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,240
Yeah,but I did not leave them there.

367
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,880
- Can you tell me who did?
- How the hell should I know?

368
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,220
All right,thanks.
You can go back to work now.

369
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,390
THE SAGINAW MOTEL.

370
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,130
Here's the guest registry.

371
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,400
All right.

372
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,250
I'll get started running these
names through the computer.

373
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,440
There's a name in there,john sherman,
you're not going to find it in the state computer.

374
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,930
He stays here once a month,and he pays me
$100 cash over the rate so i'll look the other way.

375
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,020
And you don't ask for I.D.?

376
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Well,I don't have to...
see,because I know the guy.

377
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,110
Only his name's not sherman.

378
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,280
It's chambers.
Peter chambers.

379
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,750
Don haas kidnapped my daughter.

380
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,850
Now,why are you wasting time talking to me?

381
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,660
He's being questioned in another room.

382
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,650
Tell me why you're so convinced that it was him.

383
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,390
He said it was someone from this community.

384
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,700
The only person I know capable of doing something like this is don.

385
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,150
What do you mean,capable?

386
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,720
He's a sex offender.

387
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,700
His record is clean.

388
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,320
Yeah,well,6 years ago,don called me from pittsburgh

389
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,670
and he'd been arrested for soliciting an underage prostitute.

390
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,190
Why did he call you?

391
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,480
Because I'm a lawyer.

392
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,460
We'd been friends for 30 years.

393
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,080
We played football together in high school.

394
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,420
So,why did you agree to help him?

395
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,650
'Cause don swore it was a one-time thing.

396
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,420
The guy was going through a divorce,the girl had a record.

397
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,130
I made sure that a sex offender could still spend all his working hours around young girls.

398
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,950
God,I practically gave him my daughter.

399
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,610
Chambers represented haas in a minor sex offense case 6 years ago,

400
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,030
had the record expunged.

401
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,330
What kind of sex offense?

402
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,470
An underage prostitute.

403
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,860
Sounds like the right kind of crime?

404
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,590
Could be.

405
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,750
Well,haas swears he didn't put the cigarette butts there.

406
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,480
Does it strike anyone else as grossly inconsistent

407
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,160
that an unsub this sophisticated and

408
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,820
methodical would leave an obvious pile of his dna at the crime scene?

409
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,550
Don haas was at the pep rally.

410
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,600
I saw him in 2 different video tapes.

411
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,600
I guess I must've missed him.

412
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,520
All 3 of the victims' soccer jersies were found behind

413
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,690
the motel peter chambers has been staying at for the last week.

414
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,730
Don haas has an alibi for the night your daughter was taken.

415
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,560
-What?
-Video.

416
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,200
At the exact time the other girls were leaving their scripted messages,

417
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,550
he was at the pep rally.

418
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,010
Oh,my god.

419
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,040
You said you were in philadelphia on business last week.

420
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm sorry?

421
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,170
Were you in philadelphia?

422
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,860
You think I hurt my daughter?

423
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,140
We just found the girls' soccer uniforms behind the saginaw motel.

424
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,610
What?

425
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,160
Were you in philadelphia on business last weekend?

426
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,580
No.

427
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,030
Where were you?

428
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,030
I was at the saginaw motel.

429
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,070
What were you doing there?

430
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,460
I meet a friend there once a month.

431
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,740
Actually,he's more than a friend.

432
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,100
This is a small town.

433
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,740
These are small town people.

434
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,500
They're wonderful in many ways,but there are some things they just don't understand.

435
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,970
I need a name.

436
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,950
Glenn donahue.

437
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,440
He lives on rittenhouse square...

438
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,560
with his wife...

439
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,030
and his 2 little boys.

440
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,770
These men are innocent.

441
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,790
You're sure?

442
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,740
Unsub planted evidence to implicate them.

443
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,310
Forensic countermeasures.

444
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,940
So,we've got no suspects,no reliable evidence,we've got nothing.

445
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,540
We have the behavior.

446
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,800
The fact of the countermeasures.

447
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,450
He tried to implicate haas and chambers.

448
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,770
That would mean haas and chambers had significance to him,right?

449
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,870
Who he's implicated may be as important as who he's abducted.

450
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,570
He's been watching them all for a long time.

451
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,930
See them.

452
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,910
We need to bring the parents and the people he implicated in.

453
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,710
They,along with the girls,are his targets,

454
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,030
and it may be the key to finding him before it's too late.

455
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,840
He's ahead of us.

456
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,490
Has been all along.

457
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,990
I got a bad feeling about this one.

458
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,510
Me,too.

459
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,070
I know it's terrible,but she's sick,

460
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,560
and pretty soon you will be,too.

461
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,100
I'm not listening.

462
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,990
She is dying already.

463
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,750
What?

464
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,840
You don't know that.

465
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,130
Look at her,polly.

466
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,880
She isn't going to make it.

467
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,440
We have to face facts.

468
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,270
She's dying.

469
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,520
No she's not.

470
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,950
Yes,she is.But we don't have to.

471
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,500
So,what we have to do is sacrifice our friend and we're safe.

472
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,110
We didn't do that to her,ok?

473
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,200
How do you know he'll let us go anyway?

474
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,450
Did you ever think of that?

475
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,540
What if he's just some evil,

476
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,170
twisted psycho who gets off watching people fight with each other.

477
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,530
Maybe we can get her help if we st get out of here.

478
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,660
He said one of us has to die.

479
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,050
If we don't choose,we are never going to see our families again,ever.

480
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,580
No one will ever know what happened to us,

481
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,810
we'll starve to death and no one will ever know.

482
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,960
You'll never see your mother again,ever.

483
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,260
My mom would be totally alone.

484
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,800
Totally alone.

485
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,990
There's no other choice,is there?

486
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,240
No,polly,I'm sorry,but there is no other choice.

487
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,710
She's going to die anyway,right?

488
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,120
That's right,but we don't have to.

489
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,600
All right.

490
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,270
Ok.

491
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,190
Hey,mister.

492
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,200
We made our choice.

493
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,060
God.

494
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,360
No.

495
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,640
What's happening?

496
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,280
Nothing,brooke.

497
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,970
Nothing.Go back to sleep.

498
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,300
This unsub,or unknown subject,is someone you know.

499
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,090
He's someone from your past,

500
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,090
and he's someone who thinks that you have wronged him.

501
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,120
We'd like for you to think about who might fit that description.

502
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,670
Don't you think if we knew who we did this or why we would've told you?

503
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,480
Please,let him talk,gill.

504
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,910
Oh,I'm going to take advice from somebody on mental medication?

505
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,290
What?

506
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,310
Everyone knows,judy.

507
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,700
Could we just stay focused,please?

508
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,410
The man who took your daughters.

509
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,780
He framed don haas and peter chambers for a reason.

510
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,610
This is an attack on you.

511
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,540
I have made mistakes in my life,but why take it out on brooke?

512
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,720
You know,it's one thing for brooke to pay for your mistakes,

513
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,690
but if my daughter has to pay for them,too--

514
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,850
Mr. Seymour,that's not helping.

515
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:27,950
That's not fair,gill.

516
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,410
Fair?

517
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,770
You shut the hell up,you're nothing but a pervert.

518
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,360
You will never get near the children of this town again.

519
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,010
We need to keep this as civil as possible.

520
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,750
Gill,are you even listening?It wasn't don.

521
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,990
He had nothing to do with it.

522
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,950
You knew he was a deviant,you didn't tell us.

523
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,510
We let him coach our girls.

524
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,430
His arrest was a sunderstanding,ok?

525
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,450
We talked to the hotel manager,peter.

526
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,620
We know about you.

527
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,750
Maybe this is god's punishment.

528
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,810
Oh,punishment.

529
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,880
Ok.

530
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,470
At least I didn't spend the week my daughter

531
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,360
was missing focusing on my son and the damn football game!

532
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,200
No,we know what you spent the week doing.

533
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,680
I blame myself for ever letting kelly be friends with brooke and polly to begin with.

534
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,160
Low breeding always shows through.

535
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,200
Low breeding?

536
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,450
They're bad seeds.

537
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,000
They always have been.

538
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,410
Don't talk about my daughter like that,all right?

539
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,420
That's enough!

540
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,410
What is the matter with you people?

541
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,900
This is exactly what he wants.

542
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,990
He is attacking all of you.

543
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,010
He is turning all of you against each other,and you're just letting him do it.

544
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,830
Your daughters are best friends,

545
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,760
and you all have known each other most of your lives as friends.

546
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,150
Don't let this man beat you this way.

547
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,560
What do you want us to do?

548
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,210
Listen to these agents,all right?

549
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,000
They came here to help.Let them do that.

550
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,370
We're going to split you up,

551
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,460
go over your histories,

552
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,480
and see if there's a name from your past in common.

553
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,430
Probably won't be a casual acquaintance.

554
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,800
He knows your secrets.

555
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,510
Don't just think people you've knowingly wronged.

556
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,960
It may be something you're not even aware of,or you may have forgotten--

557
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,990
agent gideon.

558
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,420
It's penelope garcia from quantico.She says it's urgent.

559
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,660
Put her on speaker.

560
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,870
Go ahead,garcia.

561
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,290
Brooke chamber's phone just switched back on.

562
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,650
Tell me you got a trace.

563
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,110
And a location.Downtown north mammon,

564
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,900
within 100 meters of the intersection of main and first.

565
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,710
That's right outside.

566
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,940
-Morgan.
-Yeah.

567
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,100
You keep the parents *********

568
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,130
what's going on?

569
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,230
Back up.Come on.*******

570
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,060
It's ok.

571
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,160
We're with the fbi.Are you all right?

572
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,560
Polly,are you hurt?

573
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,960
She's bleeding.

574
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,000
It's not her blood.

575
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,680
Brooke.

576
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,790
Where's kelly seymour?

577
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,560
Let me get you some more water.

578
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,130
I'll get it.

579
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,710
Polly,do you know who did this to you?

580
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,320
Whatever happened...

581
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,220
you're a very brave woman.

582
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,680
Not many people can face what you did and...

583
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,600
make it out the other side.

584
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,250
It wasn't polly's fault.

585
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,470
She didn't do anything.

586
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,610
Nothing's happened.I'm just getting her some water.

587
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,730
Is she talking?

588
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,660
Did she say where kelly is?

589
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,660
We're working on it.

590
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:13,050
Agent charill,when you said we all grew up together,something struck me.

591
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:13,670
What's that?

592
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,500
We all played football together.

593
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,180
Don,pete,even chief yates.

594
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,530
We were all on the last championship football team.

595
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,990
The championship game's tonight.

596
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,190
Polly,can you tell us were kelly seymour is?

597
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,190
Where's the water?

598
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,420
Hutch,do you mind if I--

599
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,480
no,please.

600
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,140
Hi,polly.

601
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,450
My name is jj.

602
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,970
I grew up in east allegheny,just right up the road.

603
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,000
I was captain of the varsity soccer team my senior year.

604
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,000
It got me a scholarship to pittsburgh.

605
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,130
It was a pretty good school,

606
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,880
but it's not exactly penn state.

607
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,080
I know that's where you're going because your mom told me.

608
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,930
You know,your mom carried a picture of you

609
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,820
all the way up to the fbi academy in quantico,virginia

610
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:27,500
so that me and these agents here could help find you.

611
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:33,320
And,believe me,she was not leaving until we said we'd come.

612
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,360
So,no matter what happened over the past 6 days...

613
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,740
no matter what...

614
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:48,500
this will all be a memory someday...

615
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,380
but you will always have a mother that loves you that much.

616
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,530
I want to show you a photograph,polly.

617
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,890
I want you to look at the men in the picture

618
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,350
and tell me if you see the man that did this to you.

619
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,740
Ok?

620
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,100
Ok.

621
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,800
It's ok.

622
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,320
We were so hungry...

623
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,290
so thirsty...

624
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,630
so cold.

625
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,000
He wants us to do it?

626
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,040
If that's what it takes to get out of this alive--

627
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,950
no way,I can'T.

628
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,400
You don't have a choice.

629
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,290
I can'T.I can'T.

630
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,400
Listen,it's like like those soccer players who crashed in the andes.

631
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,530
They were starving,they had no food,nothing to eat except for their friends o had died.

632
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,110
They were good people,but they didn't have a choice.

633
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,240
They did what they had to do.

634
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,450
You killed her.

635
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,900
I didn't have any choice.

636
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,280
They had already decided to...

637
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,370
but it wasn't polly's fault.

638
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,440
It was him.

639
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,440
He said we had to choose.

640
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,510
Who was he,brooke?Who made you choose?

641
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,580
I never saw him.

642
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,550
He made us...

643
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,830
choose.

644
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,950
Who did?

645
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,400
Good job.

646
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:36,360
Hutch,it's the guy that found the soccer jerseys.

647
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,660
It's the garbage man.

648
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,280
Marcus younger.

649
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,540
Polly just id'd him.

650
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,860
He was the star of our team.

651
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,890
Blew his knee out in the first quarter of the championship.

652
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,130
Lost his fulbright scholarship to notre dame.

653
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,000
Do you know where he lives?

654
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,220
Come on.

655
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,040
Clear!

656
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,260
Guys.

657
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,600
There's a storm cellar outside.

658
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,410
Don't move!

659
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,470
I got him.

660
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,870
Marcus younger?

661
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,000
Fbi.

662
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,820
I never touched her.

663
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,200
Put your hands where I can see them.

664
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,780
I never hurt them.

665
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,870
Get up,marcus.

666
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,260
I never even came into the room,jeff.

667
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,940
They did this.

668
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,210
Brooke and polly.

669
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,640
All I did was show them who they really are,

670
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,160
what they were truly capable of.

671
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,180
People pretending to be decent.

672
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,760
When it came down to it,they,uh...

673
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,030
they reacted just the way I knew they would.

674
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,610
They turned on each other.

675
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,960
Just like when I got hurt.

676
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:39,600
You all couldn't wait to run over me,to take my position,to take my life...

677
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,490
and to forget all about me.

678
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,940
Marcus,I'm not going to ask you again.

679
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,400
Get up.

680
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,830
You don't know what it's like,jeff.

681
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,900
You all have lives,and I just cleaned up after you.

682
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,240
Now,you have to clean up after me.

683
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,060
-You get him out of here.
-let's go.

684
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:33,150
***********************  ***self

687
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,990
Can't sleep?

688
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,660
You can't imagine the pressures a small town creates.

689
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,310
To play,to win,everyone pushing,everyone watching,I hated it.

690
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,610
Why did you play?

691
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,400
Athletic scholarship was the only way I was getting to college.

692
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,410
It was my only way out.

693
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,720
Besides,having a thick skin when it comes to pressure

694
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,960
is a good thing in this line of work,right?

695
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,360
You did exceptional work the last couple of days.

696
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,740
Thank you.

697
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,220
It's nice to be noticed.

698
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,040
Yeah.We don't usually,do we?

699
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,130
Eh,it's all right.

700
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,160
It's not why I do it.

701
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,960
Have you ever thought about taking the classes,becoming a profiler?

702
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,940
No.No.

703
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,190
I admire what you guys do,but I like my role.

704
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,790
I like being the person the family can turn to.

705
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,820
Being the voice the poor,

706
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,660
the over-worked homicide detective can call when he runs out of leads.

707
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:42,910
Really?

708
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:43,780
Yeah.

709
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,180
I thought everyone wanted to be a profiler.

710
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,160
Sorry.

711
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,750
What's all of that?

712
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,690
New cases.

713
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,060
I got to figure out where going to next.

714
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,160
Hey,wait a minute,we're the profilers.I thought we made those decisions.

715
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,620
Sure you do.

716
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,980
All right.Well,I'm going to find someplace to get some sleep.

717
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,750
-Yeah,good luck with that.
-Thanks.
