I'm sorry.

13
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,310
You're Dr.Reid.

14
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,720
I'm sorry.Do I know you?

15
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,860
I just know what you do.

16
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,600
Ok.

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,170
I saw you in georgetown a few weeks ago.

18
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,320
You gave a lecture on sexual sadism and

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,880
how you helped catch the mill creek killer in st.Louis.

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,990
I-I'm not much of a,uh-- a public speaker.

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,260
I don't know.I thought you seemed cool.

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,530
You look kind of young to go to georgetown.

23
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,130
Um,I'm a junior at northwest high school.

24
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,000
And you just go to lectures on anger excitation for fun?

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,540
I don't have a lot of friends.

26
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,230
So you're interested in profiling?

27
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,010
Yeah.I mean,

28
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,900
I read a lot,you know,true crime,

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,790
like graphic novels,mostly.

30
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,770
They're all about whether there's really such a thing as evil,

31
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,630
like nature versus nurture,all that,

32
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,560
so i figured it'd be smart to hear it from an expert,you know?

33
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,030
So you said a lot of 'em kill prostitutes?

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,830
It's the number one serial killer target,actually.

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,430
Well,is that for sex or because they think they're dirty and they need to be punished?

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,370
Were you waiting here for me?

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,510
What would it mean if somebody were stabbing them and cutting off their hair?

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,470
I've never,uh-- I've never heard of a case like that.

39
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,660
Do you wanna go to the bau with me,

40
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,420
maybe talk to some of my other team members?

41
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,780
I actually have to go to school.

42
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,540

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,170
Jj,who's your contact at the D.C. Police?

46
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,950
Uh,victor barnes.Why?You need me to call him?

47
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,020
Hi.Detective barnes,please.

48
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,960
What's wrong?

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,630
Need to get that to everyone as soon as possible.

50
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,110
Uh,hi.Detective barnes,this is special agent dr.Spencer reid at the behavioral analysis unit at quantico.

51
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,920
Have you had any recent murders involving prostitutes,

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,300
maybe just jane does?

53
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,830
They would have been stabbed to death,and their hair would've been cut off by the killer.

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,880
When was the most recent victim?

55
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,610
I'll explain when I see you.I'll meet you in a half-hour.

56
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,270
What's going on?

57
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,430
D.C. May have a serial killer.

58
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,080
I think I just let him get away.

Hey.Just got your message.

69
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,580
Aaron hotchner,vic barnes.

70
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,770
Hi.What have we got?

71
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,780
This is the second victim.

72
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,050
The first one was killed 3 months ago,

73
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,910
both in the early morning.

74
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,640
Both had their hair chopped?

75
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,330
Uniform didn't make the connection,because he was fixated on this.

76
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,340
The first victim didn't have anything carved on her?

77
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,090
Just a routine jane doe.

78
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,580
Take a look.

79
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,720
A lot are shallow.They're hesitation marks.

80
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,610
He's not certain he wants to be killing.

81
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,290
Makes you think the message he carved is sincere.

82
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,270
He's asking the police to help him stop.

83
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,490
Fits with your kid seeking you out.

84
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,290
Part of him wants to get caught.

85
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,810
I let him go.I'm sorry.

86
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,210
We'll find him.

87
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,250
If both murders took place in the morning,how come there were no witnesses?

88
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,850
The motels and alleys around the capitol are notorious.

89
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,640
People go out of their way not to look.

90
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,950
At night,no one can see down there.

91
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,760
During the day,

92
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,260
you just duck behind the dumpster or into a doorway.

93
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,020
Business is pretty heavy here in the mornings?

94
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,780
How do I know you're not just lookin' to crack down on us?

95
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,200
Because I'm telling you.

96
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,630
We're here trying to protect you.

97
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,520
A lot of johns from the hill stop by on their way to work.

98
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,340
We always say the same politicians yellin' about cleanin' up the hill,

99
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,450
the ones droppin' 50 bucks with us before they make the speech.

100
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,900
It's true,and the more important they think they are,

101
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,100
the quicker they accidentally finish up with us.

102
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,260
It's weird like that.

103
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,250
No,that's pretty much universal.

104
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,480
You recognize him at all?

105
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,340
I don't know his name or nothin'.

106
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,320
He hangs around,tries to pretend like he's not watching us.

107
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,260
He's just a horny kid,you know.

108
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,950
You didn't see him talking to any of the other girls out here?

109
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,730
I just figured he's the kind gets his little bit of danger

110
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,470
and goes home and takes business into his own hands.

111
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,190
Is he the one who did this?

112
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,380
We don't know,but someone did,

113
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,040
so you need to be careful.

114
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,700
We stick to the daylight and only work the high-end blocks.

115
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,420
How old are you?

116
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,420
21.

117
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,540
19.

118
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,310
Just watch out for each other,ok?

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,480
Oh,agent hotchner,karen steyer.

120
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,690
Congresswoman,how do you do?

121
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,490
I'm fine,thank you.They said it was fine to wait in here.

122
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,940
Of course.What can I do for you?

123
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,630
Well,I have talked to my people,

124
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,450
and I understand that we have a potential serial killer targeting prostitutes in D.C.

125
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,850
That was awfully fast.

126
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,260
I have awfully good people.

127
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,250
Sounds like it.

128
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,190
I'd like you to promise me that if your team stays on the case,

129
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,810
uh,you won't publicize the murders.

130
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,380
I'm afraid I can't make that promise.

131
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,060
With all due respect,you will notice that I said,

132
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,820
"if you stay on the case.

133
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,720
" I really don't like doing this,honestly

134
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,130
but as you know,the bau cannot join an investigation

135
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,020
unless they are invited by the local enforcement agency.

136
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,740
What's this about?

137
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,410
6 months ago,I introduced a major initiative declaring crime in D.C.An epidemic.

138
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,860
I'm familiar with the bill.

139
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,300
Makes additional federal funds available.

140
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,040
You target lifestyle crimes like prostitution and drug use,

141
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,260
and hopefully the overall crime rate drops.

142
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,910
Worked in new york.

143
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,680
It worked in L.A.It's worked here.

144
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,870
And in 4 days,I'm set to stand at the base of the capitol

145
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,710
and announce that petty crime in D.C.

146
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,230
Is down 43% and violent crime is down 37%.

147
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,650
The last thing I need is the press announcing that we have a serial killer murdering prostitutes.

148
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,070
I understand that.

149
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,290
But by not alerting the media,

150
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,920
we're putting women at risk.

151
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,630
I'm not asking you to back down.

152
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,450
Work your case.

153
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,100
Catch your killer.

154
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,940
Just do it quietly.

155
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,020
And if I don't?

156
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,860
I guarantee you won't work it at all.

157
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,500
Oh,a little unsolicited advice.

158
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,930
You're driven.You're bright.

159
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,660
You're exactly the kind of person who could run the bureau someday.

160
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,070
You might as well accept now

161
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,920
that leading the fbi has as much to do with politics

162
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,090
as it does with law enforcement.Good day.

163
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,170
This is impossible.

164
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,900
Says you.

165
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,650
There's nothing in the juvenile offender records.

166
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,840
So you think like a high school kid.

167
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,830
I was 12,and I hadn't been through puberty when I was in high school.

168
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,180
Ok,reset.

169
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,380
I think like a high school student.

170
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,970
You think like a profiler.

171
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,570
He said he was a junior,right?

172
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,220
Mm-hmm.

173
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,450
The first rule of the teen years,

174
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,240
when talking to an authority figure,always lie and say you're older.

175
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,700
He's probably a sophomore.

176
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,770
Ok.

177
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,690
His coat was lamb's wool,

178
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,290
but it didn't look vintage.

179
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,980
It   fit like it had been tailored for him.

180
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,790
That means money.

181
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,980
In D.C.,Money would mean private school.

182
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,930
Look at you go.

183
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,170
-Even a lie has to be within the depth of your own experience,right?
-Fair enough,fair enough.

184
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,920
Uh   I'm a junior at northwest high school.

185
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,230
Pull up the district that serves northwest high.

186
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,250
Are there any private schools within those boundaries?

187
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,630
Uh,3.

188
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,470
Do any of them offer elective courses at georgetown?

189
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,200
One.The morton school.

190
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,930
-Pull up the junior class.
-Ah!

191
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,750
Uh,sophomore class.

192
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,490
Ah,if I do say so myself.

193
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,750
Wait,wait.Stop.

194
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,640
Nathan harris.

195
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,640
We got him.

196
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,650
<font color=blue>I got a feelin' that you wanna come over </font>

197
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,080
<font color=yellow>The blade slices the whore's neck.</font>

198
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,020
<font color=blue>ooh ooh,ooh ooh ooh</font>

199
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,920
<font color=blue>I get you here …</font>

200
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,340
I'll be right there.

201
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,190
<font color=blue>Ooh ooh,ooh ooh ooh </font>

202
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,700
I'm jason gideon with the fbi. Dr. Reid.Agent morgan.

203
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,480
<font color=yellow>The whore falls.</font>

204
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,200
We're looking for your son nathan.

205
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,070
Why?

206
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,200
<font color=yellow>Bloody.Dead.</font>

207
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,790
We just wanna ask him some questions.

208
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,120
Well,not until you explain what's going on.

209
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,600
Uh,your son came to talk to me this morning about a murder case.

210
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,160
Why would nathan know anything about a murder?

211
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,890
No,mom,it's true.

212
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,510
I--I did talk to him.

213
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,820
I'm just 19 do you mind if I speak to him alone?****************不确定

214
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,090
-We'll stay out here,ma'am.
-O-ok.

215
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:26,000
<font color=blue>I'm just 19 ohh hoo hoo you know I-- </font>

216
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,230
I knew if you were really good,you'd find me.

217
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,890
Is that why you were waiting for me?

218
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,910
You--you wanted to get caught?

219
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,260
What do you mean,"get caught"?

220
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,450
Oh-- hey.

221
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,530
Stay right there and keep your hands where I can see them.

222
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,230
It's just the text for a graphic novel.

223
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,050
About killing prostitutes?

224
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,190
Yeah,jack the ripper.It's a famous case.

225
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,010
This isn't a game,kid.

226
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,380
I know.

227
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,920
You knew specific details about a murder that hasn't been publicized.

228
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,340
But I didn't kill her.

229
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,200
I just   I really wanted to.

230
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,300
Nathan,if you didn't do it,how'd you know the details of the murder?

231
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,300
'Cause I saw the body.

232
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,700
It was early.It was before school.

233
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,200
She--she was dressed in red.

234
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,160
She'd been stabbed a lot,and her hair was all chopped off.

235
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,340
Where was that?

236
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,370
In an alley off of "k" street.

237
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,270
They take men down there for sex.I see 'em do it all the time.

238
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,930
What were you doing down there?

239
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,150
I don't know.I just sort of

240
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,540
end up there sometimes,you know?

241
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,850
I--I stay out all night,and I just come back in the morning,

242
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,930
and if my mom's at work,I don't even bother coming home.

243
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,140
Thinking dark thoughts is a far cry from being a danger.

244
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,000
I know that.

245
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,650
I don't think anyone's personal demons would hold up to scrutiny.

246
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,610
Mine wouldn'T.Would yours?

247
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,870
No.

248
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,540
He's a good boy.

249
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,970
He's exceptionally bright.

250
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,000
He just lives in his head more than other kids.

251
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,500
So it's just the two of you?

252
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,610
His father died when he was 9.

253
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,950
How'd he handle that?

254
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,080
Well,emotionally it was grueling,

255
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,650
but we got through it together.

256
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,590
-And you're close.
-Hmm.

257
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,190
I'd say very.

258
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,620
Don't go misinterpreting that.

259
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,300
You teach at G.W.Medical school,you're also on call at the hospital?

260
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,070
2 weeks a month.

261
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,860
So nathan must have a lot of freedom.

262
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,550
I treat him like a man,because he's always handled his responsibility.

263
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,740
Why didn't you call the police?

264
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,310
I don't know.

265
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,940
Nathan,the prostitutes I talked to say you watch them.

266
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,890
I'd never touch them.

267
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,750
You fantasize about having sex with them?

268
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,250
No,I told you,I think about killing them.

269
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,600
Look,after the lecture,

270
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,070
I saw you at the metro stop a few times,

271
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,770
and I thought maybe you could help me.

272
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,240
How?

273
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,720
I don't know.I saw that body,

274
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,700
and I felt excited,and that really scared me.

275
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,190
Is it possible that you actually killed those prostitutes,

276
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,120
but you just don't want to admit it to yourself?

277
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,160
No.

278
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,630
Then why'd you run away from me?

279
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,490
'Cause I don't know,but I thought you'd say I was crazy and there was no way to stop it.

280
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,160
-Thank you.
-Sure.

281
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,870
Ma'am,we'd like to let the juvenile authorities hold him overnight so we can do a psychological evaluation.

282
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,960
I can't believe this is real.

283
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,480
Well,right now it's just an evaluation.

284
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,270
I'd encourage nathan to have a lawyer present.

285
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,780
I don't know what he's going through,

286
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,920
but the nathan I know is a sweet boy.

287
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,430
I believe you.

288
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,230
Do we have your permission?

289
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,280
I'll show you where to sign the paperwork.

290
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,250
The juvenile authorities are waiting for nathan harris.

291
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,300
He's in interrogation.

292
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,400
Is he our unsub?

293
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,570
I don't know.

294
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,730
He says he didn't do it.

295
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,370
He actually seems sincere.

296
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,220
But he's a smart kid,

297
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,120
and part of the sexual-sadist profile is the ability to mimic honesty and sincerity.

298
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,990
The police are here for you.

299
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,690
Dr. Reid.

300
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,340
Yeah?

301
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,070
I know I,um,don't deserve any favors,

302
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,220
but whatever my psych eval says,you promise you'll tell me the truth?

303
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,280
Um,my mom says a promise doesn't count unless you say it out loud.

304
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,020
I promise.

305
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,020
Ok.Thank you.

306
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,450
You know,he might have killed 2 women.

307
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,490
It's not your job to hold his hand through this.

308
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,170
It's like with my mom.

309
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,750
I used to think that if I could just understand

310
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,650
absolutely everything there is to know about schizophrenia,

311
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,720
then I'd somehow be able to fix it.

312
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,990
You can'T.I'm sorry.

313
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,850
Guys.I need everybody in the conference room.

314
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,650
If nathan harris isn't our unsub,we need a working profile.

315
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,310
D.C.Police sent us these photos of the first victim.

316
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,370
This was the unsub's first kill.

317
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,110
He held his urges in check for 3 months,

318
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,080
and when he couldn't control them any more,he sent this message to the cops.

319
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,480
We know the "help" and the hesitation marks mean he was ambivalent about the kill.

320
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,380
What we don't know is why he chopped the hair.

321
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,920
He didn't take it with him.

322
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,770
We know it's not a trophy.

323
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,990
It's probably a way to minimize some of their power,robs them of their femininity.

324
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,300
That fits with him killing during the early morning.

325
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,470
It's the time when prostitutes have the least power sexually,

326
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,630
as opposed to at night,when he might see them as being on the prowl.

327
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,060
Hey,I know we're just spitballing this here,

328
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,710
but this profile points to nathan harris.

329
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,480
I don't wanna talk about nathan harris.

330
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,380
Hotch,she is right.

331
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,810
He reached out for help.

332
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,720
This is an adolescent kid.

333
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,300
He's probably intimidated sexually.

334
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,190
I don't care how many times he says he didn't do it.

335
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,310
He knew about the last victim,and he admitted to getting off on seeing her dead.

336
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,340
We've got nathan harris.

337
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,040
It doesn't do us any good to talk about him now.

338
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,900
I just wanna make sure that if it's not him,

339
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,810
we stay on top of thing before it takes on a life of its own.

340
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,870
All right,all right,all right.

341
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,710
We know our unsub is a sexual sadist.

342
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,280
The symbolism of stabbing them probably means he's impotent.

343
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,050
The only way he can get off is by killing.

344
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,780
Considering that cutting their hair and killing during the

345
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,870
early morning both stem from feeling powerless,

346
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,130
there's a chance his pathology's more than sexual.

347
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,980
What do you mean?

348
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,450
This is D.C.Power's the most important commodity.

349
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,150
Maybe this guy feels impotent in his professional life as well.

350
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,510
But why these particular women?

351
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,630
Simplest answer is that he has access.

352
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,860
Well,northwest D.C.Has 3 major hubs of prostitution--

353
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,680
near florida avenue;

354
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,300
off logan circle;

355
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,260
and mcpherson square,where the victims were found.

356
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,870
Probably works in or around capitol hill.

357
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,050
Well,I'll go back out on the street in the morning

358
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,030
and see if any of these women know someone who fits that description.

359
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,020
Good.

360
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,790
It's late.Let's go home.

361
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,010
Um,shouldn't we get word out to the papers?

362
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,960
Not yet.

363
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,280
Well,it's not too late to make the morning edition.

364
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,540
I said no.

365
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,080
Hey!

366
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,930
You seen little holly?

367

380
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,450
Does he have to be here?

381
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,610
It's for your own protection.

382
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,750
He's here to make sure we're not talking about the case,just about you.

383
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,380
So I don't wet the bed or start fires.

384
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,150
Heh.

385
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,810
I see you've read dr.Harris' warning signs of psychopathy.

386
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,200
Yeah.Is that wrong?

387
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,360
No,it's healthy.

388
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,980
You're intellectually curious.

389
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,020
You wanna understand how you're feeling.

390
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,020
So you don't wet the bed or start fires.

391
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,180
Tell me what worries you.

392
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,670
I've just been,um

393
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,380
thinking about stuff.

394
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,850
About hurting women?

395
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,350
Yeah.

396
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,020
Have you ever hurt anyone?

397
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,580
I killed a bird once.

398
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,220
I know that's on the list.It's one of the signs.

399
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,480
Why'd you kill the bird?

400
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,870
'Cause I was sad.

401
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,030
How'd you feel afterwards?

402
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,730
Better.

403
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,060
Why?

404
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,480
I don't know,'cause

405
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,170
it was dead,and I was still alive.

406
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,230
Is that why you wanna hurt women,to feel better?

407
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,020
I don't know.

408
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,260
Have you ever seen a woman naked?

409
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,830
Don't worry about him.

410
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,520
No offense.

411
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,260
None taken.

412
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,010
Um   a few years ago.

413
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,810
My mom's med school,her students get cadavers.

414
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,090
So how'd that make you feel?

415
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,550
Good.

416
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,590
Excited.

417
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,750
And sick.

418
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,080
Perfectly natural,boy to feel excited,he sees a naked body,even a cadaver.

419
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,170
Yeah,but now that's the only part that I think about.

420
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,140
Which part?

421
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,460
Them being dead.

422
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,900
So when you watch the prostitutes,you don't imagine having sex with them?

423
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,620
No,I think about cutting them.

424
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,360
Why?

425
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,790
I don't know,maybe to look inside.

426
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,840
Or sometimes I think about

427
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,180
feeling their blood in my hands and feeling it flow through my fingers.

428
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,260
Does that ever make you climax,

429
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,300
just by thinking of that?

430
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,150
I know I'm crazy.

431
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,340
Did I say that?

432
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,150
No,but

433
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,760
what do you call pictures in your head that you can't make go away?

1
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,400
Can I talk to you?

2
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,640
Stay here.I'll be right back.

3
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,520
It's my opinion that nathan should be hospitalized.

4
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,220
What?

5
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,230
I think he needs full-time medical attention.

6
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,370
I'm a doctor.

7
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,780
He's having homicidal fantasies that are directly linked to his sexual impulses and release.

8
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,000
Well, he came to your agent.

9
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,790
That shows that he's concerned.

10
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,450
In his heart, he doesn't want to hurt anyone.

11
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,200
Positive sign, but intelligence and awareness don't always allow us to control our urges.

12
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,980
Admitting the problem doesn't mean you can manage it.

13
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,850
If I put him in a hospital, I'd be telling him that he's a monster.

14
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,640
No, no, no, no, no.

15
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,000
He's just-- right now he's sick, and he needs help.

16
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,950
No.

17
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,780
If an alcoholic cannot control his impulses, ma'am, he drinks.

18
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,690
You need to consider what happens with someone fighting psychotic urges.

19
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,680
I'm not naive.

20
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,320
I'm not gonna turn a blind eye, but I have to protect my son.

21
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,920
He needs to be with professionals.

22
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,760
I have access to the best in washington.

23
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,280
I'll make sure that he sees someone every single day, but I am not gonna lock him away.

24
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,750
Have a seat.

25
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,530
I don't appreciate being questioned in front of other agents.

26
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,790
It was not my intention.

27
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,070
I'm sorry.

28
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,450
What were you talking to congresswoman steyer about the other day?

29
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,240
She stopped by to say hello.

30
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,210
She worked with my mother, so I've known her since I was a kid.

31
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,760
Did you tip her off about this case?

32
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,400
No.

33
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,880
This team can't function if I don't trust the people on it.

34
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,340
Sir, if I touched a nerve out there today, I'm sorry, but I don't deserve this.

35
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,140
You mysteriously showed up at the bau after one of my team members was involved in a questionable shooting.

36
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,760
Right.

37
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,610
You've done good work.

38
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,420
I'm not questioning that.

39
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,890
But I will not put up with a political agenda.

40
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,030
My mother's a career politician.

41
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,090
You worked with her.

42
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,690
Did you like her?

43
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,350
She's an impressive women.

44
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Well, I think politics makes people distrustful.

45
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,410
I think it makes them hate themselves.

46
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:24,630
I think it tears families apart and damages people.

47
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,440
So if there's nothing else,

48
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,890
I would like to get back out on the street and find out who's killing these women.

49
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,860
Sir.

50
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,220
Have you reached a conclusion about nathan harris yet?

51
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,310
Profiles and evaluations are an inexact science.

52
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,390
But your professional opinion?

53
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,620
Not a question of whether he ends up killing someone.

54
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,600
It's when.

55
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,110
Nathan.

56
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,780
Nathan, honey.

57
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,370
Nathan.

58
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,430
Oh, my god.

59
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,100
He's gotta be out here, right?

60
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,980
Where else would he be?

61
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,480
I still can't believe his mother's not out here searching for him.

62
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,710
I told her it'd be better if she waited for him at home.

63
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,360
Reid, you know this is not your responsibility.

64
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,830
It is.

65
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,680
I can't explaiN.

66
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,220
Well, try me.

67
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,770
He knows I understand him.

68
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,350
Of course you do.

69
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,430
You're a profiler.

70
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,890
It's more than that.

71
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,350
How?

72
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,560
I know what it's like to be afraid of your own mind.

73
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,070
What's up with hotch today?

74
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,860
I don't know.

75
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,640
Maybe he tied that knot in his tie a little too tight again.

76
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,570
Yeah.

77
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,050
Ok.

78
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,460
We're on our way.

79
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,740
They just found a body.

80
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,770
I'd say he's getting bolder.

81
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,720
If it's the same unsub.

82
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,960
Think it could've been nathan?

83
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,100
This kill was fast and messy.

84
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,420
There's no cut hair, no message carved.

85
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,250
Not to mention killing at night.

86
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,910
None of it's our unsub's signature.

87
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,370
Excuse me, agent.

88
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,170
They found the boy you're looking for.

89
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,990
Says he's beenere 4 hours.

90
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,010
Got a lot of people worried.

91
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,900
Sorry.

92
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,260
Told that policeman that you've been here 4 hours?

93
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,830
I snuck out, and I started walking, like I couldn't control it,

94
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,940
so I figured I'd come here and try and fight it.

95
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,080
Has anybody seen you here?

96
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,640
Doesn't matter, anyway.

97
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,840
It does matter, nathan.

98
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,190
A woman was stabbed tonight, and nobody saw you.

99
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,070
I'm gonna have to bring you in as a suspect.

100
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,000
You gonna cuff me?

101
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,620
Let's go.

102
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,040
Do you wanna know what I've been doing all night?

103
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,710
Hmm?

104
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,970
Just been sitting here, thinking 

105
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:37,360
the only way for me to save people's lives in the future is to kill myself.

106
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,930
So nathan's in custody?

107
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,480
They're holding him downtown.

108
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,500
You really think he killed that last woman?

109
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,910
It's possible.

110
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,950
But nathan's evolving.

111
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,930
This last kill, it feels like a devolution.

112
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,240
It was sloppy and angry.

113
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,420
Nathan's smart and directed.

114
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,450
He's used to achieving.

115
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,880
If he decides to kill, it'll be clinical and efficient.

116
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,000
So where does that leave us?

117
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,870
Back to the profile.

118
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,300
First victim, he gets a taste for killing.

119
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,790
Second, he asks the police to help stop him.

120
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,850
By the third, he feels like they've failed him.

121
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,570
He's already devolving.

122
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,400
The fourth, no ritual, no message, just a brutal murder.

123
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,940
It's true that he's devolving, but this last victim definitely had a message.

124
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,690
You don't dump a body across from the capitol building by accident.

125
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,890
Especially not when a congresswoman is about to proclaim success against the crime epidemic.

126
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,550
Exactly.

127
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,610
Guys, that press conference wasn't announced yet.

128
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,620
Only someone with inside information would know that.

129
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,160
We profiled the unsub felt limited in his job.

130
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,900
What's more powerless than being a bit player on the washington stage?

131
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,790
You know, if he felt like he did his part to clear the prostitutes off the street, but was never heard, 

132
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,530
he might have felt so personally betrayed that he literally had to carve his frustration out on those women.

133
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,460
So the profile was right.

134
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,980
We were just wrong about who the message was for.

135
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,030
We need to get a list of anyone who advocated on behalf of that bill.

136
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:56,010
Prentiss, when you went back to talto the prostitutes, did a profile ring a bell with any of them?

137
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:01,140
A few of them described what sounded like the same man, but when I showed them mug shots, I came up empty.

138
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,490
Let's go bk to them.We're gonna need their help.

139
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,710
What are you thinking about, hotch?

140
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,820
I need to get a message to congresswoman steyer.

141
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,640
How quickly can we put together a press conference?

142
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,940
How fast do you need it?

143
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,860
May I have your attention, please?

144
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,720
A day from now, there will be an announcement across the street on the steps of the capitol 

145
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,310
that crime is down significantly in washington.

146
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,630
This is a fact.

147
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:27,170
It is also a fact however, that there's a serial killer who's been targeting the prostitutes who work in this area.

148
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,730
In fact, the last victim was fod not a hundred yards from where we're standing.

149
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,570
We're here today to let you know that the police and the fbi are working tirelessly on this case.

150
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:41,910
We'd like to stress to the women who work on these streets to please take caution.

151
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:47,300
All right, first I'm gonna give a brief description of the man we're looking for, and then we'll take some questions.

152
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:52,640
We believe the man responsible for these crimes works on or around capitol hill, 

153
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,830
possibly at a research or advocacy group dealing with issues of crime control or prevention.

154
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,210
The lower the group is on the washington food chain, the better.

155
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:06,450
This guy, he feels like his voice isn't being heard, and make sure to check for any advocacy groups promoting morality or values.

156
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,400
Ok, reality check.

157
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,530
What you're looking for--needle.

158
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,930
This--haystack.

159
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,910
Garcia, we don't have to find it.

160
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,350
We just need to get to the people who can.

161
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,800
Ok.

162
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,520
You could've done that much more quietly.

163
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,360
I know.

164
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,530
There's some people I'd like for you to meet.

165
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,020
Right this way.

166
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,770
Just what point are you trying to make?

167
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,370
These women described similar experiences with the same man.

168
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,910
We showed them police mug photos, and they didn't recognize him.

169
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,900
We thought maybe you might know who he is.

170
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,740
Did you think you could shock me by treating me to this sideshow?

171
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,320
Sideshow?

172
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,570
Lady, enough of the men you work with treat themselves to us every day.

173
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,230
My apologies, ladies.

174
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,840
Could you please tell the congresswoman who it is we're looking for.

175
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,450
He's tall and bald, and he's got sad eyes.

176
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,260
He was always wearing a turtleneck with this long, dark coat, looked like a morticiaN.

177
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,940
That's right.

178
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,490
Hung around just watching for months before he finally got his nerve on, but then he just wanted to watch.

179
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,480
Freak paid me and racine 200 bucks to turn each other's knobs,

180
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,920
but then he started screaming at us that we were low women.

181
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,140
Same thing with me, and his voice got real high and nasal when he got excited.

182
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,800
Does that sound like anyone that you know?

183
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,040
No.

184
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,160
I'm gonna read you a list of groups that lobbied on behalf of your legislation.

185
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,780
Keeping in mind the description you just heard,

186
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,140
tell me if anyone associated with these groups could be the man we're looking for.

187
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,470
Uh, "the crime policy institute, "the center for safety,

188
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:43,050
citizens' brigade, decency watch

189
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,420
oh, my god.

190
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,850
Decency watch?

191
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,990
The man who runs it.

192
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,030
Ronald weems.

193
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,820
Do you know him?

194
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,510
No.

195
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,350
I mean, yes, but he's a nobody.

196
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,180
But he fits this description?

197
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,470
Perfectly.

198
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,720
I need to get back to work.

199
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,300
Again?

200
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,310
Yes, again.

201
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,190
Can't be helped.

202
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,160
We're looking for ronald weems.

203
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,270
I-I'm sorry.

204
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,580
You just missed him.

205
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,850
Why don't you come back in a couple hours?

206
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,300
Don't you wanna know why we're here?

207
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,920
Of course.

208
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,600
Yes.I'm sorry.

209
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,210
We're investigating the murders of local prostitutes.

210
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:13,660
I-I'm glad that ronald is helping you with that, but I'm afraid I don't know anything about it.

211
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,810
We'd just like to take a look in your husband's office.

212
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,640
Please?

213
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,220
Ronald doesn't allow anyone in there.

214
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,100
I'm sorry.

215
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,710
You really should come back.

216
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:28,090
In the last 6 months did your husband start asking you to play out sexual fantasies?

217
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,200
Excuse me?

218
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,720
Possibly even berated you if you played along?

219
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,150
I don't think that's appropriate.

220
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:38,100
When it finally stopped about a month ago, you were relieved.

221
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,450
Ma'am, you're afraid to ask us why we're here.

222
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:44,450
Now, in your heart, you know we're not here because ronald's helping us with this investigation.

223
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,460
Good night.

224
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,670
You've been glad to have him leave the house at odd hours, because he's been angry and frustrated.

225
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,740
When he comes home, he feels like the man you married again.

226
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,930
His office.

227
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,670
Please.

228
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,610
"Why won't they clean them off the street?

229
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,290
"The blood is on their hands.

230
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,860
"I see a world set free of vice and vermin, cleansed of the blood of the whores who walk the street.

231
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,460
"Do you know where your husband went?

232
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,610
 He said he had work to do.

233
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,330
hey, you ever seen this guy, huh, out here doing business?

234
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,840
 Can you tell me if you've seen this man?

235
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,960
 Ma'am, you ever seen this face?

236
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,600
 No?

237
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,860
 Never? Out here talking to the ladies?

238
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,840
 Sorry.

239
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:06,970
 You seen this guy?

240
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,870
 You sure?

241
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,290
 I ain't seen him.

242
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,000
 Thank you.

243
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,820
 Thanks.

244
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,620
 My man, you ever seen this cat out here doing business?

245
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,360
 Excuse me.

246
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,830
 You ever seen this man before?

247
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,150
 Nothing?

248
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,450
 No. You?

249
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,060
 Seen him?

250
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,700
 You didn't even look.

251
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,830
 Do you know this man?

252
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,930
 Thank you.

253
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,780
 He's gotta be out here somewhere.

254
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,120
 How much?

255
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,670
 Hey, where you going?

256
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,990
 Don't run away from me.

257
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,700
Ronald weems, don't move!

258
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,640
 Put your hands in the air and get down on your knees.

259
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,740
 They lied to me.

260
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,360
Get her out of here!

261
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,590
 On the ground!

262
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,050
 He killed my friend!

263
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,380
I know. Stop it!

264
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,180
 She maced me.

265
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,040
 Yeah, she did.

266
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,090
 They said they'd clean 'em off the streets.

267
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,310
 They lied.

268
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,360
 What was I supposed to do?!

269
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,300
 Hey.

270
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:49,740
 Hi.

271
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,670
 I heard the juvenile authorities let you go today.

272
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,330
 I'm sorry I wasn't there.

273
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,170
 Mm, it's all right.

274
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,800
 Where's your mom?

275
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,440
 Oh, she had to go back to work.

276
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,610
 I told her I was coming to see you.

277
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,880
 So were you there when they caught him?

278
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,260
 Yeah, I was.

279
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,910
 Did he say how long he knew what he was?

280
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,150
 No.

281
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,250
 Well, do you think it's possible to maybe talk to him or 

282
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,070
 I'm sorry.You're not him.

283
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,420
 Who we are is--it's constantly evolving.

284
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,810
 I'm a lot older than you, and I'm changing all the time.

285
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,870
 You know, this-- this job changes me.

286
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,900
 You've changed me.

287
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,870
 You sought me out to try to understand how not to harm people.

288
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,130
 It's a far more important part of who you are than the one that scares you.

289
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,560
 My mom wants to have me go to a hospital for a little bit.

290
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,710
 Maybe that's not such a bad idea.

291
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,480
 You know, once they lock me up, they're never gonna let me out of there.

292
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,660
 You don't know that.

293
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,730
 Whatever.

294
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,240
 I just came to say good-bye.

295
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,680
 When you going in?

296
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,500
 Supposed to be tomorrow.

297
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,560
 So, last night of freedom.

298
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,270
 I don't know.

299
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,550
 I'm-- thank you for caring.

300
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:35,600
T.S. Eliot wrote between the desire and the spasm, ""between the potency and the existence,"

301
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,750
between the essence and the descent, falls the shadow.

302
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,360
This is the way the world ends.

303
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,220
"You looking for a date?

304
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,340
 Suit yourselF.

305
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,140
 You scared me.

306
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,170
 I'm actually looking for a date.

307
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,130
 Come on.

308
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:59,240
 Come on, you and me, we're hitting the town.

309
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:06,810
 No offense, garcia, but I'm not really feeling like I'd make the, uh, best company right now.

310
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,670
 Oh, no.

311
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,620
 Up.

312
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,750
 Up.

313
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,740
 Do not make me hurt you.

314
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,890
 There you go.

315
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,730
 There you go.

316
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,060
 Just relax.

317
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,070
 Don't you wanna feel me?

318
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,860
 See?

319
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,640
 There.

320
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,150
 How does that make you feel?

321
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,470
 I don't know.

322
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,970
 Yes, you do.

323
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,100
 I don't know.

324
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,690
 It's-- it's not right.

325
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,930
 It's ok, baby.

326
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,750
 You're just nervous.

327
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,670
 There you go.

328
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,360
 It's not working.

329
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,880
 Everything's gonna work just fine.

330
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,470
 Don't laugh at me.

331
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,510
 Nobody's laughing.

332
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,730
 Let me help you.

333
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,270
 Don't touch me.

334
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,610
 You're just a whore.

335
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,870
 You have no idea what I could do to you!

336
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,800
 How 'bout we both just walk away?

337
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,820
 No charge.

338
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,250
 No.

339
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,520
 You don't wanna do this.

340
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,470
 I have to.

341
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,210
 Have you met esther?

342
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,660
 You like?

343
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,850
 Only 150,000 miles on her.

344
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,560
Hello.

345
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,490
 Hey.

346
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,790
 What?

347
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,570
 Oh, god.

348
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,730
 Uh, uh, stay-- stay where you are.

349
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,820
 I'm calling an ambulance.

350
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,840
 I--I need you to drive, garcia.

351
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,910
 Yeah, yeah.

352
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,670
He just started slashing himself up.

353
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,770
 Oh, dear lord.

354
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,450
 All right, give me your scarf.

355
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,820
 Tie it around there as tight as you can.

356
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,510
 Get--get anything at all, a belt.

357
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,680
 Tie it!

358
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,420
 Is it tight?

359
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,460
 Is it tight?

360
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,240
 I think so.

361
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,880
 The paramedics stop.

362
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,660
 Don'T.

363
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,780
 I'm gonna keep pressure on him.

364
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,490
 No.

365
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,360
 Where the hell are the medics?!

366
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,970
 I don't know.

367
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,240
 Is it tight?

368
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,310
 I don't know. I think so.

369
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,460
 Don'T.

370
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,880
 I'm not gonna let you die.

371
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,230
 No.

372
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,800
 Where are the medics?

373
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,430
 You can let go now.

374
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,150
 Sir.

375
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,210
Reid.

376
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,610
 Sir.

377
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,800
 Sir, we're paramedicS.

378
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,480
 We're here to help you.

379
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,700
 Can you tell me your name, sir?

380
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,740
 How did she know to call reid?

381
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:53,170
 Nathan set reid's business card on the table before he cut himself, like a suicide note.

382
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
 Paramedics say he wouldn't've made it without you.

383
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,980
 You saved his life.

384
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,860
 He wanted me to let him die.

385
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,260
 He's sick.

386
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,770
 He needed saving.

387
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,680
How many people's lives did I risk in the future?

388
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,920
 Profiles can be wrong.

389
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,780
 What if it's not?

390
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,900
 What if next time, he kills somebody?

391
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:30,940
 Then you catch him.
