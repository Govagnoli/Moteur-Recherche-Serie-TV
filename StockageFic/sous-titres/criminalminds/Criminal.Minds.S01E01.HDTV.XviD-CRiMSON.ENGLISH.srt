1
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:04,503
Hi. I'm Heather.

2
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,904
That's a 2.4 liter
6 cylinder engine.

3
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:14,505
I can't teach you
how to drive cars.

4
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:16,020
That's right.

5
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:17,921
Wanna take a look under the hood?

6
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:19,021
Yeah!

7
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:22,003
You know your Z. I'm impressed.

8
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,684
You should have your
mechanic check it out anyway.

9
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,054
How about I leave you my
number and we can set it up?

10
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:28,199
Thank you.

11
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:45,415
So it's just... right up here.

12
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:51,676
Oh! That was-- ha ha...
Hello! There was the right.

13
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:56,867
Uh, maybe just... pull over here,
and we can try and do a U-turn.

14
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,160
What are you doing?

15
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:11,983
Okay.

16
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,449
Stop the car now.

17
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:18,962
Pull over now!

18
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,992
How about Andrew?
It's greek for valiant.

19
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:45,049
Let's call him... Sergio.

20
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,940
Ha ha! Please tell me you're kidding.

21
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:49,576
- Butch?
- How about Donald?

22
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:52,740
- Hans.
- No! Wait, wait. Um...

23
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:57,071
- Okay. Gideon.
- Not a chance.

24
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:59,332
It's hebrew. Look what it means.

25
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,033
It's perfect. Gideon Hotchner.

26
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:02,837
- No.
- Yes.

27
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:04,676
- No.
- Gideon.

28
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:20,552
1940's. He put bombs in train
stations and movie theaters.

29
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:22,896
- Uh, the mad bomber. George Metesky.
- Nice.

30
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:25,397
The winners sit. Losers, drink.

31
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:26,146
Cheers.

32
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:30,247
Hold on. Metesky wasn't a serial killer.
None of his bombs ever killed anyone.

33
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:32,471
Well, you think all we do is
serial killers? Trust me...

34
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:34,572
we cover the whole spectrum of psychos.

35
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:38,363
We profiled the D.C. sniper, the
unabomber. We do terrorists, arsonists--

36
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:41,024
Supervisory agents trying
to get trainees drunk?

37
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:43,553
Excuse me.

38
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:49,495
Wow. Behavioral Analysis Unit.
You work with Gideon?

39
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,370
Were you with him in Boston?

40
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:54,596
I was supposed to be.

41
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:56,941
Yeah. This is Morgan.

42
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,305
Anyone recognize these faces?

43
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:03,906
Victims of the footpath killer.

44
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:05,877
That's what Virginia
newspapers are calling him.

45
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,478
We refer to him as the
unknown subject or unsub.

46
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:12,525
I told Virginia P.D...

47
00:04:12,526 --> 00:04:15,726
We're looking for a
white male in his 20's...

48
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:18,902
who owns an american-made
truck in disrepair.

49
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:21,103
Works a menial job.

50
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:24,046
I told 'em
when you find him...

51
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:27,798
don't be surprised to hear him
speak with a severe stutter.

52
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:31,493
Not to sound skeptical,
but come on... a stutter?

53
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,442
Where'd the murders occur?

54
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:38,155
Hiking paths. Isolated.

55
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:42,129
If I'm a killer who has to use an
immediate application of overpowering force,

56
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,730
even out in the middle of nowhere,

57
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,692
I lack confidence.

58
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:49,493
I can't charm them into
my car like Ted Bundy did.

59
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:53,993
I can't because I am
ashamed of something.

60
00:04:58,557 --> 00:04:59,372
Excuse me.

61
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:02,389
They're calling him the Seattle
strangler. 4 victims in 4 months.

62
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,690
He keeps 'em alive 7 days.
The handle serves as a crank.

63
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:08,291
Allowing him to control
the rate of suffocation.

64
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:10,193
- To prolong it?
- To enjoy it.

65
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:11,640
Seattle's hit a wall?

66
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:13,941
Physical evidence is nonexistent.
There are no tangible leads.

67
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:15,551
And another girl is missing.

68
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:21,791
I looked the case file over. I'll
get some thoughts to you asap.

69
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:24,167
You're gonna be with us in Seattle asap.

70
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:32,075
22-year-old Heather Woodland.

71
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:36,773
Before she left for lunch, she downloaded
an email with a time-delayed virus attached.

72
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:40,164
The killer's virus wiped her hard
drive and left this on the screen.

73
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:54,339
"For heaven's sake, catch me before
I kill more. I cannot control myself."

74
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:00,343
He never keeps them
for more than 7 days,

75
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,944
which means we have fewer
than 36 hours to find her.

76
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:05,716
They want you back in the saddle.

77
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,327
You ready?

78
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,937
Looks like medical leave's over, boss.

79
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:11,216
They sure they want me?

80
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:13,870
The order came from the director.

81
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,538
Well, we'd better get started.

82
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:30,842
Joseph Conrad said,

83
00:06:30,877 --> 00:06:34,495
"the belief in a supernatural
source of evil is not necessary.

84
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:38,196
Men alone are quite
capable of every wickedness."

85
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:43,632
This  girl may only
have 36 hours to live.

86
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,633
We're not asking for
a judgment of Gideon.

87
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,054
We want an assessment.

88
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:49,255
We want to know you're there
to step in if he can't perform.

89
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:50,356
Are we clear?

90
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:53,057
Of course.

91
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:01,272
His first victim was
26-year-old Melissa Kirsh.

92
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:04,382
- Stab wounds, strangulation.
- Wait, wait. Back up. Back up.

93
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,674
He stabbed her...

94
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:08,175
- and then strangled her to finish her off?
- Other way around.

95
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:10,766
Why do you think he started using
the belt with the second murder?

96
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:13,708
Strangulation with your bare hands
is not as easy as one would believe.

97
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,757
He tried, probably
found that it took too long...

98
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,158
So he stabbed her instead.

99
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,464
And realized it would be
hours cleaning up the blood.

100
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:22,427
Next time, our boy's
got a method-- the belt.

101
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:25,780
He's learning,
perfecting his scenario.

102
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:28,481
Becoming a better killer.

103
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:38,914
What did I tell
you about the tape?

104
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:48,012
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

105
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,578
He never stands with his back to a window.

106
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,973
When I was between him and a
doorway, he asked me to move.

107
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:30,033
That's hyper vigilance. It's not uncommon
in post traumatic stress disorder.

108
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:31,971
Just how much disorder
are we talking about?

109
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:35,099
Morgan, it's been 6 months. Everything's ok.

110
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,888
This is special agent Gideon,

111
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,489
special agent Morgan,
our expert on obsessional crimes,

112
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,490
special agent Reid.

113
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:41,691
Dr. Reid.

114
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:43,692
Dr. Reid, our expert on...

115
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:46,693
well, everything. And after 2 years
busting my butt in this office,

116
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:47,994
i hope you all remember me.

117
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,929
He's willing to travel with the body.

118
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,946
Then he drives a vehicle
capable of concealing one.

119
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:56,256
1 in 7.4 drivers in Seattle owns an SUV.

120
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:59,257
- Explorer with tinted windows.
- Explorers rate higher with women.

121
00:08:59,258 --> 00:09:02,932
But how do we know it's his car?
Ted Bundy drove a VW Bug.

122
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,604
- What about a Jeep Cherokee?
- Jeep's are more masculine.

123
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:08,951
We all know how an unsub feels
about asserting his masculinity.

124
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:10,854
When did the bureau
become involved in the case?

125
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:14,263
After  the fourth body.
He dumped that one out of state.

126
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:14,904
On purpose.

127
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:17,805
If so, knowledge of law enforcement
does suggest a criminal record.

128
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:20,444
Or that he watches television. May I?

129
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:22,110
So you wanna see our suspect list?

130
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,693
No, we won't look at a suspect list
until after we come up with a profile.

131
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:26,194
It keeps our
perspective unbiased.

132
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:29,432
- When do we sit down with your task force?
- 4:00.

133
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:34,008
- An accurate profile by 4:00 today?
- That's not a problem.

134
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:37,658
Agent Gideon, where would you like to start?

135
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:42,960
Let's start at the site of the last murder.

136
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:52,196
- So that's Gideon?
- The Gideon.

137
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:55,512
The one who caught that
guy, Adrian Baal, in Boston.

138
00:09:56,544 --> 00:10:01,336
Yep. That's him. But
catching him cost us 6 agents.

139
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:22,298
22-year-old Anne Cushing
was found right here.

140
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,646
Nails clipped just like the others.

141
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:27,547
He wants them to fight back.

142
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:29,636
But not enough to hurt him.

143
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:31,437
And he left the belt around her neck.

144
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:34,465
He's probably in his early 20's.

145
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:36,666
What's your reasoning?

146
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:39,207
Youthful arrogance.

147
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,468
He clothed the body before dumping it.

148
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:47,076
That's a sign of remorse.

149
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:49,588
It's not consistent. Look where we are.

150
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,821
His opinion of women is
pretty clear, don't you think?

151
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:53,022
They're disposable.

152
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:57,917
Why show remorse by taking the time
to dress her but then dump her here?

153
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:05,670
- Sandy, no, no, no. I'm so sorry.
- No, it's ok.

154
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:07,271
It's what we call the Reid effect.

155
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:08,863
Happens with children, too.

156
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:10,864
I'm agent Hotchner. This
is special agent Dr. Reid.

157
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:12,629
You look too young to have
gone to medical school.

158
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,530
They're PhD's. 3 of them.

159
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,324
Are you a genius or something?

160
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:18,625
I don't believe that intelligence
can be accurately quantified--

161
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:23,652
but I do have an I.Q. of 187 and an eidetic
memory and can read 20,000 words per minute.

162
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:27,379
Yes, I'm a genius.

163
00:11:28,202 --> 00:11:30,049
Sandy, you get a lot
of attention, don't you?

164
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,950
Yeah, Heather loves this dog.

165
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,049
I feed her when Heather's
away. Usually, she's fine, but...

166
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,895
lately, she won't eat. It's almost
like she can sense something's wrong.

167
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:39,927
Not sense. Smell.

168
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:45,028
Our apocrine sweat gland releases
secretions in response to emotional stress.

169
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:46,160
Sandy's worried because
she knows you are.

170
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,328
David, does your sister
drive a Datsun Z?

171
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:53,028
No, but she's in the market
for one. How'd you know?

172
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:56,988
Come on, Sandy.

173
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:05,395
There's an immediate relationship established
between a buyer and a seller, a level of trust.

174
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:07,767
If  I want to coax a
young woman into my car...

175
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:09,763
offer her a test drive.

176
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:14,502
Okay, then how about the fact that on
one hand, we have paranoid psychosis...

177
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:16,323
but the autopsy protocol says what?

178
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:20,640
Adhesive reside shows he put layer after
layer of duct tape over his victims' eyes.

179
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:23,859
He knows he wants to kill them,
but he still covers their eyes.

180
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,695
He doesn't want 'em
looking at him, apparently.

181
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay, but then he takes the body and dumps it
right out in the open, murder weapon nearby.

182
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,811
Not the M.O. of a paranoid convinced
he's being watched or surveilled.

183
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:35,315
Paranoid psychosis, but
behavior that's not paranoid.

184
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,796
All right, enough.

185
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:47,797
Let's tell them we're ready.

186
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,265
We're ready?

187
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,470
Reid. You're good with this?

188
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:02,853
We've got a woman who's only
got a few hours left to live,

189
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:06,047
an incomplete profile, and a unit chief
on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

190
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:08,042
They don't call them
nervous breakdowns anymore.

191
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:12,641
- It's called a major depressive episode.
- I know, Reid.

192
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:20,882
The unidentified subject is
white and in his late 20's.

193
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,883
He's someone you wouldn't notice at first.

194
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:25,195
He's someone who'd
blend into any crowd.

195
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:31,237
The violent nature of the crime
suggests a previous criminal record--

196
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:34,338
petty crimes. Maybe auto theft.

197
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:38,195
We've classified him as an
organized killer-- careful.

198
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:40,237
Psychopathic as opposed to psychotic.

199
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:44,038
He follows the news, has
good hygiene. He's smart.

200
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:48,184
'Cause he's smart, the only physical evidence
you'll find is what he wants you to find.

201
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:53,408
He's mobile, car in good condition.
Our guess-- Jeep Cherokee, tinted windows.

202
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:55,339
The murders have all involved rapes.

203
00:13:56,364 --> 00:13:59,481
But rape without penetration
is a form of piquerism,

204
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:01,782
and that tells us
he's sexually inadequate.

205
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:06,282
Psychiatric evaluations will
show a history of paranoia

206
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:07,983
stemming from a
childhood trauma--

207
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,892
death of a parent
or family member.

208
00:14:14,322 --> 00:14:17,308
And now he feels persecuted and watched.

209
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,385
Murder gives him a sense of power.

210
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:27,410
Organized killers have a
fascination with law enforcement.

211
00:14:27,683 --> 00:14:31,441
They will inject themselves
into the investigation.

212
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:37,582
They will even come forward as witnesses
to see just how much the police really know.

213
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:41,879
That makes them feel powerful, in control.

214
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:44,958
Which is why I also think...

215
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:51,012
in fact, I know... you have
already interviewed him.

216
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:07,467
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.

217
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:11,893
I'm house-sitting down the street,
and when I got back, the door was wide open,

218
00:15:11,884 --> 00:15:13,493
and the lights
weren't working.

219
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:18,529
I feel stupid asking this, but is there someone
who might be able to take a look inside with me?

220
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:24,193
Richard. Richard,
get down here!

221
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,997
- Are you sure you locked it?
- Yeah.

222
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,902
Hello?

223
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:01,044
- Hello!
- FBI! Freeze! Freeze! Get him down!

224
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:07,428
Richard Slessman, FBI.
You are under arrest for the murder...

225
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:14,744
Emerson said,

226
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:18,045
"all  is riddle, and
the key to a riddle...

227
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:20,146
is another riddle."

228
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:26,318
There's no sign of the girl here. We
can arrest him with probable cause,

229
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,819
but we won't be able to hold him.

230
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:30,362
Slessman's been at the
top of the suspect list.

231
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,192
Is that the mother?

232
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:35,193
Grandmother. The mother died
in a fire when he was 13.

233
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,440
Probably not the
only fire in his childhood.

234
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,134
Before his Son of Sam murders,
David Berkowitz set a multitude of fires.

235
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:42,577
Exactly how much is a multitude?

236
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:46,342
- According to his diary, 1,400 and...
- 88.

237
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:49,359
Luring him out was your
idea, right? Greenway?

238
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,386
Elle. I don't send a SWAT team
into a house with children.

239
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,571
Hotch says your background
is in sex offender cases.

240
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:55,572
What can you tell us?

241
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:59,301
The last 4 murders show he's
an anger-excitation rapist.

242
00:16:59,302 --> 00:17:01,267
He'll keep a victim for a couple of days.

243
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:05,844
He probably records or videotapes them
so that he can keep reliving the fantasy.

244
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:07,644
You ok with Hotch
being in on the interview?

245
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:12,109
- I'd like him to lead, actually.
- Fine. But hold off.

246
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,690
Slessman's done time,
and he knows the process.

247
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:17,465
And all you will get now
is a demand for a lawyer.

248
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:21,104
Hotch, let's check the garage,
then show me what you got.

249
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,770
Next time, show a little leg.

250
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:30,219
Morgan, the only time you're gonna see a little
leg from me is when I'm about to kick your ass.

251
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:33,886
I still teach hand-to-hand over at Quantico
if you need a little brush-up training.

252
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,615
Seriously... I want that opening at BAU.

253
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:41,883
- You got any advice?
- Just trust your instincts.

254
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,816
Well, we got the jeep right.
And everything else wrong.

255
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:55,083
The bodies had defensive wounds.
Richard doesn't have a mark on him.

256
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,101
We're missin' something.

257
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:14,293
Something's not right about this.

258
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:21,265
This is a boy's room... not a man's.

259
00:18:33,214 --> 00:18:34,722
Log in password.

260
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,062
No, no-- wait, wait!

261
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,369
- It's not turning back on.
- Yeah. And it won't.

262
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:48,190
It was a false password.

263
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:06,879
- What kind of game is it?
- In China, it's called wei-chi.

264
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,781
Here we call it "go". It's considered to be
the most difficult board game ever conceived.

265
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,267
Chairman Mao required
his generals to learn it.

266
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:15,671
It also looks like
he's playing himself.

267
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:17,607
How can you tell?

268
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:22,647
This might provide
an advantage, actually.

269
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:26,093
Go is considered to be a particularly
psychologically revealing game.

270
00:19:26,094 --> 00:19:27,377
There are profiles
for every player--

271
00:19:27,378 --> 00:19:30,378
the conservative point counter,
the aggressor, the finesser.

272
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,774
What kind of player is Slessman?

273
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:36,859
Extreme aggressor.

274
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,954
Okay, here we go.

275
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:48,475
What's the number 6 at
the bottom of the screen?

276
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:51,824
Number of password attempts before
the program wipes the hard drive.

277
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,852
There could be an email,

278
00:19:53,853 --> 00:19:57,753
or a journal in the computer, something
that tells us where Heather is.

279
00:19:57,915 --> 00:19:59,756
Do you think you can break in?

280
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,950
In 6 tries?

281
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:07,752
Try again. Fail again. Fail better.

282
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:13,006
- Samuel Beckett.
- Try not.

283
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:14,946
Do  or do not.

284
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:18,226
Yoda.

285
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:40,902
I wanna talk to him.

286
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:53,396
You read my paper. Learn anything?

287
00:20:54,978 --> 00:20:58,859
Heirens said a man living inside of his
head was the one who committed the murders.

288
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:04,851
You said he was lying, that there'd never
been an actual case of multiple personalities.

289
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:10,261
You have an academic interest in
disassociative identity disorder,

290
00:21:10,262 --> 00:21:12,262
or you just planning your defense?

291
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:22,607
You a fan of Adrian Baal's work?

292
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,621
No.

293
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:29,574
I'm a fan of yours.

294
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:32,432
You know...

295
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,956
they never give you the
real facts about CPR...

296
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:43,127
that outside of a hospital,
it's only effective 7% of the time.

297
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:48,070
Your friend had a 93% certainty of dying,

298
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:52,320
but you kept trying... even
after you'd broken his ribs,

299
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:56,971
even after his blood
was all over your hands.

300
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:04,440
Why don't you tell us
where Heather Woodland is?

301
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,590
Woodland...

302
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:18,303
isn't she the girl that went
missing a couple days ago?

303
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:33,657
Get him out of here.

304
00:22:56,023 --> 00:23:00,558
- Hey.
- He is "isn't she the girl..."

305
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:04,101
- if he'd already killed her, he would have said--
- "wasn't she the girl..."

306
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:07,579
She's alive.
We don't know for how long.

307
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:11,293
Is it true what he said about
CPR? I mean, I didn't know.

308
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:13,194
You want statistics on CPR, ask Reid.

309
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:17,068
- I wanna know if you're ok.
- I'm fine.

310
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:21,069
- Are you?
- Think I can't do the job?

311
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,866
I think you can't be 2
different people at once.

312
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:34,066
What is it?

313
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:39,484
Conflicts in the profile.

314
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:47,672
- 2 different behaviors.
- 2 different people.

315
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:50,466
There's a second killer.

316
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:53,729
Not unusual. Remember Lawrence
Bittaker and Roy Norris?

317
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,916
1979.  They outfitted a van to rape
and murder girls in California.

318
00:23:57,917 --> 00:23:59,883
We're looking for someone who
fits a similar relationship?

319
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:04,135
They're not equals. Slessman's smart,
but he is a submissive personality.

320
00:24:04,136 --> 00:24:06,767
- So number 2 is the dominant.
- Authoritative, arrogant.

321
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:08,043
Probably not as
smart as Slessman.

322
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:11,595
He's like the schoolyard bully recruiting a
good underling-- he'll be protective of Richard.

323
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:13,076
He'll make him feel like he owes him.

324
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,940
If Richard's been up in the attic
fantasizing about being an extreme aggressor,

325
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:17,141
this guy showed him how to do it.

326
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:18,308
He helped him take the first step.

327
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:19,732
I think we should interview him,

328
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:22,233
- use this as pressure.
- No, no. We need leverage.

329
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,291
- A name.
- From the suspect list?

330
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:25,292
That'll take too long.
There's gotta be a faster way.

331
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:27,146
There is.

332
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:29,868
Here. This might be a little hot.

333
00:24:30,615 --> 00:24:32,878
Mrs. Slessman, I don't think
we've got the right guy.

334
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:36,079
I think the person we're looking
for might be a friend of Richard's.

335
00:24:36,937 --> 00:24:40,045
- Richard never had many friends.
- You sure?

336
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,741
There's gotta be someone.

337
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:46,262
You've reached Penelope Garcia in
the FBI's office of supreme genius.

338
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:49,845
Hey, it's Morgan. Need you
to work me some magic here.

339
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:53,608
I got a program called Deadbolt Defense and
a girl with only a couple of hours to live,

340
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:55,780
- so what do you know?
- Then you've got a problem.

341
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:58,718
Deadbolt's the number one password
crack-resistant software out there.

342
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:01,272
You're gonna have to get inside
this guy's head to get the password.

343
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:04,367
I thought I was calling the
office of supreme genius.

344
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:07,210
Well, gorgeous, you've been rerouted
to the office of too friggin' bad.

345
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:09,605
Thanks anyway.

346
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:13,371
Well, there was... there
was this one young man.

347
00:25:13,953 --> 00:25:16,178
I think his name was Charlie.

348
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:18,945
Cross-reference Charlie
for the second unsub.

349
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,361
Charlie is probably Charles Linder.

350
00:25:24,362 --> 00:25:26,262
He was Slessman's cellmate and...

351
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:28,563
received a dishonorable
discharge from the military.

352
00:25:28,563 --> 00:25:31,363
He's bigger, tougher. He could
have protected Richard in prison.

353
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,364
- Where were they incarcerated?
- Cascadia.

354
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,218
- Less than a mile from here.
- Let's go.

355
00:25:38,498 --> 00:25:41,622
My name is Richard Slessman,
and I have trouble sleeping.

356
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,656
Okay, what do i do when
I'm trying to get to sleep?

357
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:58,869
Guys, a little help.

358
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:02,017
We're going through every one of
these CD's-- scratches, wear and tear.

359
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,239
I wanna know which CD he
plays the most. Let's go.

360
00:26:06,218 --> 00:26:08,386
- We get an address on Linder?
- It's coming right now.

361
00:26:08,711 --> 00:26:11,156
Does senior management want
a field assessment on Gideon?

362
00:26:13,026 --> 00:26:15,567
Don't worry about it. Are they
nervous about him being in charge?

363
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:17,916
Aren't you on your way back to
Slessman's house to help Morgan?

364
00:26:19,383 --> 00:26:21,688
Do you know why he always
introduces me as Dr. Reid?

365
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:26,884
Because he knows that people see you as a kid,
and he wants to make sure that they respect you.

366
00:26:27,397 --> 00:26:29,070
What's the address?

367
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:31,212
Don't think it matters anymore.

368
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:38,109
Winston Churchill said,

369
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:43,010
"the farther backward you can look,
the farther forward you will see."

370
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:49,540
Anyone who can tell
us more about Slessman?

371
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,865
Tim Vogel was the security
guard covering Slessman's block.

372
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:55,866
- That's him over there.
- I'll get him for you.

373
00:26:57,492 --> 00:27:00,819
That was Hotch. Linder's name
came up on a police report.

374
00:27:01,046 --> 00:27:03,061
- And?
- He's dead.

375
00:27:03,062 --> 00:27:05,528
Car accident, 2 months ago.

376
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,793
Linder is dead.

377
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,025
Too bad you guys came here for nothing.

378
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:16,879
I mean, talk about scum.

379
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,480
I can't remember how many times I put Linder
in solitary for causing trouble with us.

380
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:26,897
You'd think the inmates would try
to stay on our good side, right?

381
00:27:27,818 --> 00:27:31,134
Especially since half our job is
protecting them from each other.

382
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:35,641
You protect them?

383
00:27:36,913 --> 00:27:38,498
If you're a little white guy?

384
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,488
Especially in a prison like this.

385
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,332
Linder's 6'4".
You talking about Slessman?

386
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:46,890
Oh, yeah.

387
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:50,931
Thanks for your help.

388
00:27:54,732 --> 00:27:57,932
He's a friend of Richard. He protected
him. He will feel like he owes him.

389
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:02,169
- He fits the profile. And did you see them?
- The keys.

390
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,870
Hotch, i've just found your
leverage. His name is Timothy Vogel.

391
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:31,750
What's he doing?

392
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:34,451
Lowering the room temp.
The cold puts them on edge.

393
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:36,961
Okay, so I want an SPD, and I
want a Seattle agent in the room.

394
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:40,946
I want him to see that we've got every department
working on this. And I need some file boxes.

395
00:28:41,157 --> 00:28:43,304
Fill them. I don't care
if the paper's blank.

396
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,405
And I want you to write
the name on the sides.

397
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,192
Whose name?

398
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,704
4 months of investigative work,
1 file, and guess what, Richard.

399
00:28:51,705 --> 00:28:54,763
It's not your file. See,
we don't care about you.

400
00:28:59,164 --> 00:29:00,764
It's Vogel we want.

401
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:12,918
Oh, come on! I need a
password. I need a password.

402
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:17,941
What am I looking for? What
could I possibly be looking for?

403
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:22,908
- I've been thinking about the CD's.
- Oh, Reid, come on. We tried the CD's.

404
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:26,196
We searched, sifted, and sorted through every one
of this guy's head-banging heavy metal collection.

405
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,754
We gotta find something,
or this girl is dead.

406
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:30,748
Think we may have missed the obvious.

407
00:29:31,523 --> 00:29:32,683
What are you doing?

408
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,134
Reid, what made you think of this?

409
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:42,027
It was the only empty case.

410
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:48,682
All right. I'm an insomniac who listens
to Metallica to go to sleep at night.

411
00:29:49,348 --> 00:29:51,649
What song could possibly speak to me?

412
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,850
"Enter Sandman."

413
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,909
We found out Heather
was buying a used car.

414
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:03,120
You know how car salesmen
get us to buy a car?

415
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,634
They call it reciprocity.
They drop the price,

416
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:10,435
feels like they've done us
a favor. We feel obligated.

417
00:30:11,511 --> 00:30:15,957
There's a sudden pressure to
reciprocate this one little favor.

418
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:17,858
And it's so powerful that we'll...

419
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:21,159
put a deposit down on a car we're
not even sure we really want.

420
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,697
- So what?
- So Vogel did you a favor.

421
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:29,945
He protected you in prison, and
now you feel like you owe him,

422
00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:32,446
and you need to protect him.

423
00:30:33,046 --> 00:30:37,552
Guys like Vogel learn in the schoolyard
which kids to bully and which kids to protect,

424
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:39,984
and he's got you convinced
that you owe him so much

425
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,385
that you'll go to jail for him.

426
00:30:44,782 --> 00:30:49,076
Richard, I'm here to remind you something.

427
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,284
You owe him nothing.

428
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,235
There's something wrong.

429
00:31:00,236 --> 00:31:02,044
We gotta him pull over. I can feel it.

430
00:31:02,045 --> 00:31:04,746
You wanna know the word repeated
more than any other in your file?

431
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,581
Impatient.

432
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:11,546
You wanna stop him, you give me a reason.

433
00:31:11,547 --> 00:31:15,283
His behavior. When we left
him, he was nervous, unsettled.

434
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:19,088
But now he's stopping at every stop sign.
He's using his blinker at every turn.

435
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:24,255
He's slowing at yellow lights. This is not
someone who is rushing to kill and dump a body.

436
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:29,220
Okay. Do it.

437
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,981
FBI. Put your hands up
where we can see them!

438
00:31:52,464 --> 00:31:56,438
Put your hands through
the window now! Now!

439
00:32:02,614 --> 00:32:07,876
All right, with your left hand I want you to
open the car door from the outside.

440
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:11,761
Get out!

441
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:15,662
- It's not him!
- Where is he? Where is he?

442
00:32:15,663 --> 00:32:17,063
- Where's Vogel?
- I don't know!

443
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:18,159
What are you doin' driving his car?!

444
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,460
He came up to me in the
garage after our shift ended.

445
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,655
He asked if he could borrow my truck.

446
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:23,302
- What kind of truck?
- He's dumping the body.

447
00:32:23,303 --> 00:32:26,703
- What's the make? What's the make?!
- Dodge! Dodge Dakota!

448
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,709
- Gideon, Heather's alive.
- How do you know?

449
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:34,650
'Cause we're watching her right now.

450
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:43,951
Hotch, he's gonna kill her. He's
heading there now. We need a location.

451
00:32:43,952 --> 00:32:45,674
I don't have enough time
to get it out of him.

452
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:48,154
Find something, Hotch,
or that girl is dead.

453
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:55,381
Morgan, can you show me the last 12
images lined up next to each other?

454
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:57,671
Yeah.

455
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:03,472
Right there.

456
00:33:03,562 --> 00:33:06,108
Right there. You see that? The
light bulb hanging from the wire?

457
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,800
Yeah, what about it?

458
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:11,319
It's shifting positions
like it's swaying...

459
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,206
like the earth is tilting.

460
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,719
Not the earth, doc. The ocean.

461
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:18,978
She's on a boat? Where?

462
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,116
It's a pier or a dock. He wouldn't be able to
transmit the webcam image from the middle of the ocean.

463
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:25,386
- You're sure about this.
- It's the best we got, Hotch.

464
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:27,815
Even if we're right, getting the
exact location's on you, my friend.

465
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:29,946
What is it you always ask Garcia?

466
00:33:29,947 --> 00:33:32,347
To work me a little magic.

467
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:39,438
Just to let you know...
Gideon's talking to Vogel...

468
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,603
and Vogel's nailing you to the wall.

469
00:33:42,536 --> 00:33:44,551
Yeah, whatever.

470
00:33:47,835 --> 00:33:50,743
He said it was your idea
to keep the girls on a boat.

471
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:57,260
He's talking, Richard.

472
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:00,047
Reciprocity.

473
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,008
Tell me where she is,
and we make a deal.

474
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:08,288
Is it a dock?

475
00:34:09,661 --> 00:34:10,892
A pier?

476
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:20,140
It's a shipyard.

477
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,041
Allied shipyard.

478
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:56,857
Reid, he's inside.

479
00:35:01,816 --> 00:35:03,088
Get Elle on the phone.

480
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:11,408
- Listen to me. You need to wait for backup.
- If we wait, the girl is dead.

481
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,320
- And if we had waited in Boston--
- I can't.

482
00:35:14,457 --> 00:35:16,594
You told me to trust my instincts.

483
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:37,648
Stop!

484
00:35:38,356 --> 00:35:40,013
- Stop!
- Get back!

485
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:42,749
- I'll shoot her.
- I wouldn't.

486
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,505
If I were you, I'd aim the gun at me.
You shoot the girl, you got nothing.

487
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:47,109
Get... back!

488
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,684
Shoot me instead.

489
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:52,358
Come on. What, are you a lousy shot?

490
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,308
50 feet away. You got a
perfect shot. Shoot me.

491
00:35:57,309 --> 00:36:00,205
- You think I'm stupid?
- I think you're an absolute moron.

492
00:36:00,218 --> 00:36:02,063
I know all about ya, Tim.

493
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:05,060
You're at the gym 5 times a
week. You drive a flashy car,

494
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:07,561
you stink of cologne,
and you can't get it up.

495
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:10,245
Not even viagra's workin' for ya.
You know what that tells me?

496
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:13,910
That tells me you are hopelessly
compensating, and it's not just in your head.

497
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:15,198
It is physical.

498
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:16,719
What did the girls call you in high school?

499
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,447
What'd they come up with when you
fumbled your way into some girl's pants,

500
00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:22,227
and she started laughing when she got a good
look at just how little you had to offer?

501
00:36:22,228 --> 00:36:24,884
- Shut up!
- Short stack? Very little Vogel?

502
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:27,135
I got it. Tiny Tim.

503
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:31,364
Gideon!

504
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:35,659
- You ok?
- I'm fine.

505
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,497
Go look after the girl.

506
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:58,139
So what kind of report do they want on him?

507
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,098
I suppose whether he's
fit to be a field agent.

508
00:37:01,794 --> 00:37:05,862
You know, Haley and i were looking at a baby
names book. Guess what Gideon means in hebrew.

509
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:07,685
Mighty warrior.

510
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,229
Appropriate.

511
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:14,124
So what are you
gonna tell them?

512
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:16,624
What would you say?

513
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:20,592
Gideon saved her life.

514
00:37:21,173 --> 00:37:22,722
That's good enough for me.

515
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,956
Hey.

516
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:00,412
You and Haley pick the baby's name yet?

517
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,230
It's funny... Haley liked the name Charles,

518
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:10,345
- but, you know... all I could think of...
- Manson.

519
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:13,060
- Then there was Henry.
- Lee Lucas.

520
00:38:13,061 --> 00:38:14,863
- Uh... Jeffrey.
- Dahmer.

521
00:38:15,602 --> 00:38:17,253
There's just too many of them.

522
00:38:20,812 --> 00:38:24,966
Kind of hard to feel good about catching one
when you know there are 50 more still out there.

523
00:38:31,506 --> 00:38:33,257
How's your report going?

524
00:38:36,558 --> 00:38:40,704
Didn't think you could hide that
from an old profiler, now, did ya?

525
00:38:43,903 --> 00:38:45,878
You know, you saved that girl today.

526
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:50,273
- You can feel good about that.
- It is good.

527
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,031
It's a good thing.

528
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:01,318
Nietzsche once said,

529
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,019
"when you look long
into an abyss,

530
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,520
the abyss looks into you."

531
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:38,245
I'll take this.

532
00:39:56,526 --> 00:40:01,425
Have a n-i-- n-nice day.

533
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:40,426
