1
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:11,138
Ken, go home.

2
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,538
Sandra, wait.
What ?

3
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:15,438
Just talk to me
for a second, ok ?

4
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:16,438
I can't.

5
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:17,738
Please ?

6
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:22,238
Fine.

7
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:27,338
What ?

8
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:29,938
I just want to know
where you're going.

9
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:31,638
It's none of your business.
Why ?

10
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:33,238
Because I'm not
your girlfriend.

11
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:34,838
What, are you too good for me now ?

12
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:40,538
I gotta go.
That's him ?

13
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:43,138
Ken, don't !

14
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:47,638
Ken, stop !

15
00:01:49,838 --> 00:01:51,238
Ken, don't !

16
00:01:51,338 --> 00:01:52,538
Who the hell
are you ?

17
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:54,638
Ken !

18
00:02:00,738 --> 00:02:01,838
Oh, my god.

19
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:06,138
What are you doing ?
That's my ex-Boyfriend.

20
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:06,938
Get in.

21
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:30,238
Oh, no, please !

22
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:31,538
Ow !  Ohh...

23
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,538
Good morning, emily.

24
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:36,538
Have a good weekend ?

25
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:38,538
Yeah.  No.

26
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:39,638
Yes.

27
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:42,138
Ha ha.
Oh, I've been there.

28
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:44,038
No, it wasn't--
Ugh.

29
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:45,938
I don't want
to get into it.

30
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:47,038
No problem.

31
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:49,538
It...  It just
feels weird for me

32
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:51,638
To talk about my personal life here, you know ?

33
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,638
I don't really know
you guys all that well yet.

34
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:54,738
I totally get that.

35
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:03,438
I think I totally
screwed up this date.

36
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:07,738
Ok.

37
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:10,138
What happened ?
You have to understand,

38
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:11,538
I'm a nerd.

39
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:13,038
Like, seriously.

40
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:15,038
And I can fool people for days,

41
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:16,238
Weeks even.

42
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:18,038
But sooner or later,
I blow my cover

43
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:20,438
And I say something so geeky.

44
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:22,738
And then he doesn't respond,

45
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:23,938
And I lose all confidence.

46
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,138
What did you say ?

47
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,338
"Kilgore trout. "

48
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:29,438
Guy has a problem
with kurt vonnegut ?

49
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:30,738
You know kilgore trout ?

50
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:33,338
<i>I read slaughterhouse-Five
when I was 12 and it blew my mind.</i>

51
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:34,338
Seriously, I couldn't get enough.

52
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:35,638
So I just kept going
and I read 'em all.

53
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:36,838
Yeah, yeah.  Me, too.

54
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:38,238
<i>What's your favorite ?
Oh, mother night.</i>

55
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:39,438
The one about
the american spy.

56
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:40,338
Who pretends to be a nazi.

57
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:41,838
"You are who you pretend to be. "

58
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:43,338
"So be careful
who you pretend to be. "

59
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:46,038
Oh, my god.  I can't believe
you're a vonnegut fan.

60
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:47,538
You just made my day.

61
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:48,438
Anytime.

62
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:51,838
Conference room
in 5 minutes, please ?

63
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:53,538
Got it.

64
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,438
Sandra davis, 16 years old.

65
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,338
This is her singing at her high
school talent show a month ago.

66
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:02,938
This is her on-Again,
off-Again boyfriend

67
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:04,038
Ken newcombe.

68
00:04:04,138 --> 00:04:05,938
Their bodies were found
in a park

69
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:08,038
Near the male victim's car
in groton,

70
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:09,938
An affluent,
mostly white suburb

71
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:12,038
Of new york city
in westchester county.

72
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:13,238
It's the third
of 3 killings

73
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:15,138
Believed to be a series
of hate crimes.

74
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:15,938
Hate crimes ?

75
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:17,938
The first 2 victims were keisha andrews, 15,

76
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,738
And vickie williams, 17.

77
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:22,538
They disappeared from their homes
in central westchester one night.

78
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:23,938
Their bodies were found
in a wooded area

79
00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:25,938
In a southern part
of the county near the city.

80
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:30,438
?  ?  ?

81
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,338
And this was painted
on their faces.

82
00:04:34,438 --> 00:04:35,638
what about this couple ?

83
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:36,638
How were their bodies found ?

84
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:38,038
Another swastika.

85
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:39,738
This one
on the boyfriend's car.

86
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:41,738
It's a different
victimology.

87
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:43,738
Maybe just
an escalation.

88
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:45,038
or a different killer.

89
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:46,138
and it doesn't end there.

90
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:48,338
Yesterday an african-American
community leader,

91
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:49,338
A reverend williams,

92
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:51,638
Decided to take this on
as a political issue.

93
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:53,538
Racial hate in the suburbs.

94
00:04:53,638 --> 00:04:56,538
what we are seeing is pure apathy.

95
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,338
Black kids
are getting killed

96
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:00,738
And the police
are doing nothing to stop it.

97
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:03,838
When will these racists
be confronted ?

98
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:06,538
Apparently, in response
to reverend williams' muckraking,

99
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:09,338
A black kid was beaten
on the streets of groton this afternoon.

100
00:05:09,438 --> 00:05:11,038
Connecticut neo-Nazi group

101
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:13,438
Called the white stallions
claimed responsibility.

102
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,938
There are neo-Nazi groups
in connecticut ?

103
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:18,038
The mayor of groton
called me this morning, frantic.

104
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:19,838
?  ?  ?  Rate
to solve these crimes

105
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,438
Before it escalates even more.

106
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:29,138
What are the racial demographics of groton ?

107
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:32,738
Population 42,000.  8% black.

108
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:34,938
I'd say the mayor
has reason to be worried.

109
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:38,838
If it doesn't stop soon, it could flare up  ?

110
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:16,338
"from the deepest desires

111
00:06:17,138 --> 00:06:19,138
"Often come
the deadliest hate. "

112
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:21,838
Socrates.

113
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:24,538
New York,
New York.

114
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:27,838
Too bad we're flying straight to the suburbs.

115
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:29,638
Hey, this is weird.

116
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:30,838
?  ?  ?

117
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:33,138
?  ?  ?

118
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:35,838
But no sign
of sexual assault.  So...

119
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,938
Why would the unsub
use a date-Rape drug

120
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:40,238
To commit
a hate crime ?

121
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,138
Maybe he wants
to weaken them so they can't fight back.

122
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:48,238
But there was
no g. H. B.

123
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:50,138
In the victims
of the double homicide.

124
00:06:50,138 --> 00:06:52,238
There's a lot that's different
about the double homicide.

125
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:53,638
The question is why.

126
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:55,438
All right, we just got
new information.

127
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:57,038
A few weeks before the murder

128
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:59,538
Of sandra davis
and ken newcombe,

129
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:02,838
A threatening letter
was delivered to sandra davis' door.

130
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:04,338
She showed it
to her parents,

131
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:05,738
Who then notified
the police.

132
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:07,338
The police never figured out
who wrote it.

133
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:12,238
"We see ken with you
and it makes us sick.

134
00:07:12,238 --> 00:07:14,238
"Take care to stop this now,

135
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:15,638
"Or you will pay.

136
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:18,238
If you tell anyone about this,
you will pay. "

137
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,538
Strange.
Doesn't seem real.

138
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:20,338
What do you mean ?

139
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:22,338
First of all,
the use of "we"
in a threat this direct

140
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:23,438
Is almost always bogus.

141
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:26,138
One individual trying to
diffuse responsibility.

142
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:28,238
Also, the message itself
seems contradictory.

143
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:30,638
On the one hand,
"take care to stop this now,

144
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:31,738
Or you will pay" ?

145
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:33,938
Presumably, they want them
to stop seeing each other.  But then,

146
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:36,338
On the other hand, they don't want
them to go public with it.

147
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:38,838
"If you tell anyone about this,
you will pay. "

148
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:40,838
The point of hate crimes
is to increase publicity,

149
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:42,938
Not decrease it.
It's like terrorism.

150
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:45,038
An effective threat let's everybody
know that they're in danger

151
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:46,438
If they do this behavior.

152
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:48,938
The author would want sandra
to tell people about the note.

153
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:51,338
Doesn't sound like a guy
who's actually prepared to kill.

154
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,338
Actually, it... doesn't sound
like a guy at all.

155
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:56,638
"Take care to stop this"

156
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:57,938
Implies empathy.

157
00:07:58,538 --> 00:07:59,538
"Take care" ?

158
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:01,138
Males don't use
this type of language,

159
00:08:01,138 --> 00:08:03,238
Especially when
they're trained to threaten somebody.

160
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:04,938
This message
is certainly written by a female,

161
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:07,038
And based on the lack
of psychological sophistication,

162
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,138
I'd say it's most likely
an adolescent.

163
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,438
You think a girl
killed these kids ?

164
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:13,338
I think a girl
wrote this note.

165
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:14,838
Let's call that
mystery number one.

166
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:16,038
You got a number 2 ?

167
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:17,338
Maybe.

168
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:20,638
Says here the autopsy
on sandra davis was inconclusive.

169
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:22,838
She suffered blunt force trauma to the face,

170
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:24,438
She had some bruising
around her neck.

171
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,738
Cause of death
is still unclear.  Coroner's working on it.

172
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:27,838
A lot of questions.

173
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,438
Let's get started
on some answers.

174
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:37,838
?  ?  ?  ?

175
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:41,638
Agent jareau,
gregory hughes.

176
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,038
Mayor hughes.
Yes.

177
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:44,338
This is detective rick ware

178
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,038
From the state police department.

179
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:48,338
We haven't had a murder here
in 2 years, you understand.

180
00:08:48,338 --> 00:08:49,838
This was way above our heads.

181
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:51,538
So we put rick in charge.

182
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:54,138
These are agents
gideon, hotchner,

183
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:55,338
Morgan, and prentiss.

184
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:58,538
I have to say that what's been
happening here the last few weeks

185
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,338
Is...  It's just hard to fathom.

186
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:02,538
I mean, we're 30 minutes
from the city.

187
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:03,338
What do you mean ?

188
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:04,738
Well, this isn't the de south.

189
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:06,938
For the most part, these are
sophisticated new yorkers.

190
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:08,838
Are you saying
you don't think this is a race issue ?

191
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:10,738
All we're saying is
whatever happened here

192
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:12,738
Is way out of the norm
for this community.

193
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:14,338
I wouldn't want you
entering this investigation

194
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,338
Under assumptions
that...  Well, aren't true.

195
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:18,238
Fact is, we don't know
what this is about yet.

196
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:19,738
We need to concentrate
on the double murder

197
00:09:19,738 --> 00:09:21,638
And make sure
that it's the same killer, first of all.

198
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:23,038
You mean there could be
more than one ?

199
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,038
We don't know that yet.

200
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:25,938
All we do know is the threat sent
to sandra davis

201
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:27,338
Was written
by an adolescent girl.

202
00:09:27,338 --> 00:09:28,938
You can tell that
just from a half a page note ?

203
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:30,538
It's pretty straightforward
profiling.

204
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,538
Is there a problem, officer ?

205
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:37,638
Uh, there was a girl
that we suspected at first,

206
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:39,738
But then
we talked to her and dismissed her.

207
00:09:39,738 --> 00:09:40,738
I'd like to meet her.

208
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:42,338
I think it's a waste of time.

209
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:44,138
I'd like to decide that for myself.

210
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:50,138
Sandra showed us
the note 2 weeks before she was killed.

211
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:51,738
We asked around the school for who might have

212
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:53,538
A grudge against sandra and ken.

213
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:56,338
The only girl's name
that came up was tonya mathis.

214
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,438
Rumor was ken dumped her
for sandra,

215
00:09:58,438 --> 00:09:59,738
Although ken told me

216
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:01,838
Tonya was never his girlfriend.

217
00:10:01,938 --> 00:10:03,438
You said you talked to tonya about the note.

218
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:04,438
What'd she say ?

219
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,038
She swore up and down
she had nothing to do with it.

220
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:09,638
I find it pretty hard to believe
she'd write a racist note.

221
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:10,438
Why's that ?

222
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:13,538
See for yourself.

223
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:17,138
That's tonya ?

224
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:18,238
In the flesh.

225
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:20,538
Leave her in there
for a few minutes.

226
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:22,638
You're gonna make
a 17-Year-Old girl sweat ?

227
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:25,938
I want
to scare the hell out of her.

228
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:31,938
?  ?  ?

229
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:34,538
Did these kids live
near here ?

230
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:37,738
Sandra davis lived
about 1/2 mile west.

231
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,338
Ken newcombe
about a mile east.

232
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,538
What were they doing here ?

233
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:43,138
When I was a kid, I used to hang
out in the park at night,

234
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:44,738
Drink beers, hook up
with a girl.

235
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:46,938
Maybe, but I don't think
these two were out on a date.

236
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:48,438
Why do you say that ?

237
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:50,638
Well, as ken
was wearing a sweatshirt and tennis shoes,

238
00:10:50,638 --> 00:10:51,738
Sandra was wearing a dress,

239
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:52,738
High heels, and makeup.

240
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:54,538
She was definitely dressed to go out.

241
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,638
Ken's body was found here ?

242
00:10:57,638 --> 00:10:59,538
Yeah.  And sandra here.

243
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:00,838
But from the bloodstains,

244
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:03,338
It was obvious that she was killed there

245
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:05,238
And then dragged here.

246
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:09,538
So the unsub
shot ken first,

247
00:11:10,138 --> 00:11:12,338
Sandra started
to run and he chased her down.

248
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:15,438
Beat her and strangled her.

249
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:17,238
He had a gun, why didn't he shoot her, too ?

250
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:19,338
He could overpower her,

251
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:21,138
Maybe he didn't think he could overpower ken.

252
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,738
No, it's more than that.

253
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:25,038
The killer took the time
and risked her escaping

254
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:27,538
To track her down
and strangle her with his bare hands.

255
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:29,238
He was completely focused on her.

256
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:31,638
Sandra didn't have
a date with ken.

257
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:34,038
She had a date
with the unsub.

258
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:40,138
Hello, tonya.

259
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:42,338
I'm agent morgan,
this is agent prentiss.

260
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:43,338
We're with the f. B. I.

261
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:44,538
F. B. I.  ?

262
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,538
I'm gonna get
right to the point.

263
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:48,338
Writing a threat like this ?

264
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,338
It's a federal crime.

265
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:52,638
I told him
I didn't write that note.

266
00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:53,938
Oh, I know
what you told him.

267
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:56,638
But this is not
the principal's office,you understand ?

268
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,038
The people you threatened are dead.

269
00:11:58,038 --> 00:11:59,638
I didn't kill anybody.

270
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:00,438
I know that.

271
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:02,738
I got it.

272
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:07,438
But we need to know
why you wrote that note.

273
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:11,338
You were angry with ken

274
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:13,338
Because he didn't
acknowledge you.

275
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:14,538
I get it.

276
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:16,738
He didn't admit
that you were his girlfriend.

277
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:18,038
I was his girlfriend.

278
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:18,838
Yeah.

279
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,638
What about sandra ?

280
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:22,838
She's the one
who got the note.

281
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:25,638
Why were you
so angry with her, tonya ?

282
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:29,738
Oh, this isn't
just about her going with ken,

283
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:30,938
Is it, tonya ?

284
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:33,638
That note says "we. "

285
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:37,038
You wanted to make it look like
other people were in on it.

286
00:12:37,338 --> 00:12:39,738
Like the whole town
was against her. Why ?

287
00:12:40,938 --> 00:12:42,638
Is that the way
she made you feel ?

288
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:44,438
Like everybody
was against you ?

289
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:51,138
It was that stupid
talent show.

290
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:54,438
What talent show ?

291
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:58,838
I was just as good as her.

292
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:03,138
She was just
this quiet little girl who nobody liked.

293
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:05,938
Then she sings,
and suddenly she's all little miss popular,

294
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:08,138
And ken's all over her.

295
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:09,938
It's not fair.

296
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:13,138
So, tonya...

297
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:14,838
Look at me.

298
00:13:16,938 --> 00:13:19,238
You wrote this note
for revenge, didn't you ?

299
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,938
I know it was stupid.

300
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:31,238
But I just wanted
to scare them.

301
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,138
I'm sorry.

302
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:47,538
We called tonya's family
and friends.

303
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:48,538
We're checking her out,
but...

304
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:51,938
That girl
didn't kill those kids.

305
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,138
It's how you've had to learn.

306
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:38,338
anybody seen reid ?

307
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:39,738
Where's reid ?

308
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:46,638
Coroner's report.

309
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:48,438
"Victim had been beaten
so extensively,

310
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:50,038
"The cause of death
was indeterminate.

311
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:52,438
Post-Mortem stab wounds
were also discovered. "

312
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:53,738
Post-Mortem stabs, huh ?

313
00:14:54,138 --> 00:14:54,838
What ?

314
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:57,738
Post-Mortem stab wounds
almost always indicate sexual homicide.

315
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:00,138
Uh, this is also
a fairly extreme overkill,

316
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:03,038
Which is markedly different
from the other 2 girls.

317
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:04,338
So you're saying
this was a different killer.

318
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,838
No, we're saying
if it was the same killer,

319
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,238
The overkill indicates he didn't get
what he wanted from someone...

320
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:09,538
?  ?  ?

321
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:15,038
Derek: sexual predators kill
for sexual needs.

322
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,538
And in this case, there's no sign
of sexual assault on his victims.

323
00:15:17,538 --> 00:15:19,538
That tells us
that he probably fetishises.

324
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:21,438
Takes some souvenir
from his victims that

325
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:23,438
He uses to get off.

326
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:24,538
Correct me if I'm wrong,

327
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:26,438
?  ?  ?  Like the m. O.
Of a hate crime.

328
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:27,538
No, we're pretty certain
that hate

329
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,138
Wasn't the primary motive at all.

330
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:31,338
He has a specific
physical type

331
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:33,238
And he tries
to cover his tracks.

332
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:34,938
He is a serial killer.

333
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:50,838
Hi.
Hi, naomi.

334
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:52,938
It's nice
to see you again.  Hop in.

335
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,138
Thanks.

336
00:15:58,138 --> 00:15:59,338
Thanks for picking me up.

337
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:00,938
?  ?  ?

338
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:07,812
Reverend williams: and when
did the f. B. I.  Finally arrive ?

339
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:11,112
Only after a white boy
was killed.

340
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:15,712
We cannot rely
on the police.

341
00:16:16,112 --> 00:16:18,212
We must protect ourselves.

342
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,112
Let the people
who are taking our daughters

343
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:24,312
Know they will not
get away with this.

344
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:25,612
That's enough.

345
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:26,812
Explain this to me.

346
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:28,312
The swastikas
on the bodies.

347
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:29,812
What do they mean ?

348
00:16:29,812 --> 00:16:31,012
They're a distraction.

349
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:33,512
Hotch: perhaps
this killer isn't driven by hate,

350
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:34,512
But he wants us
to think so

351
00:16:34,512 --> 00:16:35,712
So we won't guess
his real motive,

352
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:37,312
Which is serial
sexual homicide.

353
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:39,512
I'm confident the unsub's
from this county.

354
00:16:39,512 --> 00:16:40,812
He knew
the kind of hysteria

355
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:42,612
That would flare up
from these swastikas.

356
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:43,812
Reverend williams
took the bait.

357
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:45,312
Judge is trying
to buy us some time.

358
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:46,512
She's talking
to the reverend to see

359
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:48,212
If he'll cool
his rhetoric a little bit.

360
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:49,712
Hate crimes are political.

361
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,012
If we're right,

362
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:52,712
This was personal.

363
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,312
Well, we need to confirm
that the double homicide

364
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:55,912
Is linked
to the first 2 murders.

365
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:58,312
We need to speak
to the families of the victims.

366
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:01,512
We know how difficult
this is for you.

367
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:03,312
Thanks for talking
to us.

368
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:05,312
She just disappeared
that night.

369
00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:07,712
I know she must
have just walked out the front door,

370
00:17:07,712 --> 00:17:09,412
But I thought
we'd hear that.

371
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:11,612
What about the window
in your daughter's bedroom ?

372
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:13,112
She couldn't have climbed out there.

373
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:14,512
It's been painted shut
for years.

374
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:15,712
No, it hasn't.

375
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:18,112
What are you talking
about, bree ?

376
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:22,012
I fixed it
so I could get out.

377
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:24,412
You've been sneaking
out in the middle of the night ?

378
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:25,412
I'm sorry.

379
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:26,812
You're not in trouble.

380
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,112
But just tell me,

381
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:30,312
Did she sneak out before ?

382
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:31,612
No, I swear.

383
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:34,412
She always told me
not to do it.

384
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:37,212
She was the good one.

385
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:39,912
She didn't deserve this.

386
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,512
Nobody deserves this.

387
00:17:45,712 --> 00:17:47,012
Your daughter liked to sing ?

388
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:50,912
We dug up everything
on the first 2 victims,

389
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:52,412
And basically these girls
were good students

390
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:53,412
Who stayed out of trouble.

391
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:54,812
Just like sandra davis.

392
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:56,912
And we found something else.
They both liked to sing.

393
00:17:56,912 --> 00:17:58,412
One in church,
and one in a band.

394
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,012
Their parents said
that this was their passion.

395
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,412
Just like sandra davis.

396
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:03,312
African-American girls

397
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:05,612
Between the ages
of 15 and 17 who like to sing ?

398
00:18:05,612 --> 00:18:07,412
That's a pretty
specific type.

399
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,812
Sounds like
the same unsub to me.

400
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:10,512
And the fact
that they all sing,

401
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:11,612
That could be part of his m. O.

402
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:13,012
Maybe part of a ruse.

403
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:14,612
Another girl went missing.

404
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:16,212
A naomi dade.
16 years old.

405
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:17,512
When ?
Last night.

406
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,312
Why are we just
finding out about it now ?

407
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:20,812
First victims
weren't found for a couple of days,

408
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:22,112
There's a chance
she's still alive.

409
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:24,312
Let's get to the profile
before it's too late.

410
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:40,912
Girl, on tape:
hey, I'm naomi.

411
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:43,612
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

412
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,912
?  ?  ?  ?

413
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:48,012
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

414
00:18:54,312 --> 00:18:56,312
Suspect we're looking for
is a black male,

415
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:59,612
Statistically between
the ages of 20 and 35.

416
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:02,112
We know he's black
because of his victims.

417
00:19:02,312 --> 00:19:04,612
Sexually motivated killers
almost always kill

418
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:05,612
Within their own race.

419
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,612
The victims he's chosen
are good girls.

420
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:09,412
They're good students.

421
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,012
No behavioral problems.

422
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:12,612
They're what we call
"low-Risk. "

423
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:14,212
And the lower the risk
of the victim,

424
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:16,312
The higher the intelligence
of the unsub.

425
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:18,012
Guy's a smooth talker.

426
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:20,912
Makes people feel
at ease.  Gains their confidence.

427
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:24,312
You'd be amazed
what these guys can talk people into.

428
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:28,412
Jeffrey dahmer
was once pulled over by police officers

429
00:19:28,412 --> 00:19:30,112
For driving over
the center line.

430
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:33,012
He'd thrown the garbage bag
full of body parts

431
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:34,312
In the back seat
of his car,

432
00:19:34,512 --> 00:19:36,612
But he was so calm
and so self assured,

433
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:38,712
That he convinced the officers
not to look in the bag.

434
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,812
He then went on to kill
at least 15 more people.

435
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:43,312
This guy's a hustler.

436
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:45,512
He may not have
a lot of education,

437
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:47,812
But he knows how to treat
impressionable young girls.

438
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:51,112
Victor paleologus
used to troll shopping malls

439
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:52,912
Pretending to be
a movie producer.

440
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:54,312
He told kristine johnson

441
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:56,043
For a james bond movie.

442
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:58,257
And that was the last time
she was ever seen alive.

443
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:01,657
We think that because
all these girls are singers,

444
00:20:01,657 --> 00:20:03,657
That the unsub
may be connected in some way

445
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:04,957
To the recording industry.

446
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:06,557
We know the unsub
has a vehicle.

447
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,757
Big enough to transport a body.

448
00:20:09,357 --> 00:20:10,157
It's clean.

449
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:11,657
It's not too old.

450
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:13,357
Nice enough
to make a girl feel comfortable inside,

451
00:20:13,357 --> 00:20:15,357
But it's not flashy.
This is not a guy

452
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:16,757
Who wants to attract
attention to himself.

453
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:18,657
Probably a large,
dark sedan.

454
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:21,257
We recommend
putting this profile on the news,

455
00:20:21,257 --> 00:20:23,657
The paper, anywhere
it might be seen by the people in this town.

456
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:26,157
This guy's ruse
didn't work on everybody.

457
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:27,957
Somewhere out there
is at least one woman

458
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:29,257
Who didn't fall
for his game, and...

459
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:31,257
That's who
we need to find.

460
00:20:31,257 --> 00:20:32,957
The key to this unsub's
psychology

461
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:34,357
Is the souvenir he takes.

462
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:35,957
We don't know
what it is yet, but...

463
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:37,857
We know that
once he has it,

464
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:40,057
His victim tn becomes
disposable,

465
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:41,157
And that's when he kills her.

466
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,157
The unsub's ritual
was interrupted

467
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:44,557
When he killed
sandra davis.

468
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:47,857
We don't believe
he was able to take a souvenir from her.

469
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:50,157
We think he may
revisit her house

470
00:20:50,157 --> 00:20:51,957
Or any place
she may have frequented.

471
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:54,057
We recommend surveillance
in locations

472
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:56,157
Where the unsub
might approach young girls.

473
00:20:56,157 --> 00:20:57,557
Churches, high schools,

474
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,357
Libraries, coffee shops.

475
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:01,057
Stick with the community.

476
00:21:01,057 --> 00:21:02,057
The people of this county

477
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:03,757
Should be able
to offer some good leads.

478
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:05,457
Thanks a lot.
Good luck.

479
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:06,457
Gid...

480
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,857
Whoa.  Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

481
00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:09,757
You think
community vigilance will be enough ?

482
00:21:10,357 --> 00:21:11,957
If it were,
we'd be out of a job.

483
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:14,457
I'm telling you not to do your job.  Jason.

484
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:17,357
Just want to make sure
that we don't get ahead of ourselves.

485
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:19,257
What's he doing ?

486
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:22,657
So please
just sit tight one more minute.

487
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:23,657
What's the problem ?

488
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,757
Well, the problem
is I would have to be crazy

489
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:27,757
To release this profile to the public.

490
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:28,557
What are you talking about ?

491
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:31,057
Reverend williams
has already stirred up enough trouble

492
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,057
By choosing
to make this town a soapbox

493
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:34,457
For his anti-Racism
campaign.

494
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:36,857
What do you think
is gonna happen if I go to the press

495
00:21:36,857 --> 00:21:38,157
And tell them
the killer is black ?

496
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:40,657
Hey.  The best way
to stop all this is to find that killer.

497
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:42,157
And we just gave you
the best way to do that.

498
00:21:42,157 --> 00:21:44,157
Right.  By telling everybody
to look out

499
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:45,457
For an anonymous black man ?

500
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:47,657
They're gonna say
that's racial profiling.

501
00:21:47,657 --> 00:21:48,857
It's not
racial profiling.

502
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:52,157
Racial profiling
is targeting suspects because of their race.

503
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:54,557
We gave you
a complete profile which includes race.

504
00:21:54,557 --> 00:21:55,557
All right, look.
The point is

505
00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:57,757
I've never even heard
of a black serial killer.

506
00:21:57,757 --> 00:21:59,957
And neither have
all the african-Americans in this community

507
00:21:59,957 --> 00:22:02,257
Already upset
by what's been happening here.

508
00:22:02,257 --> 00:22:04,857
You can believe
in black serial killers or not,

509
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,357
But the fact is
they do exist.

510
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:08,557
And it's only a matter of time
before he kills another girl.

511
00:22:08,757 --> 00:22:11,057
All right, look.
I am not interested in debating this.

512
00:22:11,057 --> 00:22:12,857
Detective ware
is more than capable

513
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:14,057
Of heading
this investigation.

514
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:16,157
You gonna let this happen ?

515
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:18,257
Let what happen ?
Make every black man

516
00:22:18,257 --> 00:22:19,157
In this county a target ?

517
00:22:19,157 --> 00:22:19,957
Rick.  What ?

518
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:21,957
We found naomi dade's body.

519
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:22,957
Damn it.

520
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:24,557
We got a mass
of reporters out there.

521
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:28,057
What's it gonna be, detective ?

522
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:31,957
Please.

523
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:33,857
Let us help you.

524
00:22:39,422 --> 00:22:42,322
Finally, I want to assure you
we considered all options,

525
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:44,722
<i>And we're certain this is
the best course of action.</i>

526
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,622
Thank you.

527
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:52,622
Detective, I think you made the right choice.

528
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:54,822
I hope this doesn't
come back to bite us in the ass.

529
00:22:55,122 --> 00:22:55,922
Why would it ?

530
00:22:55,922 --> 00:22:58,022
Why ?  Last thing I need
is to spread fear

531
00:22:58,022 --> 00:22:59,922
That a dangerous
black man running around this county.

532
00:23:00,122 --> 00:23:01,922
Hotch: best way to solve
your problem is to stay focused

533
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,522
On what we need to do
to catch this guy.

534
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:04,322
Tell me.

535
00:23:05,922 --> 00:23:06,822
Tell me what to do.

536
00:23:08,122 --> 00:23:09,322
We need to get
the word out...

537
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:10,822
Not just on the news.

538
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,022
We need to talk to
these kids face to face.

539
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:14,622
Gotta give them
the profile.

540
00:23:14,622 --> 00:23:17,522
What about the talent show
that sandra davis sang in at her high school,

541
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,922
That could be
where the unsub saw her sing.

542
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:21,922
That's a good idea.
Talk to the kids at her high school.

543
00:23:23,222 --> 00:23:25,122
Set up a tip line.
Yeah, you got it.

544
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:29,422
Well, I hate waiting around.
So, what do you say, ware ?

545
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:31,622
Want to join the patrols ?

546
00:23:32,122 --> 00:23:34,222
Get back on the street ?
Pretend to be a beat cop again ?

547
00:23:35,222 --> 00:23:36,022
Yeah.

548
00:23:36,522 --> 00:23:38,222
Beats waiting around
here for more bodies, don't it ?

549
00:23:38,922 --> 00:23:39,722
Let's do it.

550
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,022
Tips have just started
to come in.

551
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:47,822
So far, we have fingers pointed
at a minister...

552
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:49,222
You don't have to do this.

553
00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:52,922
A janitor
at his school, and...

554
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:54,622
Oh !
The reverend jesse jackson.

555
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:55,822
Is anything useful ?

556
00:23:55,822 --> 00:23:57,722
Not so much.
Keep diggin'.

557
00:23:57,722 --> 00:23:59,722
Hey, uh, I got someone
who remembers seeing

558
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:02,722
A black guy they didn't
recognize driving around in a black lincoln

559
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:04,322
In front of our last victim's
house yesterday.

560
00:24:04,622 --> 00:24:06,022
That's the second sighting
for that vehicle.

561
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:07,722
It fits the profile...
Large, dark sedan.

562
00:24:08,222 --> 00:24:09,422
Include it
in the press release.

563
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:10,222
Yeah.

564
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:11,622
Yeah, I got it.

565
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:16,222
suspect may be
driving a black town car.

566
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,122
May be ?

567
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:20,422
It's something.

568
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:28,422
No, I'm good.

569
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:34,422
For what it's worth, um...

570
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:38,422
Took balls to stand up
to the mayor like that.

571
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:40,922
You would've done
the same thing.

572
00:24:42,922 --> 00:24:44,022
I don't have to work
for the guy.

573
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:46,522
I know that was
a tough decision.

574
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,522
Don't you ever wish
it didn't matter ?

575
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:55,422
It ?

576
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:56,822
Color.

577
00:24:59,022 --> 00:24:59,822
Hmph.

578
00:25:01,622 --> 00:25:03,822
Judge me by the content
of my character.

579
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:07,522
I mean, why does it
even have to be part of the equation ?

580
00:25:08,322 --> 00:25:10,322
People are dying.
We need to get the bad guy.

581
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:11,222
That should be it.

582
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:13,722
No half-Cocked reverends
running around,

583
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:15,522
Getting people mad
about the wrong thing.

584
00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:20,522
No mayors so afraid of
offending black folks,

585
00:25:20,522 --> 00:25:22,622
He doesn't even want
to tell the community what to look out for.

586
00:25:28,722 --> 00:25:30,022
It's exhausting
sometimes.

587
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:34,222
It's the way
it's always been, man.

588
00:25:35,822 --> 00:25:38,422
Politicians,
community leaders...  They do what they do.

589
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:41,622
You and me...
We do what we do.

590
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:45,422
We're the foot soldiers
in these streets getting the job done.

591
00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:49,522
Hmph.  Foot soldiers.

592
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:52,822
Right.

593
00:25:53,522 --> 00:25:54,822
Only ones
who ever really get results,

594
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:55,722
You know what I'm sayin' ?

595
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:01,422
Ware.

596
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:02,922
Right there.

597
00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:04,122
It's a black town car.

598
00:26:04,422 --> 00:26:06,522
Yeah, just a few blocks
from sandra davis' house.

599
00:26:09,522 --> 00:26:10,522
He's turning right.

600
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:12,222
Turn right here.

601
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:18,022
There it is.

602
00:26:27,722 --> 00:26:29,022
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

603
00:26:35,422 --> 00:26:36,222
Nothin'.

604
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:37,522
You hear that ?

605
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:19,822
Ware.  Yeah.

606
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,822
It's a false alarm.
It's just a car service.

607
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:25,722
All right.  I'll be right out.

608
00:27:31,622 --> 00:27:33,122
I got him !
I got him !

609
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:38,722
What the hell are you doing ?  !

610
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,522
Freeze !
Put down your weapon.

611
00:27:40,822 --> 00:27:43,622
The cops, damn it.
I'm f. B. I.

612
00:27:43,822 --> 00:27:45,922
What ?
Listen to me.  Do not shoot.

613
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:48,622
I'm gonna reach
in my back pocket and grab my wallet.

614
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:50,522
All right ?

615
00:27:51,322 --> 00:27:52,122
All right ?  !

616
00:27:56,522 --> 00:27:57,522
I'm f. B. I. , man.

617
00:27:59,922 --> 00:28:00,922
I didn't know.

618
00:28:02,322 --> 00:28:03,222
Give me your gun.

619
00:28:03,622 --> 00:28:04,522
Give me your gun !

620
00:28:04,522 --> 00:28:06,222
Call 9-1-1.
This man needs help.

621
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:07,422
Go !  Call 9-1-1 !

622
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,122
Ware, nah, nah, nah.
Come on, man.

623
00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:14,022
Nah.  Hey.  Look at me.
Look at me.

624
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:15,922
Ware, you're going
to be all right.

625
00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:17,122
I'll get you some help, ware.

626
00:28:17,622 --> 00:28:18,822
Talk to me.

627
00:28:19,022 --> 00:28:20,522
Hey, just talk to me.
I'm right here.

628
00:28:21,322 --> 00:28:22,722
Tell me about
that family of yours.

629
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:24,722
Huh ?  You got
2 kids, right ?

630
00:28:25,422 --> 00:28:27,022
Yeah.  I saw
those pictures in your car.

631
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,522
What's your
little one's name ?

632
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:29,922
Huh ?

633
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:32,722
D-Dwayne.

634
00:28:32,722 --> 00:28:34,522
Dwayne.
All right, that's good.

635
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:36,122
That's good.  Come on.
I got you, man.

636
00:28:36,122 --> 00:28:37,622
You ain't going nowhere.

637
00:28:37,622 --> 00:28:38,822
All right ?  All right ?

638
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:40,822
Tell me about dwayne ?
How old is he ?

639
00:28:41,422 --> 00:28:42,622
Uhh.  Uh...

640
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,822
Come on.  Ware,
talk to me.  Say it.

641
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:48,922
Hey...  Hey.
Don't you leave me.  No.

642
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:49,822
Come on.
Don't you do this.

643
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:52,222
Ware !  Ware !
No.  Come on, man.

644
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:53,722
Ware !  Ware !

645
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,233
What the hell happened ?

646
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,333
Man: I didn't know
he was a cop.

647
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:33,233
W-We saw this black car
parked in front of our house.

648
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,033
This black guy with a gun
sneaking around the yard.

649
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,333
So, you shot him ?

650
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:39,333
I...  I was scared.

651
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:40,733
I got a family.

652
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:42,233
So did detective ware.

653
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,233
Where's morgan ?
Back here.

654
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:54,833
You ok ?

655
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:05,833
Yeah, j. J.

656
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:08,033
You're kidding.

657
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:10,833
Another girl
just went missing.

658
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,233
All right,
we're on our way.

659
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,333
The girl's name is ally hadley.

660
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,333
She told her mom
she was sleeping over at a friend's house,

661
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,333
But she never showed up there.

662
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:22,933
Well, I'm sure
she's just out

663
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:24,533
With some other friends
or a guy or...

664
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:25,933
She says she never
does this.  She a...

665
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:26,833
Good girl.

666
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:29,233
Yeah.  She's african-American.

667
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:30,733
15 years old.
She loves to sing.

668
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,033
Guys we got a witness.
A girl who saw the report on the news.

669
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,633
She says a guy came up
to her about a month ago,

670
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:37,833
Claiming to work for
a record company.

671
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:38,933
She's on the way in.

672
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:39,833
I'll call the others.

673
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:43,433
It was after choir practice
at the church.

674
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:45,733
He came up to me outside...

675
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,133
This black guy.

676
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:50,733
Told me he was
an executive at some record company

677
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:53,233
And he goes to churches
in the area to scout talent.

678
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:57,933
He said I had a great voice,
and he'd like to record me.

679
00:30:58,733 --> 00:30:59,633
What did you say ?

680
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:01,733
I told him
I wasn't interested.

681
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:03,933
He gave me
some kind of business card

682
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:06,033
And told me to call him
if I changed my mind.

683
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:08,833
It didn't even have
a company name on it...

684
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,033
Just his name
and a phone number.

685
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,933
It looked so fake.

686
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:15,533
How could anyone fall for that ?

687
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:17,533
Do you have the card ?

688
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:20,133
I didn't have to keep the card.

689
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,133
Why ?

690
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:25,433
I knew him.

691
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:34,133
I was beginning to think
you guys had forgotten all about me.

692
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,033
Well, we need you now
more than ever, hot stuff.

693
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:39,233
Aww, it's like candy
to my ears, sugar.  Go.

694
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,433
All right,
here's the scoop.

695
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:41,633
The guy's a freelance musician.

696
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,833
Played keyboard
for the girls' high school musical.

697
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,633
We contacted the school,
and they gave us a name...

698
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:48,333
Terrance wakeland.

699
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:50,133
In the new york
metropolitan area

700
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:52,033
Including westchester county.

701
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,433
Computer says 3.

702
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:57,133
He may work at
a recording studio or record company.

703
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:01,433
Ok, I'm going
to cross reference with i. R. S.  Records.

704
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:02,733
Gotcha.

705
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:04,833
Mount vernon,
just outside the bronx.

706
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:07,833
A & l studios...  Looks like
they went bellyup a few months ago.

707
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,133
But he still works there
as a security guard.

708
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:14,033
Thanks, mama.
You're the best.  Let's go.

709
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:19,433
Man: you're lucky the studio
was available tonight.

710
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:21,633
You're not nervous,
are you, ally ?

711
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:23,333
No.
Good.

712
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,433
Good.  Good.
Don't you worry.

713
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:26,533
I'll have you back
before your parents even know you're gone.

714
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:28,633
Hey.  Let's go.

715
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:31,533
Man on police radio:
all units to a & l studios,

716
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,833
5663 vincent boulevard.
Mount vernon.

717
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:36,833
What are the chances
of us catching ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

718
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:42,933
* mama may have *

719
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:47,233
* papa may have *

720
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,933
* but god bless the child *

721
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:53,733
* that's got his own *

722
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:58,033
* that's got his own *

723
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:03,133
Man: oh, that was it.
You killed that last take !

724
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:04,133
I'll...  I'll be right out.

725
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:14,433
I've never been in
a real recording studio before.

726
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:16,133
Yeah.  Well,
you wouldn't know it.

727
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:18,233
I mean,
you're so comfortable.

728
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:20,933
It sounded like you were in
your own living room singing.

729
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,333
It felt good.

730
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:23,433
Yeah.

731
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:26,733
Hey, I'm sorry.
Your...  Your throat must be tired.

732
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:28,433
You want some water ?
Sure.

733
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:44,933
Hotch: hey, our road's closed.
Construction.

734
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:45,933
Isn't there
a faster way ?

735
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:46,833
Not that I know of.  No.

736
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,333
Hey, you know
not a lot of girls your age

737
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,433
Would have chosen
a song like this.

738
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:52,433
Really ?

739
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,233
Oh, yeah.

740
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,633
And that look...
That face you got.

741
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,433
I mean, you got this
real smokey kind of tone.

742
00:33:57,733 --> 00:33:59,933
Like something you hear in
a thirties harlem supper club.

743
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:02,133
I mean, do you have any idea
what your music does to me.

744
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:03,833
No.

745
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,733
It takes hold.

746
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:07,833
You get a song
stuck in your head.

747
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:09,933
But for me,
it gets stuck right here.

748
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:12,433
Once it's there,

749
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,133
There's just no letting it go.

750
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:14,933
It's just...

751
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:17,133
?  ?  ?  ?

752
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:20,033
U  all right

753
00:34:29,698 --> 00:34:30,498
you all right ?

754
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:33,798
Yeah.  Just...
a little dizzy.

755
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,498
What I'm saying is that
it's so beautiful.

756
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:39,498
Ally, I just can't...

757
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:40,998
Let it live.

758
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:43,798
You ever feel that ?
Like there's something so beautiful...

759
00:34:45,198 --> 00:34:47,398
so beautiful you can't
let it live to show you...

760
00:34:48,198 --> 00:34:49,598
To remind you
of how ugly you are ?

761
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:51,998
I...  I don't feel
so good.

762
00:34:55,798 --> 00:34:57,698
Son of a bitch !

763
00:34:57,898 --> 00:34:59,098
you think I'm ugly ?

764
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:00,198
Aah !

765
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:19,398
Help !

766
00:35:21,498 --> 00:35:22,898
Somebody help !

767
00:35:31,698 --> 00:35:32,598
Police officer:
i'll cover the door.

768
00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:36,798
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

769
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:40,398
Right there.  Go.

770
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:46,798
Check the back.

771
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:11,098
Morgan !

772
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,098
Yeah.

773
00:36:19,498 --> 00:36:21,598
Door are wide open,
lights are on.  Somebody left in a hurry.

774
00:36:21,798 --> 00:36:22,998
There was definitely
a struggle.

775
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:24,398
So, maybe she's still alive.

776
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:26,098
They were here.
And maybe she tried to flee.

777
00:36:26,098 --> 00:36:27,498
She could be in
the neighborhood, trying to get away.

778
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:28,698
Hotch, look at this.

779
00:36:29,498 --> 00:36:30,398
It's the voices, man,

780
00:36:30,998 --> 00:36:31,898
His souvenirs.

781
00:36:35,398 --> 00:36:36,198
Let's go.

782
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:37,898
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

783
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:40,798
Help me.

784
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:41,998
What's the matter ?

785
00:36:45,398 --> 00:36:46,698
Where...  Where am i ?

786
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,098
Whoa.  What did you take ?

787
00:36:50,098 --> 00:36:51,998
Ally !  Ally, there you are !

788
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:53,598
You know this girl ?

789
00:36:53,598 --> 00:36:55,698
Thank you, officer.
This is my baby cousin.

790
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:57,098
Her parents are
out of town,

791
00:36:57,098 --> 00:36:58,698
And I'm taking care of
her right now.

792
00:36:58,698 --> 00:37:00,898
And, uh,
she snuck out and obviously got herself

793
00:37:00,898 --> 00:37:02,998
Some kind of wasted.
I'm very, very sorry.

794
00:37:03,298 --> 00:37:05,498
Come on, ally.  Come on.
Party's over.

795
00:37:05,498 --> 00:37:07,798
Hey, you want me
to tell your parents what you've done ?

796
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:10,398
I mean, look around you.
This is a dangerous neighborhood, ally.

797
00:37:10,398 --> 00:37:11,598
You could have gotten
yourself killed.

798
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:12,598
You know this man ?

799
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,998
Again, officer,
I'm very, very sorry.

800
00:37:15,998 --> 00:37:17,598
She's...  She's really
out of it.

801
00:37:17,998 --> 00:37:19,598
Come on, ally,
you can sleep it off when you get home.

802
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:22,798
Can I go now ?  Or am I gonna
have to stand here all night

803
00:37:22,798 --> 00:37:23,798
While you mess with this kid ?

804
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:24,998
There they are.

805
00:37:33,598 --> 00:37:36,198
Wakeland, f. B. I.  !
Don't move !

806
00:37:36,198 --> 00:37:37,598
Whats going on ?
Let her go.

807
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:39,698
What did I do ?
Let her go.

808
00:37:40,798 --> 00:37:43,198
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? Right ?  !

809
00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:45,198
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

810
00:37:49,098 --> 00:37:50,398
He won't let her go.
He could be armed.

811
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:51,398
Just calm down !

812
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:52,598
Hey, what the hell
are you waiting for ?  !

813
00:37:52,598 --> 00:37:54,598
Do not shoot !
I want you to calm down,

814
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,598
Put your weapons down
so we can move in.

815
00:37:57,198 --> 00:37:57,998
Do it !

816
00:37:58,598 --> 00:37:59,398
Do it !

817
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:05,998
Wakeland,
get away from the girl.

818
00:38:06,198 --> 00:38:07,098
Turn around.

819
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:08,198
Hands on your head.

820
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:19,598
Let's go.

821
00:39:30,398 --> 00:39:31,398
You all right ?

822
00:39:35,798 --> 00:39:36,598
I was just thinking.

823
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:41,098
I know what it's like
to grow up without a father.

824
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:44,898
Their father died a hero.

825
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:49,298
So did mine.

826
00:39:51,798 --> 00:39:52,898
Doesn't make it
any easier.

827
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:06,898
Jacob: "the life of the dead
is placed in the memory of the living. "

828
00:40:07,898 --> 00:40:08,698
Cicero.

829
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:15,398
Oops !  Sorry.

830
00:40:18,398 --> 00:40:19,298
Oh, wait a minute.

831
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:22,298
No, you didn't.

832
00:40:23,198 --> 00:40:24,398
Where did you find this ?

833
00:40:24,398 --> 00:40:25,698
In the airport.
Can you believe it ?

834
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,498
Haven't read this in
fift...  Like...  12 years.

835
00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:29,898
Ok, that's funny.
Hmm.

836
00:40:30,198 --> 00:40:31,898
Chapter 3's
where it starts to get good.

837
00:40:32,498 --> 00:40:34,398
Ok.  I will let you know
when I get there.

838
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:35,898
All right, you do that.

839
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:44,598
You all right ?

840
00:40:46,498 --> 00:40:47,298
Reid.

841
00:40:48,398 --> 00:40:49,198
Hmm ?

842
00:40:49,798 --> 00:40:50,798
I said, are you all right ?

843
00:40:52,198 --> 00:40:53,198
I'm fine.

844
00:40:55,898 --> 00:40:57,098
Thanks
for broadcasting it.

845
00:40:57,598 --> 00:40:59,398
Hey, talk to me.

846
00:41:01,098 --> 00:41:03,098
Whatever you say to me in
confidence is between us.

847
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:03,898
You know that right ?

848
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:05,498
I don't have anything
to tell you.

849
00:41:11,098 --> 00:41:11,998
Reid, listen to me.

850
00:41:13,798 --> 00:41:15,198
What you went through
out there,

851
00:41:15,198 --> 00:41:16,098
Nobody expects you
to rebound...

852
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,998
I can still do my job,
all right. I'm not gonna freak out.

853
00:41:20,098 --> 00:41:20,998
You think
I don't know that.

854
00:41:36,498 --> 00:41:37,798
It's the crime scene
photos.

855
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,698
Crime scene photos ?

856
00:41:45,098 --> 00:41:46,398
The dead girls
in the leaves.

857
00:41:50,498 --> 00:41:51,598
Reid, we've seen worse.

858
00:41:52,898 --> 00:41:53,898
I know.

859
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:55,798
I know
we've seen worse, but...

860
00:41:58,898 --> 00:42:01,998
For the first time, I know.

861
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:05,798
I look at them, and...

862
00:42:07,998 --> 00:42:10,798
I look at them and I...
I know what they were thinking.

863
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:12,798
And I know what
they were feeling, like, right before.

864
00:42:17,798 --> 00:42:18,898
That's called empathy.

865
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:21,198
And it's a good thing.

866
00:42:26,198 --> 00:42:27,798
It's not.
It's got me all messed up.

867
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:30,198
I don't know how to focus.
I can't do my job as well.

868
00:42:37,198 --> 00:42:38,098
So, what do I do ?

869
00:42:38,198 --> 00:42:39,298
You use it.

870
00:42:41,498 --> 00:42:42,998
Let is make you a better profiler,

871
00:42:44,798 --> 00:42:45,898
A better person.

872
00:42:52,198 --> 00:42:53,198
A better person.

873
00:42:57,198 --> 00:42:57,998
Hmph.
