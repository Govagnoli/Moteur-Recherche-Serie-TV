1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:13,200
Criminal Minds 1x13, "Poison"

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,800
Kinda scary, huh?
-What?

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,900
The trees.  They kinda look like those hooded creatures in the movie, don't they?

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,200
Did you like the movie?
- I told you I did.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:32,200
No, no.  You said "nyeh."  "Nyeh" is exactly halfway between "yeah" and "nah"

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,700
That's the kind of answer I would tell my students is "ambiguous."

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,900
Was that your intent?

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,100
More or less.
- [Man chuckling]

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,100
Oh, Bud, I know it's tough on you, but, hey, look, think on the bright side...

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,600
You know, every other week, we get to stay up late, eat junk food, and...

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:56,100
go see movies your Mom would never let you see in a million years.

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,700
What are you doing?

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,100
Then you didn't see that deer?
- No!  Where?

14
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,400
It's gone.  I must have... Wow!  It must have run away.

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,800
Whatever...
-- Oooh...

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,900
Ah...
- What?
- Ah, it's a flat.

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:26,200
We must have blown a tire driving on the shoulder.

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll be right back.
- Maybe we should call someone.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:02:02,300
It's a flat tire.  It's...you know, despite what your mom says I'm not completely useless.  I'll be right back.

20
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,100
Hello?

21
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:21,500
What is it, Dad?
- It's nothing.  It's just, it's just the wind, Eric.  Get back in the car.

22
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:33,000
It's all right, it's all right.  It's just me. Clumsy me. It's all right.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hello?  Who's there?

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,100
What is it Dad?
- Stay in the car.

25
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,200
Get away!  What do you want?

26
00:02:46,200 --> 00:03:29,300
Get away from me!  Get away!

27
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,600
Get away! Get away!  Get away!
- Hey, hey, hey!  Calm down inside there.  Calm down.

28
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,300
Yeah, I'm gonna need some backup, just past Exit 5.

29
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,500
Car on the shoulder of the road, lone male in the driver's seat,

30
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:59,300
under the influence of...something.

31
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:06,700
Wait, there might be another one.

32
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm gonna need an ambulance!

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,400
State trooper took this before the paramedics showed up.

34
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,200
He's unconscious, has four broken bones.  He's gonna be in the hospital for a month.

35
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,800
I didn't hurt my son.

36
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,800
You remember removing the tire iron from the trunk?
- No! No!

37
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,600
What's the last thing you remember?

38
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:43,400
I picked Eric up from school.  Friday, for the weekend.

39
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,100
Who would do this?

40
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,400
.

41
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,600
This happened two days ago in Beechwood, New Jersey.

42
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,400
Mr. Fisher had ingested LSD one afternoon and didn't come down until 18 hours later.
[ LSD: lysergic acid diethylamide, ³Á¨¤¤G¤AÓi(°g¤ÛÃÄ) ]

43
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
The hospital reported 6 other patients who ingested LSD in the last 24 hours.

44
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,400
The hospital called the CDC, the CDC called us.
[CDC = Center for Disease Control]

45
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,700
So, a bunch of people got spiked.  What makes it a BAU case?

46
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,700
They each received 10 to 20 times the normal dose.

47
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,600
It's enough to kill a small child.
- Or cause a grown man to kill him with a tire iron.

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,900
Of the seven victims, there was one death and one coma.

49
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:20,800
This is from the hospital's security footage the same night Fisher lost it.

50
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
These people didn't get spiked.

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,800
These people were poisoned.

52
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,100
Roman philosopher Lucretius wrote, "What is food to one...

53
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,100
...is to others, bitter poison."

54
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,800
Of the 7 victims, Gail Norman was the only death.  She was 78.

55
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,500
Ran out into the middle of the road, and she was hit by a car.  She was DOA.
[ DOA = Dead on Arrival ]

56
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,400
The other potentially fatal case is 9 year old Brittany Canon.

57
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,900
She fell out of a tree house and fractured her skull.

58
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,200
She's in a coma and the doctors don't know if she's going to come out of it.

59
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,400
How do you wanna handle the press?

60
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,500
We still don't even know how these people got dosed.

61
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,600
I think it would be irresponsible to issue a warning without specifics.

62
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
It'll just cause panic.

63
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
I did notify the local PD, though, to be discreet.

64
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,700
How is it possible that none of these people knew how they got poisoned?

65
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,600
None of them remembers anything about the day it happened.

66
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,300
These people were so messed up, it's made it difficult for local PD to retrace the victim's steps.

67
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,200
So, we need to go on precedent.  We know there are four types of poisoners who target multiple victims.

68
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,900
There's the true believer, the political terrorist / religious cult.

69
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,700
There's the extortionist.  The product tamperer holds the business hostage in exchange for money.

70
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:12,000
Or the prankster.  Usually a younger offender who doesn't mean any harm and it's basically just a big practical joke.

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,300
And the avenger, someone with a personal vendetta who chooses poison as their weapon.

72
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,300
We need to find out as quickly as possible which type he is.

73
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,600
Because with the exception of the prankster, all these types commonly test their poison on a small scale before appearing at a larger attack.

74
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Then, let's hope this one was just a prank.

75
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,500
I would suggest we split up the victims, see if there's a pattern to the victimology.

76
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,700
Most of them are still in the hospital.  I'll call local PD to meet us there.

77
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll check the lab reports.  Maybe there's a clue to the unsub's motive in the specific nature of the poison he used.

78
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:56,900
I can't imagine anybody could want this to happen.

79
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,700
Detective Hanover, Beechwood PD.
- Agent Hotchner, this is Agent Gideon.

80
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,400
Thanks for coming down on such short notice.

81
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,900
Doctor said he may have permanent brain damage.

82
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,200
I've never seen anything like this.
- Well, let's hope we can help him.

83
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,900
Have you had a chance to review the victim's files?

84
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,200
We're especially interested in talking to the boy's father.

85
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,500
We'd like to get a sense of why he turned violent...

86
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,900
While the lab analyzes the specific nature of the LSD he was dosed with, we'd like to get our own sense:

87
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,200
was it the drug itself or was there something else going on?

88
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,200
And hopefully, that can give us a little bit of a window into the motive of the offender.

89
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:36,500
He's in the psych ward.
- Well, we'll keep it short.

90
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,700
Mr. Fisher?
- Shrink or cop?

91
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,700
I'm an FBI profiler, so I guess I'm a little of each.

92
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,700
I'm Jason Gideon.

93
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,400
I can't imagine what you've been through.

94
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,700
I understand you recently divorced your wife.  Can you tell me why?

95
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,200
What do you wanna know? Was I angry about the divorce?

96
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I mean, was I so angry that I wanted to hurt my son to get back at her?  Is that what you wanna know?

97
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,100
Were you?

98
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,900
Let me tell you something about my wife, OK?

99
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:12,000
About what she did, in my house, in my bed.

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,200
With the investment banker next door.  Do you wanna know what the worst part is?

101
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,600
My son, Eric.....

102
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,300
is angry with me.

103
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,000
She's the cheater!

104
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,400
And he's angry at me!  Me!

105
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
What did you do?

106
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,500
Did you want to hurt her?
- Of course!

107
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,400
And the kid?  I mean, it's her kid, right?

108
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,000
He takes her side.  You wanna crush him, too.

109
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,800
You wanna shut his obnoxious little mouth up for good.

110
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,100
NO!

111
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,800
No, he doesn't understand.

112
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,000
He took her side.  I'm sure it's not the first time he's done that.

113
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,400
No! Eric.  Oh, Eric!

114
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,600
Why did this happen to you?

115
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,300
Why?????

116
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,400
Mr. Fisher!
- Why!? Why?!  Why?!
- Calm down.

117
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Why? Why?
- Come on, come on, come on!

118
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, he's raw, broken, and seriously pissed off.

119
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,700
He didn't hurt the son to get back at the mother?

120
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,300
Not consciously, no.

121
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,800
Rage was real but understandable...and

122
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,100
he never apologized...

123
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,300
When he lost control, he didn't even say, "Eric, I'm sorry."

124
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,800
He said, "Eric, why'd this happen to you?"

125
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
He never even confessed to hurting the kid.

126
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
So, the drugs tapped into the rage but didn't cause it?

127
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,700
Yeah, that's my guess.

128
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,700
That's consistent with the information we just received from the lab tox screens.

129
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:39,000
They didn't find any trace of PCP or any other drug indicating the unsub was intentionally trying to make people violent.

130
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,500
But they did find traces of rohypnol in all the victims.

131
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,500
A central nervous system depressant, similar to valium, only ten times more potent.

132
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
It's commonly known as a "roofie" or a date-rape drug.

133
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,000
Right, and one of its side effects is amnesia, which explains why none of the victims remember how they were poisoned.

134
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,500
We compared notes on the victims we talked to.

135
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,300
So far there doesn't seem to be any pattern as to who got hit.

136
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,500
Maybe the drugs themselves could explain what type of offender we're dealing with.

137
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,100
A lot of kids are using LSD and rohypnol these days.

138
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,200
Fisher is a high school teacher.

139
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,200
So it might be a prank after all.
- Yeah, one that went horribly wrong.

140
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,700
Yeah, I'm gonna get a list of students from Fisher.  See you later.

141
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,300
Hotch.

142
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,900
Okay...we'll be right there.

143
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:42,300
Cops may have figured out where everybody was dosed.

144
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,300
Uniforms were on a canvas.  Staff here remembers seeing 4 out of the 7 victims here the day they reported symptoms.

145
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,600
Please tell me your staff didn't mention the canvas was about a poisoning.

146
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,700
They didn't, but I had to tell the owner.

147
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
Is that the owner?

148
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,000
Nell Trucco.

149
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,300
I'll be shocked if this doesn't get leaked now.

150
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Let's just hope nobody jumps to the conclusion it's bio-terrorism.

151
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,900
All right, I'm gonna go talk to the cafe staff.  Make sure they know to keep it quiet.

152
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,100
Can you think of anyone who would do something like this?

153
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,300
High school kids hanging around?

154
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,800
Honestly, I can't tell them apart.  You should talk to Danny.

155
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Danny?
- A busboy.  High school kid.  A lot of his friends come in here.

156
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
His girlfriend was here Saturday night.

157
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Is he here today?

158
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,300
He was supposed to come to work after school, but he called in sick.

159
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,200
What's his last name?
- Ah, Wallace.

160
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,500
I'll have Elle check at the school.

161
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,800
You got a phone number for him?

162
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,600
Hotch, I checked the high school and Wallace's house.  He wasn't there.

163
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,900
So, now I'm at his girlfriend's house.

164
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,100
OK, I'll call you back.

165
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:45,800
[doorbell rings]

166
00:12:45,800 --> 00:13:00,600
Samantha?
- Yeah?
- I'm with the FBI.  Can I talk to you for a minute?

167
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,400
Where are your parents?
- Working.

168
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,100
What do you want?
- Well, you didn't go to school today, Samantha, and neither did your boyfriend.

169
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:19,200
He's sick.

170
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,100
Can I ask you something personal?

171
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,900
I think that something might have happened to you.

172
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,500
You wanna tell me about it?

173
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't know.

174
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,400
I don't remember.

175
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
What do you remember?

176
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,900
He took me someplace on his motorcycle.  I, I remember...

177
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,800
...waking up, but I was naked.

178
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,400
I was all beat up.

179
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,700
And he was there.  Above me.

180
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,900
Holding me down.

181
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,700
Who was?

182
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,000
Danny.
- [phone rings]

183
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,700
I called the doctor earlier. That could be her.

184
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,900
Hello?
-Samantha, listen to me.  Don't hang up.

185
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,400
Can you hear me?

186
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
[Elle whispering] Keep him talking.
- Samantha!

187
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,700
What do you want?
- Someone's there.

188
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Who did you call?

189
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,900
Why do you think someone's here?

190
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,900
Don't mess with me, Samantha.  Don't do it.

191
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,300
If you say anything,... [click]

192
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,500
He hung up.
- Come with me.

193
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,300
You're gonna call 911, and as soon as I leave, you lock the door behind me.

194
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Do it.

195
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,700
He is near his girlfriend's house.

196
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Hillcrest at Maple, ah, I can't see the other cross-street.

197
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,200
Yeah.

198
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:57,700
[rumbling of motorcycle engine]

199
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,200
Danny Wallace, stop.  FBI.

200
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
You put your hands on top of your head.

201
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:15,200
Off the bike.  Hands on your head.

202
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:27,100
This wasn't what you had in mind when you skipped school today, was it, Danny?

203
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
You wanna tell us about Saturday night, Danny?

204
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,400
I didn't do anything.

205
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,300
Samantha doesn't know what she's talking about.

206
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,800
A lot of people saw you at the cafe together on Saturday night.

207
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,600
What did you decide to do, Danny?

208
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Dose the common milk so that nobody would know you just wanted to roofie your girlfriend?

209
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,000
That's not true.

210
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,300
Sex was an issue in your relationship.  She told me about it.

211
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,500
She wasn't prepared to give it up, so you decided to take it.
- No!

212
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,500
She had bruises all over her body, Danny.  You hit her!

213
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Well, I didn't mean to.  She was freaking out, punching me.

214
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,600
She was on something.  I was just trying to help her.

215
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,700
I was just trying to hold her down.

216
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,600
She was hitting you, but you still had sex with her?
- No!

217
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Then, what, then?

218
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,100
It was after.  After, we did it.

219
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
We fell asleep.  When she woke up, she was seeing things.
- What things?

220
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,300
Look, she was on something, and if it was acid or something, I've taken that.

221
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,800
You give that to someone without telling them, it doesn't exactly set the mood.

222
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,000
Kid is right about that.  If he wanted to slip her a date rape drug, why'd he give her LSD, too?

223
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,100
This boy seems too scared NOT to be telling us the truth.

224
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,000
So, Samantha was just the 8th victim and the boyfriend working in the cafe was just a coincidence.

225
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,600
But, even so, there may be an explanation why the two drugs:

226
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,300
LSD to hallucinate and rohypnol to forget.

227
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,700
Forget what?  What they were hallucinating?

228
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,200
No, how they got dosed.

229
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,100
Then, the unsub's covering his tracks.  It's much too organized for a high school prank.

230
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,900
And there still hasn't been any kind of ransom demand.

231
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,000
Which rules out the extortionist.

232
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,500
Or any visible political group or cult in the area.

233
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,900
Which rules out the "true believer."

234
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,500
And leaves us with "the avenger."

235
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Think we can give him a profile?

236
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,100
We believe whoever poisoned these people was motivated by revenge.

237
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,400
The randomness of the victimology -- average people in an average-sized town...

238
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,900
all points to a local resident.

239
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,900
We know that people who poison for the purpose of revenge primarily act alone.

240
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,200
However, he may have manipulated someone close to him to assist him.

241
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,100
The unsub usually disposes of these accomplices when they're of no further use to him.

242
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:32,200
The unsub is like a cautious, deliberate, and highly-functioning male between the ages of 35 and 50.

243
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,900
He chose LSD for a reason.  LSD is about altering perception.

244
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,800
We think that this unsub is striking out because he feels that he's been...

245
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,400
inaccurately perceived by the community or a subset of it.

246
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,100
He feels that these attacks will effect and alter a reality that he is caught in, that he perceives to be unjust.

247
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,600
He's so self-centered he believes his victims will know the reason for the attack and who did it.

248
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,600
This individual was savvy enough to use rohypnol to obstruct our investigation,

249
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,000
erasing the memories of the victims of how they were poisoned.

250
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Hold on.  If this guy believes that his victims know who he is,

251
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,800
why is he covering his tracks?

252
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Because these victims aren't his primary targets.

253
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,500
We know from precedent that this kind of offender, the "avenger," tests his weapon first.

254
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,300
This attack was a test run.

255
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,900
A test run for what?
- We don't know yet.

256
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,200
What we do know is that this is not the first time that he's aired his grievances.

257
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,300
While it's not likely that he has a criminal record,

258
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:29,700
it is possible that he has filed criminal charges or pursued  a civil action against his perceived adversaries.

259
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,900
And, now, to measure the results of his test, he's watching.

260
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,000
And he wants to see the results of his test.

261
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,400
Once he has them, all those years of pent-up rage will be released in the form of a larger attack.

262
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,700
The profile indicates a lot of people could die.

263
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,100
We have a leak.

264
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,900
That's right, Steve.  Neighbors became aware something was wrong when a local Beechwood restaurant closed early.

265
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,400
From inside sources, we learned that representatives of the CDC began testing food inside the restaurant.

266
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
If you're gonna report the story, name the restaurant.

267
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,200
---unconfirmed, we were told that some of the food had been tainted with hallucinogenic drugs.

268
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,900
Name the restaurant.

269
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,600
--- until we do confirm all of this, we will not release the name of the restaurant.

270
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,800
We'll only say it's a Beechwood area favorite.

271
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,800
This is Suzanne Whang reporting live from Beechwood.  Back to you, Steve.

272
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,000
They didn't name the restaurant.

273
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,700
What is it?

274
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,400
Call the local hospital, make sure they know what's coming.

275
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,100
Excuse me.

276
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,600
Where do your 911 calls get routed?

277
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,900
There's a county phone bank.  They contact first responders, the fire department.

278
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,500
Alert them, too.  They're going to need additional personnel and any other backup you've got...

279
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,700
auxilary cops.  You're going to have to call them.
- But, why?

280
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,100
Because we're going to have a heck of a time just calming people down

281
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,200
and we really don't need the confusion to interfere with our investigation.

282
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,000
Do you want me to start making those calls?
- No, NO, no, no.

283
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,300
Hey, hey!  Everybody please shut up for a minute.

284
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,400
Tell me what this is all about.

285
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:57,400
[phones ringing]

286
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,700
Panic.

287
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,000
No, I can't comment.  No, we don't know for sure why those people were poisoned.

288
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
OK, great. Thank you.

289
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,100
I just got off with the hospital.  They're swamped with over 50 potential poisonings from local restaurants,

290
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,900
but no hallucinations.

291
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,800
Another poisoning?

292
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,400
Or maybe more hysteria.

293
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,000
We've looked into any civil or criminal complaints from employees, ex-employees ...

294
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
suppliers, regulars at the cafe... not one good lead.

295
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,900
There's got to be somebody connected to that cafe who pops as a suspect.

296
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,100
Morgan, you wanna go back there, see if we can find another angle?
- Can't hurt.

297
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:40,300
JJ, you and Reed go to the hospital, see if any of the poisonings seem legit.
- OK.

298
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,100
I really can't talk right now.  We just got hammered.

299
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:47,300
Listen, most of these food poisonings are probably psychosomatic.
- What makes  you think that?

300
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,100
A news broadcast just reported a local restaurant was poisoned.

301
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,500
Now, it would be a huge coincidence if there was another poisoning right after that aired.

302
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,600
So what do you want me to do?

303
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,200
Help us find out which cases, if any, are real.

304
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,800
People are coming in with all kinds of complaints.  But, there's at least one case that isn't psychosomatic.

305
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
She's barely breathing.

306
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,300
Can you take us to the doctor that's treating that patient?

307
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:16,900
I'll call Hotch.

308
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,600
If you're an "avenger," you choose your targets for a reason, right?
- [Elle nods]

309
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,400
Then, why haven't we found anyone connected to this cafe who fits the profile?

310
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,900
Why hasn't the CDC found any trace of the drugs?

311
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,800
Wait a minute.

312
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,000
What if it's not the profile that's wrong, but the target?
- Not this cafe.

313
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Just because a bunch of victims came to eat here, doesn't necessarily mean they got poisoned here.

314
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,700
Then where?

315
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,900
When the patient got here, she didn't remember anything about her day.

316
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,400
And her speech was so slurred, I could barely understand her.

317
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,500
It sounds like rohypnol.  Did you test her?

318
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,300
She was positive for rohypnol, negative for LSD.

319
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,300
But, we're running more tests because rohypnol alone doesn't explain her symptoms.

320
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,900
She presented with nausea, difficulty swallowing, labored breathing.

321
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,700
She was also having trouble moving her legs.

322
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,100
[woman continues coughing]

323
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,700
How long had she been sick?
- She didn't know.

324
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,400
I could barely understand her when she first got her.

325
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,700
Now, she can't speak at all.

326
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,400
Do you know any biological agents that have similar symptoms: ricin, seron gas?

327
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,400
You think this is a biological attack?
- We can't rule anything out.

328
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,400
I'll order a few more tests.

329
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,700
???
- Thanks, Nell.

330
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,200
No soda machines, hot dog stands, water fountains, or anything else.  Get anything?
- Maybe.

331
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,500
First New Jersey Federal, right across the street.

332
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,100
One of the victims who I talked to said he went to that bank the day that he was dosed.

333
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,500
How do you get poisoned at a bank?
- I don't know.  But, I'd like to take a look at the security tapes.

334
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:58,600
After you.

335
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,200
Right there.  Pause it, Elle.

336
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,500
Jack Fisher.
- About to have the worst night of his life.

337
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,400
That's all of them.

338
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Every one of the victims who turned up at the ER three nights ago is on this tape.

339
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:16,100
I'm gonna call Hanover.
- Bring in the CDC guys, they can test the candies.  I'll call Hotch.

340
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Morgan, it's Hotch.  What's up?

341
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:28,400
Reed, I think she's trying to say something.

342
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,400
[inarticulate]
- "The End"??

343
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,400
She may be incoherent from the lack of oxygen.

344
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,200
[inarticulate]

345
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,800
Doctor!

346
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,500
[patient continues coughing]

347
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,000
No, Hotch, we're pretty sure it's the bank.  All the victims were on their security tapes.

348
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,100
Then you should look for Lynn Dempsey, 45.

349
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,000
Garcia's emailing a picture to your phone.

350
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,600
Hold on a second, I'm checking.

351
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,900
Yeah, yeah.  I got it.  Lynn Dempsey.  Hold on.

352
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Elle.

353
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,800
[to Hotch] Elle's checking.

354
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,700
Yeah, we got her Hotch.  Checking the tape.

355
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Right there, that's her.
-Play it again.

356
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,500
Okay, not only was she here, but from one of these tapes...

357
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,100
it looks like she was the one replacing the candies.

358
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,300
Hotch, she could be the unsub.

359
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,300
We're working on that.  I'll call you back.

360
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,100
So, what are the chances that she's not poisoned, that maybe she just got some bad food?

361
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,500
Highly improbable.

362
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,200
Chances are basically nil.

363
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,700
What is the rate of survival?

364
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,500
This dose, without anti-toxin...

365
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,400
Zero.

366
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,500
What is it?

367
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,400
Botulism.
[ Ã¾¸zµß¯f: ¦×¬r±ìµß¤¤¬r, ¥Ñ¦×¬r¯À³y¦¨ªº¦Ù¦×·ò·ô¯e¯f ]

368
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,500
Doctor, her BP is dropping rapidly.
[BP = Blood Pressure]

369
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,400
It's sepsis.
[ sepsis: ±Ñ¦å¯g ]

370
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,300
Give another amp of epi.
[epi = epinephrine  µÇ¤W¸¢¯À ]

371
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,600
She's going into v-fib.
[v-fib ventricular fibrillation. ¤ß«ÇÅÖºû©ÊÅ¸°Ê (¤£¥¿±`ªº¤ß«ß) ]

372
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
She's crashing!  Get the paddles.

373
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,100
Charging to 200.
-Clear

374
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,700
Nothing.  Charging to 300.
-Clear
- Still nothing.

375
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,100
The test run is over.

376
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:16,200
Page a Code Blue.
- Yes, Doctor, right away.  Starting CPR.
[CPR cardiopulmonary resuscitation ¤ßªÍ´_µd³N ]

377
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,100
Just be careful the fresh air doesn't kill you, Fred.
- Ha ha.

378
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,900
See you in a few days, Janice.

379
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,200
Don't stay late, the kids need you.

380
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:44,100
Thank you, Mr. Dennis.  Have fun.

381
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:49,600
Lynn Dempsey was an executive assistant.  She has no expertise with chemicals.

382
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
She doesn't fit the profile of the unsub.

383
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,600
But the CDC found both LSD and rohypnol in the candy she was replacing at the bank.

384
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,100
She must have been an accomplice

385
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,900
and when the unsub finished using her to further his attack, he killed her with botulism.

386
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,600
So, what does that tell us about the unsub?

387
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,900
He's far more sophisticated than we realized.
- Why is that?

388
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,200
The botulism toxin is the deadliest substance known to man.

389
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,300
It blocks acetylcholine receptors, paralyzing its victims until, basically, choking you to death.
[ acetylcholine: ¤AñQÁxÆP ]

390
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,200
Without a, uh, antitoxin, a lethal dose will kill you in 36 hours.

391
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,500
How many people have access to this stuff?
- In New Jersey, quite a few.

392
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,400
It's the pharmaceutical and chemical capital of the US.

393
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,800
So, that the toxin can be ordered in the form of botox through any chemical or biological lab or botox clinic.

394
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,700
It has to be purified, but any chemist or lab assistant has that capability.

395
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,500
So, we're looking for chemists and sophisticated lab assistants?
- Basically.

396
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,800
OK, wait a minute.  If the unsub is a chemist with access to the toxin,

397
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,300
what'd he need Dempsey for?

398
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,400
Well, we don't know yet.

399
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,300
But, she worked for a, she worked for a company, called, uh...

400
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,700
Hithcock Pharmaceuticals.

401
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,500
I think there's a good chance the unsub worked there, too.

402
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,400
Well, let's start with people who fit the profile who've had a recent stressor.

403
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,100
Like, anybody fired from Hichcock in the past 6 months.

404
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,400
Hichcock's a giant company, Sugar Shack, there were over a 100 people fired just this past year.

405
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,400
And so far, none of them fit the profile?
- No.

406
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,400
But, I do have 30 names of people who were downsized and shunted off to other lame companies

407
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,400
with a cut in pay and benefits.

408
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,000
All right, send us the names.  We'll cross-reference them with civil and criminal complaints filed with local PD.

409
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,100
But, I want you to keep digging, and while you're at it,

410
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:30,000
look for any connection to the First New Jersey Federal Bank.
- I'm on it, Angel.

411
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,700
Our guys acting like a workplace mass murderer.

412
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,800
He'd stay close, seething, and he'd plan his revenge.

413
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,200
Well, if he is a workplace killer, what else does that tell us about him?

414
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,500
Well, for one, they don't give themselves up.

415
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,300
He's lost his empathy, his moral compass.

416
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,200
He's capable of anything.

417
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,600
All those innocent people at the bank.

418
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
They meant nothing to him.

419
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,800
He'll take out anybody to forward his cause.

420
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,300
Like Dempsey.

421
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,100
Like Dempsey, and eventually, even himself...

422
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,400
until he finishes taking out his primary targets.

423
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,900
We have no idea where he's going to strike next.

424
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,700
For all we know, he could poison the local reservoir.

425
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Well, the local cops haven't gotten any leads out of Dempsey.

426
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,500
Why don't you go to Hichcock and see if you have any luck.

427
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,900
Yeah.

428
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,100
Miss Dempsey's boss is away for the week.

429
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,000
I just can't believe this happened to her.

430
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,800
Is there anyone you can think of who would want to hurt Miss Dempsey?

431
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,700
I mean, anyone here at work?

432
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,500
She wasn't the type to inspire hatred.

433
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,100
She was pretty quiet, actually.

434
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,300
Would you say that she was awkward?  You know, like, socially?

435
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,100
A little, yeah.  She made a lot of jokes about herself.

436
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,900
You know, self-depracating jokes.

437
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,500
I always thought she'd do a lot better dating if she didn't.

438
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,200
So, she was single, as far as you knew.

439
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,600
I couldn't say one way or the other.

440
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,500
I mean, she never really talked to me about that kind of thing.

441
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Is there anything about her behavior that was unusual lately, um,

442
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,400
anything that you noticed that was out of her normal routine?

443
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,800
Just that she was very busy this last week.

444
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,800
There's a big corporate retreat coming up that she was helping her boss put together.

445
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,100
I'm sorry I can't be of any more help.
- That's all right.

446
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,900
I'm going to go take a look through her things, if that's OK.

447
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:16,400
The police already went through her desk, but feel free.
- Thanks.

448
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,600
Gideon, some of these lay-offs were brutal.

449
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,300
This one chemical engineer, he'd been at Hichcock 19 years when he was downsized.

450
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,200
Yeah, that could certainly inspire homicidal rage, huh?

451
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,800
The guy was in his late forties, head of his department.

452
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,500
Definitely had a generous severance package.

453
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,000
A lot of these guys don't have enough pension.

454
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
They may not be happy about it, but I don't see them killing anyone.

455
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,600
[phone ringing]
- It's Garcia.

456
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,000
Talk to me, Hot Stuff.
- Get this, Cochise.

457
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I found a chemist who works at a company that was bought by Hichcock called Palmay Cosmetics.

458
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,900
Now, here's the thing.  Lynn Dempsey applied for a loan at New Jersey Federal Bank

459
00:29:52,900 --> 00:30:00,400
around the same time this chemist applied for a patent on this anti-aging, breakthrough technology thing called PCO99.

460
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,900
So, maybe he applied for a loan in her name to make his product?

461
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,100
That's what I thought, but both the loan and the patent were rejected because

462
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,500
Hichcock had already applied for the patent and the patent deal had gone through, drumroll please...

463
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,000
New Jersey Federal Bank.

464
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm tracking his cell phone and it won't be long before I have his location.

465
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:57,300
.

466
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,500
Don't move.

467
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,500
He let us take him.  He didn't kill himself.

468
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Doesn't fit the profile of a workplace killer.

469
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Sometimes you miss the mark.

470
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,400
Let's be glad we did.

471
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,800
He's our best chance at stopping the next attack.

472
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,500
Well, his lab had traces of botulin toxin, but no clues as to what he's up to next.

473
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,100
Our only chance is to make him tell us.
- You think he will.

474
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,900
Once caught, these types usually do.

475
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,000
They want the whole world to know about their brilliant plan to destroy their enemies.

476
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,300
In case he doesn't give it up, let's play every angle.

477
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,800
We need to re-examine everything we know about this guy.

478
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,600
I'll check witness reports, forensic evidence,

479
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,400
anything that might be a clue to this guy's plan.

480
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,700
A lot of lives could be at stake.

481
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,200
You were romantically involved with Lynn Dempsey, Mr. Hill?
- Is that what she said?

482
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,200
That's what her sister said.  What happened to her?

483
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,300
The fact is, Lynn was already dead.

484
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,600
That company killed her years ago.
- They kill you, too?

485
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,400
Well, they might as well have.  They took everything from me.

486
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,700
Fruits of my labor, best years of my life.

487
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,500
They took my family, and when there was nothing left to take,

488
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,900
they took two-thirds of my salary and my health insurance.

489
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,900
You have the opportunity to treat people with the mercy that they never showed you.

490
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,500
I can't even begin to tell you how little that means to me.

491
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:47,900
What would it mean to your children?

492
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,900
Listen, you worked hard...

493
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,500
played by the rules your whole life.

494
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,000
You don't wanna go out like this.

495
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,600
If you do, you stoop to their level.

496
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,200
There are  things we can do for you.  There's ways to help you if you'll let us.

497
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,700
What can you do for me?

498
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,000
We're FBI.  We have influence with Justice.

499
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
If you have a legitimate claim, and I believe you do, we can see to it you get fair compensation and credit

500
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,800
And that's all you wanted, right?  A fair deal.

501
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,300
That's all I ever wanted.
- Of course.

502
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,300
You don't think the company knows they screwed you?

503
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:31,000
You don't think everything they do, every move they make, isn't designed to screw people like  you?

504
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You could really get me those things?
- Yeah.

505
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,100
This is my ABA card.  I'm a lawyer and I'm offering to take your case.
[ ABA = American Bar Association ]

506
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,000
And if you accept, I have to do what you say.

507
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,800
This whole thing is being videotaped, I can't lie about that.

508
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:56,700
I would like my sons to know that their Dad created something...

509
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:03,300
I created something good.

510
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:13,000
Ed, tell us.  What did you do?

511
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,700
There's a party this afternoon in the Executive building.

512
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:26,500
All departments get together.

513
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,600
There's a punch bowl.

514
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
Stop!
- Don't drink that!  Put it down!

515
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,300
Put it down right now.

516
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,200
Ladies and gentlemen, listen up.

517
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,400
We are FBI.

518
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,900
I need everybody to remain calm, but there could be some contaminated food here that could make you sick.

519
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,200
Please put down whatever it is that you're eating and drinking, and please

520
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,400
Just take it easy.  We're going to be coming around and asking you some questions.

521
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,000
Is everyone going to be OK?
- Yes.

522
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
OK, the CDC is here with three dozen doses of anti-toxin.

523
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,400
We're going to make sure everyone gets some just in case.

524
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:04,200
Ah, whoever may have gotten sick, we should have caught it in time.

525
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,700
The punch tested positive for botulism toxin.  About a dozen party-goers reported symptoms,

526
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,600
but they've all been given the anti-toxin.

527
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Thanks, JJ.  I'll call you back.
- Bye.

528
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,300
What is it?
- You're right.

529
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,600
It doesn't make sense.

530
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,800
Why didn't Hill take his own life when we had him surrounded?

531
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Guys, I think we have a problem.

532
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,200
I've been looking over the victim reports.

533
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,300
One of the victims that was originally dosed was severely diabetic.

534
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,700
And?
- He wouldn't have taken candy from the candy bowl at the bank.

535
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,500
All of the victims were there.  We know that, but how were they poisoned?

536
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,900
I started looking at the, ah, security footage.

537
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,600
We know Lynn Dempsey replaced some candy from the bowl.

538
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,000
Look how close that jar is to the deposit envelopes.  Now, watch this...

539
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,400
See that?  Her hand is directly in the stack of envelopes.

540
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,700
So, you think the envelopes were poisoned as well as the candy?

541
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,200
As Lynn Dempsey was dying, she kept saying something like "the end."

542
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,100
"The end."  I think that what she was saying was "the envelopes."

543
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:14,100
I mean, what was Hill actually testing? The rohypnol? The LSD?

544
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,800
The delivery system.
- Exactly.

545
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,300
Botulinin toxin and LSD are the only two substances in the world toxic enough to be effective

546
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,100
in doses as small as thousandths of a gram.

547
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,200
Small enough to fit on the glue strip of an envelope.

548
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,700
But, the CDC didn't find any evidence of poison on the envelopes.

549
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,700
They wouldn't have.  The envelopes were destroyed after the cheques were deposited and processed.

550
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,500
So, like the rohypnol, Hill was using the candy to throw us off.

551
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,200
To cover his tracks.

552
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,700
To distract us from the fact that he was testing the envelopes.

553
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:46,400
What I can't figure out if why would he poison the envelopes to test the punch?

554
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,800
Because the punch is a decoy just like the candy.

555
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,800
He's not finished.

556
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:59,400
Gideon!

557
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:11,600
Get him!  Get his head back!

558
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,000
He's dead.

559
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,500
He killed himself before we even got to him.

560
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:22,900
[phone rings] Yeah?

561
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,900
Hotch, it's Morgan.

562
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,200
Listen, I'm looking at these victims from Hichcock, and this doesn't add up.

563
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,400
All of these people are lower-level, regular office workers.

564
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,300
This guy was trying to get back at the people who screwed him.  None of them are here.

565
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,400
What do you mean?  Where are they?

566
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,900
The entire upper management staff is away on a corporate retreat.

567
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,000
The office manager mentioned to Elle that Dempsey was organizing a retreat.

568
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,300
So, then Hill wasn't using Dempsey for access to the office party.

569
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,300
No, he used her for access to the retreat.

570
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,300
Where are the executives?  Can they be reached?
- No. No, not until tomorrow.

571
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,700
They're out in the middle of the woods somewhere.

572
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,900
It's one of those "no cell phones allowed" types of things.

573
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,100
And what are they doing there?

574
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,100
You know, bonding exercises, playing games, that kind of stuff.

575
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,400
What kind of games?

576
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,200
.

577
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,200
When voting, you wanna think about the qualities you admire most, so tomorrow

578
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,400
we tally the votes to find out who our new team leader is.

579
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,300
Now, we don't want a repeat of last year's fiasco, so this year, I brought along some envelopes.

580
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,900
The victims need to ingest the anti-toxin within four hours of the time they were poisoned.

581
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:32,400
And make sure you seal the envelope so there's no cheating.  Fred! [men laughing]

582
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Are we gonna go fishing today?
- Shut up and lick it, Bob.

583
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,600
[ men talking ]

584
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,900
Gideon to Air One, anything?  Anything?

585
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,000
Negative, we checked the first three campsites.  Nothing.

586
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
How about the Parks Service?
- A couple of families on holiday.  None saw the target.

587
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,100
Wait a minute, I'm getting a radio from the staties.
[ Staties = State Police ]

588
00:38:53,100 --> 00:39:12,800
They found something near the access road and trail end 6.  EMTs are en route.
[ EMT = Emergency Medical Technicians ]

589
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,700
These guys are in bad shape and getting worse by the minute.

590
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,100
Who's the sickest?
- That one over there.

591
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,200
Medic!  Been having trouble breathing. ???? I think.

592
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,100
What time did he lick the envelopes?
- They said around 12:30.

593
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,400
Federal Agent.  You're going to be fine.

594
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,400
This is gonna make you feel 100%.  Relax and breathe.

595
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,900
You're gonna be fine.

596
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:46,700
Thank you.

597
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,700
Confucius warned us: "Before you embark on a journey of revenge,

598
00:39:50,700 --> 00:40:11,500
dig two graves." [Confucius: ¤T«ä¦Ó«á¦æ (¤@­Ó®I¹ï¤è, ¤@­Ó®I¦Û¤v) ]

599
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,000
You ought to sleep.

600
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,900
Just finishing my report.

601
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,800
Are you OK?

602
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,800
There's always another file.  This next one's pretty bad.

603
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,400
Yeah.

604
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,000
Of all the departments, why'd you choose the BAU?
[ BAU = FBI's Behavior Analysis Unit ]

605
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,300
You know, I had prosecuted dozens of murder cases and

606
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:41,900
by the time they had reached my desk, I had always felt like it was too late.

607
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:54,400
And I wanted to, ah, stop them before they got to my desk.

608
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,600
That doesn't really answer your question.

609
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,400
No, it doesn't.

610
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:07,700
I guess I'm still trying to figure it out.

611
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:14,100
I should try and get some sleep.
