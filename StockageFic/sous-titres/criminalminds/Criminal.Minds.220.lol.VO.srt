F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit Quantico,Virginia

4
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,700
Excuse me, agent.

5
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,370
I need to speak to Agent Prentiss and one of her superiors.

6
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,360
Uh, she's in a briefing.

7
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,070
Yes, well, it's extremely important.

8
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,220
Mother?

9
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,960
I found my father's car last night

10
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,480
when I took out the garbage.

11
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,660
The door was open,and his bag was on the ground,

12
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,850
but he was gone.

13
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,800
Gone?

14
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,660
He's been kidnapped.

15
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,560
Are you sure?

16
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,560
Yes.

17
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,660
Have you been to the police?

18
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,030
They came directly to me.

19
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,270
As I think you can understand, agent,

20
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,480
they don't easily trust the authorities.

21
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,260
There are protocols,Ambassador Prentiss,the local police.

22
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,570
There's an FBI office in Baltimore.

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,870
Yes, but you do handle kidnapping cases,don't you?

24
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,020
- Yes. - The B.A.U.? 
I'm--it is your mandate.

25
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,390
Yes, when necessary.

26
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,870
Mrs. Chernus' brother,Natalya's uncle,

27
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,660
worked for me at the embassy in the Ukraine.

28
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,570
Be that as it may, there are channels 
these cases must go through,

29
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,770
and if our particular expertise is required..

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,610
(speaking in Russian)

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,130
Please.
We don't have time.

32
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,330
It's just not something that's up to us.

33
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,200
I told you they wouldn't help.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,740
- Mama. 
- Officials are the same everywhere.

35
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,100
Please.It's already 8:15 in the morning.

36
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,530
The kidnappers left a note demanding $100,000

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,900
be wired to a bank account in Moscow by noon today.

38
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,530
That's less than 4 hours.

39
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,400
They say if we don't,they'll send another...

40
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,790
piece every 6 hours after.

41
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,260
Another piece?

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,330
That's my father's wedding ring.

43
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,510
Please help him.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,900
An old russian proverb reminds us,

48
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,760
<i>"There can be no good without evil."</i>

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,410
Where are you taking that?

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,740
We need to process it.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,510
Nyet. Pazhalusta...

52
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,980
She wants his wedding ring.

53
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,910
Please, let us hold the cooler.

54
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,200
It'll be here if you need it.

55
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,300
Agent, it's fine for now.You can leave it.

56
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,900
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,900
This note's in russian.

58
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,870
I need to know the exact text.

59
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,620
"Wire $100,000 to nadka bank account,

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,390
"number 155293846729 by tomorrow noon.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
"If you don't--

62
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,660
if you don't,you'll receive "another body piece

63
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,100
then and every 6 hours after."

64
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,540
That's it exactly?

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,000
Exactly.I'll never forget it.

66
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,900
There's no personalization,no salutation?

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,860
It's not addressed to anyone?

68
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,000
Your father's name isn't mentioned specifically?

69
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,500
No.

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,910
That's odd.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,870
Most ransom notes are personalized.

72
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,500
Frightens the families to know that they've

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,800
been specifically chosen,watched for a time.

74
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,900
It doesn't even say not to call the police.

75
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,700
Russian expats don't have the greatest

76
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,150
experience with their home government.

77
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,200
They tend not to trust officials.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, there's another reason 
they aren't worried.

79
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,900
According to the note,they aren't 
planning on contacting them again.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's completely self-contained.

81
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,500
They expect their instructions to be followed.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,960
We don't have $100,000.

83
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,800
They seem to think that you do.

84
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,800
Garcia, can you get any information on the account?

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,900
I'm already checking.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
The account number does seem to 
correspond with that bank.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,190
Can you get the account holder's name?

88
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,000
I have no idea how russian banks store their data,

89
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,600
how their servers are structured.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,220
- We'd have to call the bank directly. 

91
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,000
- No way.
There's no way a russian bank is gonna

92
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,620
give information on personal accounts.

93
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,800
Well, I could try to go through the embassy in Moscow.

94
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,300
Wh--and say what? The FBI is looking for information

95
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,120
on russian citizens' bank accounts?

96
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
I mean, if we were lucky,

97
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
we'd spend the next 6 years 
drowning in red tape.

98
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,960
I can make some calls.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,400
I may still have some friends in 
the eastern countries.

100
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,000
That would be a great help,Ambassador.

101
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,590
If you'll excuse me.

102
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
We don't have much time.
We need a division of labor.

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,330
Um, morgan, somebody needs 
to go to the Chernus house

104
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,780
in baltimore in case they are contacted again.

105
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,550
We got it.

106
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,200
I wanna be there.

107
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,850
That's a good idea.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Are you fluent enough to stay with the mother

109
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,800
until we get a translator up here?

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm passable.

111
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,000
Then Mrs. Chernus should stay with us.

112
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,900
I'll meet with Agent Cramer in Baltimore...

113
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,000
ok.

114
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,510
See if he has similar open cases.

115
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,250
Baltimore Maryland

116
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,800
We're landing already?

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,060
25-minute flight.

118
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,340
Never knew 25 minutes could feel so long.

119
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,700
And 3 hours could feel so short.

120
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,500
She doesn't look scared.

121
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,500
She looks determined.

122
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,430
She's a tough girl.

123
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,100
When we get to the house,take her inside.

124
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,000
Profile the rooms while you profile her.

125
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,780
What am I lookin' for?

126
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,790
Anything that helps.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,670
Can I get you something, Mrs.Chernus?

128
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,500
 - Water?

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,880
Thanks.

130
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,040
Your mother's got feelers out.

131
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,230
She's confident she can get results.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,950
Well, if anybody can,
it's Ambassador Prentiss.

133
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,500
How's she doing?

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,300
How would you be?

135
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,000
Right.

136
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,500
Uh, Agent Cramer is meeting Gideon 
and Reid at the Chernus house.

137
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,600
This is the translator.I've already briefed her.

138
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,510
Will you introduce her to Mrs. Chernus?

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,940
Come on.
Right this way.

140
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,420
Thank god.
I'm really not very good at russian.

141
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh. Uh, if it would be all right,

142
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,800
I would like to go help my mother.

143
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,500
All right.
Keep me up to date.

144
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,000
Baltimore Maryland

145
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,700
Agent Gideon.
Long time, no see.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,300
Agent Cramer.
Remember Dr. Reid?

147
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,410
Absolutely.

148
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,530
Been briefed on the case?

149
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,040
Didn't need to be.

150
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,260
Been working these mutilation 
kidnappings for over a year.

151
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,510
Really?

152
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,310
Yeah, and I got zipped.

153
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,500
No one cooperates.

154
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,120
Families don't.
The witnesses don't.

155
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,800
Hell, even the victims aren't talking.

156
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,600
I must have a dozen guys walking around 
with missing ring fingers.

157
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:08,999
Why?

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
'Cause we're dealing with criminals.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Obviously.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,800
Not just the kidnappers,genius.

161
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm talkin' about the victims, too.

162
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,290
These are russian criminals kidnapping 
other russian criminals.

163
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,170
Are you sure?

164
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,340
It's the russian mob.

165
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,000
These guys are bold,efficient.

166
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,440
There's no regard for leaving evidence,
and let me guess.

167
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,480
In the note, there's no warning not to go to the police.

168
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,210
There's a clear assumption that they won't.

169
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,550
So you think the chernus family's 
involved in organized crime.

170
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,050
Well, these guys are ruthless,

171
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,320
but they don't normally kidnap civilians.

172
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,930
They target people they know have money

173
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,500
they snuck into the country--

174
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,900
other mobsters, other criminals.

175
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,180
They won't go the police,

176
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,500
because they have something to hide themselves.

177
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,780
Only, this family did come to us.

178
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,930
And they don't have any money.

179
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,600
Well, they all say that.

180
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,240
Get garcia on the horn.

181
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,000
Your friendly neighbourhood oracle of all things

182
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,500
knowable and unknowable at your service.

183
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,000
Garcia, I need you to do a background search

184
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,700
on the entire chernus family.

185
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,200
The victims?

186
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,500
Yeah, get us everything you can on them--

187
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,800
financial records, employment,
immigration status.

188
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
We need that as soon as possible.

189
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,000
I know. I know. 
We're on the clock.

190
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,700
I will compile and reconnect forthwith, 
junior G-man.Oracle out.

191
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,000
Junior G-man?

192
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,000
If the chernuses are hiding anything,
Garcia'll get it to us.

193
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,820
Alright.

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,230
Why are they just standing around?

195
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,730
Natalya, that's the head of the 
local office out there.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,700
It wouldn't do us any good to go running around

197
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,500
without any information.

198
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,100
What kind of information do you need?

199
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,300
Sometimes that's not clear until we actually find it.

200
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,600
Just the three of you living here?

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I had 2 brothers,

202
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,000
but they died of diphtheria when 
we were children.

203
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,810
I'm sorry.

204
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,880
It was a long time ago.

205
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Andrei was 4.Sergei was 6. 
I was 5.

206
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,000
That must have been terrible.

207
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,530
It was hard on my parents.

1
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,500
It was never really the same after.

2
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,240
How do you mean?

3
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,580
They never smiled again,
neither of them,ever...

4
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,090
Who's this?

5
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,320
It's my grandfather.

6
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,300
He held a party job in the former government.

7
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,070
When communism fell,
he was arrested.

8
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,600
Arrested?
He was a criminal?

9
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,910
In the new russia.

10
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,220
He died a year later in prison.

11
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,790
We were already here for 3 years by then.

12
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,700
We fled in 1988.

13
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,120
You fled?

14
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,030
We were smuggled out in delivery trucks.

15
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,560
My father never really believed,

16
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,810
even with democracy,
russia could ever change.

17
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,200
He was right.

18
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,120
What he didn't expect was that

19
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,030
it would allow criminals to follow.

20
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,640
In america,they can only hurt 
you if you're afraid to ask for help.

21
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,420
Is that really true?

22
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,510
Most of the time.

23
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,010
I hope,for my father's sake 
this is one of those times.

24
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,800
What are you doing?
You'll kill him!

25
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,400
Then he dies.

26
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,630
So What?

27
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,440
I...you...please...

28
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,950
The money.

29
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,480
I am going to love cutting you to pieces...

30
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,710
...old man!

31
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,950
We have no money.

32
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,080
Soon.

33
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,830
It's okey.They will send the money.

34
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,670
We--we--we--we have no money.

35
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,540
They'll send it.They always do.

36
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,420
This all involves the russian mafia.

37
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,940
It's really beefed up around here the last 10 years or so.

38
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,740
Started off mainly new york and L.A.

39
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,000
But they send lieutenants from the old country

40
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,260
pakhans they call them to open branch offices in other cities.

41
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,260
Like baltimore.

42
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,930
St. Louis,chicago,dallas...List goes on.

43
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,860
They're mainly offshoots of the odessa mafia

44
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,670
and they're especially tough to crack from the law enforcement standpoint.

45
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,160
I mean,besides being well organized with sophisticated technical equipment

46
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,610
there's vory v zakone to contend with.

47
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,960
-The thieves code. -Yeah.

48
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,370
18 principles they live by.

49
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,200
It's like a bible to these guys.

50
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,110
Stepping outside of it means certain death.

51
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,990
We're not gonna be turning any of them informer anytime soon.

52
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,610
Then we need a witness who'll talk.

53
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,610
There's not much chance of that.

54
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,030
-Gideon? -Wait here.

55
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,050
Mr. Gorban?

56
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,740
Your name's right here on the mailbox.

57
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,920
Mr. Gorban,please.

58
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,800
Who are you?

59
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm with the FBI.

60
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,670
Please,sir.

61
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,210
Your neighbors have had some trouble.

62
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,340
This has nothing to do with me.

63
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,490
You all live in the same community.

64
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,570
I mind my own business.

65
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,040
Been watching us since we got here.

66
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,720
Mr. Gorban,last night

67
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,200
somebody grabbed Mr. Chernus right off the street.

68
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,590
They would've had to have had a vehicle to do it

69
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,210
large vehicle,a van

70
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,390
did you see anything like that?

71
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,780
Something you can describe for me?

72
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,280
I saw nothing.Get off my porch.

73
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,320
Mr. Gorban.Mr. Gorban.

74
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,500
Guess who.

75
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,240
You know these guys?

76
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,870
Oh,yeah.

77
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,890
Arseny lysowsky.

78
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,150
Agent,uh,cramer how are you?

79
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,240
What brings you out,lysowsky?

80
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,570
I heard chernuses had problems.

81
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,590
How did you hear that?

82
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,590
And you are?

83
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,170
Chernuses said they hadn't told anyone.

84
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,830
This is a small community.Word gets out.

85
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,940
Are you a friend of gorban's?

86
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Mr. Gorban wouldn't talk to me.

87
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,790
Would you like me to talk to him for you?

88
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,890
-I can't promise something will come of it--
-You!

89
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,630
Where's my father?!

90
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,930
Take it easy,buddy.

91
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,300
-Wait. Wait.
-Where's my father?!

92
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,980
Wait a minute!

93
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,880
Do you know he has your father?

94
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,090
He's responsible for all this

95
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,610
why everyone's afraid him and his animals.

96
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,390
I'm only here to help.

97
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,660
Help?You're a dog!

98
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,720
Natalya...

99
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,230
How exactly can you help?

100
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,080
In any way they'd like me to.

101
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,780
As I said,this is a small community.

102
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,140
If one is in pain,we're all in pain.

103
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,260
Natalya...

104
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,590
You didn't have to bring outsiders.

105
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,620
Let me help you.

106
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,490
My family will never come to you for help.

107
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,120
Get away from my house!

108
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,890
You are not right,Natalya.

109
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,640
You have made the wrong decision.

110
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,640
What did he say?

111
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,640
Did he threaten you,natalya?

112
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,050
Talk to us,and we can do something about it.

113
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,060
What did he say?

114
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,720
He said I made the wrong decision.

115
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,320
I hope I didn'T.

116
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,630
Time's up.Old man.

117
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,940
But they still have more than two hours.

118
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,020
Give me the knife.

119
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,170
No...please...

120
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,630
Give it to me!

121
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,000
Just tell me.Why are you doing this?

122
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,300
Because the FBI has come into this.

123
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,020
Please...

124
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,780
Natalya.

125
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,420
Natalya.

126
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,700
You all right?

127
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,180
In 2 hours,if we don't send someone money we don't have

128
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,630
my father will be mutilated again,

129
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,710
so,no,I'm not really all right.

130
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,430
We're workin' on it.

131
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,370
You're working on it? You're standing right here with me.

132
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,260
The rest of you are standing in front of the house.

133
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,790
What exactly are you doing?

134
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,690
We collect details.

135
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,340
There are things that people may not even realize

136
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,640
but they help tell us who we're looking for.

137
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,270
I look around.

138
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,870
I see no family pictures after your brothers died

139
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,460
no pictures of you at all after that day.

140
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,110
You had to graduate high school here,yeah?

141
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,510
There's nothing to commemorate it anywhere.

142
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,840
You don't have a family room

143
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,610
so this should be the center of your home 
but look at your furniture.

144
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,340
Sure,they may be old antiques,
but they look new.

145
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,190
They're hardly ever used.
Nobody sits here.

146
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,090
You have 2 chairs at your dining table  
but 3 people live here

147
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,550
so obviously you don't eat together.

148
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,390
Your shoes,they may look like prada

149
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,670
but they're knockoffs.

150
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,320
Your bag, it's a fake designer bag.

151
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,110
I mean no disrespect,Natalya

152
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,410
but you're trying to look like 
something you aren't.

153
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,550
That tells me that you have no money

154
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,860
and you just don't want anybody to know.

155
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,610
Why'd you need to know all this?

156
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,710
It's what we call victimology 
and it's very important.

157
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,360
We need to know why these people 
chose your family to victimize.

158
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,140
You have any information on 
Lysowsky at your field office?

159
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,650
Got a lot about the organization 
less about him personally.

160
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,340
I'll get Garcia on it.

161
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,310
You have other kidnapping mutilation case files?

162
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,790
Thin ones.

163
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,440
2 hours,14 minutes.

164
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,430
Before you call garcia,give Morgan the keys to the suburban.

165
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,160
We're goin' to Agent Cramer's office.

166
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,240
I can give you a crash course on everything 
you need to know about these people.

167
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,590
How are you enjoying your assignment to the B.A.U.?

168
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,840
Well,enjoying is an odd description.

169
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,830
Is it?

170
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,940
Well,we,um,deal with some pretty horrible things.

171
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,210
I thought that was where you wanted to be.

172
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,900
It is,definitely.

173
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,120
Then you do enjoy it.

174
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,790
All I'm saying is "enjoy" feels wrong.

175
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,720
All right.
What would you call it?

176
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,370
Why do we have to end up in an interrogation?

177
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,520
-Ambassador.
-Yes?

178
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,210
Gregor Popovich returning.

179
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,780
Thank you.

180
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,030
Gregor.

181
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,390
My daughter Em's in the room with me.

182
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,780
Little Emily?

183
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,950
You have some good news for me,I hope.

184
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,370
I'm afraid not.

185
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,510
No one in the russian government is 
going to officially give you permission

186
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,490
to look into the account holder information in this bank.

187
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,930
Do they understand this is an emergency?

188
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,710
They were not impressed.

189
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,880
Uh,thank you for trying,Gregor.

190
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,850
I wish I could have done more.

191
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,850
-Good-bye,Emily.
-Good-bye,sir.

192
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,980
I really thought he could do this.

193
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,210
Um,I should head back to the office 
and let them know.

194
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,520
Yeah. 
Please tell Agent Hotchner I'm sorry.

195
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,100
Right.

196
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,260
These tattoos are amazingly detailed.

197
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,160
It's a form of communication.

198
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,970
Each tattoo has meaning.

199
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,390
Symbols tells the other criminals 
who the counterfeiters are

200
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,250
the murderers,the armed robbers.

201
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,850
There's a guide in that folder right there.

202
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,840
You said they were very organized.

203
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,320
A boss called a pakhan,or a head thief in law

204
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,910
controls 4 criminal cells.

205
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,770
Now, Lysowsky is the Pakhan in this area.

206
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,070
The Pakhan employs 2 underbosses to watch over the brigadiers.

207
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,870
You saw them today with Lysowsky.

208
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,000
Uh,what's that circle over there to the right?

209
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,010
The Obochek.

210
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,670
It's a pooled monetary fund the groups use for bribes

211
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,820
and other types of support.

212
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,530
And where does that money come from?

213
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,750
Nobody really knows.

214
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,120
I'd guess it comes from any number of sources,
above and below.

215
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,860
It really is just an open pool of cash

216
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,080
that any Pakhan can use almost 
without question.

217
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,450
Excuse me.Cramer.

218
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,490
Penelope Garcia from Quantico.

219
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,220
Put her through.

220
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,230
What do you have,Garcia?

221
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,890
Ok,finding information on this man
not as easy as you think.

222
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:28,040
Arseny Lysowsky,born 1940 in Dolgoprudniy.

223
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,270
Seems to be a lifelong criminal.

224
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,370
I have no employment records of him at all.

225
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,330
Married Katya Fulenko in 1960.

226
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,340
She died 2 years later.

227
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,510
He served 23 years in 4 remote prisons in perm.

228
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,940
That's a remote region of the northern Ural mountains,

229
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,800
for those of you playing the home game.

230
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,630
He seems to be in America legally

231
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,390
and I have searched every nook and cranny of 
the Chernuses' lives

232
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,660
and I have found nothing even remotely untoward.

233
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,930
They're law-abiding, taxpaying american citizens.

234
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,790
Thank you,Garcia.

235
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,130
Vory v zakone.

236
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,880
The thieves code.

237
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,930
Breaking any of those tenets is punishable by death.

238
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,460
"Forsake all relatives,mother,father,brother,sister."

239
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,060
"Not have a family of his own."

240
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,100
"No wife. No children."

241
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,090
Family makes you vulnerable.

242
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,740
Lysowsky owns a restaurant called little kiev.

243
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,890
Well,you're not gonna find too many 
civilians eating there.

244
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,720
But it doesn't say anything in here 
about helping a nonthief.

245
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,610
No,sir.

246
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,400
Well,why would he offer to help the chernuses?

247
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,930
Well,the chernuses are probably fellow criminals.

248
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,370
Why--why do you kidnap the father,

249
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,470
and then you offer to help get him back?

250
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,090
If I understand this man,it ju--

251
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,550
just doesn't make any sense.

252
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,100
Where would he be right now?

253
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,690
Probably where he always is,

254
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,600
in little kiev restaurant.

255
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,990
-Anything? 
-Her contacts fell through.

256
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,500
Really?

257
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,990
Apparently she's not infallible.

258
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,650
Was there something else?

259
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,410
No. Uh,I just wish there was something 
more we could be doing for this family.

260
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,480
We still have over an hour.

261
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,560
Yeah.

262
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,750
Are you hungry?I can make something.

263
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,230
Oh,no. No.

264
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,030
Thanks. I'm fine.

265
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,250
I guess I'm like my mother.
When she's upset,she cooks.

266
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,430
Heh. Really?

267
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,790
Yeah,mine does,too.I think that's just a,
uh,mom thing.

268
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,470
-Where is your mother?
-Chicago.

269
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,210
That's where I'm from.

270
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,550
I'm from Dolgoprudniy,
just north of Moscow.

271
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,530
-You expecting someone?
-No.

272
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,410
It's uri.
Lives down the street.

273
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,510
Go ahead.

274
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,910
-A man said to give this to you.
-What?

275
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,630
He said you needed it right away.

276
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,650
Get in the house.Get in the house.

277
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,800
Welcome to little kiev.

278
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,000
These tattoos are like books on their skin

279
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,190
gives their whole life story.

280
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,890
Well,these guys are nothing if not dedicated.

281
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,590
This all the information you have on 
additional kidnappings?

282
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,760
Like I said,no one cooperates.

283
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,210
Most of those pictures,the guys 
with the missing ring fingers

284
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,400
we had to take 'em from surveillance vehicles

285
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,060
even when we confronted them and 
asked them about the obviously fresh wounds,

286
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,470
none of 'em would talk.

287
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,910
-Vory v zakone.
-So they're all criminals?

288
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,030
They were kidnapped,and they aren't dead.

289
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,030
So they're payin'.

290
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,050
Gideon.

291
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,490
They didn't wait,man.

292
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,330
What?

293
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,840
They didn't wait until noon.

294
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,910
What are you talkin' about?

295
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,110
A kid just came to the door,and he had--

296
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,480
they cut off Mr. Chernus' ear.

297
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,850
But the--they got more than an hour left.

298
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,240
They had the kid deliver it in a box with a handwritten note

299
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,580
and it says,"we now want $500,000,and you have until 1:00."

300
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,950
Raised the ransom.

301
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,790
Why? Why?

302
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,670
Well,it also says,"say hello to the fbi."

303
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,130
Ok.

304
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,090
What do you want me to do?

305
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,410
Let hotch know what happened.

306
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,000
Where's natalya?

307
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,360
In the bathroom,and she's hysterical.

308
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,410
Let her know we're gonna bring her father home.

309
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,730
-Are we?
-Yes.

310
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,230
They didn't wait?

311
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,240
They cut off his ear.

312
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,120
They increased the ransom to half a million.

313
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,190
How much money do they think the Chernuses have?

314
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,440
Agent cramer,I'm gonna have to ask you to wait outside while we talk to lysowsky.

315
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,720
-Why?
-He knows you.

316
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,040
He deals with you on a regular basis.

317
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,410
You're someone he needs to save face with.

318
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,640
I don't want him posturing.

319
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,760
Natalya.

320
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,670
Listen,I know it feels like it may be too late

321
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,000
but gideon thinks we may be onto something.

322
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,880
Natalya.Natalya?

323
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,390
Damn!

324
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,440
There is nothing for you here.

325
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,360
No,it's all--it's all right,alexander.

326
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,930
Allow the gentlemen in.

327
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,170
Would you like something to eat?

328
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,860
This borscht is exquisite.

329
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,990
It's my mother's old country recipe.

330
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,740
Didn't you forsake all your relatives when 
you swore the thieves code?

331
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,200
I didn't forsake her recipes.

332
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,570
Borscht?

333
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,010
No,thanks.

334
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,670
I'd love a taste.

335
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,940
You know,you should take some home.

336
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,560
You will not regret.

337
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,370
We need to talk,arseny.

338
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,900
We are on a first-name basis?

339
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,130
I still don't even know who you are.

340
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,850
I think I understand something about this.

341
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,900
You have a problem.

342
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,200
Thank you.

343
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,440
I do?

344
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,920
That's why you came to the chernuses' house this morning.

345
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,020
I went there to offer my help.

346
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,200
There's no reason I can see for a man like you to 
help a family like the chernuses.

347
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,900
Man like me?

348
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,570
4 watchtowers and a convict signifies a stay in prison.

349
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,460
Each one of those crosses represents 
an individual sentence.

350
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,390
23 years in prison in the ural mountains...

351
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,750
doesn't breed a compassionate friend.

352
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,620
You think you know russian prison life?

353
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,550
I know human behavior.

354
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,690
You haven't where you've gotten in this organization

355
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,010
by rching out to civilian families in need.

356
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,320
No,sir. You have a problem,arseny.

357
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,100
Someone in your organization's out of control.

358
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,460
You may know american behavior...

359
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,080
but you don't understand us.

360
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,780
Don't forget your borscht on the way out.

361
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,890
If anyone in odessa learns you have a maverick

362
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,620
you lose everything.

363
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,370
Good-bye.

364
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,730
They might even kill you.

365
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,900
I am in control.

366
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,270
You know tattoos?

367
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,260
Then you'll know what this means.

368
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,760
You're a thief in law,the boss.

369
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,150
In my world,there is no such a thing as a control problem.

370
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,350
There is controlled... and there is dead.

371
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,490
Mr. Lysowsky...you said you could help me.

372
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,650
Don't you already have help?

373
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,250
I made a mistake.

374
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,020
I talked to my father on the phone.

375
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,290
-He's fine.
-What?

376
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,280
Thank you for coming,but I don't need your help.

377
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,480
Has something happened?

378
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,260
Yes. The kidnappers didn't wait until noon.

379
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,810
They cut off Mr. Chernus' ear 
and sent it to his daughter.

380
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,040
Oh,god.

381
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,140
Is he--

382
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,880
no. We don't think so.

383
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:09,210
But they've given us a new deadline 
and increased the ransom demand.

384
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,710
You still think I enjoy all of this?

385
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,560
Are they still instructed to wire the money 
to the same bank in moscow?

386
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,150
Yes. I think so.

387
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,140
Something your computer expert said this morning about

388
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,480
if she understood how russian banks hold their data

389
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,680
she could get information about account holders.

390
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,560
Right.

391
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,030
After you left,I called gregor back.

392
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:33,190
He made some calls,gave me this.

393
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,960
He said she would understand it.

394
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,320
Natalya!

395
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,890
Natalya,wait a minute!

396
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,860
Natalya!

397
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,850
What are we doin'?

398
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,350
We're just gonna let her go with him?

399
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,640
What choice do we have,man?

400
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,290
Oh,so what?

401
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,190
What,we get on a plane,

402
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,880
we go home and pretend none of this happened?

403
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,120
We have a victim who claims the 
crime never occurred.

404
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,890
No. We have a daughter of a victim who 
claims the crime never occurred.

405
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,470
Well,if she says that she talks to him and he's ok,

406
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,750
then what proof do we have it even happened?

407
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,440
The body parts.

408
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,680
Where's the ear?

409
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,220
Natalya's got it.

410
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,540
-J.J.
-Yeah,morgan.

411
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,270
Look in the cooler.

412
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:29,270
Mrs. Chernus,I need to look inside the cooler.

413
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,350
What?

414
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,380
It's for morgan.

415
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,000
Tell her I-I'm not gonna take anything.

416
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,650
I just need to look inside.

417
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,430
The finger's gone,too.

418
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,440
Natalya.Natalya!

419
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,750
She's not here,

420
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,540
and the garbage was never taken out.

421
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,080
What?

422
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,580
When hotch first talked to her,

423
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,920
he said she noticed her father's car in the driveway 
when she took the garbage out.

424
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,580
Right.

425
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,290
Garbage can in the kitchen is completely full.

426
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,460
-She never took it out.
-She lied.

427
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,690
She could halfway to dogo-wherever by now.

428
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,340
-Dolgoprudniy?
-Yeah.

429
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,800
It's the town she's from in russia.

430
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,920
Isn't that where lysowsky's from?

431
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,660
It's bread crumbs.

432
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,720
I'm sorry.

433
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:09,790
It's a set of address strings and 
passwords a path. See?

434
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm jumping from site to site,country to country

435
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,280
and each time I get a cursor

436
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,880
I put in the next address and password.

437
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,760
It's the equivalent of bread crumbs 
to hansel and gretel.

438
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,520
What is that?

439
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,700
It's downloading the structure of nadka 
bank's server to me.

440
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,770
Are you kidding?

441
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,910
Whoever gave these instructions is really good.

442
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,350
So you can get the account information noW.

443
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,410
If I can figure this out.

444
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,500
So we have a daughter who lied about how 
she discovered the crime

445
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,300
none of the missing body parts to 
prove anything actually happened

446
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,810
and a generic ransom note that 
mentions no names.

447
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,510
So what are we sayin'?

448
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,900
Natalya was a part of this.

449
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,310
How did I not see this comin'?

450
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,420
How could any of us,man?

451
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,410
She sought us out.

452
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,770
We were so blinded by the fact that she trusted us

453
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,100
that we never considered not trusting her.

454
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,870
-I'm in.
-You're kidding.

455
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,530
It's a pretty archaic system once the 
parameters are understood.

456
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,290
Account number,please?

457
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:24,780
-Ok.
-155293846729.

458
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,330
Why?

459
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,770
Why would she even bring us into this?

460
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:43,850
Yeah. What?

461
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,770
You're sure?

462
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,450
Ok. Thanks.

463
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,090
Garcia just got into the bank's system.

464
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,730
Somebody wired $500,000 into the account 10 minutes ago.

465
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,390
Who wired it?

466
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:56,400
She didn't say where it came from,

467
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,410
but the name on the account is lyov fulenko.

468
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,950
She says that's Lysowsky's wife's 
maiden name,fulenko.

469
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,690
Why did she need to bring us in?

470
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,790
'Cause she needed to put pressure on the other victim.

471
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,200
Other victim?

472
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,960
Money. 500,000.

473
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,560
It's all here.

474
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,470
You see,old man.

475
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,630
I told you they'd pay money.

476
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,650
We're finished.

477
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,540
Yes,fyodor.

478
00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:42,440
We are finished.

479
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,150
Mr. Gorban,I'm not gonna ask you anything official.

480
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,110
Just have a simple question.

481
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,920
I don't have anything to say.

482
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,280
You were kidnapped once,Mr. Gorban?

483
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,100
When the men kidnapped you,who paid your ransom?

484
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,030
Mr. Gorban,your house,the way you're dressed,

485
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,680
you don't have any tattoos--you're not a criminal.

486
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,680
No.

487
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,460
Well,how could your family have paid a ransom for you?

488
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,180
Was arseny lysowsky,wasn't it?

489
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,770
Thanks,mr. Gorban.

490
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,180
Paid the ransom already.

491
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,750
Paid all the ransoms.

492
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,730
SiT.

493
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,830
Are they gonna kill mr. Chernus?

494
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,800
No.

495
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,960
Why are you paying these ransoms?

496
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,690
-What's goin' on here?
-I think I know.

497
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,240
The account is in the name of lyov fulenko.

498
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,630
Lyov's a man's name,a son's name.

499
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,460
Vory v zakone.

500
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,150
Never have a family of your own. 
No wife.No children.

501
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,010
"Lyov." You know what it means?

502
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,480
Time's up,old man.

503
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,670
No.

504
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,280
Na-natalya?

505
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,050
When we started this a year ago,

506
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,340
we agreed there would be no witnesses.

507
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,160
Where we're going,witnesses won't matter.

508
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,620
No,my love.That is sloppy.

509
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,350
If he tells my father who did this,

510
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,340
everything we've done will fall.

511
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,830
He'll hunt us down.

512
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,090
Let me say good-bye to him.

513
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,800
I'm sorry,papa.

514
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,140
I couldn't do it anymore...

515
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:14,360
Living in that house with my brothers 
hanging over everything...

516
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,090
the--the sadness and the struggle.

517
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,560
You brought us here so we could have
things and we have nothinG.

518
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,430
We're nothing. I need more.

519
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:34,680
I'm gonna go away,gonna live my life happy.

520
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,040
I'm sorry.

521
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,210
I knew when the first man was taken.

522
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,720
I knew who had done it.

523
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:54,850
No one else would be so bold and so stupid.

524
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,320
Tell me where mr. Chernus is.

525
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,850
At first,it didn't mean much.

526
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,080
It was a way of letting him earn his own money.

527
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,090
I could afford it.

528
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,990
It came from the fund,and...

529
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,660
no one questions the use of the fund.

530
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Where is he?

531
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,220
What else could I do?

532
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:19,230
I couldn't admit that i wasn't blessing the kidnappings.

533
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:22,550
I couldn't even admit that my son existed.

534
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,710
Chernus will be home in a few minutes.

535
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,660
You should be there.

536
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,090
He's going to need medical attention.

537
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,170
Go. Go.

538
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,010
What are you gonna do?

539
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,170
Vory v zakonE.

540
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,100
We take care of our own troubles.

541
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,590
I'll wait outside.

542
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,050
Put the knife down,lyov.

543
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,230
It's time to pay.

544
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,310
"Happy families are all alike.

545
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,160
Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."

546
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,560
Leo tolstoY.

547
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,660
We got him.

548
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,980
Mr. Chernus is safe now.

549
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,680
Oh. Good.

550
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,020
We couldn't've done it without you.

551
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,140
Ah. Well,I'm sure that isn't true.

552
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,280
Agent hotchner wanted me to 
say thank you for him.

553
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,910
Well,tell him I'm glad I could help.

554
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:50,070
Anyway,I thought you would wanna 
know how it all came out.

555
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,770
It was nice to feel needed again.

556
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,970
What--what did you say?

557
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:59,840
Well,I don't mean to be overly dramatic,but...

558
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,170
I am an ambassador without an assignment.

559
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,910
You--you've been without assignments before.

560
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,990
Yeah,but never for this long,

561
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:12,120
and one does begin to wonder.

562
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,960
What? Did I say something wrong?

563
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,070
I don't think I've ever seen you 
doubt yourself before.

564
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:23,440
I doubt myself all the time,emily.

565
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,980
It's just not showing it.

566
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,180
That's what being a diplomat's all about.

567
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,160
Would you like to go to dinner?

568
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,800
-My treat?
-Definitely.

569
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,040
Yeah.

570
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,440
Yeah. Think I would.

571
