1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,400
* there's a man
going 'round *

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,900
* takin' names *

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,100
* and he decides
who to free *

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,600
* and who to blame *

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,600
* everybody won't be treated
all the same *

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,400
* there'll be a golden ladder
reaching down *

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,500
* when the man comes around... *

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,000
You wake me again tonight,

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,900
It'll be
the chainsaw for you.

10
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,700
This is, uh, unit 2,

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,700
Responding
to the explosion
at the norris place.

12
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,500
Go ahead, unit 2.

13
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,100
We got one d.O.A.

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,800
I think it's rod norris.

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,700
Send e.M.S. And fire.

16
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,500
Heck...send everybody.

17
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,200
They're on their way.

18
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,100
Hi. Um...

19
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,100
My name's, uh, spencer,

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
And i'm a...

21
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,200
I don't really know
what i am.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,400
Hello, spencer.

23
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,900
This is my--
This is my first meeting.

24
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,800
Welcome.
Welcome.

25
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,500
Thanks. Thank you.

26
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,000
Um...i guess
i, uh--

27
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,900
I know i had a...

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,500
A problem with
dilaudid, but, um...

29
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,100
I stopped.

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,300
Like...10 months ago
i stopped.

31
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,800
I thought it was over,

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,700
But recently i'm--
I've really been...

33
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,700
Your literature
uses the term "craving."

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,200
It started like a month ago.I...

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,400
A--A suspect was murdered
in front of me.

36
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,600
A--A kid,

37
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,500
And i thought that
i could save the kid,

38
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,300
But i couldn't, and...

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,500
Sorry. I'm sorry.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,500
I've seen a lot
of that stuff before,

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,500
But for some reason
that kid's face is really, uh...

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,400
Stuck in my brain.

43
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,600
You know? It's really,
uh--I can't...

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,100
And i...

45
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,300
I want to forget...

46
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,800
About him, and...

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,200
I just want to escape.

48
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,900
Sorry.

49
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,700
I have to go.
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,500
Spencer.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Sorry. I'm late.

52
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,800
Places to go,
people to profile.

53
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,900
You know who i am.

54
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,900
Of course i do, sir.
I just--I didn't, um,

55
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,900
Expect to see a man
of your position here.

56
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,900
Here, there's no sirs.

57
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,900
I'm just john here.
Uh-Huh.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,200
And this is not something
you talk about at the office.

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,500
Especially our office.

60
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,300
Sorry. I really do
have to go.

61
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,400
Here.

62
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,800
Take this.

63
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,700
That's my one-Year medallion.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
It took me 6 years
to get it.

65
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,800
For the past 13 years,
i've never left home
without it.

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,800
Because i know
if i forget that,

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,500
I'll lose my gun,
my credentials,

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,400
My home.

69
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,600
Everything.

70
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,600
Hold on to it.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
I only have 10 months.

72
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,100
I know.

73
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,900
It's your most prized
possession.

74
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,300
It is.

75
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,500
You're just giving it
to me?

76
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,600
No.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
A couple of months
when you get your year,

78
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,100
You give it back to me.

79
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,700
I really don't understand.

80
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,400
You will.

81
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,700
Officer letts shot this
just before he was killed.

82
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,300
Sorry i'm late.

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,599
I hope she was worth it.
I hope it was a she.

84
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,500
Oh, i'm sorry.
I was in the movies.

85
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,300
Oh, really? Why don't you
tell us what it was about?

86
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,700
I had to leave early,
so i can't really--

87
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,000
I know it's late,
i know we're tired,

88
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,400
But we've got
two dead cops.

89
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,700
All right, uh, the resident,
rod norris, was d.O.A.

90
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,500
They're still trying
to i.D. The remains
of the second victim,

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,700
Whom they believe is his
16-Year-Old daughter jordan.

92
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,700
From the condition
of the remains

93
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,500
She would have
had to have been
inside the house

94
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,300
Close to the source
of the blast.

95
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
Clearly,
they used the bombing

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,600
To set the officers up
for an ambush.

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,600
It's a well-Established
terrorist tactic.

98
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,900
First wave
takes out civilians,

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The second wave takes
out first responders.

100
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,500
The locals are
thinking terrorism

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,900
In west bune, texas?

102
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,500
Not exactly
a tier-One target,

103
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,000
But dhs did issue
a terror alert

104
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,200
For the border states
yesterday,

105
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,500
Just due to the timing
and nature of the attack.

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,700
I've never heard
of this place.

107
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,300
I mean, the militia,
ok, that i could see.

108
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,100
Yeah, well,
it is close to the border.

109
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,000
It could be traffickers
sending a message.

110
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,500
Whoever it is,
they gunned down
two cops

111
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,800
And blew up
a teenage girl.

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Till they're stopped,
no one in that town
is safe.

113
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,300
We need to be cautious
with the locals.

114
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
They've lost
two of their own,

115
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,600
They're anxious,
they're scared,

116
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,100
And they're
gonna want revenge.

117
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,000
Can you blame 'em?

A sad soul
can kill you quicker,

122
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,800
Far quicker,
than a germ."

123
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,400
John steinbeck.

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,100
Get that over there.

125
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,000
Sheriff hallum?

126
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,400
Jennifer jareau.

127
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,400
This is the team.

128
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,200
Agents hotchner, rossi,
dr. Reid,

129
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,000
Prentiss, and morgan.

130
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
We're really sorry
for your loss.

131
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,500
Thank you.
Where do we start?

132
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,200
First victim, rod norris.

133
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
Manager of
the chemical plant
over at ibis.

134
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,100
No arrests in 10 years
since his wife left him.

135
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,000
I can't blame her
for leaving him,

136
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,700
But it's a shame
she left jordan behind.

137
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,300
What can you tell us
about jordan?

138
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,100
Sweet girl, a bit slow.

139
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,200
Slow? She was
mentally challenged?

140
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,700
Not quite. Special ed
and all that stuff.

141
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,900
Takes some talking
to her to notice it.

142
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,900
I think
her mother leaving
took its toll.

143
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Sheriff, i'd like to gather
your people back at the office

144
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,900
So i can brief them
all together.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
Sure.
But i'm staying here.

146
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,400
Of course.

147
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,400
Thank you.

148
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,500
The blast
was localized here.

149
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,800
The room's been sealed off.

150
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,600
There's some plastic,
duct tape on the doorsills,

151
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,700
Windows, too.

152
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,900
Cordite. Gunpowder.

153
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, they found
a dozen canisters, it says.

154
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,700
Well, the concentration
of damage

155
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,400
Puts those canisters
right here by the door.

156
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,100
He seals the kitchen,

157
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,600
Blows out
the pilot light,

158
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,500
Trapping the gas in here

159
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
Near the primary charge.

160
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,200
If she was here,

161
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,100
Between the charge
and the window...

162
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,100
Boom.

163
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,700
Rod norris ends up
in the tree,

164
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Jordan ends up
in the field.

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
They didn't care
about the rest of the house,

166
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,000
So the whole thing's
designed to focus the blast

167
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,200
On whoever came through
that door.

168
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,900
Yeah, but what
was the trigger?

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,100
Rod norris.
He was a smoker.

170
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,000
And they knew
he would be coming
through this door.

171
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
And they knew
he'd be smoking
when he did it.

172
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,800
Hit pattern says they
were fired on full auto.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,100
Tight grouping for it.

174
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
Single burst
put them both down.

175
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,000
That takes skill

176
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
And some serious
training.

177
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,800
Letts lands here,
still alive,

178
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,900
Savage falls there dead.

179
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,200
But i walk past letts.

180
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,300
And i shoot lou savage
in the face

181
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
When i know
he's already dead.

182
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,400
This was personal.

183
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,400
They knew each other?

184
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,800
Enough to know rod norris

185
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,400
Would enter through
the back door while smoking.

186
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,400
And that lou savage was
on duty and would respond.

187
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,900
So what are we
talking about here?

188
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,000
This wasn't terrorism,
domestic or otherwise.

189
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,900
Terrorists rarely know
their victims,

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
At least not personally.

191
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,100
Because they knew
rod norris was a smoker
who used his back door?

192
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,600
And shot deputy savage
in the face
at pointblank range.

193
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,100
They weren't being
thorough?

194
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,200
No. He walked
past letts,
who was alive,

195
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,800
Shoots savage in
the face when he knows
he's already dead.

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,800
Responders were coming.
That last shot
was risky overkill.

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,100
Overkill means rage.
Rage means a close personal
relationship.

198
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Rod norris and lou savage
were the specific targets
of this attack.

199
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,200
Sheriff, can you think
of anyone with a close
personal connection

200
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,600
To rod norris
and lou savage?

201
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,600
I didn't think about it
because of the terror alert.

202
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,000
Think about what?
Owen.

203
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,700
Owen savage.

204
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,700
Lou's son was dating
jordan norris.

205
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,000
My deputies didn't
find owen at home.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,200
How long did you know
lou savage?

207
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,700
My whole life.

208
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,700
And deputy savage's wife?

209
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,700
Hope?

210
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,700
How did she die?

211
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,600
Drunk driver in '02.

212
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,900
Lou was
in afghanistan.

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,800
Owen lived with us
until he got back.

214
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,300
Semper fi.

215
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,300
How long was lou savage
in the marines?

216
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,000
12 years.
He was discharged
so he could raise owen.

217
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,600
Is that why
he resented them?

218
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
Pardon me?

219
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,600
Uh, did lou blame
his wife and son

220
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,000
For ending his career
in the marines?

221
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,100
Lou was a good man.

222
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,400
A good man that doesn't
have a single photo

223
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,600
Of his dead wife
or only son anywhere
in his entire house.

224
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,500
I know this is hard,
and if we had more time
we would be more sensitive,

225
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,500
But we don't.

226
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,100
Hope was
the drunk driver.

227
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,700
I didn't write it up
that way,

228
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,300
But
it didn't matter.

229
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
Her drinking was
no secret in town.

230
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Where's owen's room?

231
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,400
Right over there.

232
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Here's
your gun safe.

233
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
I don't know
the combination.

234
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,300
Start with birthdays--

235
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,100
Lou's, owen's, hope's.

236
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,000
Hotch.

237
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,100
Dress blues in plastic.

238
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
No pics of wife and son.

239
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
No luck.

240
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,500
Try 11-10-75.

241
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,000
November 10, 1975?
What's that?

242
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,700
1775.
Marine corps birthday.

243
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
You might have just sold me

244
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
On that profiling of yours.

245
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,900
That's bad.

246
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,700
How bad?

247
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,900
Lou was
our tactical trainer.

248
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,500
He had
a whole collection

249
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,900
Of automatic weapons
and handguns.

250
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Which he taught owen
to shoot.

251
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,200
Gun safe is empty.

252
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,400
That's a surprise.

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
That's
james dean's porsche.

254
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,200
No pictures
of james dean, though.

255
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,600
That's a bad sign.

256
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,600
Especially when
your mother died
in a car accident.

257
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,500
Still haven't found
the father
of the year award.

258
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,700
You already check
his computer?

259
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,300
It's password encrypted.

260
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,600
Well, smart move
if your dad's a cop.

261
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,000
Ah, assuming he cares
enough to snoop.

262
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,100
Hey, reid.
Check yourself.

263
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
That sheriff out there
wanted to take your head off.

264
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,900
I think hotch
might have let him.

265
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,100
All his clothes
are black.

266
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,400
The same here.

267
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,400
Just like his friend
johnny cash.

268
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,000
So owen identifies as being
a misunderstood loner.

269
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,900
You know,
i wish all our unsubs would
just tack their profiles

270
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,200
On their walls
like this for us.

271
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,000
It doesn't mean
anything.

272
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,800
What, you grew up
in chicago,
a high school jock,

273
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,800
You had pictures
of scottie pippen
and michael jordan

274
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,400
All over your walls,
trophies everywhere?

275
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,400
Yeah.

276
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,400
But you forgot
walter payton.

277
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,100
Not to mention
the sexy ladies

278
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,500
<i>Of the sports illustrated
swim suit issues.</i>

279
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,600
Smart money says
you didn't paint
your mirrors black.

280
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,100
I guess owen
didn't like what he saw.

281
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,700
Don't try to stop me!
I need to get by!

282
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,400
Reid.

283
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,400
Let me by, let me by.

284
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,500
Don't you try
to stop me! Let me by!

285
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,500
Is it true?

286
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,100
Sarah, please.

287
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
If it's true, you tell me.
Sarah--

288
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
Did lou's freak son
shoot byron?

289
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,100
Go home
to your kids, sarah.

290
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,000
The kids need you
at home.

291
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
My children need
their daddy.

292
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,100
Officer letts' wife.

293
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,100
?????????

294
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,200
You know what to do.

295
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,100
You find that little
son of a bitch.

296
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,600
You find him
and do what's right.

297
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,400
Why do i get the feeling
she's not going to be
the only one

298
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,200
With that sentiment?

299
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Stay here
and work the room.

300
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,700
Reid and i are going to
go to the high school

301
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,400
And talk to owen's
teachers and friends.

302
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,700
We need to get a profile

303
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,700
And figure out
where he's going.

304
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,600
All right.

305
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,600
He's heading
out of town.

306
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,600
We found his car
out by the interstate,

307
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,300
Right next to
victim number 5.

308
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,800
I can't use
the texas rangers here.

309
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,000
I need them working
roadblock.

310
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,100
Owen's truck is
completely cleaned out.

311
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,600
He didn't want
to leave us any clues
where he was headed.

312
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,400
He's a smart kid.

313
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,000
So far,
every move he's made

314
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,100
Has been clever
and well-Planned.

315
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,500
What about the victim?

316
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,500
Single gunshot wound
to the face.

317
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,400
Who is he?

318
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,100
Kyle borden, 19.
Worked the register.

319
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,100
His car is gone.
We already put it
out on the wire.

320
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,500
So owen stops by here
on his way
to the interstate,

321
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,200
Grabs supplies,
marches kyle out back,
kills him,

322
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
And steals
his el camino.

323
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,400
No evidence kyle resisted.
Owen didn't have to kill him.

324
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,200
Well, he certainly
didn't have to shoot him
in the face.

325
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,200
He wanted kyle
to see it coming.

326
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,400
Kyle was a couple of years
ahead of owen in school.

327
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,100
Follows he'd know him.

328
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,900
Excuse me.

329
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,900
Owen didn't
just know him,

330
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,900
Owen hated him.

331
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
The question is, why?

332
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,300
It's been restocked
recently.

333
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,600
According
to the invoice,

334
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,400
This last night
after closing.

335
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,300
Good.

336
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,100
We have a problem.

337
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,100
He took gallon jugs
of milk,

338
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,100
Frozen pizzas,

339
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,100
Cold cuts...

340
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,300
But no water.

341
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,100
You don't take
frozen foods
and perishables

342
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,100
On a road trip.

343
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,100
Roadblocks
aren't gonna work.

344
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,100
Why is that?

345
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,100
He's not on the road.

346
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,200
He's still here.
He never left.

347
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,500
Correction--
They're still here.

348
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,800
That wasn't
jordan's body
we found.

349
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,700
Who was it?
Not who. What.

350
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,100
The remains we sent
to the m.E.

351
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,800
Turned out to be
3 hams and a dozen
bone-End ribeyes

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,799
Stuffed in
jordan norris'
blue jeans.

353
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
So you tell me,

354
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,000
Is she a hostage
or accomplice?

355
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,000
Owen?

356
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,100
Owen?

357
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,500
Hi.

358
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,400
Owen. You scared me.

359
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,700
I made you breakfast.

360
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,000
I woke up,
and you weren't here.

361
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, well, i went out
and i got you those.

362
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Cut 'em fresh.

363
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,000
They're beautiful.

364
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,300
How long
can we stay here?

365
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,400
Uh, well, old man stratman
doesn't usually come back

366
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,600
Until the first.

367
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,700
You know, i figure our dads
won't be looking for us
around here by then,

368
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
So we could just slip away.

369
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,700
You know, baby,
we can go wherever
we want to go.

370
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,500
The money that i saved up,

371
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,000
You know, you and i
just buy a house,
just escape.

372
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,700
My daddy finds us,
he'll kill you.
I know he will.

373
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,900
No, he won't.
He will not hurt you again.

374
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No one will.

375
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,700
Not while i'm here, ok?

376
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,300
You promise?

377
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Yeah. I promise.

378
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,900
As owen's counselor,
what can you tell us
about jordan and owen?

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,500
Not much. They started
dating last year

380
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,800
When owen moved
to special ed.

381
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,400
Junior year--
Isn't that
a bit late?

382
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,200
Yes, if he'd been put there
for academic reasons.

383
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,500
So what was
the problem?

384
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,800
Bad attitude,
lack of effort.

385
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,100
Owen applied himself
in some classes.

386
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,900
He did very well.

387
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,100
But it didn't last.

388
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Here.

389
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,200
The problem wasn't lack
of effort or bad attitude.

390
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,600
The as in math and science
tells he's a gifted student.

391
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,000
The ds in english
and history,

392
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,400
That tells us that
he had difficulty reading.

393
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,000
And the "f" in geometry,

394
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,300
That indicates
a severe problem
with spatial relations.

395
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,600
That's further confirmed
by his atrocious,
illegible handwriting.

396
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,400
All consistent
with a brilliant

397
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
But severely
learning disabled
student.

398
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,400
Yeah, but
his standardized tests

399
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,000
Didn't support
that kind of intelligence.

400
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,100
A spatial relations handicap
affects your hand-Eye
coordination.

401
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,600
He couldn't fill in
an answer bubble
any easier than he could...

402
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,600
Hit a baseball.

403
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,100
Which is why
he stayed away
from sports.

404
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,000
Sports was a sore spot
with his father.

405
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,200
I mean, he joined
the wrestling team
freshman year

406
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,000
Just to appease
his old man,
but, uh...

407
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,700
That didn't work out.

408
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,200
Excuse me.

409
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Come on, mom.

410
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,000
Johnny cash.

411
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Come on.
Hope savage?

412
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,200
I know you're trying
to tell me something.

413
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,700
Hope.

414
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,300
Ok.

415
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,200
He was probably
the smartest kid in class.
He just couldn't prove it.

416
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,700
Being the smartest kid
in class

417
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,000
Is like being
the only kid in class.
He missed all of it.

418
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,700
But schools like this
can't meet the specialized
needs of every student.

419
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,000
He gives it everything
he's got,

420
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,400
Over and over and over again,
and continues to fail.

421
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,200
And the whole time,
the whole time they tell him
it's his fault.

422
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
I mean, it makes sense.

423
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,300
No, it doesn't.

424
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,800
An undiagnosed
learning disability

425
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,400
Does not add up to
this level of violence,

426
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,100
Not without severe
emotional abuse.
You know that.

427
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
You got something?

428
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,600
An mpeg
on owen's computer.

429
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
You really need
to see this.

430
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,000
Jordan was
the gentlest girl
in the world.

431
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,900
She could never hurt
anybody.

432
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,400
Eileen, can you tell us
about jordan's father?

433
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
He thought she was dumb.

434
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,100
And she wasn't.

435
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,000
She'd get the answer
if you gave her time,

436
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,600
But he never did.

437
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,900
Did he ever hit her?

438
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,500
She thought
she deserved it,

439
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
At least till owen
came along.

440
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,500
Were they in love?

441
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,900
Oh, yes, ma'am.

442
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,400
I thought
she was gonna die

443
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,800
When her dad
took her phone away.

444
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,000
She didn't have
a computer,

445
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,300
So owen bought her
a pda for e-Mail.

446
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,800
He paid the bill
and everything
and set it up

447
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,700
So that
it wouldn't ring

448
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,000
Unless it was
owen or me.

449
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,500
Owen took care of her.

450
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,400
He tried.

451
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,600
Whenever anyone said
anything bad about her,

452
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,500
He'd stick up for her.

453
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,500
Always.

454
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,600
What would people say
about her?

455
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,200
Uh...

456
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,400
When jordan was
a freshman,

457
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,100
There was a senior
who took advantage
of her.

458
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,500
He told
everyone about it.

459
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,700
That's how she and i
became friends.

460
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,100
I thought
she needed someone
to look out for her.

461
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,400
I guess i didn't do
a very good job.

462
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,000
You're wrong.

463
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,900
She's lucky to have you
as a friend, eileen.

464
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,100
Yeah?

465
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,300
Yeah.

466
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,400
We're done, for now.
Thank you.

467
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Oh, uh, before you go,

468
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,400
Could you tell us anything
about kyle borden?

469
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,400
Oh...

470
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,800
Kyle was the senior

471
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,400
Who took advantage
of jordan

472
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,400
When she was
a freshman.

473
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,500
Thank you.

474
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,200
Guys, i'm not so sure
that i can do this.

475
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,000
It's just us.
It's not like you don't
masturbate at home, right?

476
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,500
No, i do it, man.
I can't do it while
you're watching me, man.

477
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,100
He didn't know
he was being filmed.

478
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,800
You want to be on the team,
you gotta do it.

479
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,000
We all did it.

480
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
Ok, i'll try.

481
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,700
Did owen tell you
about this?

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
He didn't have to.

483
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
It was posted
on the school
social networking site.

484
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,100
We pulled it down
immediately.

485
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,500
Once it's on the internet,
it's out there forever.

486
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:02,900
Owen knew that.

487
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,400
Did owen tell his father
about it?

488
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,000
Not at first,
but when owen quit
the wrestling team,

489
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,100
His father confronted him.

490
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,100
I mean, he blamed owen
for the whole thing.

491
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,700
Owen joined the team to get
his father's approval.

492
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,700
How were
these boys punished?

493
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,900
Owen identified them,

494
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,900
But on film, all we have
is their voices.

495
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,200
I mean, even if they'd
admitted involvement,

496
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,200
All they'd have to do is say
owen didn't have to do it.

497
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,700
He didn't know
he was being filmed.

498
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,100
Look, it's his word
against theirs.

499
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,300
I mean--Parents
will get involved,

500
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,800
The school board,
lawyers.

501
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,200
I mean, cyber-Bullying
is a hot issue right now.

502
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,700
And the whole thing
would wind up on 60 minutes.

503
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,200
How's that gonna help owen?

504
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,300
What did you tell him?

505
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,100
I told him
that dealing with bullies

506
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Is part of growing up.

507
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,000
Sounds familiar.

508
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,000
Boys have a way
of sorting these things
out for themselves.

509
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,700
Yeah, they sure do.
Right now,
owen's out there

510
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,200
Sorting it out
with an assault rifle.

511
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,600
Reid.

512
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,700
I apologize.
It's just,

513
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,200
We--We've heard
those phrases before

514
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
When we interview
school shooters.

515
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,900
Jordan was the motive
for kyle borden.
It was revenge.

516
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,900
I need to speak
to the boys who made
this video immediately.

517
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
I'll check
their class schedules.

518
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,200
What is it?

519
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,800
None of them show up at school

520
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,900
He deleted everything
but the one mpeg.

521
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,700
I'm walking morgan through
retrieving

522
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
What he put
in the trash, but--

523
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,600
We've got
3 missing kids,
garcia.

524
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,100
We need access
to owen's e-Mail.

525
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,400
The kid is tech savvy, sir,

526
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,600
But fret not,
i am tech savvier.
Is that a word?

527
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,300
That sounds like a word.
If it is a word, i'm it.

528
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,200
D.C. Time, garcia.

529
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,400
11:17 a.M.

530
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,700
D.C. Decaf.

531
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,800
Right.

532
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,600
Two alienated kids,
no maternal presence,

533
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,500
Dysfunctional relationships
with dominating fathers

534
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,400
Who withheld love.

535
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,000
They were made
for each other.

536
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,700
Mm. As lovers, yes,
but partners in crime, no.

537
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,200
There's nothing
in jordan's profile

538
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,900
That indicates
she's capable of violence,

539
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,900
And certainly not murder.

540
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,900
A new mpeg just posted

541
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,800
To the school
social networking site.
He...

542
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,400
You need to see this.

543
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,900
It was a joke, man!

544
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,400
We didn't mean anything
by it.

545
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,900
It was 3 years ago.
No one even remembers it.

546
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,300
I do.

547
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
No, owen.
Don't. Don't!

548
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,100
Please! No--

549
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,000
Garcia, is there any way
to trace the mpeg

550
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,000
To the computer
that sent it?

551
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,700
It was sent from jordan's pda,
but owen's hacked the sim card.

552
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,400
He's anonymized it.
It stops the phone

553
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,900
From transmitting
its current position.

554
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,600
Hackers do it
to stop roaming charges.

555
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
It's good for one call,
and then the carrier
turns the service off.

556
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,900
So even if it's turned on
and he's using it,

557
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,500
We can't track it?
Bingo.

558
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,400
Have the cell company
leave the service on

559
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,900
In case
he sends anything else.

560
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,800
Yes, sir.

561
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,800
Let's bring
in sheriff hallum

562
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,200
And see if he recognizes
the background.

563
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,600
"There's a man
going around
taking names,

564
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,400
"And he decides
who to free
and who to blame.

565
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,100
Everybody won't be
treated all the same."

566
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,700
Johnny cash.

567
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,400
From that song
owen was playing
when he did this, right?

568
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,800
He's been taking names.

569
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Collecting names.
He's acting out
his revenge fantasies.

570
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,300
The family, school,
and social dynamics

571
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,800
Do seem to fit perfectly.

572
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,300
He's not collecting names.

573
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,900
He's collecting injustices.

574
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,800
I'm ready
to give the profile.

575
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,500
Once you've heard
the profile,
you'll understand.

576
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,000
We are wasting time.

577
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,600
Owen is here,
and we should be
knocking on doors.

578
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,200
It's not a good idea.
And why is that?

579
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,600
Because owen's watching.

580
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,900
He's monitoring the news.

581
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,600
Right now, he thinks
you think he's gone.
He feels safe.

582
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,300
If we start
knocking on doors,

583
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,300
He's gonna know that he's not.
He's gonna feel trapped.

584
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,200
Why the hell
should we care about

585
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,500
This little bastard's
feelings?

586
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,000
All right, we're here
to help you bring in
owen savage

587
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,400
With minimum loss of life.

588
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,600
The profile tells you
the best way to do that.

589
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Owen savage fits the profile
of a type of school shooter

590
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,100
Known as
an injustice collector.

591
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,800
He's trying to avenge
perceived wrongs.

592
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,400
If he's a school shooter,
why hasn't he hit
the school yet?

593
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,300
Jordan. Most of these guys
are so angry and hopeless,

594
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,400
They just want to kill
as many people as possible
and commit suicide.

595
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,300
But jordan gives him
a reason to live.

596
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,800
Otherwise
he's a textbook case.

597
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,999
His life was one torment
after another.

598
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
His teachers gave up on him,
his classmates bullied him,

599
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,000
And his father blamed him
while giving him
access to guns.

600
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,000
Given these conditions,
you're actually
quite fortunate.

601
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,200
It sounds like you're saying
these victims deserved this.

602
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,500
We're not.
Nobody deserves this.

603
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,700
But you could have
prevented it.

604
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Reid, can i talk to you?

605
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,600
It's the truth.
They could have
done something.

606
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,000
They worked
with his father.
They knew owen.

607
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,400
So what? All adolescents
profile like sociopaths.

608
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,700
There's a reason
you can't diagnose them
until they're 18.

609
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,900
Yeah,
and they could have
seen the signs.

610
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,100
Nobody sees the signs, reid.
You know that.

611
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,100
And making it their fault
is not only unfair,
it's dangerous.

612
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,000
I want youo go back
to the savage house

613
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,500
And i want you
to go through
owen's room.

614
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,300
Morgan's already
doing that.

615
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,200
Yeah, and you're gonna
join him.

616
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,000
Oh, you're punishing me?

617
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,500
No. I'm using you.

618
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,600
You know this kid
better than anybody.

619
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,300
Go find us something
we can use.

620
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,600
He was out of line,
and i'm sorry.

621
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,300
We want to release the mpeg
from owen's computer
to the media.

622
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,400
He left it because
he wants us to know
why he's doing this,

623
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,800
And by releasing it,
it could temporarily

624
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,900
Dissipate his urge to kill
and buy us some time.

625
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,800
Time for what?

626
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,600
To figure out a way
to bring him in peacefully.

627
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,500
Jordan's innocent,
and owen wants to die,

628
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
And if you choose
to go knocking on doors,

629
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,900
I think it's gonna
get her killed.

630
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,100
After
the funerals tomorrow,
i won't have a choice.

631
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,500
Until then,
you do what
you think is best

632
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
To find him
and bring him in.

633
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,400
Thank you.

634
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,800
If y'all will excuse me.

635
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
You know what?

636
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,600
Someday we're gonna have
a house of our own,

637
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,600
Just like this one.

638
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,500
Can we live
someplace cold?

639
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Why do you want that?

640
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,200
I want to wake up
christmas morning
and see snow.

641
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,300
Wouldn't that be great,
a white christmas?

642
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,800
Yeah. Here.

643
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
You gotta smell it.

644
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,800
Why?

645
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,100
To see
if it's the right kind.

646
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,500
You know,
people who know wine

647
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,000
Can tell if
it's the right flavor
by smelling the cork.

648
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,000
It smells
like grapes to me.

649
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,900
So this is nice, huh?

650
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,800
It's not a bad spread
for a couple of kids.

651
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,200
Owen.

652
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,500
It's ok. It's ok.

653
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,700
Sit back down.

654
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,200
I'm scared.

655
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,700
It's ok.
All right?

656
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,300
Go on back,
sit down,

657
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Stay away
from the window.

658
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
I'm gonna take care
of this, ok?

659
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Who is that?

660
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,400
Owen?

661
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,300
Is that you?

662
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,500
Yes, sir, it's me.

663
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,600
What are you doing
out here, boy?

664
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,000
Aah! Aah!

665
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,300
Owen...

666
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,700
I'm--I'm sorry,
mr. Stratman.

667
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,900
Why?

668
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You weren't supposed
to be back

669
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,100
Till the first week
in may.

670
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,600
This wasn't supposed
to happen.

671
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,400
I'm--I'm sorry.

672
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Hey, jordan.

673
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,300
Jordan, it's ok.
They left.

674
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,000
Jordan?

675
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,200
What are you doing
down there?

676
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,300
I thought it was my dad.

677
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
No, no.

678
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,000
It was--There was just
a few mexican kids.

679
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,500
They got lost
looking for the interstate.

680
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,000
It's fine.
They're gone now.

681
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,900
I thought
he was gonna kill us.

682
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Hey, ok?

683
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,900
Everything's fine,
all right?

684
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,600
They got lost
and they're gone now.

685
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Hey, come on.
You doin' all right?

686
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,100
Garcia restored
those e-Mails.

687
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,200
Yeah, i'm sorting
through them right now.

688
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,100
Reid.

689
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,100
You know, you're not
the only one
who identifies with him.

690
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,800
You said i was
a high school jock.

691
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I was.

692
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But not at first.

693
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,300
My freshman year
i was 5'3".

694
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,400
I weighed a buck 20
soaking wet.

695
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,300
So trust me
when i tell you

696
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
I got my ass kicked
every day.

697
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,300
So the following summer,
i hit the weights.

698
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,400
And i got lucky.
I grew 6 inches.

699
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,900
But it was never
about vanity, reid.

700
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,400
It was about survival.

701
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,400
I was in the library,

702
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,000
And, uh...

703
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,500
Harper hillman
comes up to me,

704
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,500
And she tells me
that alexa lisben

705
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,300
Wants to meet me
behind the field house.

706
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,400
Alexa lisben's, like...

707
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,200
Easily the prettiest girl
in school.

708
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,200
So what happened?
Alexa wasn't there?

709
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,200
She was there.

710
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,200
So was the entire
football team.

711
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
They...uh...

712
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,500
Stripped me naked

713
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
And tied me
to a goal post.

714
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,000
So many kids were there,
you know, just watching.

715
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,900
Nobody tried
to stop them?

716
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,400
Mm-Mmm.

717
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,500
I begged--
I begged them to,

718
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,000
But they just--
They just watched.

719
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
And finally,
they got bored,
and they left.

720
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,900
It was, like, midnight
when i finally got home.

721
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,900
And my mom didn't...

722
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,300
Mom was having
one of her episodes,

723
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,700
So she didn't even realize
i was late.

724
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,000
You never told her
what happened?

725
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,800
I never told anybody.
I thought...

726
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
It was one of those things
that i thought

727
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,300
If i didn't talk about it,
i'd just forget.

728
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,700
But i remember it
like it was yesterday.

729
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Ah, reid, you don't need
an eidetic memory for that.

730
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,600
You know, we forget
half of what they teach us
in school,

731
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
But when it comes to
the torment and the people
who inflicted it...

732
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,200
We've all got
an elephant's memory.

733
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,800
Owen just wants to forget,

734
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,900
And i know
what that's like.

735
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,000
He's been making
a big deal out of saying
good-Bye to jordan

736
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,000
In all of his e-Mails.
None of it's shorthand.

737
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,800
That's odd.

738
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,100
He never got a chance
to say good-Bye
to his mother.

739
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,700
Abandonment is
his biggest fear.

740
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,400
That's why he chose jordan.
He thinks she'll never leave.

741
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,900
Owen's mother's death
left him with severe
issues of abandonment.

742
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,600
If we can get jordan
away from him,
we'll save her

743
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,100
And take away
his reason to live.

744
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,600
He'll take his own life.

745
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,200
It's the only way
we can save jordan.

746
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,700
How can we get her
to leave him?

747
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
He's kept jordan
in the dark.

748
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
She doesn't know
about the murders.

749
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,500
You want to tell her?
If we can.

750
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,900
We can get her
to turn herself in.

751
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,600
But even if we could
talk to her,

752
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,100
The only person
she trusts is owen.

753
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,200
There's one other person,

754
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,100
And she might be able
to get a message to jordan.

755
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Jordan doesn't know
what owen's done.

756
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,000
She has no idea
of the danger she's in.

757
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,600
Owen loves her.
He would never hurt her.

758
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,500
If the police find them
and there's no way out,
he will.

759
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,700
We've seen it before.

760
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,000
Even if he doesn't,
she'll get caught
in the crossfire.

761
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,400
We've seen that
before, too.

762
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,700
We're trying to save her.

763
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,900
You are the only person
she'll listen to.

764
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,800
We want to send a text
explaining the reality
of the situation.

765
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,700
You want to protect her
and be her friend,
this is your last chance.

766
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,100
"Jordan, there are
some people here with me

767
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,400
"Who want to talk to you.

768
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,500
"Listen to what
they have to say.

769
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,200
They are with the fbi."

770
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,200
You're doing
the right thing.

771
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
It don't feel right.

772
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,700
Send her
the news coverage.

773
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,300
Tell her to look
at the pictures.

774
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Tell her we know
owen didn't tell her
what he did.

775
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,700
You liars!

776
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,400
Send the mpeg.

777
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,900
Reid, do it.

778
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,700
Tell her,
when the police
come for you,

779
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,900
Owen will kill you
and kill himself.

780
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,000
No, owen! Don't! No--

781
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,400
You lie.
Owen loves me.

782
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,800
She's gone.
Now what?

783
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,600
We've planted the seed.
Now we wait.

784
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,400
She's back.

785
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,000
"You were right.
What do i do?"

786
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,100
Ask her where she is.

787
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,100
"If i tell you,
you will hurt him."

788
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,800
She's not gonna
give it up.

789
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,200
Ask her
if she can get away?

790
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,200
"I can try."

791
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,500
Jordan?

792
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,900
Jordan!

793
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,600
She's back.

794
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,700
"You turned her
against me."

795
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
It's not jordan.

796
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,000
Somebody please tell me

797
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,700
We didn't just get jordon killed

798
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,900
It was the right thing
to do.

799
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,900
I know. I just--
I really thought

800
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,800
We could save her.
Emily.

801
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,800
We had no choice.
Emily.

802
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Jordan.

803
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,700
I got to the car
while owen was...

804
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,500
Digging.

805
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,500
And he didn't see me
until he heard me
start the truck.

806
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,900
He tried to stop me,
but i kept driving.

807
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,500
We need to know
where he is.

808
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,100
You're gonna hurt him.

809
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,000
We don't want
to hurt owen,

810
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,400
But we think owen
might hurt himself
or someone else

811
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,100
If we don't get to him
really soon.

812
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,000
He's at stratman's ranch.

813
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,400
Reid, reid,
a little help.

814
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,800
Owen's not here.

815
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,900
Hotch.

816
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,000
We got a body
back there.

817
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,900
Half-Dug grave.

818
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Found a note.

819
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,700
"I'm going to return
my mom's necklace."

820
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,400
He may be going home
to get it.

821
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,800
We didn't find it,
but it could be there.

822
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,700
Sheriff, you go there.

823
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,700
You?
Where's his mother
buried?

824
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,100
Reid,
what are you doing?

825
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,900
He's gonna force us
to kill him.

826
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,700
I don't need to be
a part of that.
You don't need me.

827
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,100
Meet me at the station.

828
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,500
They think he's going
to his mother's grave.

829
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,500
Isn't he?

830
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,000
He was gone
when we got to the ranch.

831
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,300
I want to save his life,

832
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
But i need to ask you
a question.

833
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,800
This necklace--
He gave it to you?

834
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,300
Uh...i left it
at the ranch.

835
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
He's coming here.

836
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,500
Call hotch, tell him,
and don't let her out
of this room.

837
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,000
Something's wrong.

838
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,700
He had a head start.

839
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,700
If he was coming here,
he'd be here already.

840
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,000
He said he wanted
to say good-Bye,

841
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,900
Give her back
the necklace.

842
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,400
He wasn't talking
about his mother.

843
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,300
Jordan.
Yeah?

844
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
Ok, we're on our way.

845
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,200
Reid knew.

846
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,600
What makes you think
he'll come here?

847
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,100
It's what i would do.

848
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,400
Prentiss.

849
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,900
Cover me.

850
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,900
Whoa--What--Reid!

851
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,800
Do not shoot.

852
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,700
Reid!

853
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,300
Owen,
i don't have a gun.

854
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,800
My name is spencer,

855
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,100
I'm with the fbi,
and i'm here to help you.

856
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,200
Yeah? I need you
to stay back!

857
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
I know the only reason
you joined the team
was for your father.

858
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,000
I know that he blamed you
for what happened.

859
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,500
Stay back!
Right where you are!

860
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,200
I also know
the only reason

861
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,500
You killed rod norris
and kyle borden
was to protect jordan.

862
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,300
I know the harder
you tried,
the worse it got,

863
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,600
And it felt like
everybody just stood there
watching you suffer,

864
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,600
And not a single person
even tried to help.

865
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,400
They didn't.
They didn't.

866
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,800
What's he doing?

867
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,800
He's blocking
our shot.

868
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,100
I know
you want to escape...

869
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And forget.

870
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,300
Believe me when i say

871
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,600
I know--I know exactly
how that feels.

872
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,700
But you know what?

873
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,400
You don't have to die.

874
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,900
No. No,
i'm already dead.

875
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
No.No, you're not dead.

876
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,300
If you die,
you're gonna leave
jordan

877
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Just like
your mother
left you.

878
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,500
I know
you don't want that.

879
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,300
Do you?

880
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,100
Ok.

881
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,000
You bring her to me,
all right?

882
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,300
You bring her outside.

883
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,900
I can't bring her
outside, owen,

884
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,000
But if you put
the gun down,

885
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,900
I swear to god,

886
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,700
I'll take you to her.

887
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,900
I promise
nobody will hurt you.

888
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,500
You'll say good-Bye
to her,

889
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,500
And you'll give her
the necklace.

890
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,300
All right?

891
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,100
So what do you say?

892
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,800
Let's put the gun down.

893
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,200
Let's go inside.

894
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,300
Don't move!

895
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,300
Don't move.

896
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,000
You good, reid?

897
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,600
It's all over.

898
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,700
It's ok.

899
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,500
"We cross our bridges
when we come to them

900
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,000
"And burn them behind us,

901
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,300
"With nothing to show
for our progress

902
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,300
"Except the memory

903
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,300
And a presumption
that once our eyes watered."

904
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,100
Tom stoppard.

905
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,900
You knowingly
jeopardized your life
and the lives of others.

906
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,800
I should fire you.

907
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,100
You're the smartest kid
in the room,

908
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,600
But you're not
the only one
in that room.

909
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,100
You pull something like
this again, you will be.

910
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,100
Am i clear?

911
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,000
Yes, sir.

912
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,700
It won't happen again.

913
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,900
Thank you.

914
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,000
What were you thinking?

915
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,700
I was thinking that
that would have been
the second time

916
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,900
A kid died in front of me.

917
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,600
You're keeping score,
just like owen.

918
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,900
It was my turn
to save one.

919
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,900
It doesn't work
like that.

920
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,600
It should.

921
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,700
I know it's painful
when the person
you identify with

922
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
Is the bad guy.

923
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,900
What's that make me?

924
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
Good at the job.

925
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,000
I know it's none
of my business,

926
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,800
But when we land,

927
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,400
I think you should go
and catch the rest
of that movie.
