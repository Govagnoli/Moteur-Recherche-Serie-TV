1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,780
- Nothing's happening 
- Watch

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,710
Ah

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,570
Ooh Ah,what--

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,380
I'm so sorry,emily

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,170
What was that

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,380
Don't you recognize a rocket when you see one

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,120
I--I was merely demonstrating a physics law

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,250
I--I--I didn't meant to hit-- oh,show me

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,120
All right

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,260
Uh... well,turn around,please

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,170
Turn around

12
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,370
Yeah,he's not gonna show you... how it's done

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,890
A magician doesn't reveal his secrets

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,440
But I thought you said it was physics

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,860
Physics...magic

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,640
Trust me

17
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,350
It will not do you any good to argue with him

18
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,170
All right,all right,turn back and observe

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,710
All: Oh

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,460
Physics magic

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,490
Yes,sir

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,110
Reid,we talked about this

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,470
I'm sorry,sir

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,700
Really starting to get some distance on those

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,610
So he does have a sense of humor

26
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,830
Sometimes

27
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,610
Hey,where's morgan

28
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,130
In chicago

29
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,970
He goes there every year for his mother's birthday

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,360
[Camera clicks] You're sure she's got enough butter

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,180
You know if sarah doesn't put it on the list she doesn't need it

32
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,300
- She doesn't make mistakes

33
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,500
Looking good

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,710
I mean,damn

35
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,210
You fillin' out all good in all the right places,aren't you

36
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,180
Step off,rodney

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,080
Desiree,get in the car

38
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,400
- Come on,derek,it's nothing

39
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,650
Heh heh

40
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,980
That's ok,baby

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,380
I'll get wit' you a little later,huh

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,610
Yeah,in your dreams

43
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,080
Ooh,most definitely

44
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,520
All night long,baby girl,huh

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,640
You better step off before I make you wish you never walked up on me

46
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,230
What,you think you a bad-ass now because they pay you to wear that gun,mr Fbi

47
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,870
Rodney,I proved a long time ago I don't need a gun to take you out

48
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,260
Past history,that's a dangerous thing for you to count on,my friend

49
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,850
Walk away

50
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,310
Ha ha ha

51
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,500
Des,I'll get at you a little later,huh

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,630
Go to hell

53
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,480
Bitch

54
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,160
You all right

55
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,730
Just a fool

56
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,180
come on,I'm taking you home

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,580
There's something I gotta do

58
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,980
That's the man,james

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,120
Way to run a route

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,950
Nice job,nice job

61
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,520
Come on,damien

62
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,080
You call that pass coverage

63
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,860
You bite on the inside route every damned time

64
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,250
Ok,let's bring it in,boys

65
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,440
Get your helmets,let's go

66
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,690
[Sighs] You pushed off on that last catch

67
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,280
Man,you weren't close enough to push off of

68
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,200
I blew you away

69
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,950
I could cover your ass all day long

70
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,960
- Man,kiss it all day long

71
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,620
Hey,hey,hey

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,050
Knock it off

73
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,500
Knock it off

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,810
That's enough

75
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,050
You did push off,james,on your second cut,with your inside hand

76
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:53,950
Damn right

77
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,240
Hey

78
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,820
It's not the push-off that beat you,though

79
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,340
That's happening off the line

80
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,780
Who are you

81
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,810
What's up,derek

82
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,800
What's up,youngster

83
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,430

You wanna mess with somebody

96
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,990

Go ahead,momma

101
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,400
Did you make this yourself

102
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,690
Uh,sarah helped me

103
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,920
Momma,they wouldn't let me help so I don't know how good it's gonna taste

104
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,850
Oh,no,no,no

105
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,620
- You remember that christmas fiasco of 1994

106
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,830
Whatever,that was 12 years ago

107
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,350
Let it go

108
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,880
No,no,we still get cards from the fire department

109
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,220
Momma,momma,you see how they treat your baby boy

110
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,450
You be good to your brother

111
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,230
Uh-huh,what she said

112
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,580
No,no,no,you got the baby part right

113
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,530
Ok,you know what

115
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,280
Make a wish

116
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,680

I'm gonna lock that son of a bitch up

121
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,720
Shouldn't we call the powers that be

122
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,940
This is big,stan

123
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,270
To hell with that

124
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,870
What is it

125
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,000
Here

126
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,780
It's a remote starter,mom

127
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,980
You hit that button right there and it starts your car from inside the house

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,840
Why would I do that

129
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,310
So it's nice and warm when you get in it

130
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,300
- Really

131
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,880
No more cold cars in the winter,mom

132
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,700
I would like one for christmas

133
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,350
Not for that bucket you drive

134
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,740
Shut up

135
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,440

136
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,130
[Laughter] We miss you around here,baby

137
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,470
I know

138
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,760
Your sisters wish you were around more

139
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,410
You know the unit I work for is only out of virginia,you know that

140
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,290
Well...you're careful,right

141
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,890
I lost your dad

142
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,220
I can't lose you

143
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,970
You won'T

144
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,340
Good

145
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,680
'Cause you owe me some grand babies

146
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,520
Oh,come on,mom

147
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,710
[Knocking on door] Oh,look at that,saved by the bell

148
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,390
Phew

149
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,570

Excuse me

154
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,420
Are you wearing a gun

155
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,720
No

156
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,850
Not right now

157
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,520
Then turn around

158
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,190
This is some kind of sick joke,right

159
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,740
Don't make us get physical

160
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,280
It'll only make it worse for your family

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,370
I'm not some punk kid you can scare anymore,gordinski

189
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,060
Tough guy... you want a lawyer Yes or no

190
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,610
I want a phone call

191
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,280
Local

192
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,000
I need to call my supervisor at fbi headquarters in quantico

193
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,130
Agent hotchner

194
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,510
He's already getting a call

195
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,070
There has to be a mistake

196
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,420
Yes

197
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,990
Of course

198
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,800
We're on our way

199
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,620
[Sighs] This is ssa hotchner,

200
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,670
I need an emergency recall of agents reid,prentiss,jareau and penelope garcia as well

201
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,290
Yeah--uh,yes,I'll call him myself,thank you

202
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,950
Jason,it's hotch,we've got to get to chicago,morgan's been arrested

203
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,230
Homicide

204
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,310
Righ I can wait as long as you guys can

205
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,770
Did you get some sleep

206
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,290
You know I didn'T

207
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,350
Slept like a baby,myself

208
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,120
Didn't even wanna get out of bed

209
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,670
Really

210
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,470
So that wasn't your donut-eatin' ass on the other side of that glass all night,then,huh

211
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,150
Here you go

212
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,960
You want the other ones

213
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,030
No,just this one right now

214
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,670
[Laughs] Come on,man

215
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,200
You gotta be kidding me,right

216
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,710
Pretend you went home and slept,put an empty box with my name on it on a table right in front of me

217
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,000
The fbi invented this stuff,you simple bastard

218
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,630
We teach it

219
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,170
What's this

220
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,390
It's yesterday

221
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,950
You're following me

222
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,990
Whose grave is that

223
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,960
Why would you be following me

224
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,440
Whose grave

225
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,100
You know I don't know his name

226
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,410
You paid to bury him,didn't you

227
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,480
The neighborhood did

228
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,020
But you led the collection

229
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,780
So

230
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,040
And you visit him a lot

231
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,980
Every time I come home

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,150
Is there something wrong with that

233
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,730
[Chuckles] What,you got a crush on me all of a sudden,gordinski

234
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,790
Ok,that's me at the youth center tossing a ball around with a couple of kids

235
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,710
You did a little more than that

236
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,610
This is about you giving one of them a ride home,one of the boys

237
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,930
Yeah

238
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,430
Yeah,I did

239
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,720
This kid named,um,damien

240
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,210
His place was on the way to my mother'S

241
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,180
So what,man

242
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,820
Damien walters,D O A

243
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,210
Oh,no

244
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,590
Somebody killed him

245
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,900
Not somebody,derek

246
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,370
You think I did this

247
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,690
Special agent hotchner,fbi

248
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,720
I'm looking for detective... gordinski

249
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,620
I got this,chuck

250
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,620
How you guys doing

251
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,440
Wally dennison,cpd

252
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,520
Where's agent morgan

253
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,500
Detective gordinski's in with the suspect now

254
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,000
I need to see him

255
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,340
When my partner's finished talking to him

256
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,020
I have your superintendent's personal cell number,

257
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,790
and in the interest of not running roughshod over another police agency

258
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,770
I've resisted calling him so far

259
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,790
I need to see agent morgan now

260
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,200
I'll get gordinski

261
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,720
He's the,uh,primary

262
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,650
I don't like them calling him a suspect

263
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,030
Me neither

264
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,010
You're the last person anyone saw with my victim

265
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,820
You recognize him

266
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,150
Found in an alley four years ago

267
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,660
Still unidentified

268
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,290
John doe

269
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,140
Just like that kid whose grave you visit every time you come to chicago

270
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,810
Another boy

271
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,510
Just after you left the city

272
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,500
This is crazy

273
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,620
No kidding

274
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,480
Look,man,rodney harris

275
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,790
He's been following me around ever since I got back to town

276
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,950
Rodney harris the gangbanger

277
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,200
Yeah,he was waiting for me outside of a corner store

278
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,360
He did that drive-by yesterday

279
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,550
So you think this looks like something a gangbanger did

280
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,200
Is that how you'd advise me,mr Fbi

281
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,880
[Door opens] Dennison: Stan

282
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,990
[Clears throat] [Whispers indistinctly] All right,tell him I'll be there in a minute

283
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,900
You're gonna have to come up with something better than a gangbanger,derek

284
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,000
Detective gordinski,cpb

285
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,510
You think an fbi agent,a bau profiler committed a homicide

286
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,110
Actually,three homicides at least,over 15 years

287
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,680
You--you think he's a serial killer

288
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,890
This is ridiculous

289
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,100
Has he been charged with anything

290
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,310
I got 72 hours for that

291
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,710
I'd like to see him

292
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,630
Be my guest

293
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,670
This way

294
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,480
Agent gideon,right

295
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,420
Yes

296
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,180
I owe you a big thank you

297
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,750
I had no suspects at all until you looked over my case for me and sent me this profile

298
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,490
Everything in it points to that son of a bitch,derek morgan

299
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,450
[ ] I profiled him

300
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,390
It's all right there

301
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,790
Detective,a profile's just a guide

302
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,310
Yeah,this one guided me to him

303
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:22,540
They're really more useful in the elimination of suspects rather than the inclusion

304
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,290
That's not the way you presented it to me

305
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,760
Well,if I confused you,I'm sorry

306
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,280
I'm not confused at all

307
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,720
Look,whatever it is in here that made you consider agent morgan a suspect has to be coincidencE

308
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,320
You can't rely solely on this

309
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,000
You're right,I'm not

310
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,690
[Door opens] You ok

311
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,060
This kid

312
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,380
I was with him yesterday

313
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,650
So

314
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,900
So he's dead

315
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,890
I drove him home,hotch,and gordinski's saying I was the last person seen with him

316
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,080
15 years ago,I was a new detective

317
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,510
One of my first cases was a black kid

318
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,460
12 or 13 years old,found strangled in a vacant lot near here

319
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,880
Boy was a john doe,right

320
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,660
Still unidentified to this day

321
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,250
Wait,a 12-year-old kid that no one reported missing

322
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,340
Ever

323
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,710
Four years ago,another body turns up,same M O

324
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,850
Worked that case just as hard,came up with just as much nothing

325
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,890
Nobody in the area had ever seen the kid before

326
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,560
No one's looking for these kids

327
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,960
Then a few months back,I attended a seminar that you taught at cpd headquarters

328
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,500
I told you about my case,you said to send you the files and you'd look 'em over

329
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,200
This is the profile you worked up

330
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,480
There are about 3 million people in chicago

331
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,880
Your profile said I was looking for a black male,25 to 35,with a knowledge of the area

332
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:43,090
Nonthreatening to children-- either knows them or is normal enough that he doesn't scare them

333
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,490
A probable criminal record

334
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,960
It also said the way the body was placed

335
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,460
gently on a mattress,not just tossed on the ground,

336
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,750
indicated someone who was probably consumed with guilt,especially for the first victim

337
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,420
Your exact words are--

338
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,500
"with a guilt-ridden offender,"the bau postulates the first victim is the most important "

339
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,490
and the unsub may still visit the place of the crime or even the victim himself

340
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,200
" Care to guess who visits my first victim every time he's in town

341
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,800
Can't be just visiting the victim

342
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,260
There has to be more than that

343
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,200
Sure

344
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,700
You said the unsub might try to inject himself into the investigation to keep tabs on it

345
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,220
Morgan has called our headquarters many times since he joined the bureau

346
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,600
Always about this case

347
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,330
So,wait,he talked to you about it

348
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,200
Headquarters

349
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,590
He'd never call me

350
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,820
After I got your profile,I checked airline records

351
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,700
Turns out derek had just left chicago when the other body turned up

352
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,320
Tell me the story from the beginning

353
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,360
I--I guess it starts when I was 15

354
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,270
I was coming home from football practice one day

355
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,950
[Car horn blares] Me and my boy,we were goofing off,

356
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,020
you know,we were throwing a football around

357
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,250
[Telephone ringing] The only person that I'd ever seen dead before that was my father

358
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,810
when I was ten

359
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,860
I mean,there I was,I was looking at this kid and he was my own age,hotch

360
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,070
Dead in this vacant lot

361
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,940
And he was never identified

362
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,410
Nobody knew who he was,nobody ever even reported him missing

363
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,810
And that,that just didn't sit right with me

364
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,540
So I--I felt responsible for him,I mean,I was the one that found him,right

365
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,880
I went around the neighborhood,door to door,trying to start a collection,

366
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,050
and... eventually I got enough so I could bury him,and... I gave him a little headstone

367
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,440
What did you put on the headstone if he wasn't identified

368
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,890
Morgan: Just the date

369
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,290
I left room for a name if he was ever identified

370
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,950
And you still visit him

371
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,740
Hotch,I go see this kid every time I'm home

372
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,480
I just feel like he deserves to have somebody look in on him

373
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,480
Gordinski must read that as a guilty conscience,a killer revisiting his victim

374
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,100
But that can't be the only reason he suspects you

375
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,480
Believe me,that guy's had it in for me my entire life

376
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,180
He's supremely confident that you're his killer

377
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,720
Then yesterday another kid ends up dead and the last person he was with was derek morgan

378
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,590
In the boy's pocket we found one of his fbi business cards,

379
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,260
his cell number written on the back of it

380
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,330
In fact,every time morgan's in town,he hangs out with kids

381
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,810
This is all just coincidence

382
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,180
A hell of a lot of coincidences

383
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,760
It's purely circumstantial

384
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,190
So's a fingerprint

385
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,270
Did I mention that morgan found the body in 1991

386
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,920
Hidden way back in a vacant lot

387
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,270
Now,don't you teach that when a body is hard to find,

388
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,550
the person finding it is always a suspect

389
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,240
Reid: There are key pieces of the profile that don't fit,detective

390
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,230
Uh,the age,25 to 35,morgan was 15 or so at the time

391
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,520
Also says that age is the hardest to predict,

392
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,510
and I should never exclude someone simply because of a discrepancy with the age

393
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,410
What about the speculation

394
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,860
that since he didn't managed to leave any evidence at the scene of the crime

395
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,530
and he most likely has a criminal record or previous law enforcement knowledge

396
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,410
Derek wasn't even in the bureau yet when the first body was found

397
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,220
He may not have had a knowledge of law enforcement

398
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,920
but derek morgan definitely had a criminal record

399
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,150
A desperate detective here

400
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,210
Three dead boys,no evidence at all,

401
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,940
so he applies the profile directly to someone he already suspected

402
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,390
It's easy to get tunnel vision that way

403
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,330
One begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts

404
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,500
That's,uh,one of sherlock holmes's favorite quotes

405
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,420
We need to figure out who really killed these boys before they decide to charge morgan

406
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,370
What do you want us to do

407
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,420
Last victim was someone morgan was seen with

408
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,450
Conveniently,morgan was already a suspect in the other two

409
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,260
Someone set him up

410
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,290
We should consider morgan a victim

411
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,590
Prentiss,you and reid talk to his family,learn about him--

412
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,250
especially around the time of the first murder

413
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,250
Do we have the address

414
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,530
I can take you

415
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,050
Oh,that's ok

416
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,130
Gideon: No Actually,that's not a bad idea

417
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,450
Right

418
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,250
Okey-doke,lead the way,detective

419
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,310
According to morgan,he's got a bad history with gordinski

420
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,620
He's got a bad history generally

421
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,980
Resisting arrest,vandalism,aggravated battery

422
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,590
This is morgan

423
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,460
As a juvenile Look at the dates

424
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,300
This isn't in his personnel file

425
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,950
He said he told me everything relevant

426
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,310
Then he either lied or he doesn't consider this relevant

427
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,500
Since when is the criminal history of a suspect not relevant

428
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,230
You just called him a suspect

429
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,420
Get garcia into morgan's life

430
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,600
Yes,sir

431
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,920
Hey,hotch,I almost forgot

432
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,080
There's a local banger out here,his name is rodney harris

433
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,280
He's been running these streets for a while now

434
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,070
You have a criminal record

435
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,850
What

436
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,210
Where did you get this

437
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,340
What difference does that make

438
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,830
Hotch... this was supposed to be expunged

439
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,940
My record's clean

440
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,880
I asked you if there was anything you hadn't told me

441
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,990
A judge expunged this,it doesn't exist anymore,man

442
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,320
I was a kid,it's nothing

443
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,970
Aggravated battery

444
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,200
I-- [Sighs] Ok

445
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,800
I was with some guys,we got in a fight with some other guys

446
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,490
Rodney,this cat I'm trying to tell you about,it was him

447
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,570
We got into it a little bit,we knocked each other around,

448
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,990
he got a couple stitches in his head so they made it aggravated

449
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:33,860
That's it

450
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,800
So you're saying this rodney committed three murders because you beat him up

451
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,850
No

452
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,240
I'm saying he's been following me around since I got here,

453
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,600
so go talk to him and you might get something

454
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,360
This was expunged

455
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,520
You still should've told me

456
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,180
You know how important accurate information is to victimology

457
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,300
Whoa

458
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,590
Whoa

459
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,250
Victimology

460
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,460
It's very likely the latest victim was an attempt to set you up

461
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,090
Are you profiling me

462
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,020
Morgan,we need to look at-- no

463
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,840
We don't need to do anything

464
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,560
Derek,you're in trouble here

465
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,720
[Laughs] Hotch,I didn't do this

466
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,560
I am not worried about gordinski out there

467
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,840
You still have three dead children

468
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,730
Ok,ok,so you profile them

469
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,780
That's the case

470
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,960
Is there something else you don't want us to find out about

471
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,960
Hotch,I don't need the people I work with going into my entire world

472
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,200
Is,uh,derek all right

473
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,790
He wouldn't let us go down there

474
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,500
He's fine

475
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,490
Our boss is with him

476
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,750
Did he tell you gordinski's been harassing him since he was a kid

477
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,940
Reid: Why's that

478
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,350
You'd have to ask that bastard

479
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,390
Oh,sarah

480
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,790
It's true,mom

481
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,660
Sure it is

482
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,520
What are you even doing in my mother's house

483
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,060
They asked me

484
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,830
Oh,really

485
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,120
I don't understand how they could think he did this

486
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,090
Someone may be trying to make it look like he hurt those kids

487
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,650
And the police believe it

488
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,870
Just following the evidence

489
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,970
But he's an fbi agent

490
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,710
Reid: Actually... law enforcement officials

491
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,850
are just as probable statistically to commit a crime as anyone else

492
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,480
Look at the cross-section of a society,there's a general population

493
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,510
and a small fraction-- he's not actually saying

494
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,360
we believe derek's involved in this

495
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,590
Oh,no,no,yeah,not at all

496
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,400
I'm merely,um-- speaking theoretically

497
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,350
You're dr Reid,right

498
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,680
Mm-hm

499
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,710
Derek talks about you

500
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,590
He does

501
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,560
Anyway,so... someone may be trying to make it look like this was derek

502
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,690
But derek loves kids

503
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,160
Every time he's here,he goes to the youth center

504
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,150
Youth center

505
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,660
The upward youth center

506
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,440
Does that have some sort of significance for him

507
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,990
Oh... are you saying there's something in it for him

508
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,610
Other than giving back to the poor kids of your neighborhood

509
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,630
Sarah... sarah,we're friends of your brother'S

510
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,890
We're here trying to help

511
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,180
When we ask a question,it isn't to denigrate or demean anything he's done

512
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,010
We just have to know everything,so we can figure out where to look next

513
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,300
Is there some special significance to the youth center

514
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,570
The youth center saved his life

515
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,750
Does this make any sense to you

516
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,600
No

517
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,640
He's clearly hiding something else

518
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,820
Well,we know he isn't involved in any murders

519
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,790
No

520
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,040
There are larger implications

521
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,950
We can't have people on this team who have secrets

522
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,450
Oh,come on,hotch,we all have secrets

523
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,740
Would you want us profiling you

524
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,760
I feel terrible looking into his life like this

525
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,720
I know,just remember we're trying to help him

526
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,780
Garcia: Right,ok

527
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,300
Graduated with honors from northwestern law

528
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,120
Did you know he was a star football player

529
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,160
Surprisingly,I don't know much about him at all

530
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,810
Quarterback

531
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,980
That's the guy who throws the ball,right

532
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,120
Yes

533
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,590
Ha That's what he was

534
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,690
Full ride athletic scholarship

535
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,810
Sophomore year he severely injured his left knee and he never played again

536
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,810
Ok,garcia,look further back,ok

537
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,960
Before college

538
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,940
Garcia: Right Where are we

539
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,020
Ok,um... wait

540
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,480
He was mentioned in the chicago register as...

541
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:11,430
body of a ch-child in a vacant lot in 1991

542
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,260
[Sighs] That's our first victim

543
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,810
Garcia: He never told me about this

544
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,930
He never told any of us

545
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:22,400
My husband,um,their father,was killed when he tried to stop a robbery

546
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,500
Derek was with him,he was ten

547
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,370
A year or so later,he started getting into trouble

548
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,260
What kind of trouble

549
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,200
He started running around with older kids

550
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,550
They would give him money to run errands for them

551
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,240
Not drugs

552
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,980
No,derek would never disgrace his father's name

553
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,560
But they were gangbangers

554
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,470
So people started looking at derek like he was one of them

555
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,580
One night,he and a friend were attacked by some boys from another gang

556
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,560
Big fight

557
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,580
And one of the other boy's head split open

558
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,730
And that was the first time gordinski arrested him

559
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,310
Now,he wasn't a detective yet,just a street cop,

560
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,210
but from that night on,no matter what happened in the neighborhood,he'd pick derek up for it

561
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,490
Dennison: Probably because he was involved

562
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,740
The hell he was

563
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,430
Stan's never arrested anyone who didn't need arresting

564
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,410
He did with derek

565
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,910
Until carl buford stepped in

566
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,910
Carl buford

567
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,400
He runs a youth center

568
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,530
He took derek under his wing

569
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,980
Mentored him

570
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
Became like a surrogate father

571
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,950
He taught him football and that changed derek's life

572
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,920
He got a scholarship to college,with it he got his degree

573
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,530
Where is carl buford now

574
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,410
He still runs the youth center

575
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,580
I'd like to talk to him

576
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,000
Detective,do you think you could take me over there

577
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,280
Just you

578
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,090
Yeah

579
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,410
I thought maybe you could stay here and keep going through this stuff

580
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,490
Good idea

581
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,520
Yeah,keep going through the stuff

582
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,630
Is there a criminal history

583
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,800
Garcia: Criminal

584
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,090
Garcia,is there a criminal history

585
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:59,620
Jj,there's not gonna be a-- [Computer beeps] There's a sealed file

586
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,210
Unseal it

587
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,450
But it's a sealed file

588
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,590
Garcia,helping him

589
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,740
Ah

590
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,890
Right

591
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:11,320
Helping him,helping him... that's a juvenile criminal record

592
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,010
It was expunged and sealed by a judge esposito

593
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,820
after presentation of a letter and testimonial from a local youth center director

594
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,500
"Finest young man I've ever known,

595
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,650
"criminal record could jeopardize "potential scholarship offers...

596
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,320
stake my personal and professional reputation..."

597
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,220
garcia: He was definitely a fan of our boy

598
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,810
Do we have a name

599
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,500
Hang on a second

600
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,680
I'm carl buford

601
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,700
I've brought damien walters' mother to see detective gordinski

602
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,480
Hi,carl

603
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,210
Stan

604
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,860
Mrs Walters,thanks for coming

605
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,160
This way

606
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,830
Buford

607
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,840
Did you just say buford

608
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,650
would you just give me the hell out here

609
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,610
That wouldn't be a good idea,would it

610
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,350
Says who

611
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,950
Apparently I provided the profile that led them to arrest you

612
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,620
You what

613
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,710
They sent the case to me a few months ago

614
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,460
I did a routine consult but he was looking for it to lead to you

615
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,970
Preconception of guilt

616
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,060
We just can't force 'em to let you go,it's not gonna look too good with the local press

617
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,170
Oh,like I give a damn about the press,gideon

618
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,950
Well,we cannot appear to be covering something up

619
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,280
You trying to say something to me right now

620
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,720
Only if you're hiding something You need to trust us

621
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,550
Trust us enough to tell us about it

622
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,950
Gideon

623
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,880
It's not about trust

624
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,490
It's about having a little privacy

625
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,740
I got the right to keep something to myself

626
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,090
Look at us,man,we practically live together already

627
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,070
Then the best way to clear you is...find the real unsub

628
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,510
Find anything out about morgan

629
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,420
The record wasn't picked up in his background check

630
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,200
because everything in it was expunged and the file sealed by a judge

631
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,650
Forgiving judge

632
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,910
It was based on the recommendation

633
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,350
of an upstanding member of the community who took personal responsibility for morgan

634
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,870
That sounds like somebody we should talk to for more background

635
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,710
Should be easy,he's right over there

636
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,360
Hello

637
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,780
Mr Buford

638
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,790
This guy's been honored by everybody but the nobel society

639
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,360
That's carl buford

640
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,010
Who are you

641
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,600
I'm with the fbi

642
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,010
Do you know derek morgan

643
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,430
Yeah,he's a friend of mine

644
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,860
I've been trying to call him

645
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,250
He's a little busy right now

646
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,950
Is there something I can do to help you

647
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,370
I just... a friend of mine

648
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,820
Someone killed him yesterday

649
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,720
Do you know something about who might have done it

650
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,030
No

651
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:05,960
Derek's always telling me if I need somebody to talk to,about anything,I can call him

652
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,920
Guess I just wanted to... I don't know

653
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,470
I'll tell you what

654
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,710
Why don't you give me your name and I'll let him know that you've been trying to reach him

655
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,980
James barfield

656
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,760
Does he know where to find you

657
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,290
He can find me here

658
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,780
Anytime

659
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,470
All the time

660
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,160
You folks work with derek morgan

661
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,480
Yes,sir,closely

662
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,010
You knew him well as a teenager

663
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,840
One of the finest boys I ever coached

664
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,740
Football

665
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,800
I run a youth center

666
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,040
I gather you were instrumental in helping to get his criminal records expunged

667
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,760
I feel terrible about that now

668
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,630
You do

669
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,080
Well,in view of what's happened

670
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,890
What's happened is a mistake

671
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,490
I'm confused,I thought stan said there was all kinds of evidence

672
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,460
There is

673
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,450
Thanks,carl,you can take miss walters home now

674
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,520
Appreciate you bringing her in

675
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,780
Of course,of course

676
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,880
Derek morgan

677
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,790
It's still hard for me to believe

678
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,920
For them,too

679
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,290
I can understand that

680
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,610
Derek had a way of charming people into looking past his deficiencies

681
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,850
Excuse me,deficiencies

682
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,130
Well,you've seen the records

683
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,100
Derek was at the youth center yesterday,wasn't he

684
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,500
Playing football with damien walters and some other boys

685
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,190
Carl's the one that saw 'em leaving together

686
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,220
Did you talk to him

687
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,290
I was working inside

688
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,140
By the time I was done,they were leaving

689
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,950
When was the last time you did talk to him

690
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,150
I don't know

691
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,410
Years

692
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,140
If you need anything else,stan

693
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,930
Anything at all

694
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,460
Thanks,carl

695
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,980
Appreciate it

696
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,930
You seem friendly with mr Buford

697
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,430
I can't tell you how many times that guy's come through for me

698
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,730
Goin' way back to my beat cop days

699
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,820
Carl buford knows the kids in this neighborhood better than almost anybody

700
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,310
He's knocked more than a few of them back onto the straight and narrow

701
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,500
Has he kept up with the investigation

702
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,500
I'm sorry

703
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,490
Over the years,does he ask how it's going

704
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:48,030
Yeah,he'S... wait a second,you're not gonna try to turn this off on him to save your guy,are you

705
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,000
Just a question

706
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,240
Carl buford is a local hero

707
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,930
I'm sure he is

708
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,230
Carl buford

709
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,110
What

710
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,530
Carl buford,he runs the youth center

711
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,460
What's that got to do with anything

712
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,970
He's responsible for getting your records expunged

713
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,910
I told you to stay the hell out of my business

714
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,060
You said you visit the youth center every time you come here

715
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,560
So what

716
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,340
Buford says he hasn't spoken to you in years

717
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,350
Why don't you visit the man who made your career possible

718
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,420
Damn you,hotch

719
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,070
It is none of your damn business

720
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,610
Buford's the one who told detectives you were with damien

721
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,450
I am warning you,hotch

722
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,590
Back off

723
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,300
I'm not saying it's mr Buford

724
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,840
There's a huge amount of investigation left to be done

725
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,190
For 15 years he hasn't been the slightest bit suspicious

726
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,360
Morgan won't even talk about buford

727
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,120
He won't

728
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,940
Buford should be that kid's hero

729
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,910
Something happened

730
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,210
You talking about carl buford

731
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,010
Yes

732
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,640
We just left his office

733
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,260
Dennison: Hey

734
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,330
What,did we turn him loose

735
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,430
You let him escape

736
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:17,220
8g black male,33,six foot one,name is derek morgan

737
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,430
You're standing there trying to convince me

738
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:23,130
that a local hero is my killer while you let my suspect dance our the back door

739
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,560
I'm gonna charge all of your asses

740
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,810
Yes,as soon as possible

741
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,440
You have to tell your officers that morgan's not a threat

742
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,470
Like hell I will

743
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,470
But this-- lady,as far as I'm concerned,he is a threat,ok

744
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,890
They're beyond reason

745
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,110
We have to find hm first

746
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:09,970
Any ideas

747
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:13,370
His mother said that buford practically raised him after his father died,

748
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:16,140
he mentored him,took him on trips,spent all of his time with him

749
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,440
Basically became a surrogate father

750
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,770
Jason,I think I know what he was afraid we'd find

751
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,570
Detective,we may know where he's heading

752
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,210
Lookin' good there,kid

753
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,480
I was tryin' to call you

754
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,780
I'm here now

755
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,600
Someone killed damien

756
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,970
I know

757
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,160
James,we need to talk about carl buford

758
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,240
What about him

759
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,640
You're a star player,right

760
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,760
Center of attention

761
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,940
Yeah,I guess

762
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,270
You know,I used to be that guy

763
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,860
Yeah,I know

764
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,360
It's a lot of pressure,isn't it

765
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,710
Always wanna make 'em happy

766
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,120
Impress 'em

767
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,300
I can handle it

768
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,660
Oh,I'm sure you can,kid

769
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,450
Does he ever take you to his cabin

770
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,520
What

771
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,340
Fishin' in wisconsin,camping

772
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,740
Do things you wish you had a real father for

773
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,390
Sometimes

774
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:32,250
Yeah,he's good like that

775
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,140
You know about the cabin

776
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,120
James,i told you,I used to be you

777
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,820
What do you mean

778
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:02,250
The first time you weren't even sure what was goin' on

779
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,150
He brushed up against you

780
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,490
You thought it might have just been an accident

781
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,280
But then at the cabin,he let you sit and drink with him

782
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,270
You thought it was kinda cool

783
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,000
Made you feel grown

784
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,680
He gave you a glass of wine

785
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,270
Maybe a little shot of something harder

786
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,420
And then he took you swimming

787
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,210
Only he told you to jump in without your swimsuit on

788
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,400
He did things to you,james,didn't he

789
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,510
He did 'em to me,too

790
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,190
You do whatever you think you gotta do to keep him happy

791
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,010
because he's the closest thing to a father you got

792
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,830
But what he's doin' to you is wrong

793
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,090
And you don't have to let it continue,man

794
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,830
- Yeah,I do

795
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:14,510
My oldest brother's in jail,my sister was paralyzed in a drive-by,she's eight years old

796
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm all my mom's got left

797
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,620
I gotta get us outta here

798
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,270
Carl's gonna make sure I get into college

799
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,750
Then I can make something of myself

800
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,370
James,you are something,man

801
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,660
You're something right here,right now,without carl buford

802
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,070
You just gotta believe that

803
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,840
Where's carl right now,huh

804
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,790
Look at you,man

805
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,870
You're out here in the dark running pass routes

806
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,890
That's you

807
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,290
That ain't got nothin' to do with carl

808
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:46,440
What you got inside of here,that's what's gonna get you off these streets

809
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,230
You never told

810
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,810
Not until right now

811
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,280
Damien always said I should call you

812
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,170
What

813
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,110
Damien knew

814
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,560
I didn't think you'd believe me

815
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,270
James... I got your back

816
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,560
Forever

817
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,710
Carl

818
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,060
You've been let go

819
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,870
Looks that way

820
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,300
I told 'em it was crazy,thinkin' you were involved in any killing

821
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,830
Really

822
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,720
Gordinski said you're the one who told 'em I drove damien home

823
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,580
Was that supposed to be a secret

824
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,220
No

825
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,500
That wasn'T

826
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,830
I don't follow

827
00:38:55,730 --> 00:39:00,280
All these years,I kept my mouth shut

828
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,960
I let you go on being a hero

829
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,040
Carl buford,my mentor

830
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,990
What are you talkin' about

831
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,550
God,I was so afraid of you

832
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:17,120
I was afraid of the police,afraid of losing everything I was gaining

833
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,090
But that's how you work,isn't it

834
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,530
You make sure there's a hell of a lot to lose,don't you

835
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,440
I don't know what you think you remember

836
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,030
No,no,no See,it's not what I remember that's gonna hurt you,carl

837
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,720
Our business is over way too long ago to matter

838
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,470
You're protected by a statute of limitations and that's my fault

839
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,760
Then good night

840
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,170
You set me up

841
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,340
You knew damien walters wanted james to call me about you

842
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,120
So you killed him

843
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,490
You killed him because you knew I'd come after you,didn't you

844
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,070
Now you're just talking crazy

845
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,100
God,I should have told somebody about you when I was a kid

846
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,580
When you were helping me

847
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,000
Well,you know what happens in cases like this

848
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,760
Once that dam breaks,the flood comes

849
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,640
One kid steps up,just one

850
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,760
And then another one,and another

851
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,840
Because they're not scared of you anymore

852
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,680
They know they're not alone

853
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,410
James barfield is your dam

854
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,800
Whatever lies james told you... they're not lies

855
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,360
You did the same thing to me

856
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,790
I did nothing to you,to james

857
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:24,570
One by one,they're gonna pile up until there's so many accusations

858
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,310
- You can't say that they're all lies

859
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:30,300
any idea how many kids I've helped get out of this neighborhood

860
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,300
Hm

861
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,650
How many lives I've provided

862
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,380
Look at yo 

863
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,110
yeah,well,it wasn't for free,was it

864
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,390
I pulled you out of the gutter

865
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,690
I pulled myself out of the gutter,all the way to the fbi

866
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,660
I did that

867
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,650
You sayin' I had nothin' to do with making you who you are

868
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,550
No,carl

869
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,450
Actually I'm saying you have everything to do with making me who I am

870
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,160
Because of you I'm somebody who gets to spend the rest of this life

871
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,240
making sure guys like you go down

872
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,720
Look,derek... carl: I never hurt you

873
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,420
You could have said no

874
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,140
You're under arrest,carl

875
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,550
I've helped a lot of kids

876
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,390
Let's go

877
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,250
The neighborhood won't be the same without me

878
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,420
It's gonna be worse without the center

879
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,730
Somebody'll keep this center running

880
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,220
The neighborhood will

881
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,270
I will

882
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,500
Wait Wait

883
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:52,440
DereK... isn't there something you can do for me

884
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,720
You go to hell
