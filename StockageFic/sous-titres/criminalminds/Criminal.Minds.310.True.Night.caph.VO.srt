I Met A Guy.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,100
I'm Asking You Out,
Garcia.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,100
Hey, Garcia.

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,200
I've Been Thinking About
Doing This All Night.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,500
I Just Need You To Run
Some Bar Association Records.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,400
Why Doesn't She Do It?

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,700
She's In The Hospital.

9
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,600
Whoa. This Might Be

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,500
The Coolest
Girl I've Ever Met.

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
Her Gooey Is Mind-blOwing.

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,700
I'm Not Going Anywhere.

13
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,500
This Couch Right Here Is
Gonna Be My Best Friend

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,700
Until We Find This Guy.
Now Leave It Alone.

15
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,500
Ok.

16
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,000
Kevin Lynch.

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Penelope.

18
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,700
You're Good.

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,600
You're Better.

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,800
los angeles, california

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,400
No One Sees
True Night...

22
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,700
What's Really There
In The Dark

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,300
It's Not That
They <I>Can't</I> See,

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,000
They Simply Don't.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,100
They Feel
An Elemental Force

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,300
That Scares Them Into The Deepest Reaches
Of Their Minds...

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,700
But They Refuse To See
The Actual Source...

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,500
Something Wane Them,
Just Out Of Their Reach.

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,900
Something Cold
And Frightening.

30
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,400
Something Inhuman.

31
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,800
These Are Victims 6 And 7
Within A 2-Week Span.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,300
All Killed With
A Bladed Weapon?

33
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,900
The Attacks Are Getting
Progressively Worse.

35
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,400
The First 5
Were Lone Victims.

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
He's Getting Bolder.

37
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,600
And More Vicious.

38
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,500
Tell L.A.
We Can Be There By 9:30.

Now, Will You Zip It?

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,600
What The Hell?

45
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,700
What?

46
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,000
What Happened In Here?

47
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,900
Oh, What, The Mess?
I Got That.

48
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,200
Partially.

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,900
I Guess The Guy Who Was
In Here Going Through Your System--

50
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,600
- Kevin Lynch.
- YEAH.

51
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,100
He Made A Little Bit Of A Mess.
Don't Worry About It.

52
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,500
He Changed Everything.

53
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,200
Changed Everything?
What Are You Talking About?

54
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,000
He Adjusted The--The...

55
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh...Forget It.
It'll Be...

56
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,100
Go. You Need To Get
To L.A.

57
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,900
No, Listen, I'm Gonna
Stick Around For A While.

58
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,100
I Think You Might Need Me.

59
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,000
Stick Around?

60
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,900
Yeah.

61
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,600
The Team Can Handle
One Case Without Me.

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,700
They'll Be Fine.

63
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,600
Honey, I Know You Love Me,
But The Prospect Of You

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,000
Whirling Around Here
Trying To Fix This

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,700
Is Actually More Frightening
Than Getting Shot.

66
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Garcia, Are You Sure?

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,300
I Am Completely Fine.

68
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,600
- Look. Full Range Of Motion.
- Stop, Stop, Stop.

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,700
- No Pain. Uhh! Uhh!
- Stop, Stop, Stop.

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,900
Will You Stop It
With The "Uhh." Stop.

71
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Go.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
You Know I'm Just
A Phone Call Away.

73
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Thank You.

74
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,300
Go.

75
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Oh!

76
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,500
Kevin Lynch,

77
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,500
You May Be Cute...

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,500
But If You Ever
Mess With My Stuff Again...

79
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600

I Don't Know.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,300
Just Say Something.

87
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,200
Ohh...

88
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,500
Why'd You Hang Up?

89
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,000
I Hate This.

90
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
It's Not That Big A Deal.

91
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,600
I Don't Want To Leave
A Lame Voicemail Message.

92
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,500
All You Have To Do
Is Say Your Name.

93
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,800
Like Yours?

94
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,100
What's Wrong With Mine?

95
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,100
Come On,
I Want Something Fun.

96
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
You're A Writer.
You Promised To Help.

97
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
All Right, All Right.

98
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,300
Why Don't You Say
You Can't Answer The Phone

99
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Because You're Outu'
Living Your Life.

100
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,700
You Hate It.

101
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
I Love It.

102
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,500
Hey, This Is Vickie.
I Can't Come To The Phone Right Now

103
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,300
'Cause I'm Out Living My Life.
Leave It At The Beep.

104
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,300
My Hero.

105
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,200
Quid Pro Quo?

106
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,600
Oh, I Love It
When You Speak Latin.

107
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,100
Wait Till You Hear
My French.

108
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,600

109

I Know You're In There,
Jonny.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,600
Come On, Jonny, Open Up!

111
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,800
What?

112
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,300
Oh. I Don't Check On You
For A Few Months

113
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,500
And You Fall Apart.

114
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,300
What Do You Want?

115
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,400
Are You Serious?

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,300
You Have A Book Signing
In An Hour.

117
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm Not Going
To A Book Signing.

118
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,900
Uh-Uh.
No, No, No, No.

119
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,300
I'm Your Agent,
And We Got An Advance

120
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
From The Publisher, Baby,
And It's A Big One.

121
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
Give It Back.

122
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,400
Come On, Jonny.

123
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,800
These Are Your Fans.

124
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,400
They Schlepped To A Gallery
And Camped There.

125
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,600
All Night.

126
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,100
Now, I Don't Know
If You Noticed,

127
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,500
But It Rained On Them.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,900
A Lot.

129
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,400
Ah Ha Ha. Check And Mate.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,900
Get Dressed.
I Got A Coffee

131
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,200
Waiting For You
In The Car.

132
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,300
What's This?

133
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,600
It's Something
I'm Working On.

134
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,200
What Do You Mean?

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,500
That Sentence Needs
An Explanation?

136
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,600
What About <I>Blue 6?</I>

137
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,700
I'm Doing Something New.

138
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,400
 <I>Blue's</I> Due In 2 Weeks.

139
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Not Gonna Happen.

140
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,400
Not Gonna Happen?

141
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm Not Feeling It Anymore.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Not Feeling It.

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Stop Repeating
Everything I Say!

144
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,900
Jonny, Stop It.

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,200
You Have Commitments.

146
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
You're A Professional.

147
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,600
What The Hell Is This,
Anyway?

148
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,500
All This Blood
And Decapitations.

149
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
When Did Your Art
Get So Violent?

150
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,200
I'm Working On Something New.

151
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,500
I'll Call The Publisher.

152
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,700
Seriously, Not All Pedestrians
Have The Right Of Way, Ok?

153
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
We're Already Late!

154
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
My Headache Isn't Gonna Get Any Better
With You Screaming.

155
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,400
I Got To Admit, Jonny,

156
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,800
The Art Is Amazing.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,400
Violent As Hell, But...

158
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,700
Amazing.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,600
This Character--
What's His Name? Night?

160
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,000
That's The Whole Name,
Just Night?

161
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,600
Not Very Catchy.

162
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,900
What About, Uh,
Night Man Or i don't know...

163
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
True Knight.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,900
With A "K."

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,900
No "K."

166
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
- I'm Just Saying--
- No "K"!

167
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,600
Message Received.

168
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm Just Asking Questions
Here, Jon.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,500
You Know How We Kind Of
Work These Things Out Together?

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
You Think
We Work Together?

171
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
I'm The Talent,
You're The Leech.

172
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,500
What Is Wrong
With You Today?

173
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,200
Ha Ha!

174
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,200
Are You Gonna Work All Night?

175
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
I Have A Deadline.

176
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,600
I'm Hungry.

177
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,300
How Does Someone
So Small Eat So Much?

178
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,000
Let's Go Get Some Jerky.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,500
- It's Midnight.
- So?

180
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,900
You Really Want To Go Out
In The Middle Of The Night
For Jerky?

181
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,700
Teriyaki Jerky.

182
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,300
Hurry Up.

183
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Will You Hurry Up?

184
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,000
Seriously, Would You Just
Hurry The Hell Up!

185
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
I Swear, If We're Not There
In 5 Minutes--

186
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,300
Whoa.

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,600
Something Big Happened.

188
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,500
Seriously, This Is Huge.

189
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,800
Should Have Listened To Me.

190
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,400
It Wouldn't Have Saved
That Much Time, Reid. Let It Go.

191
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,000
The Interchange Between
The 405 And The 101 Freeways

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Is Consistently Rated
The Worst Interchange

193
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,900
In The Entire World.

194
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,500
Why Do You Know That?

195
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,600
It's A Government Report.

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So What?

197
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,200
So You Work
For The Government.

198
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,600
What, You Don't Read
The Reports?

199
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
On Traffic Patterns
In A City

200
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,600
2,500 Miles
From Where I Live?

201
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,900
2,295 Miles.

202
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Don't Make Me Smack You In Front Of
All These People.

203
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm Grady, Lapd.

204
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,900
Derek Morgan.
Dr. Reid.

205
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,100
The Rest Of The Team's
In An Suv Behind Us.

206
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,300
Yeah, Stuck In Traffic.

207
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,500
Uh, So You Had
2 More Victims Last Night?

208
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,300
They Were Discovered A Little After 3:30
By A Cleaning Crew

209
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,500
Finishing Up
In The Building.

210
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,300
So That's 7 Victims
Over The Past 2 Weeks.

211
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,000
Bodies Are In The Alley.

212
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,800
What's Left Of Them.

213
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,100
Same Victimology?

214
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
We Don't Have Positive I.D.
On Either One Of Them Yet,

215
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,600
But The Clothing Fits.

216
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,200
You Really Think This
Is Only One Guy, Huh?

217
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,300
The Level Of Overkill

218
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,400
Suggests An Unsub
In A Psychotic Break.

219
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Multiple Unsubs In Violent
Psychotic Breaks

220
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,700
Operating In The Exact Same
Location

221
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,200
Is Exceedingly Unlikely.

222
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,700
Yeah, It's Probably One Guy.

223
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
* Ooh, La  *

224
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,500
* She Was Such
A Good Girl To Me *

225
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,000
* Ooh, La... *

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,900
He Was Supposed
To Be Here At 1 P.M.

227
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,200
It's 1:11, Gus.

228
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
I Just Talked To His Agent.
They're In Traffic, Ok?

229
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,700
Maybe They Should Have
Left Earlier.

230
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,800
Look, You Want The Agent's
Number So You Can Call
And Tell 'Em Off?

231
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm Just Saying.
A Schedule's A Schedule.

232
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,700
It's Probably
The Police Activity Holding Them Up.

233
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,000
It's All Over
The Scanner.

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,800
There Were Some Murders
Near Here Last Night.

235
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,200
Murders? Plural?

236
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,400
2 Bodies.
Robbery-Homicide's Been There All Night.

237
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,500
R-H Only Comes Out
For The Major Cases.

238
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,600
If Jonny Mchale
Doesn't Show, I Promise You,

239
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
I Will Take My Considerable
Business Elsewhere.

240
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,900
You Can Leave
Right Now, Milo.

241
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,300
Seriously, Where Would You Go,
Hero World?

242
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,800
They Never Get Anything
Day Of Release.

243
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,000
It's Always Over-- 

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,300
I Present To You...

245
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,000
The One And Only...

246
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,900
Jonny Mchale.

247
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,000
Jonny!
Jonny!

248
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,300
Jonny, I Love <I>Blue!</I>

249
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,500
Hey, This Way, Jonny!

250
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,200
- No.
- Jonny.

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,800
Jonny!

252
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,400
Bobby.

253
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,700
That Was The Personal
Appearance?

254
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,300
Milo, Seriously, Leave.

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,400
They Hate Me
At Hero World.

256
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Seriously.

257
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Jonny?

258
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,900
Jonny. Jonny?

259
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,200
Come On, Come On,
Come On, Come On.

260
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,500
Hey, This Is Vickie.

261
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,700
I Can't Come To The Phone
Right Now

262
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,200
'Cause I'm Out Living My Life.

263
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,700
Leave It At The Beep.

264
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,800
Vickie, Call Me, Please.

265
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,800
Just Call Me Back.
I'm Sorry.

266
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,600
- Uhh!
- Uh!

267
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,700
Oh, My God.
Oh, My God!

268
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,900
He Jumped Right Out
In Front Of Me.

269
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,400
There Was Nothing--
There Was Nothing I Could Do.

270
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,100
Oh, My God.
Can You Get Up?

271
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,500
You Ok? Let Me Help You.

272
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,900
- You Ok? Are You Ok?
- Can You Get Up?

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,500
Aah!

274
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,800
- Stop! Stop!
- what's wrong with you?

275
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,500
Let Go Of Him!

276
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,500
Aah! Jasper!

277
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Jasper. Oh, My God.

278
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,600
Jasper!

279
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,400
You Son Of A Bitch!
It Was Your Fault!

280
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,400
You Ran Right Out
In Front Of Us!

281
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,800
It Was Your Fault!

282
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Baby, Are You Ok?

283
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,300
Jasper.

284
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,900
I'd Say It's Definitely
Our Guy.

285
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,800
Same Victimology.

286
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,600
Hotch...

287
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,000
This Guy's Getting
Off-The-Charts Brutal.

288
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,300
Do You Know That
A Domestic Cat

289
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,500
Loose In A Normal
Neighborhood

290
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,100
Is The Equivalent
Of A Small-Scale

291
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,700
Ecological Disaster?

292
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,600
Excuse Me?

293
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,800
They'll Kill Anything
They Can--

294
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,900
Bugs, Rodents, Birds,

295
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,200
Other Cats,

296
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,400
Small Dogs If Possible.
Anything.

297
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,100
That Got Something
To Do With This?

298
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,100
An Unsub In A Violent
Psychotic Break Is Worse.

299
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,300
You Ran right Out
In Front Of Us!

300
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,100
Stop!

301
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,600
What?

302
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,600
you're blind or ???

303
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,500
What?

304
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,300
This Is A Crime Scene,
Moron.

305
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,400
Go Around.

306
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
Oh, Careful There.

307
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,700
Hurt Yourself?

308
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
How'd That Happen?

309
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,600
I Think I Fell.
I Was Running.

310
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,500
Are They Dead?

311
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,300
Looks Like It.

312
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,300
Are You Sure?

313
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,700
My Name's David. Rossi.

314
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,800
What's Yours?

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,400
Jon Mchale.

316
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Live Around Here?

317
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,900
Jonny!

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,100
Where'd You Go, Man?

319
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,000
What Happened To You?

320
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,200
I Need To Get Out Of Here.

321
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,000
Come On.
The Car's Right Here.

322
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,000
Seriously,
Are You All Right?

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,300
I Think She's Mad.

324
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,100
Who?

325
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,800
She Won't Call Back.

326
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,300
I Left Tons Of Messages
Every Day.

327
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,300
Who, Jonny?

328
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
Vickie!

329
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,400
Jonny--

330
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,800
I Have To Tell Her
I'm Sorry.

331
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,400
Just Rest, Jonny,
All Right?

332
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,900
It'll Be Ok.

333
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Hey, This Is Vickie.

334
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,300
I Can't Come To
The Phone Right Now 'Cause--

335
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Mmm. I Love Jerky.

336
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,200
More Than Anyone
I've Ever Known.

337
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Do You Love It?

338
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,800
Love Isn't Really
The Word I Would Use.

339
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,300
My Mother Loves It, Too.

340
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,100
Think I Got It From Her?

341
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,100
I Highly Doubt
Something Like That's Genetic.

342
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,500
It's Probably More
Environmental.

343
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,900
I Wonder If The Baby
Will Love Jerky.

344
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,000
When Did You Find Out?

345
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
For Sure
This Afternoon,

346
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,900
But I Already
Kind Of Knew.

347
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,100
Oh, God.

348
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,600
If It's A Boy, I Want
To Name Him Jonny,

349
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,200
After His Daddy.

350
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,500
Oh, Vickie.

351
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,200
I Know A...Great Therapist.

352
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,400
She's Helped Me Through
A Lot Of Dark Times.

353
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,500
Go Away.

354
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,700
She's Really Good.

355
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
I Can Get You
An Appointment.

356
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,000
Leave.

357
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,800
Ok.

358
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,600
We Can...

359
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,700
Go To The Comic Shop
Some Other Day, All Right?

360
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,700
No.

361
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,400
Jonny, They're Your Fans.

362
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,900
Look, It's Not Your
Problem Anymore, okay?

363
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,800
You're Fired.

364
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,300
What?

365
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,900
Get The Hell Out.

366
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,200
But You're Gonna
Need Me To...

367
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Help You To Get
This New Book On Its Feet.

368
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,700
Get Out Of My House!

369
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Go!

370
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,600
Uhh!

371
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,800
Hey, This Is Vickie.

372
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,200
I Can't Come To The Phone
Right Now 'Cause I'm Out Living My Life.

373
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,400
Leave It At The Beep.

374
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,300
Uhh!

375
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,900
Just Take Me Home.

376
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,700
So, This Area
Is More Or Less

377
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,700
The Geographical Center
Of The Scenes.

378
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,500
Detective Brady's
Putting Together A Taskforce,

379
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,200
So We Can Canvass These 3 Blocks
In Both Directions.

380
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,500
Any Idea How Many
Residents That Covers?

381
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,300
Garcia Estimates
Close To 3,000.

382
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,600
A Lot Of These Buildings
Are Single Room Occupancy.

383
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
High Turnover Rate.

384
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,500
So It's Transient.
There Aren't A Lot Of Records.

385
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,700
- Press Conference Went Well.
- good.

386
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,700
I Think The Media
Understands

387
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,100
What We're Looking For.

388
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,600
Should Be On Local
Affiliates Now.

389
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
Hopefully We Can Thin Out
The Suspect List.

390
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,800
Ohh!

391
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,500
Oh, My God.

392
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,600
Aah! Aah!

393
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,700
I Wonder If The Baby
Will Love Jerky.

394
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,500
Baby?

395
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,400
When Did You Find Out?

396
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,800
For Sure This Afternoon.

397
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,600
But I Already
Kind Of Knew.

398
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,300
If It's A Boy, I Want
To Name Him Jonny,

399
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
After His Daddy.

400
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Vickie...

401
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,600
I Love You So Much.

402
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,400
Wait. Wait, Wait, Wait.

403
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,300
Oh, My God.

404
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,500
I Promise First Thing
In The Morning

405
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,700
I Will Buy A Big, Big Ring.

406
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,900
Jonny,
You Don't Have To.

407
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,700
Vickie Wright,
Will You Marry Me?

408
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Vickie?

409
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Jonny.

410
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,700
Stop! Aah!

411
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,900
Aah!

412
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,900
Vickie?

413
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,900
Vickie?

414
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,800
Same Type Of Victims?

415
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,900
All Gang-Bangers.

416
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,400
Good Riddance,
You Ask Me.

417
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Who's That?

418
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,200
It's Benson.

419
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,100
He's From
The Gang Taskforce.

420
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,000
If Anyone Had
A Violent End Coming...

421
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
What's The Scene Like?

422
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,900
It's Actually
The Gang Leader's

423
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,100
Personal House.

424
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,400
Guy Named Glen Hill.

425
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,600
Street Name Is Reaper.

426
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,000
Guess Why.

427
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,500
Only Benson And Me
Have Been Inside.

428
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,500
I Didn't Do Much.
I Kind Of Backed Out The Minute I Saw Him.

429
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,400
How Many?

430
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,800
6. 4 Inside, 2 Outside.

431
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,100
No Survivors At All?

432
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,200
Never Thought
I Could Feel Sorry

433
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,900
For These Gang-Banging
Sons Of Bitches.

434
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,500
We'll Be There
In A Few Minutes.

435
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,200
He Actually Went To
The Gang-Bangers' House.

436
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,800
The Other Victims Were In
Alleys And Dark Corners.

437
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,700
It Could Be The Unsub
Was Initially Just Defending Himself.

438
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,100
Like Bernie Goetz,
Riding The Subways With A Gun,

439
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,600
Waiting For Someone
To Confront Him.

440
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,200
Except He's Seeking
Them Out Now O

441
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,300
Because Psychotics
In A Break Always Devolve.

442
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,500
Only A Matter Of Time
Before He Becomes Dangerous
To Those Closer To Him.

443
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,800
No! No! Stop!

444
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,400
Vickie?

445
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,000
Ohh.

446
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,800
Oh!

447
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,000
Where's Vickie?

448
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Jonny?

449
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,600
You Scared Me.

450
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,800
Do You Need Something,
Sweetheart?

451
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,700
Oh, You Hurt Yourself.

452
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,700
Where did Vickie Go?

453
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm Sorry.

454
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
She Was On The Fire Escape.

455
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,000
- Who?
- Vickie, My Fiancee.

456
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,600
You Have A Fiancee?

457
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,300
She Was On
The Fire Escape.

458
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,500
When?

459
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,800
Just Before I Came In.

460
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,300
Oh, Caesar Was Out There.

461
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,700
I Saw Her Come In Here.

462
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,400
Jonny, Nobody
Came In Here.

463
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,600
- don't lie to me.
- I'm Not Lying To You.

464
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
Where Is She?

465
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,900
No!

466
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,000
T.S.K?

467
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,100
Twenty-Third Street Killers.

468
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,800
Looks Like They Tried
To Fight Back.

469
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,100
They Failed.

470
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Are we Sure This Isn't

471
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,100
Some Kind Of Gang
Retaliation Kind Of Thing?

472
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
You're On The Taskforce.

473
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Ever See A Street gang
Do Something Like This?

474
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,800
Yeah, But...

475
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
One Guy?

476
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,100
One Guy With A Weapon, Psychotic Rage,
Surprise On His Side.

477
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,500
Yeah, Just Look At Any School
Or Workplace Shooting.

478
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,000
So What Do We Do Now?

479
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,600
Ready Doing It.

480
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,300
An Unsub In A Psychotic Rage
Stands Out.

481
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,500
Agent Jareau's Got The Media

482
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,900
Playing The Press conference every hour

483
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,000
She's Putting The Profile
Out To The Public.

484
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,200
Someone In This Man's World
Knows He's In Crisis.

485
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,000
Hopefully They'll
Recognize The Description.

486
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,700
Hotch.
You Need To See This.

487
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,800
Bitch! I Know
She Was Down There.

488
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,900
I Saw Her!

489
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,000
Oh, God.

490
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,000
Jonny?

491
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,900
Suhh!

492
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,800
Uhh!

493
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,600
- No!
- Lapd Hotline.

494
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,500
Yes, Sir.

495
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Right.

496
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,700
I Got One Says He Thinks
It's God's Mighty Vengeance.

497
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,500
Could Use
Some Help Down Here.

498
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,600
Lapd Tip Line.

499
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,000
Agent Jareau?

500
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,000
We Have Some People Out Front
You Need To Talk To.

501
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,700
Ma'am, Could You Hold,
Please?

502
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,500
They Saw
Your Press Conference.

503
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,400
Uh, Detective, Line 3.

504
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Fbi!

505
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,700
What Did I Do?
What Did I Do?!

506
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,800
Uh! Ow! Wh'd I Do?

507
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,900
i haven't done anything.

508
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,600
There's Been
A Big Mistake Here.

509
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,700
Then It'll Work
Itself Out, Jonny.

510
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,100
I Just Dracomic Books.
I'm An Artist.

511
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,200
That Guy Out There, Bobby,
I Fired Him.

512
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
He's Probably Just Mad. 

513
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,800
He's Not Mad At You
At All.

514
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,900
Then Why Would He Say
That I Did Something?

515
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,100
That's Why He's Here,
Right?

516
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,000
You Remember I Read
You Your Rights?

517
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Jonny, Look At Me.

518
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,600
Tell Me That You Understand
That You Can Have A Lawyer Present

519
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,700
Before You Speak
To Anybody.

520
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,600
I Don't Want A Lawyer.

521
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,100
Tell Me
That You Understand.

522
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,500
I Understand.

523
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,600
Somebody's Gonna Be In
To Talk To You Real Soon.

524
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,900
There's Been
A Big Mistake Here.

525
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,400
I Haven't Done Anything!

526
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,500
That's A Lot.

527
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,500
There's More.

528
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,700
Did You Find
The Murder Weapon?

529
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,400
Didn't Need To.

530
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,500
Why Is That?

531
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,200
Mr. Mchale Is A Very Sick
Young Man.

532
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,600
This Is Exactly--

533
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Yeah.

534
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,800
Can You Go Get The Mug Shot
Of Glen Hill?

535
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,900
Yeah. Give Me A Minute.

536
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,400
Is That All From
Jonny's Studio?

537
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,200
Yes, Sir.

538
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,400
He's Not A Killer.

539
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,600
He's Just Sick.

540
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,200
You Did The Right Thing
By Coming Here, Mr. Kim.

541
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,900
Now, You Said You Hadn't
Seen Him For A Couple Months

542
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,900
Before Today?

543
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,300
Yeah.

544
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,600
I, Uh...

545
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,900
You Get Busy, You Know?

546
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,700
There Was No Reason To...

547
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,000
You Know...Go There.

548
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,500
That's Glen Hill.

549
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
He's Missing.

550
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,300
You Think I Know
Where He Is?

551
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,800
6 Months Ago
He And His Gang

552
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,100
Victimized You
And Your Girlfriend, Right?

553
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,500
What?

554
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,100
They Attacked You
On The Street.

555
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,400
No.

556
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,900
And You Couldn't Identify
Any Of Them

557
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,600
After You Got Out
Of The Hospital.

558
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,400
This Is Crazy.

559
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,400
Hey, How You Feeling,
Baby Girl?

560
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,000
I--I Just Can't Seem
To Get My Chair Adjusted

561
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,100
Just Right Again,
But...

562
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,100
Other Than That,
I'm Mortified.

563
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,100
Mortified?

564
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,100
Please Tell Me The Unsub

565
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,100
Isn't Jonny Mchale, the graphic novelist.

566
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,500
don't Tell Me You're
The Grapa Fan Of This Guy.

567
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,800
Oh, My God, yes.

568
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
He's A Genius.

569
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,200
Well, Sweetheart, you should see what he thought

570
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,000
The Victims Looked Like
Before He Killed Them.

571
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,600
Sometimes For An Artist,
The Only Difference

572
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,700
Between Insanity And Genius
Is Success.

573
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,400
I Believe You're Suffering
A Post-Traumatic Form a Psychotic break.

574
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,500
Psychotic?

575
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,800
You Have Been
For Weeks.

576
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,300
Come On.

577
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,400
It's Possible
You Don't Even Know.

578
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,700
How Could I Not Know?

579
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,700
That's A Page From Something
I'm Working On.

580
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,600
We Know.

581
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,700
This Is A Murder Scene
From 2 Nights Ago.

582
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,100
You Were There.

583
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,000
Yesterday.
I Talked To You.

584
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,700
We Have Photos Of You.

585
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,400
Wait. This Is Real?

586
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,000
These Are Members Of
The Twenty-Third Street Killers.

587
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,900
Glen Hill's Gang.

588
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,700
And There Were
6 Gang Members Murdered In That House

589
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,700
Last Night.

590
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,200
This Was On Your Drawing Board
When We Arrested You.

591
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,400
No, No, This Can't Be.
It Doesn't Make Any Sense.

592
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,000
This House Belongs
To Glen Hill.

593
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,600
There Was A Trail Of Blood
Leading Out The Back Door.

594
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,400
We Believe That You Took
Mr. Hill With You When You Left.

595
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Is This His Phone?

596
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,200
It On The Floor
When We Took Him Down.

597
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,000
Looks Like All The Calls He Makes 

598
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,400
Are To The Same Number.

599
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,500
Dial It.

600
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,300
Maybe It's Somebody
Who Can Help Us.

601
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,600
Or At Least Help Him.

602
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,300
Hey, This Is Vickie.

603
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,100
I Can't Come To The Phone
Right Now 'Cause I'm Out

604
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,900
Living My Life.

605
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,200
Leave It At The Beep.

606
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,600
Vickie?

607
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,900
Vickie.

608
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,400
That Was His Girlfriend.

609
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,400
All These Calls Were Made

610
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,800
Within The Last 2 Days.

611
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,300
Sometimes What An Unsub Does
Actually Makes Sense.

612
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,900
These Are Just Drawings--
My Imagination.

613
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,600
Severe Ptsd Is Not Uncommon
For Victims Of Violent Crime.

614
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,500
Victims?

615
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,600
You're Bleeding.

616
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,100
It Looks Like
A Grazing Gunshot Wound.

617
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,100
did they Shoot You
Last Night?

618
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,800
Look, Stop It.
I Would Know If I'd Been--

619
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:16,800
--
A Victim.

620
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,000
yOu Remember
Being In The Hospital?

621
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,600
I Was Never--

622
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,200
That's Your Medical Report.

623
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,100
They Cut You Open,
Mr. Mchale.

624
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,800
Call Ahead.
We Got...

625
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,300
You Were Nearly
Evisceraevis

626
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,700
They Said It Was a Miracle You Lived.

627
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,100
Miracle?

628
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
You Think Living
Was A Miracle?

629
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,100
All Your Drawings Reflect
Actual Crime Scenes.

630
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,400
All Of Them But One.

631
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,400
Where Is <I>This</I> Crime Scene,
Jonny?

632
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,100
- Is This Glen Hill?
- Where Is He?

633
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,500
Where's Glen Hill?

634
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,700
Aah!

635
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,400
No! No!

636
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,600
You Don't Know
What's Out There!

637
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,000
No One Knows
About The Night!

638
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,200
We Don't Want
To Hurt You, Jonny.

639
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
It's Ok, Son.
It's Ok.

640
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,300
I Couldn't Help Her.

641
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,400
Jonny, You Don't
Have To...

642
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,100
Vickie Wright,
Will You Marry Me?

643
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,900
Vickie?

644
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Jonny.

645
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,900
Answer Him, Baby.

646
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,100
The Man Ask you
A Question.

647
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,600
We Don't Want
Any Trouble, Guys.

648
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,200
Don't Much Matter
What You Want.

649
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,500
Look, I've Got A Little Bit Of Money.
It's Not A Lot--

650
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,300
Answer Him!

651
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,600
Yes, Yes,
I'll Marry You.

652
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,400
It's Ok, Vickie.
It's Ok.

653
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,500
See, Bro? You Got More
Than You Thought.

654
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,500
You Got A Fiancee.

655
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,700
- No! No, Jonny!
- - No!

656
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,600
Jonny! Aah!

657
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,800
- Get Off Me!
- Jonny!

658
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,200
Help! Stop!

659
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,900
Get Off Me!

660
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,500
You're Not Gonna
Want To Miss This.

661
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,300
They Made Me Watch.

662
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,400
It Can Help You

663
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,100
If We Can Tell The Court

664
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,100
That You Told Us
Where Glen Hill Is.

665
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,400
They Made Me Watch.

666
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,200
I Know. I Know.
They're Animals.

667
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,500
You Were Sick. You Didn't
Know What You Were Doing.

668
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,500
Where's Glen Hill,
Jonny?

669
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,700
You're Not Gonna
Want To Miss This.

670
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,700
Aah!

671
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,500
Just Leave It Alone
Until I Get There.

672
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,700
Hey. Hey. Hard-Head.

673
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,400
Don't Make Me Spank You
When I Get Back.

674
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,900
Don't Listen To Him, Garcia.
He's All Talk. Ow!

675
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,500
J.J., He Just Hit Me.

676
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,500
You Boys Behave
Or I Will Ground You Both.

677
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,100
Is That One
Of Jonny Mchale's Books?

678
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,100
Yeah, It's, Uh,
It's Called <I>Blue.</I>

679
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
It's About A Girl
Who Thinks She's A Real Human Being, Right?

680
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,800
But It Turns Out She's A Robot 
That Was Built By Her Uncle.

681
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,600
So It's <I>Pinocchio.</I>

682
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,600
Yeah,
It Is Like <I>Pinocchio,</I>

683
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,300
Only, Uh, Set In A High School
In Outer Space.

684
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,000
Oh, By The Way, What
Happened To Vickie's Phone?

685
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,600
Phone?

686
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,000
The One That Jonny
Kept Calling, With Her Message On It?

687
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Oh, We Gave Them Both
Back To Him.

688
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,500
You Know, I Couldn't Imagine

689
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Having Nothing Left
Of Someone But A Voice Message.

690
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,300
I Think I'd Never Stop
Listening To It.

691
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,100
Yeah, It's Sad.

692
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,000
Hey, Did You Know
That Carlo Lorenzini,

693
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,900
The Guy That Wrote
 <I>Pinocchio,</I>

694
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,900
Was Said To Be Obsessed
With The Human Nose?

695
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,800
- As A Matter Of Fact,
- Wow.

696
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,700
pinocchio Wasn't Even
The First Character--

697
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,500
Interesting. Coffee?

698
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,800
I'm All Right. Thank You,
Though, For Asking.

699
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,800
Something Wrong?

700
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,100
He's The First Unsub
I've Worked

701
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,400
Who Wasn't A Bad Guy.

702
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,500
You Know?

703
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
6 Months Ago,

704
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,400
Jonny Mchale Was Just
A Regular Person.

705
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,200
Every Unsub Is Ill
On some Level.

706
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,000
Most Can't Help
What They Do

707
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,500
Any More Than Jonny Could.

708
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,000
But He Went 
From Successful Writer And Artist

709
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,200
To Brutal Killer
In 6 Months.

710
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,300
He Suffered
An Unbelievable Tragedy.

711
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
I Know.

712
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,100
I Get It.

713
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,700
So What's Bugging You?

714
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,700
It Just Makes Me Wonder...

715
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,500
Are We All Capable Of Becoming
Something Like That?

716
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,700
Life Is A Hell Of A Thing
To Happen To A Person.

717
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,200
You Really Don't
Have To Do This.

718
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Woman, Will You Hush.

719
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,800
I Can Do It Myself.
I Just Can't Grip Anything Too Tight Yet,

720
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,900
And When I Tried To Do It,
It Kept Falling--

721
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,800
Will You Sit
Your Motormouth Down.

722
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,700
Oh...See, Now,
That's Perfect.

723
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,500
Yeah?

724
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Totally.

725
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,300
Well, There You Go,
My Sweet Lady.

726
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,600
My Hero.

727
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,200
I'm Nobody's Hero.

728
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
Mmm!

729
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,800
Hey, Do You Know
Who Frank Miller Is?

730
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,400
Frank Miller. Um...

731
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,500
It Sounds Familiar.
Unsub?

732
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,400
No. 

733
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,700
Graphic Novelist.

734
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,700
 <I>300? Sin City?</I>

735
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,100
Oh. Right, Right, Right.

736
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,100
Cool Movies.

737
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,400
Anyway...

738
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,100
He Said Something Once
And It Makes Me Think Of You.

739
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,600
"The Noir Hero
Is A Knight

740
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,500
"In Blood-Caked Armor.

741
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,300
"He's Dirty,

742
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,300
"And He Does His Best
To Deny The Fact

743
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,000
That He's A Hero
The Whole Time."

744
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,900
Hey, This Is Vickie.

745
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,100
I Can't Come
To The Phone Right Now

746
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,500
'Cause I'm Out
Living My Life.

747
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,900
Leave It At The Beep.

748
