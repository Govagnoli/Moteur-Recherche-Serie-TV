1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,800
Nobody move ! 

2
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,700
Let's go...

3
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey ! I can't get down ! 

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,700
Get back in ! 

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,200
Yo get back in.

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,300
Damn it.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
Come on out of there, punk ! 

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,100
I'm warning you ! 

9
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,500
Aah ! Aah ! Ohh ! 

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,200
Ah ! Ah ! Ohh ! 

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,500
This is houston's fifth ward.

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,200
It accounts for a large percent
of the city's growing homicide rate,

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,100
Due to gang violence
And a bustling narcotics trade.

14
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,300
Although in the last 48 hours,

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,500
There have been
3 distinctive murders in the ward.

16
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,600
Distinctive ? 

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,600
3 men, 3 different
socioeconomic groups,

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,000
All killed on the street
with their necks snapped.

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,200
There appears to be
no other injury,

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,200
And there's no apparent
connection between the victims

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,300
Or motive.

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,200
The ward's detectives
are inundated with homicides.

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,500
Gang violence is a big problem.

24
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,400
Shootings,

25
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,000
Armed robberies,
it's an everyday occurrence,

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,800
But this type
of street attack

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Is new to them.

28
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,600
Could it be gang related,

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,700
Maybe some new type
of initiation rite ? 

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,200
The gangs in the ward use guns.

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,400
In fact, no known gangs
exhibit this type of m.O.

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,300
What about dope ? 

33
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,200
These guys come up with
pretty freaky ways

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,100
Of killing the competition
to get their message out.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,100
Yeah, but there just
doesn't seem to be any connection

36
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Between the victims
and the drug world.

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,300
Homeless man,

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,700
A construction worker...

39
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,400
Security guard.

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,000
Just 3 dead men and no witnesses.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,100
We're looking for
a homicidal serial criminal

42
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,400
In a neighborhood
populated by criminals.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
The challenge will be
separating him from the rest.

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,800
We have no evidence, no apparent
interaction between the unsub

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,400
And the victims
pre- Or postmortem,

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,500
And an indistinguishable M.O.

47
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,800
Should be simple.

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,000
"Criminal minds" 217

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,600
"our life is made
by the death of others."

50
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,600
Leonardo Da Vinci.

51
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,800
We got a construction worker...

52
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,900
Outsider in the community.

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
We got a security guard...

54
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
That's an authority figure.

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
And then we got a homeless man.

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,700
That's a powerless victim
that no one would notice missing.

57
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,800
So who's he targeting ? 

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,600
Let's see if any of the victims
frequented the same stores or sites.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,500
He used blitz attacks,

60
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,000
Which means he most likely lacks
the interpersonal skills.

61
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,300
He needed to coerce his
victims into coming close.

62
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,100
And he also used
the element of surprise,

63
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,700
Which means he may have stalked
his victims prior to killing them.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,900
Well, if that's the case,
i want to go to the last crime scene

65
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,300
To see where
he may have been hiding.

66
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,800
I want to see
the neighborhood for myself.

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Good.
I'll go with you.

68
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,600
The rest of us will go to
the precinct and set up shop.

69
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,400
I'll map out the area
and see if i can find any places

70
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,100
The victims would have
visited in the neighborhood.

71
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,800
Good. Maybe we can find
a connection between them.
I'll help you with that.

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,700
I can handle it.

73
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,500
I wasn't suggesting
that you couldn't.

74
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,600
You know what "i'll help you
with it" means ? 

75
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Reid. Prentiss will help you
with the geographical profiling

76
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,700
And victimology.

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Fine.

78
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,900
Remember, this is a high-Crime area.

79
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Be vigilant.
Nobody goes anywhere alone.

80
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,600
FBI, right ? 

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,400
Agents Morgan,

82
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,200
Gideon.

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,100
Hi, how are you ? 
Nice to meet you.

84
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,400
We really do
appreciate your help.

85
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,500
Oh, we're glad to assist.

86
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,000
The vic, the security guard,

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,300
Was patrolling construction sites
in the neighborhood.

88
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,200
Some equipment was vandalized.

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,300
You think
the murder's related ? 

90
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,200
The damage was kind of
unspecific,

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
More like something
kids would do.

92
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,800
The guard had a pistol,
which is now missing.

93
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,900
This whole area,
it's empty ? 

94
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,300
Except for a liquor store
around that corner

95
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,900
And the locksmith on this end.

96
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,700
And what about this
building right here ? 

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,300
Oh, empty for years.

98
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,100
Where's he going ? 

99
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,100
Find out when he comes back.

100
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,200
Detective Fuller ! 

101
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,600
Let me see
what this here's about.

102
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,600
Her son was at
the community center last night.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,800
I've lived in this
neighborhood all my life.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,100
So has my son.

105
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,400
I didn't raise him to be a vandal.

106
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes, ma'am,
i'm sure you didn't.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,900
Kelvin ! 

108
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,900
Well, i was...

109
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
We was up here last night.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
We messed up some of
the equipment over there.

111
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,900
I found some spray paint
on his clothes,

112
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,600
And i knew he was up to trouble
with his no-Good friends.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,100
He will not be vandalizing
his own neighborhood again.

114
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,200
Will you, son ? 

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,200
No, ma'am.

116
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,800
I was gonna drive him
to the police station,

117
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,500
But i saw you already here.

118
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,600
How much damage was done ? 

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,700
Actually, we're here because
there was a murder last night.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,900
Murder ? 

121
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,900
What murder ? 

122
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,500
Security guard.

123
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Oh, my god.

124
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,200
No. No.
He chased us,

125
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,300
But i lost him.
I swear, i ain't touch him.

126
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,600
Don't say another word, Kelvin.

127
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,400
Kelvin... I only have one question
for you and then you can go.

128
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,100
Did the security guard
fire his weapon at you ? 

129
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,200
No. He, like,
shot into the air to scare us.

130
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
And that's why we ran.

131
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,100
Thanks. You can go.

132
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
We can go ? 

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,700
You just sent away the last person
to see our victim alive.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,100
A boy that frightened
of his mother and that slight

136
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,500
Doesn't have the skill,
courage, or size

137
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,900
To kill the way
this unsub does.

138
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,700
Hey, guys.

139
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,900
Over here.

140
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,000
Someone was living here.

141
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,000
There, you got
a dirty blanket,

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,700
Hamburger wrappers,
and soda cans.

143
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Those kids weren't
the only ones here last night.

144
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,700
What's that ? 

145
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,100
One of the detectives' wives
made us cookies.

146
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,800
Wow. Homemade cookies ? 

147
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,100
Yeah, I guess that's what
they mean by southern hospitality.

148
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,000
What are you saying ? 

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,600
Southern hospitality ! 

150
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
I need to concentrate...

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,300
How can anybody hear
with all this work going on ? 

152
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,100
Well, you're gonna
have to get used to it.

153
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,700
Construction crews
are working around the clock.

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Saw it on the way in.

155
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,400
City's trying to return
to its splendor,

156
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,100
And that means that
houston's poorest

157
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,500
Are being kicked out
of their homes.

158
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,900
Unsub might be homeless.

159
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,200
Appears to have been
living in a building

160
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
Next to where the security
guard was attacked.

161
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,400
These are the locations of the last
3 murders, all near abandoned buildings.

162
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,800
I noticed the neighborhood.
Maybe he was recently displaced.

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,300
Could be a motive.

164
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,200
Construction worker,
security guard at a construction site.

165
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,200
Payback ? 

166
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,100
What about the homeless man ? 

167
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
We get a lot of beefs down
there among the homeless.

168
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,400
That one could have just been
a fight about space or food.

169
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,200
Let's get a list of residents Who've been
kicked out of their homes by the gentrification.

170
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,200
You and Reid
check the shelters ? 

171
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah, we're on it.

172
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,800
Unless...
you ok with that, Reid ? 

173
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,500
I'm fine with that.

174
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,200
We should check to see if there are
any mental hospitals in the area,

175
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,100
Maybe someone who was recently
released into the streets.

176
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Mm-Hmm. Got it.

177
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,400
Morgan, can you cover
the police records for the last week ? 

178
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,300
If it's someone
who's been recently made homeless,

179
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,200
He might have stolen food,
comfort items, blankets,

180
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,500
Toiletries... We might be able
to track a pattern of theft.

181
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,700
Thanks.
Done.

182
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,000
Are you lonely
in the lone star state ? 

183
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,500
Are you wearing chaps ? 

184
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,000
Only in your dreams, Garcia.

185
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,100
Oh, not necessarily.

186
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,500
I have photoshop.

187
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
Hey, hey, behave.

188
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,900
Focus your little
twisted mind for me, ok ? 

189
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,100
I need police records
from the fifth ward...

190
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,800
Small thefts and burglaries.
Can you do that ? 

191
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,900
Aren't you at that
very station right now.

192
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,500
Yeah, but it's a small precinct

193
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,300
And these guys are stretched. Trust me.

194
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,400
Got it.

195
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,900
Oh, Garcia.

196
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,500
See if you can find before and after
pictures of demolitions in the area.

197
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,200
Maybe we can nail down a building where
the unsub may have worked or lived in.

198
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,500
How far back ? 

199
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,800
A week.

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,700
And Garcia...

201
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,500
I better not ever find
any photoshop pictures of me...

202
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,600
Oh, trust me, my vision.

203
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,600
You will never find them.

204
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,700
Get out ! 

205
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,800
Victim's name is Travis Overby.

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
That's his buddy over there.

207
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,500
He was working
a jackhammer on a new trunkline.

208
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,600
He said one second
travis was going down the sewer,

209
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,900
The next second
he was down at the bottom dead.

210
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,800
From one second to the next.

211
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,200
Someone has to go down.

212
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,200
Aw, see, this ain't cool.

213
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,700
I'm putting in for hazard pay.

214
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,300
Good luck with that.

215
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,900
It's pretty clean for a sewer ! 

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,700
The trash is pretty much
cleared away.

217
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,900
Yeah, i got a dirty blanket...

218
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,700
Something else rolled up
in the corner.

219
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,000
It's obvious he made himself
a place to sleep, but...

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,200
He cleared it all away.

221
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,300
It looks a lot like
the last place he was in.

222
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,400
Huh.

223
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,600
A new temporary home.

224
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,200
Guys, it looks like
the jackhammer

225
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,800
Must have knocked
some of the ceiling loose.

226
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,200
It fell down all around him.
I'd be pretty scared, too.

227
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,800
It's about survival.

228
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,800
Carved out a place of his own,

229
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,000
Saw a threat, he attacked.

230
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,900
That's got to be why
the victims were so random.

231
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,100
He didn't have
a relationship with them.

232
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,100
They just happened to be
intruding on his home.

233
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,100
We'll need to see
the other crime scenes.

234
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,400
Sure ! Let's go ! 

235
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,900
You all right ? 

236
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,300
Yeah. You owe me.

237
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,200
You all are looking
for someone in charge ? 

238
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,700
I'm angie, one of
the administrators.

239
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,900
Hi. I'm Agent Prentiss.
This is Agent Reid.

240
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,000
We're with the fbi.

241
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,800
Really ? 
Really.

242
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,600
It looks like
you have your hands full.

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,400
With the demolitions in the projects
and the abandoned buildings,

244
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,100
There's no place else
for people to sleep.

245
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,300
Well, thank god there are people
like you who take the time...

246
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,700
Do you have a list of everyone
who comes through here ? 

247
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,000
Angie: uh, we have
a sign-In sheet,

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,100
But we don't force
anyone to sign if they don't want to.

249
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,200
Some who do don't even
use their real names.

250
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,100
Elvis eats here a lot.

251
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,900
We would appreciate
any lists you have.

252
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,100
Why ? 

253
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,400
Have you noticed anyone who acts

254
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,600
Unusually aggressive
towards the other residents ? 

255
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,800
What's this about ? 

256
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,700
A series of murders in the area.

257
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
The perpetrator
may be a homeless man.

258
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,100
Maybe someone who stays here.

259
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
He may even be in this room
as we speak.

260
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,300
My god, Reid.

261
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,700
Have you noticed anyone
who acts paranoid or displays

262
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,100
Explosive, unprovoked
bursts of violence,

263
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,300
More than just
pushing and shoving ? 

264
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,600
I mean, someone who really
tries to harm others.

265
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,700
There are territorial fights
over food and places to sleep.

266
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,300
The nurse treats people
for minor injuries all the time,

267
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,000
But no one's seriously hurt.

268
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,800
If anyone does come to mind,
give us a call.

269
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,600
Thank you.

270
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
A murderer ? 

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,100
I'm sorry. Uh--Um...

272
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,700
This investigation is still...

273
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,600
No one's actually
been hurt in a shelter.

274
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,300
We're just... We're acting with
an abundance of caution.

275
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,700
So, please, let the police know

276
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,100
If anything unusual occurs.

277
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,200
Thanks.

278
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,000
There's a high presence
of mental disorders with the homeless.

279
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,900
Yeah.

280
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,600
What the hell
was that in there ? 

281
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,300
What ? 

282
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,700
"He may even be in this room as we speak" ? 

283
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,300
We have nothing to support that.

284
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,200
We're investigating
a serial homicide.

285
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,800
Should i have pretended
there's no danger ? 

286
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,400
We just left that woman
potentially afraid

287
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,300
Of every man who walks
into this shelter.

288
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,900
Again, until we find
this unsub, how is that a bad thing ? 

289
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,500
What is the matter with you ? 

290
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,900
What do you mean,
what's the matter with me ? 

291
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,700
I have never seen you act like this.

292
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh, really ?  Oh, in the months
that you know me,

293
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,200
You've never seen me
act this way ? 

294
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,600
Hey, no offense,
Emily, but...

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,700
You don't really know what
you're talking about, do you ? 

296
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,100
Good. Thanks.

297
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Just got back from
the local homeless shelter.

298
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,100
The administrator hasn't noticed anyone
new displaying aggressive behavior.

299
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,200
He's not in
a homeless shelter.

300
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,300
I just talked
to Gideon and Morgan.

301
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,400
They think that he's killing

302
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
To protect some makeshift
shelter of his own.

303
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,400
So are we ready
for a profile yet ? 

304
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,700
We're missing something.

305
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,500
How did this homeless man
learn to kill so efficiently ? 

306
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,500
You know what we need ? 

307
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,800
We need to get lucky.

308
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,400
We need him to make a mistake.

309
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey.

310
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,000
Come on, man, get out of there ! 

311
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,700
I see you right there ! 

312
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,300
Iaqui tengo mi tienda ! 

313
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,100
There's a shelter
a couple of blocks from here.

314
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,300
Vayase...

315
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,100
Papa ! 

316
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,200
Please help my daddy ! 

317
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,100
I need help !  I was attacked ! 

318
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,800
Can i get some help here, please ? 

319
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,400
Please... Call my house
to come get my daughter. Please.

320
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,600
Maria...

321
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,800
Is my papa gonna be ok ? 

322
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,200
Yes.

323
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,000
Maria, could you answer
a few questions for us ? 

324
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
It would really help us
find the bad guy.

325
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,900
Did he say anything
to your papa ? 

326
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,700
No.

327
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,800
What were you and your papa
doing before the bad guy came ? 

328
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,700
Papa took out the garbage.

329
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,900
And then he jumped out...

330
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,200
And he hit my papa.

331
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,000
I was screaming at him.

332
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,900
Don't hurt my papa ! 

333
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,700
I thought he was gonna
hit me, too.

334
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,400
But then he stopped...

335
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,400
And he looked at me funny.

336
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,000
What do you mean by "funny" ? 

337
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,200
He looked...

338
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,100
Sad.

339
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,400
He did say something.

340
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,700
Not to my papa.

341
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,900
To me.

342
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,900
What was it ? 

343
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,000
He said...

344
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,700
Are you ok ? 

345
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,300
Why are you crying ? 

346
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,400
And then we ran.
Go away !  Go away ! 

347
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,300
Maria...

348
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
What you did was very brave.

349
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,600
Can you help us
with one more thing ? 

350
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,400
Can you tell us
what the man looked like ? 

351
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,800
He was white.

352
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,000
And tall.

353
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
And dirty.

354
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,300
And he had a ring like yours.

355
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Like that ? 

356
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,300
I remember his ring.

357
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,700
Thank you.

358
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Iabuela ! 

359
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,200
Gracias.

360
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,900
He asked if she was ok
and why was she crying.

361
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,100
He wasn't aware of what
he was doing to her.

362
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,700
Garcia's on line one.

363
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,800
Go ahead, Penelope.

364
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,900
All right, cowgirls and boys.

365
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,700
Hey.

366
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,500
I've got the comparison
satellite images

367
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Of the before-And-After
pictures, and i found something.

368
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,300
Check it.

369
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,900
Do you see it yet ? 

370
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,900
Yeah.

371
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
Yeah, an s.O.S.

372
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah, it's made of debris
and other rocky bits of gobbledygook.

373
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,900
This is the building
where the security guard got killed.

374
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,700
He's asking for help.

375
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,400
Wait, guys. Listen outside.

376
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,300
Chaos. S.O.S.

377
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,200
He's a war veteran.

378
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,900
He thinks he's in a war zone.

379
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,200
He left a distress signal
on the roof of one of the buildings.

380
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,400
The quick strikes
are consistent with trained military

381
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,000
He must have served in a place

382
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,500
That looked or sounded like this ward.

383
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Well, we were right
about him being homeless, in a sense.

384
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,500
Wherever he is, in his mental state,
he's certainly not at home.

385
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,600
He may not even be aware
he's killing.

386
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,700
Now, how's that ? 

387
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,600
When soldiers suffered
from anxiety, depression,

388
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,000
And flashbacks in world war i,
it was called shell shock.

389
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
In world war ii,
battle fatigue.

390
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,900
Now we refer to it as ptsd,

391
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
Post-Traumatic
stress disorder, war related.

392
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,900
A side effect of which
is slipping into dissociative states.

393
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
The mind divorces itself
from reality

394
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,900
So it can cope
with the trauma.

395
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,300
He's reliving a memory.

396
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,400
He's trapped in his head
in some war zone.

397
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,500
Hiding and defending himself
from the enemy.

398
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,200
Ok, so how do we find
a man who's trapped inside his head ? 

399
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,300
He's got a wedding ring.

400
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,800
Someone's missing him.

401
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,400
Good. I'm with detective Fuller.

402
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,500
Morgan has last crime scene to check.

403
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
J.J., check
missing persons reports,

404
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,300
See if anyone matches
the description.

405
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,500
It would have been
filed recently,

406
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,100
The last 2 or 3 days.
Ok.

407
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,000
Thanks.

408
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,900
Hey.

409
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,900
You shouldn't be out here.

410
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,600
It isn't safe.

411
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,900
It isn't safe.

412
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,600
Dana Woodridge and Max Weston...
Her husband and his best friend.

413
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,100
Roy Woodridge
has been missing since tuesday.

414
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,300
He was on his way home from work.

415
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,800
He called before
he left the office

416
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,400
And said we needed to talk
when he got home.

417
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,400
He sounded upset.

418
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,200
That was the last
I heard from him.

419
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,300
What was he upset about ? 

420
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,600
He didn't say.

421
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,000
Dana called me that night

422
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,500
When Roy didn't show up.

423
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,700
So...

424
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,800
The next morning we filed
a missing persons report.

425
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Mrs. Woodridge, where
does your husband work ? 

426
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,000
He's a consultant
at a security firm downtown.

427
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,800
Did your husband
ever serve in combat ? 

428
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,700
Excuse me ? 

429
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,500
Is he a war veteran ? 

430
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,800
Yeah.
Uh...

431
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,700
We both are.

432
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,100
We were in
special ops.

433
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,500
75th ranger regiment,

434
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,400
Bravo company, 3rd battalion.

435
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,700
But Roy...

436
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,600
He retired shortly after
things went bad in Mogadishu.

437
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,400
That was back in 1993.

438
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,400
Let me ask you this... Does he display
any sort of, uh...

439
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,000
Behavioral tics...
Certain everyday things,

440
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
They make him jumpy or startled ? 

441
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,400
Why ? 

442
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Does he ? 

443
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Is this going to help find him ? 

444
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,800
Mrs. Woodridge, please.

445
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,200
We need to know everything
we can about your husband.

446
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We all had a...
hard time over there,

447
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,900
You know... you bring
some things home with you.

448
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Like what ? 

449
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,500
He has a hard time
with loud noises.

450
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
He can't be in crowds.

451
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,400
He has nightmares

452
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,900
And wakes up in cold sweats.

453
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,400
The smells are the worst.

454
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,600
He...

455
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
If he smells
something burning,

456
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,800
Like a barbecue or gas or fire...

457
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,300
He gets sick.

458
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,400
It really only got bad
about a year ago.

459
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,600
What happened to him in Somalia ? 

460
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,400
Nothing.

461
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,200
Combat happened.

462
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,600
What does that mean ? 

463
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,400
I'm gonna get a drink of water.

464
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,300
You knew your friend
was suffering from symptoms of ptsd ? 

465
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,700
He was a changed man, wasn't he ? 

466
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,000
He was anxious,

467
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,100
Paranoid, distant.

468
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,000
He was far away in his head.

469
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,600
I tried to get him
into a vet center to talk to somebody,

470
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,000
But he said he was all right.

471
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,800
What happened
in Somalia ? 

472
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,000
What's he reliving ? 

473
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,100
You can't tell Dana.

474
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,500
Roy never wanted her to know.

475
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Thank you.

476
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,100
Could somebody please
tell me what's going on ? 

477
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,700
There have been some
people hurt recently,

478
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,000
And we think that there
may be someone lost on the streets.

479
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,400
Someone who thinks
that he's still at war.

480
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,900
But Roy would never hurt
innocent people.

481
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,900
Well, why would he even
be in this neighborhood ? 

482
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,000
Hey, Garcia. We have
Mrs. Woodridge here with us.

483
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,600
Oh, uh, well,

484
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,300
I found an '02
white ford f150 pickup truck.

485
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,300
Oh, my god. That's his truck.

486
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,500
It was impounded.

487
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,000
Uh, it had a flat tire
and was picked up on Lyon street

488
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,100
About a quarter of a mile
from highway 59.

489
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,100
He takes the east tex freeway
to work every day.

490
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,400
Mrs. Woodridge,
I'm very sorry...

491
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
But this is definitely
your husband.

492
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,100
What  ? 

493
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,800
Roy and I...

494
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,100
We were escorting
a u.N. Aid caravan to a refugee camp.

495
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Our convoy was ambushed.

496
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,200
The front received heavy fire,

497
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,300
But we were in the rear,

498
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,000
So we managed to escape.

499
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,900
We hid for 2 days
in and out of abandoned buildings that...

500
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,800
Insurgents were looking for us.

501
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,300
One night I was sleeping,
Roy kept watch.

502
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,700
When I woke up, there was
an ak-47 pointed right at me.

503
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,800
A child.

504
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,700
Yeah.

505
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
They were all babies
back in Mogadishu,

506
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,700
But this one...

507
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,300
He couldn't have been
more than 11 or 12.

508
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,400
Then what happened ? 

509
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,500
We finally found a radio...

510
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,900
Fixed it,
called for an extraction.

511
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,100
Did you put out an S.O.S. ? 

512
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yeah, we...

513
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,100
We used rocks to put
an s.O.S. In the dirt

514
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,900
So the blackhawks
could locate us.

515
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,200
How did you know that ? 

516
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Look,

517
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,900
If this is roy,
you're not gonna find him.

518
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,500
He's trained and skilled
at survival.

519
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,900
He knows how to hide.

520
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,700
We think he has a gun.

521
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,500
Well, he doesn't miss.

522
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,200
We need to put
a s.W.A.T. Team together,

523
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,000
Plan a grid search
and go building to building.

524
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
He's reliving the war, isn't he ? 

525
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,000
A specific incident
in which he killed a child.

526
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,500
Guys, the s.W.A.T. Team's
gonna have guns, right ? 

527
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,700
What happens if he tries
to fight them ? 

528
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,200
Can I get you something,
Mrs. Woodridge ? 

529
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,900
Those men are going
after Roy ? 

530
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
Do they need so many guns ? 

531
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,800
He's just one man.

532
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,700
It... It's protocol, ma'am.

533
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,200
How badly were they hurt ? 

534
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,400
Y'all said
that people were hurt.

535
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,000
Some people were murdered.

536
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Murdered ? 

537
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,600
Mrs. Woodridge...
He never really came home.

538
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I lost him 14 years ago.

539
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
It's been like
living with a ghost.

540
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,300
Help him.

541
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,600
Please, help him.

542
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,000
We'll do everything we can.

543
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,700
Ok ? 

544
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,900
Reid, what are you working on ? 

545
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,100
3 days ago police shut down
the freeway

546
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,200
At 5 p.M. For 10 minutes.

547
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,500
Cars were stalled and Roy must have
tried to exit on the surface streets.

548
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,300
Sadly, he ended up in an unfamiliar
area with a flat tire.

549
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,800
He was changing that tire
when an 8-Story building

550
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,200
On market imploded
5 blocks away.

551
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,900
He heard the explosion
and reacted

552
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,900
Like a mortar bomb
had landed nearby.

553
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,200
This explosion is what
triggered his dissociation.

554
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,100
And since then,
he's been stuck in that state.

555
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,400
Running when he needed to,
sleeping when he could,

556
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,200
Camouflaging himself
into his surroundings,

557
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,400
And hiding from
his perceived enemies.

558
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,200
He's relieving
the worst moment of his life.

559
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,900
He's gotta be
terrified.

560
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah.

561
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Yeah, what do you have ? 

562
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,000
Why isn't Derek
answering his phone ? 

563
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,700
He's probably stuck
underground somewhere.

564
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,600
Underground ? 

565
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,200
I'll explain later.

566
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Oh. Ok. So,
I finally got through

567
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,800
All those recent police reports
he asked me to check,

568
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Which, by the way,
it was no hopscotch through the park,

569
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,000
Because that precinct you're at

570
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,600
Is kind of tragically behind
on their paperwork.

571
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,700
Yeah, they're undermanned.

572
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,800
Oh, Jeez, really ? 

573
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,300
I can't imagine
what that feels like.

574
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,600
Oh, no, wait.
Yes, I can, 'cause...

575
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,200
Garcia, do you have
anything for me ? 

576
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,500
Well, he told me to look
for anything unusual,

577
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,300
And it's all usual.

578
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,800
Minor break-Ins,
apartment burglaries,

579
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,500
Televisions, stereos,
car thefts, and smash and grabs.

580
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,100
Common stuff in the world
of burgling.

581
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,400
Nothing a guy
lost in the streets

582
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,900
Might use for survival ? 

583
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,400
No, nothing reported.

584
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,200
It... like I said,
it's all petty.

585
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,000
There's a...

586
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,500
Some vandalism
at construction sites.

587
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,300
Communications radio
missing from one of them.

588
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,100
Wait... Did you say radio ? 

589
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,500
Yeah. Construction Foreman
reported that one of their

590
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,400
Trucks had been broken into
and a hand-Held radio was stolen.

591
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,800
Yesterday.12 hours ago.

592
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,400
Is that what you're looking for ? 

593
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,400
Reid ? 

594
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,200
This is Roy Woodridge,

595
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,000
6'1", 195 pounds,

596
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
44 years old.

597
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,700
Brown hair,
former army ranger.

598
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,000
It's imperative
you don't try to apprehend him alone.

599
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,100
He won't understand
what's happening.

600
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,400
He may try
to defend himself.

601
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,300
He's armed, and he's an excellent
marksman.

602
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,300
He may have stolen a radio,

603
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,700
A walkie-Talkie.

604
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,000
We were right.

605
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,400
He had a nest of sorts
right near every murder scene.

606
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,600
There was a burglary
of a two-Way radio

607
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,400
From a construction site
recently.

608
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
That could be Roy.

609
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,300
We only used uhf
back then.

610
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,500
He's looking for help.

611
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,100
And he'll keep trying to
contact operations command.

612
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,700
Detective, can we get a dozen uhf
radios set up in this room,

613
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,700
And each of them tuned
to each of the preset channel frequencies ? 

614
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,600
Right away.

615
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,700
Wait a minute.

616
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,600
When he calls,
we need to be very careful

617
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,000
With the communication,

618
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,900
Because we set up
specific responses to contact op com

619
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,000
So we could avoid
hostile interception

620
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,400
And to establish
"no danger" signals.

621
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,800
And we had specific names
to identify our squad to the operator.

622
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,500
Do you remember
the language you set up ? 

623
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,700
I couldn't forget it.

624
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,000
Roy and I wrote it.

625
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,200
The callout was, "this is John Doe
looking for mark rippen."

626
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Rippen was our hero
at the time...

627
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Number 11, quarterback
for the redskins in 1993.

628
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,600
Now we know where he is
in his head.

629
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,600
He calls in, we'll be
on the other end when he does.

630
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,900
What if he doesn't call ? 

631
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,100
What if he just
kills someone else ? 

632
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,000
Well, we'll deal
with that if it happens.

633
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,700
Kind of easy for you to say.

634
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,900
This guy may be messed up,
but that doesn't change the fact

635
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,000
That he has killed
4 innocent people.

636
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,100
Now, why don't we
just do the grid search ? 

637
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,200
If you set up
a grid search

638
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,800
And he confronts
one of your men,

639
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,100
You'll be planning a funeral.

640
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,500
I can guarantee you we're
right about his profile.

641
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,600
This man wants to get rescued.

642
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,400
All i'm asking is that you just
give us a chance to bring him in.

643
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,900
It's channel 11.

644
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Are you ready Garcia ? 

645
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,900
I've got nat recon
satellites all over the ward.

646
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,600
Stand by.

647
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,900
This is John Doe
looking for mark rippen.

648
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,500
Can you help us ? 

649
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,200
You know how to do this
better than we do.

650
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,200
Roger that.
This is number 11, all clear.

651
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,200
Maxey, boy, am I happy
to hear from you.

652
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,600
I'm taking heavy fire.

653
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,400
Request immediate extraction.

654
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,000
What are your coordinates ? 

655
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,300
Unknown. I lost my land
navigational aids.

656
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,700
I went high, but i don't
recognize anything.

657
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,100
I don't have a fix
on my grid coordinates.

658
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,200
Any other way for him
to signal his location ? 

659
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,600
Did you put up any flags ? 

660
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,100
Yeah, you bet
your ass I did.

661
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,700
I'm holding cover here.

662
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,700
Roger that.
Hold your position.

663
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,400
He triangulated. We need to look
for 3 large, colored flags,

664
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,000
Maybe on rooftops.

665
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,400
They'll be identical
in size and shape.

666
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,100
Did you get that, Garcia ? 
Yeah, I got it.

667
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,700
Number 11,
do you still read me ? 

668
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,100
Garcia.
I'm working as fast as I can.

669
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,400
I can still read you
loud and clear.

670
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,300
Stay put.

671
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,500
I found one.
I found one.

672
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,800
I got them.
I see...

673
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,300
Housing projects
and a courtyard.

674
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,900
We need street names,
Garcia.

675
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,100
Farmer and Capron ! 
Farmer and Capron ! 

676
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
I know where that is.

677
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,500
There's some abandoned
buildings right there.

678
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,300
I'll have construction sites
to halt work and secure the streets.

679
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,100
He's gonna expect
men in fatigues and a chopper as cover.

680
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,400
I can take care
of the choppers.

681
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,800
We're in black suvs. Tell him
we're security executives.

682
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,500
You're coming with us.
We need to do this fast.

683
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,200
Tell him to stay there,
we're coming to him.

684
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,400
Roy, we're coming to you, buddy.

685
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,900
Let's go ! 

686
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Thank you, god.

687
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,900
Sergeant Woodridge ? 

688
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
Got him.

689
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,300
Where's Max ? 

690
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,400
Roy.

691
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,700
It's all right.
It's time to come in.

692
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,000
He's got a weapon ! 

693
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,800
No ! No ! Stop ! 

694
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,100
Stop

695
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Look, it's all right.

696
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
It's all right.

697
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,600
No ! 

698
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,400
It's not safe ! 

699
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,900
It's a boy, sergeant,
it's just a boy.

700
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,500
Roy ! 

701
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,900
It wasn't safe.

702
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,300
I know.

703
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,000
Is the boy all right ? 

704
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,600
Yes.

705
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,900
Yes, sergeant.

706
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,200
The boy's all right.

707
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,900
That's good.

708
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,200
Folks. Uh...

709
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,400
Thank you so much for coming here.

710
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,800
No one ever makes this place
a priority.

711
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,500
We're grateful to you.

712
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,200
I wish it had ended
differently.

713
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,800
Yeah. Me, too.

714
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
Hey, has anyone seen Gideon ? 

715
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,000
Agent Gideon
left some time ago.

716
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,600
Said he meet you all
at the airport.

717
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,100
Did he say
where he went to ? 

718
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,500
I think I know where he is.

719
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,500
Hey.

720
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,700
It's quiet.

721
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,900
Construction's taking
the rest of the day off to honor the victims.

722
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,500
You know, the first
reported war was...

723
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,200
2700 b.C.

724
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,600
Probably earlier wars, but...

725
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,300
Writing hadn't been
invented yet.

726
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,300
Almost 5,000 years
of killing each other.

727
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,900
One thing human beings
have been consistently good at.

728
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,100
We did everything we could
for him, you know.

729
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,700
Yeah.

730
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,700
Sometimes knowing that
just isn't good enough.

731
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,300
I know.

732
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,400
"if there
must be trouble,

733
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,100
"Let it be in my day,

734
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,200
That my child
may have peace."

735
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
Thomas Paine.

736
00:41:20,503 --> 00:41:24,500
