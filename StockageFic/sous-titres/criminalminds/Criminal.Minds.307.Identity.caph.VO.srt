00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,840
GREAT FALLS,MONTANA

2
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,520
Damn!

00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,470
{\a6}<i><u><Pride and Joy> by Stevie Ray Vaughan</u></i>

4
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,000
Dispatch 88,in pursuit of a vehicle.

5
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,360
Plates match missing
blue honda,highway 227.

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,050
This is 71 joining
pursuit,request additional back-up.

7
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,390
Come on. Come on!

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,910
What a piece of crap.

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,230
Damn!

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,590
Driver,pull your vehicle over!

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,310
driver,turn off your vehicle
and stay where you are.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,590
driver!

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,010
Put your hands outside the
vehicle where we can see them!

14
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,420
turn off the radio and reach
your hands outside the window!

15
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,550
hands!

16
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,960
both hands,now!

17
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,100
- Now,slowly....
- Grenade!

18
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,510
Get back!

19
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,450
Call for an ambulance.

20
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,150
Officer down! Officer down!

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,490
A popular theory among leading astrophysicists
estimates that the hyper matter reactor

22
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,610
would need about 10 to the 32nd jewels of
energy to destroy a planet the size of earth.

23
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,210
Now,lucas said it took 19 years to
build the first death star,right?

24
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,030
But if you look at the
new essential chronology,

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,990
there's a testbed prototype
for a super laser that spans--

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,340
where are you goin'?

27
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,290
Taking back the last
5 minutes of my life.

28
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,920
You can't go in there.

29
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,300
Don't you want to know about this guy?

30
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,810
I do.

31
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,700
Got it all memorized--
his books,his bio.

32
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,740
Yeah,books have sold
over a million copies.

33
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,630
So?

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,010
There's a million reasons not to
come back,if you know what I'm sayin'.

35
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,020
Taupe walls.

36
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,410
That's a negative color.

37
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,120
Cold,distant.

38
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,920
You know,emotionally,taupe
is linked to loneliness

39
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,520
and the desire to escape from the world.

40
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,190
I just figured the guy's walls would be
covered with plaques and commendations.

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,480
Maybe he doesn't want to be
reminded of past victories.

42
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,720
It's a new chapter for him.

43
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,970
What happened to the moratorium
on inter-team profiling,guys?

44
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,870
Come on,reid,team?

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,660
I don't think this guy knows
the meaning of the word.

46
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,390
Oh,I found something.

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,310
Looks like some type
ofreligiousreligous art.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,180
Original,maybe?

49
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,540
Definitely expensive.

50
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,980
It's renaissance art.

51
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,940
- If that's original...
- is it?

52
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,420
I don't know,it's kinda hard to tell.

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,590
Means he's into the classics.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,910
What else?

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,510
Uh,italian,strict catholic upbringing.

56
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,710
Probably believes in redemption.

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,590
Well,I believe in a lot of things.

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,570
Catholic,yes.

59
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,210
Italian-american,52 years.

60
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,340
Strict upbringing,not so much.

61
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,880
Now,the artwork,that's
15th century,original.

62
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,590
Cost more than my first house.

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,820
And as for the wall
color,it's just a base coat.

64
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,730
Painters will come in
and finish tomorrow.

65
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,950
Now,if you're all finished,I think
J.J.And hotch are ready for us.

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,700
Isn't that how a team works?

67
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,410
Great falls,montana.

68
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,250
Over the past 14 months,3 women
have been reported missing.

69
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,720
Michelle lawford,jennifer
hillbridge,and darcy cranwell.

70
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,640
All young caucasian brunettes.

71
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,850
After an extensive search,all were
presumed dead by local authorities.

72
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,330
So at least we know he has a type.

73
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,700
And now there's a fourth
woman,angela miller.

74
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,690
This morning,she and her car went
missing from a small grocery store

75
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
while her husband and son were inside.

76
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,750
This morning?

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,730
Montana's requesting our help?

78
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,170
40 minutes later,state troopers spotted
angela miller's car on the highway.

79
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,260
And when troopers tried
to apprehend the driver,

80
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,370
he blew himself up with a grenade,

81
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,210
putting one of the
troopers in the I.C.U.

82
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,980
Are they sure that she
wasn't in the car with him?

83
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,740
They went through the wreckage,and
it appears she's still missing.

84
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,890
Troopers get a look at the guy?

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,170
Caucasian,stocky,brown hair,moustache.

86
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,120
Early forties.

87
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,240
He has a scar on the
left side of his face.

88
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,550
Do you think angela
miller's still alive?

89
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,550
Since the other missings were
never found,we don't know,

90
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,250
but he only had her for 40
minutes,so we have to assume she is.

97
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,870
You know,I could have gotten you
a coloring book at the airport.

98
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,520
I'm creating a topographical map,

99
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,300
weighing down and geocoding all key
locations looking for algorithms.

100
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,240
Yeah.

101
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,160
That's exactly what I
thought you were doing.

102
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,770
It's called a jeopardy surface.

103
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,710
It's a way of narrowing down
where the unsub could reside.

104
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,900
And by default,where he may
be stashing angela miller.

105
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,670
You know,it says here the
guy had a fully loaded gun,

106
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,550
so we know he had
options. Why the grenade?

107
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,480
He wants to be remembered.

108
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,400
And he wanted to be sure to take
as many cops with him as possible.

109
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,360
He knows he's out gunned.

110
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
So he waits.

111
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,220
Times it to the last second. Boom!

112
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,160
There are some very committed
people in those parts.

113
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,400
Who love their fire power.

114
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,490
Almost as much as they hate us.

115
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,650
Militia.

116
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,000
And they're heavily armed.

117
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,480
Yeah,but hand grenades?

118
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,370
It's not uncommon for militia
members to have military experience.

119
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,110
Oftentimes,they resent the
structure and they get discharged,

120
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,350
and they form their own
paramilitary governments.

121
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,130
Dental records are on
their way to garcia.

122
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,920
I'll tell her to check
the military first.

123
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,460
Prentiss and i will go meet the husband.

124
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,270
I can walk the other abduction sights.

125
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,080
Everybody else,set up base,work
on geographical profiles.

126
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,200
Establish contact with the
locals,and tread carefully.

127
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,360
They'll be watching us.

128
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,490
He killed a 15-year police veteran.

129
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,830
He died in I.C.U.A couple hours ago.

130
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,770
Sorry to hear that.

131
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,540
So angela miller came
out with the groceries

132
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,190
while her husband took
mark into the bathroom.

133
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,580
He came out,she was
gone,her and the car.

134
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,720
Unsub gets into the car,gun
drawn,and tells her to drive.

135
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,590
She knows her son's
coming out any minute,

136
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,950
so to keep him out of
harm's way,she drives off.

137
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,580
Where did he come from?

138
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,100
All the vehicles in the
vicinity have been accounted for.

139
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,000
Well,if he's a local,he walked.

140
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,840
Well,these folks can rest easy
knowing the bastard's dead.

141
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,610
Except,of course,for
angela miller's family.

142
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,170
Uh,this is agent jareau
with the F.B.I.And--

143
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,820
that's the third time
I've been hung up on.

144
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,470
Try not saying F.B.I.

145
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,510
Who was that?

146
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,580
Contact for a local militia newsletter.

147
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,650
Yeah,drop the F.B.I.Part.

148
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,880
A woman is missing.

149
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,820
You'd think the espeople
would want to help us.

150
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,880
They do want to help.

151
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,970
The missing woman,not us.

152
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,210
Go ahead,garcia.

153
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,990
You were spot on,crime fighters .

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,390
Military records match.

155
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,500
Francis goehring,42 years old.

156
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,540
Did a year in the army for
a bad conduct discharge.

157
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,310
Highlight of which was an
arrest during a bar brawl

158
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,080
in which three other
people were hospitalized.

159
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,510
He also appears in the
federal database for...

160
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,140
get this,aggressive militia groups.

161
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,930
Aggressive militia groups.

162
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,110
Is there any other type?

163
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,170
That's your federal government at work.

164
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,000
We specialize in redundancy.

165
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,850
You see a last known address?

166
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,540
A compound just outside of town.

167
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,070
It's coming your way.

168
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,740
he also has a wife that
doesn't appear to live with him.

169
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,870
Diane marie goehring,lives
in shelby a few hours away.

170
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
Have the state police bring in the wife.

171
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,720
Reid and I will go make
friends with his neighbors.

172
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,400
Thanks,garcia.

173
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,750
We need you to tell us what happened.

174
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,490
The guy that took my wife...

175
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,090
he took the other
missing women,didn't he?

176
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,220
He's a serial killer,that's
why you're here?

177
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,510
No,we're here to help
you find your wife.

178
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,140
You do believe she's alive?

179
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,910
Unless I have evidence to the contrary,

180
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,240
I very much consider her to be alive.

181
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,440
I wouldn't have called him
in if I believed otherwise.

182
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,140
What do you believe?

183
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,330
I believe you spent all morning...

184
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,880
going over and over in your head
about the last time you saw her.

185
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,790
And asking yourself how could
it happen,why did it happen.

186
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,640
Those moments,those memories,

187
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,590
we need to hear them all,in detail.

188
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,240
How's that gonna help save her?

189
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,530
Well,in one of those moments,

190
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,640
someone else may have
been watching her,too.

191
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,440
NO TRESPASSING!! MANAGERS OFFICE

192
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,170
NO SOLICLLORS;KEEP MONTANA ARMED!!

193
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,010
What the hell do you want?

194
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,920
Can't you read?

195
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,180
I'm not a salesman,I'm with the fbi.

196
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,580
Fbi?

197
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,950
You're not serious.

198
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,000
You look like a pipe cleaner with eyes.

199
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,710
I could snap you like a twig.

200
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,370
But then,he isn't alone.

201
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,420
We're here because this was the
address listed for francis goehring.

202
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,740
I haven't seen him in months.

203
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,090
We'd like to see his residence.

204
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,650
Francis goehring abducted 3 women.

205
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,640
We're looking for a fourth.

206
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,470
He took her while her husband
and son were in a store.

207
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,320
This isn't about us,it's about
a woman from your community.

208
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,250
I'll show you his place.

209
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,760
Piece of advice,pipe cleaner,

210
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,540
way you're wearin' that gun...

211
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,770
beggin' someone to take it off you.

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,490
Mostly just junk mail.

213
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,450
Catalogs for firearms...

214
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,780
survival preparedness.

215
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,700
He doesn't sleep here.

216
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,070
Postmarks are new.

217
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,810
He probably just uses
this address for mail.

218
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,220
Odd choice of reading material.

219
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,080
Uh,speaking of reading material,

220
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,050
I've,uh,read all your books.

221
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,460
Thanks.

222
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,980
one thing that always kind
of struck me as odd is that

223
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,330
you really just sort of
glance over ruby ridge.

224
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,150
I mean,you don't-- you
don't have to tell me,I...

225
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,600
this picture seems old.

226
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,910
It's part of a past life.

227
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,320
We need to find where his new life is.

228
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,380
How's that map of yours coming along?

229
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,660
I've got it narrowed down
to about a 30 mile radius.

230
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,840
Well,hotch seems to
think he was on foot.

231
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,970
That's a long walk.

232
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,230
I'm still refining it.

233
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,740
Good.

234
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,070
Hello.

235
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,670
Home movies.

236
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,460
An earthly kingdom...

237
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,390
cannot exist without the
inequality of persons.

238
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,570
Martin luther understood the
weak will always serve the strong.

239
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,570
Like me.

240
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,690
He had dreams.

241
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,360
And ideas.

242
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,940
It's funny,he uses the
chair like it's a throne

243
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,660
and he's framing himself intentionally
with a low angle to give him power

244
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,810
and dominance in the frame.

245
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,060
In feudal times,the lord lived on
high ground to spot the invader.

246
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,500
He had serfs to serve his kingdom.

247
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,720
The lord never had to leave his castle.

248
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,580
The serfs would bring him everything.

249
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,800
They were the appendages of his will.

250
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,880
There's 11 more tapes of this?

251
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,600
It's his manifesto.

252
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,170
First,I will ilbud a compound,a kingdom.

253
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,130
Second,I will arm,protecand
fortify my kingdom.

254
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,090
Third,I will keep women as
serfs to serve my ever need.

255
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,880
This is my right.

256
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,440
As a man with free will in america,

257
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,030
I will make my kingdom a reality.

258
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,690
Well,we know he's
moved out of his house.

259
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,840
My guess is that kingdom
is the reality now.

260
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,970
Hey,he talks about
keeping women to serve him.

261
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,370
It's possible all these
women are still alive.

262
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,850
Excuse me.

263
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,780
Goehring's wife is here.

264
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,720
Thank you for coming to
speak with us,mrs.Goehring.

265
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,320
Did I have a choice?

266
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,810
We need your help.

267
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,950
If I don't have to be here,good-bye.

268
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,920
Um,is this you?

269
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,990
That is you,isn't it?

270
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,890
Where did you get this?

271
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,020
Um,have you seen this woman?

272
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,070
Today on the news.

273
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,470
Well,you probably saw these
three women on the news as well,

274
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,910
and we think they all
share one thing in common.

275
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,330
What?

276
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,610
They all look like you.

277
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,880
A pattern,a type.

278
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,050
You and all of these women fit a type.

279
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,390
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

280
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,270
I...

281
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,580
I haven't seen him
since we threw him out.

282
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,960
We?

283
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,420
The militia.

284
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,150
They saw what-- what he
did to me,and threw him out.

285
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,310
What he did to you?

286
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,960
Francis killed himself yesterday.

287
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,610
He's--he's
dead?

288
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,330
After being caught driving
angela miller's car.

289
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,180
Can you think of anywhere that
he would have taken these women?

290
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,380
Your husband was sadistic.

291
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,450
He hurt you,made you do horrible things.

292
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,300
He treated you like a slave.

293
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,890
Did what he wanted,whenever he wanted.

294
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,340
He did the same thing
to those other women,

295
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,780
except they didn't have
the militia to save them.

296
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,990
Francis said that his
dream started with 9 acres.

297
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,360
What's he talking about?

298
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,390
My parents' land.

299
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,420
When--when--when they died,he
made me give it to him.

300
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,030
Where is it?

301
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,580
FRANCIS GOEHRING'S LAND

302
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,020
Sheriff,let me know when they've
swept the house for explosives.

303
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,110
In the meantime,check the
perimeter. Let's find her.

304
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,870
Tommy,2 men on the house.

305
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,530
- Angela?
- ****

306
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,790
Angela?

307
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,170
Angela?

308
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,850
Angela miller?

309
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,260
Angela!

310
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,530
Hotch!

311
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,870
Rossi!

312
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,360
We got her.

313
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,220
It's angela.

314
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,500
She's gone.

315
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,960
2 exit wounds,upper torso.

316
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,450
I promised her son we'd find her alive.

317
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,730
What is it?

318
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,510
She's still warm.

319
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,890
Look at the blood,it hasn't dried yet.

320
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,820
This is recent.

321
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,830
Very recent.

322
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,490
How is that possible?

323
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,590
Goehring didn't do this.

324
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,820
He's got a partner.

325
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,200
Angela's been dead for
no more than half an hour.

326
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,490
The partner was just here.

327
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,960
He can't have gotten far.

328
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,810
We set up road blocks
within a 40 mile radius.

329
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,270
Sheriff,somebody around here must
know who goehring's partner is.

330
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,800
We should try goehring's
pals,the militia.

331
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,000
Maybe they can help.

332
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,790
Militia leader is harris townsend.

333
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,610
He owns a bar called the horse post.

334
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,060
I'd suggest sending morgan.

335
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,130
What?

336
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,400
All due respect,rossi,but you've
got an entire team to pick from.

337
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,750
You're choosing me?

338
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,920
Are you serious?

339
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,640
No offense,but do you
really want to do that?

340
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,190
Take J.J.With you.

341
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
They know we're here.

342
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,830
But you're the last face they expect.

343
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,960
Let's do it,J.J.

344
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,520
Sheriff,we need to get into the house.

345
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,310
Not until I get the all clear.

346
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,640
Goehring blew himself up.

347
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,000
God knows what else he's got in there.

348
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,360
Search what you can until we get in.

349
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,530
Anything to build a workable profile.

350
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,050
Keeps everything neat.

351
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,730
Obsessively so.

352
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,710
His trailer was organized,but
this is different.

353
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,210
Get back to me on it.

354
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,890
We found some cartridges
and different casings.

355
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,660
The gun racks were empty.
He took his entire arsenal.

356
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,960
7.62 millimeter.

357
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,190
He's got an assault rifle.

358
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,560
And I found 2 sets of men's
shoes of different sizes.

359
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,100
We found fresh tire tracks.

360
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,240
Small pick-up truck.

361
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,650
I know it doesn't narrow it down much,

362
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,700
but let the troopers know they're
looking for a man in a pick-up.

363
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,930
If he's as prepared as goehring,

364
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,930
he'll have a police
scanner and a 2-way radio.

365
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,770
We can tune into the state
geological survey frequency.

366
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,210
Nobody ever listens to that.

367
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,950
Hey,guys?

368
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,020
There are 3 sections of roses,

369
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,550
different heights,different
levels of maturity.

370
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,540
3 different women.

371
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,220
These appear to be the
most recently planted.

372
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,580
The tags are still on them.

373
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,720
Guys...

374
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,420
carrion beetles.

375
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,340
Like in a cemetery.

376
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,980
Sheriff,let's get some shovels.
We need to start digging.

377
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,990
This should be interesting.

378
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,080
J.J.,Wait a minute.

379
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Stay behind me.

380
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,500
When we get inside,do
not,whatever you do,

381
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,960
turn your back on that
door. Do you hear me?

382
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,940
I can handle myself.

383
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,030
We're looking for harris townsend.

384
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,700
Put your badge away.

385
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,430
We know who you are.

386
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,900
We're only here to
talk to harris townsend.

387
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,820
We heard he runs this bar.

388
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,590
I do.

389
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,340
Talkin' isn't exactly what
you boys are known for.

390
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,640
We're investigating
a missing woman--

391
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,200
bobby,be a gentleman.

392
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,270
Pull up a chair for the little lady.

393
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,730
No,I prefer to stand.

394
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,390
I'd prefer it if you both left my bar.

395
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,720
But we have manners.

396
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,060
Glock 17.

397
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,380
Tactical,but european.

398
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,170
Smith and wesson.

399
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,320
Pure american hardware.

400
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,220
I wonder which one is more dependable.

401
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,090
I don't want to be here just as
much as you don't want me here.

402
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,360
But we have a job to do.

403
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:49,510
I never understood how someone
like you could trust them.

404
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,880
Someone like me?

405
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,760
How was the federal government
ever helped your people?

406
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,510
Slavery,ghettos,poverty.

407
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,670
The cia got you all hooked
on heroin in the sixties,

408
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,620
crack in the eighties.

409
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,410
Now,I hate the government. But you...

410
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,330
you should despise them.

411
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,950
They sure as hell don't
care about you now.

412
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,440
There are 5 other members of your team.

413
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,390
Look around you.

414
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,950
Why the hell did they send you in here?

415
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,770
Francis goehring and a partner
abducted and killed 4 innocent women,

416
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,940
the last of which we just found dead in
a bed of roses,shot in the back twice.

417
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,990
Nobody sent me anywhere.

418
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,440
I came here to do right by her.

419
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,820
Now,goehring's partner
is out there somewhere,

420
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,190
so we completely understand if you boys
are just too afraid to tell us about him.

421
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,750
I get it.

422
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,220
But just say so.

423
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,040
Don't go hidin' behind your
vague little gun threats

424
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,070
and your tired conspiracy
theories,please.

425
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,020
Goehring was a piece of dung.

426
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,780
I don't know who his partner is.

427
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,110
I saw him once,through
the scope of my rifle.

428
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,470
Me and some of the
boys were out huntin'.

429
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,030
Small guy,about 5'8.

430
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,070
Following goehring around
like his private pack mule.

431
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,130
Hat on,head down.

432
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,570
That's it,that's all I know.

433
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,020
Just in case you
remember something else.

434
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,430
Take care,boys.

435
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,200
Didn't find any explosives,nothing
rigged,but be careful.

436
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,040
Odd.

437
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,960
Goehring kept his house almost cozy.

438
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,420
- Hotch?
- Yeah.

439
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,570
These tapes have the
names of the missing women.

440
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,920
They've all been un-spooled.

441
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,040
We need to get these
to garcia immediately.

442
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,040
Deputy.

443
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,630
One,all actions must
serve to please the master.

444
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,890
2,insubordination will
result in punishment...

445
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,070
this is his new manifesto.

446
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,750
Notice the "master" is
singular and capitalized,

447
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,520
emphasizing there's only
one dominant partner.

448
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,040
So his partner is more of a servant.

449
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,040
Or a serf.

450
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,550
Watching the house,minding the
lawn,helping him abduct women...

451
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,690
ok,so if his partner is a
serf,what are the female slaves for?

452
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,940
Oh,I think I can answer that.

453
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,980
Now we know why the victims
were taken so far apart.

454
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,380
They tortured them. It
took time for them to die.

455
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,980
This is where he kept them.

456
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,870
The blood's fresh.

457
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,900
What the hell is this?

458
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,860
The pear of anguish.

459
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,310
I've got something here.

460
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,240
Homemade torture tools.

461
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,250
They covered the floor in something.

462
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,260
The bodies are probably
wrapped in whatever it was.

463
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,650
They must have kept these
women in that box for months,

464
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,360
judging by these tools,there will be
a considerable amount of mutilation.

465
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,700
We need to do what we can to help
their families give a proper burial.

466
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,250
Goehring's partner is
early to mid-twenties.

467
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,620
5'8".

468
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,590
Slight build. Shy and retiring,

469
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,190
but groomed by a separatist
armed with assault weaponry.

470
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,760
Like goehring,

471
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,330
he's unlikely to
surrender if he's cornered.

472
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,780
His obsession with cleanliness
and order is deeply ingrained.

473
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,780
This will be reflected in
his home and his vehicle.

474
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,960
We've located hair samples in
the cabin we believe are his,

475
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,170
medium-short length and blonde.

476
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,680
He's the submissive partner,but
having just lost goehring--

477
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,580
the man he was dedicated to
and heavily dependent upon--

478
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,620
he's in crisis.

479
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,360
One more
thing--

480
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,050
never let the bastards take you alive.

481
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,440
And never be forgotten.

482
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,740
That's it. The whole tamale.

483
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,990
Every horrific frame.

484
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,080
I'm done.

485
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,460
- No luck seeing the partner?
- No.

486
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,610
He's-- I scanned
every frame.

487
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,180
He's holding the camera.

488
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,390
You ok?

489
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,480
No.

490
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,660
This is jennifer hillbridge,the
second woman abducted.

492
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,070
Please,stop. Please.It hurts.

493
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,220
What is it with you?

494
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,430
You just don't get it,do you?

495
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,530
Total power over your life.

496
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,130
The cameraman frames goehring,

497
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,830
- but never her.
- Total power...I decide.

498
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,510
Watch.

499
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,360
He never stays on her that long.

500
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,960
He's more interested in
goehring than the torture.

501
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,170
He's lingering on his biceps like
he's caressing goehring's body.

502
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,380
Why the hell?

503
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,860
The unspooled tapes -- that
wasn't to destroy evidence.

504
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,360
It was from jealousy.

505
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,530
What?

506
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,420
He's in love with goehring.

507
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,290
Make a loop.

508
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,260
Tie it around. Bring it through.

509
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,670
Goes through.

510
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,400
He's teaching him how
to tie the perfect knot.

511
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,700
A trucker's hitch.

512
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,300
She's not going anywhere.

513
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,260
So he can be the perfect serf.

514
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,850
It would be part of his
servitude to clean his house,

515
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:53,730
help abduct girls,bury the
bodies,get supplies,plant the roses.

516
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,100
He had to buy roses,and a lot of them.

517
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,730
Someone must have seen him.

518
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,650
Let's get to the nurseries.

519
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,260
We're looking for a man in his twenties.

520
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,150
He keeps to himself.

521
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,830
Avoids eye contact.Speaks very little,

522
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,360
but when he does,he would
sound meek,almost feminine.

523
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,990
He'd have purchased
soil,gardening tools...

524
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,010
buys quite a few rose plants.

525
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,880
Yeah,I know who you're
talking about. Henry.

526
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,810
He's not a customer.

527
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,230
Henry frost. Here.

528
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,220
- He works here.
- Great.

529
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,900
I need an address.

530
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,560
HENRY FROST'S TRAILER

531
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,290
He's destroyed everything he owns.

532
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,060
He has no identity.

533
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,010
He burned his face off his pictures.

534
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,860
Why?

535
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:04,090
A submissive depends upon a dominant
partner not only for instruction,

536
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,470
but for purpose and meaning.

537
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,670
So he's starting
over,wiping the slate clean.

538
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,100
Yeah,but as what?

539
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,030
Sorry.

540
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,190
Did I scare you?

541
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,340
No,it's ok.

542
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,900
- Let me help you with that.
- No,thanks.I got it.

543
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,440
- Oh,god!
- Get in the trunk.

544
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,600
- No!
- Get in the trunk!

545
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,130
- God,please,no!
- Shut up!

546
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,090
Shut up!Shut up!

547
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,890
Get in the trunk!

548
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,340
- Take the car - -
don't tell me what to do!

549
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,790
Help me,somebody!

550
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,520
- Please!
- Shut up!

551
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,850
Help!

552
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,890
Hey!

553
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,370
Son of...Stop the car or I'll shoot!

554
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,360
Damn it.

555
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,660
I could have taken the shot.

556
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,000
I was just afraid of hitting her.

557
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,330
You get a good look at him?

558
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,390
Yeah,he came in.

559
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,730
Big ass bandage on the
left side of his face.

560
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,230
Bought a beer and pumpkin seeds,

561
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,760
went back to his truck and sat there.

562
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,190
Was that his truck?

563
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,010
Yes,sir.

564
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,380
That was their M.O.

565
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,020
Frost chauffeured goehring around.

566
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,170
Goehring picks a
victim,abducts her on foot,

567
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,050
they drive off in separate vehicles.

568
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,870
But this time,frost
had to play both roles,

569
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,430
and he got sloppy,and he
left a witness and his car.

570
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,740
Can you confirm that
that's the guy you saw?

571
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,640
No.

572
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,720
That's him.

573
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,310
He looks like goehring.

574
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,990
Or frost's version of him.

575
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,630
Ok,you're goehring.

576
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,490
Sadistic bastard.

577
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,760
I'm frost,a submissive,troubled,gay man.

578
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,000
I need you to dominate me

579
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,920
because it gives me direction
and a purpose in life.

580
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,690
And life is good.

581
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,050
And then one day,I pull
the pin on a grenade.

582
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,430
You die.

583
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,240
And when I lose you,I
begin to lose my identity

584
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,820
because my sense of
self was tied to you.

585
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,770
You're showing classic signs
of depersonalization disorder

586
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,000
precipitated by the stressor
of losing a loved one.

587
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,560
Now,all that's left is me.

588
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,070
- And you hate yourself.
- I do.Why?

589
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,090
Because I brainwashed
you with all my rules.

590
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,620
I've told you over and over how weak
you are how you're nothing without me.

591
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,350
Right.

592
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,170
So I go back to my home and annihilate
everything I own,every reminder of who I am.

593
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,180
I erase myself and become you.

594
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,020
It's the only way that you can survive.

595
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,870
The only way that you can hold onto me.

596
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,220
Frost transforms himself into goehring

597
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,140
and goes back to abducting women

598
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,570
because that's what goehring would do.

599
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,050
We need to stop thinking like frost
and start thinking like goehring.

600
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,940
'Cause he's still calling the shots.

601
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,250
Help me,somebody!

602
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,080
help!

603
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,990
Let me out

604
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,410
What kind of man follows
another man around like a dog?

605
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,330
If you act like a nobody...

606
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,580
you'll be treated like a nobody.

607
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,570
I'm not a nobody.

608
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,820
- I'm you.
- Help!

609
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,660
Hurry up.

610
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,570
Hurry up! Come on!

611
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,420
Ok,ok!

612
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,350
Get over here.

613
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,900
Get down.

614
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,530
Please

615
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,060
Sheriff,he's taken
on goehring's persona.

616
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,000
We have to assume he's
going to behave the same way.

617
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,330
He's heavily armed,and
he's committed to his cause.

618
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,890
If he's caught,he's
not only willing to die,

619
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,980
but to take as many of
us with him as possible.

620
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:19,210
He's got a hostage,which means I'm going
to need the best sharp shooter you've got.

621
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:19,850
That's fine.

622
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,520
But we don't even know
where this guy's headed.

623
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,040
The team's been working the profile,and
we think we've got something.

624
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,650
In the tapes,goehring makes
several mentions of "ideal land."

625
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,430
He also said that

626
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,800
"lords live on higher ground to better
surveil the land and spot invaders."

627
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,290
He studied medieval defense strategies,

628
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,590
so he'll probably go to a place
where he can protect himself.

629
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,070
High ground,easily defendable.

630
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,600
This picture was on goehring's fridge.

631
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,550
Do you know where that is?

632
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,050
That's black eagle peak.

633
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,760
Militia groups used to use it for training
drills till the state stopped them.

634
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,660
Ideal land.

635
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,790
Please,don't do this.

636
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,890
Why?

637
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,620
This is what I do.

638
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,440
- My name is becky--
- yeah.You shut up!

639
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,600
Shut up!

640
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,310
You don't have a name,not
until I give you one.

641
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,630
You hear me?

642
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,610
I teach school.

643
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,930
I have a fiance.

644
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,130
What happened to your face?

645
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,890
It looks bad.

646
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,660
What's your name?

647
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,230
What's my name?

648
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,170
My name is francis goehring.

649
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,640
******

650
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,610
My guy's got eyes on him.

651
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,280
He's on the very top of the peak
on the far side of that ridge.

652
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,350
He'll see us coming.

653
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,520
He already knows if he's
using that police scanner.

654
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,970
We got to find a way to get up there.

655
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,580
We'll never be able to get close enough.

656
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,070
How it going with the sharp shooter?

657
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,350
Who's that?

658
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,930
Oh,you can't be serious.

659
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,030
You asked for the best. He's it.

660
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,440
Ex-special forces sniper.

661
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,050
- He's a civilian.
- He's militia.

662
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,780
I deputized him.

663
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,960
He knows the terrain like nobody else.

664
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,220
Wind in this valley will change
the trajectory of a shot by inches.

665
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,310
If you can't read the wind,the
wrong person might get shot.

666
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,180
I guess I don't need to
remind you gentleman of that.

667
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,510
We can handle this.

668
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,230
Good luck with that.

669
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,470
Hey,it might not come down
to it if we don't get moving.

670
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,700
I'll go with him.

671
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,620
You want to flank around the
west side of the mountain?

672
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,170
If he's on the north,I'll get a
better view from the east ridge.

673
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,390
It's steeper,higher ground.
Get a clear shot from there.

674
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,790
- If you see the shot,call it.
- Good.

675
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,040
Channel 23. Keep it open.

676
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:42,900
I'll go with the sheriff.

677
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,890
We'll stay at the base
and try to distract him.

678
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,850
You go up to the northeast
and through the middle.

679
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,750
Keep your head down.

680
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,700
Francis goehring?

681
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,270
Channel 2!

682
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,810
All we want to do is talk to you.

683
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,700
Let me know if you can hear me.

684
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,160
Yeah,I can hear you.

685
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,060
Get up

686
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,340
This is my land.

687
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,020
You understand? Not yours.

688
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,900
And you will leave it,or she dies.

689
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,560
She's tucked in real tight.

690
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,270
Too tight. I can't get the shot.

691
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,090
You got to get him to move.

692
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,680
No shot. We got to distract frost.

693
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,980
Get him away from becky.

694
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,930
How are we going to do that?

695
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,240
He's not goehring.

696
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,320
He can't do this.

697
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,940
He shot angela miller in the back.

698
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,170
All I want to do is talk!

699
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,640
You want to talk? You go ahead and talk.

700
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,400
But you come any closer,and
she gets a bullet. You hear me?

701
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,150
She's going to be the
first to go. I swear!

702
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,230
Your policy was shoot to
kill at ruby ridge,wasn't it?

703
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,720
It wasn't,but it is now.

704
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,140
Yeah.

705
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,630
Well,I'm not in the bureau,am I?

706
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,450
We know a lot about you,henry.

707
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,900
We know your name is henry frost.

708
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,280
We know you're
25-years-old.

709
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,820
We know that your dad kicked you
out of the house when you were 15.

710
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,430
He was a drunk and he
abused and he abandoned you.

711
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,060
And ever since,your life has been
a series of jails and institutions,

712
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,130
- and it's been hell.
- Shut up!

713
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,800
No!

714
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,150
Never let the bastards take you alive.

715
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,980
Never be forgotten.

716
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,450
You the man who sent
those 2 agents into my bar?

717
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,500
I was.

718
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,370
To piss me off.

719
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,640
If you have the shot,take it.

720
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,690
Innocent woman died at ruby ridge.

721
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,240
As tragic as that outcome was,

722
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,270
my order on that day is
the same as it is now.

723
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,410
This man is not going to be taken alive.

724
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,560
You were there?

725
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,900
I was.

726
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,890
The shot's the signal to go.

727
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,580
Take the damn shot.

728
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,650
Maybe your partner
will talk him out of it.

729
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,580
Henry,just let the girl go.

730
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,170
And I'll clear everybody out,

731
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,860
and you and I can just talk.

732
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,930
That's a promise.

733
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,990
- It doesn't have to end like this.
- Yes,it does!

734
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,480
Yes,it does!

735
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:18,250
And it will!

736
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,150
Henry,let her go.

737
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,940
Henry,let her go!

738
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,820
Ok,ok,it's ok.

739
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,060
I'm gonna get this off you.

740
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,070
He's gone.

741
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,090
Let me help you up.

742
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,910
- Is there anything else on you?
- No.

743
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,790
It's quite a view.

744
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,470
Reminds me of idaho.

745
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,510
Me,too.

746
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,640
All anybody remembers is that

747
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:35,650
an fbi sniper killed a mother
while she was holding her baby.

748
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,060
6 months later. Waco.

749
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,000
80 men,women and children died.

750
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,100
Not a single shot did we fire that day.

751
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,840
The legacy of those
failures still haunts us.

752
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,280
It's why some people don't trust us.

753
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,830
Made me start thinking
about leaving the agency.

754
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,640
So what started you
thinking about coming back?

755
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,610
Unfinished business.

756
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,640
You know,there's one thing
you'll learn about me,rossi.

757
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,270
I'm relentless.

758
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,340
I'll find out.

759
