1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Diane arbus once said:

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
"A photograph is a secret
about a secret.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The more it tells you, 
the less you know."

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Spencer! Spencer Reid!

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Dude! Look at you!

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You look just the same. Ha ha!

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Look at you, dude.
Nothing's changed.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Spencer was the only 12-year-old
in our graduating class.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Just the same.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thanks.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is special agent
Jason Gideon.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is Parker Dunley.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We went to high school together, 
as you can probably gather.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
- How you doing?
- Hey.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a beautiful gallery.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Thank you.
Thank you.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Jason's a big
contemporary art enthusiast.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, we're exhibiting
4 up-and-coming artists
in this show.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Everything's for sale,

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,474
and I can definitely swing
a nice discount for a friend.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Lila.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Guys, come on.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
do I look 12 years
old to you?

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,838
14.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Spencer, I'd like you to
meet a real movie star.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Movie star? Please.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
She has a supporting role on
a television series about beach volleyball.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Totally blue-collar.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm Lila.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hi. I'm, uh, I'm doctor
Spencer Reid. Uh--

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm spencer. You don't have to..
call me doctor.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I won't.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Excuse me. Hey!

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I told you! No photos
in the gallery!

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Out!

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And who are you?

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm Jason Gideon.
I'm a friend of--

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
have you seen my work?

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,575
- No.
- Thanks.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So, you're not from
around here, are you?

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Me? No. No.
I'm, uh..

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
we're running a training
service about profiling

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
for the los angeles police department.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Profiling?

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, I'm with the behavioral 
analysis unit of the fbi.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
we psychoanalyze crime scenes
 in order to

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
gain a better understanding
 of the criminal who might have
committed the crime.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Psychoanalyze, huh?

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
are you doing that
to me right now?

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What? No.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm not psychoanalyzing you.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,316
Spencer,
I'm kidding.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
One of my
earliest works.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Totally boring.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, I don't think so.
nothing's just a picture.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If viewed correctly--

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
whatever that means--

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
one can see world
views, obsessions,

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
in manifestations
of the subconscious.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If I weren't a lesbian,

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'd jump your bones!

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I've always had this
thing for middle-aged men.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You have these piercing,
discerning eyes which remind me

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
of my father who was
a shrink. And I'm like,

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
god, I am so hot.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Pinky, some guy from
artnews wants to talk to you.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,053
Don't go away.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Does it make you
feel anything?

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Like what?

71
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,058
I can't tell you
how to feel.

72
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:27,852
Right now, I feel
pretty good.

73
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:29,000
We're leaving.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We're still looking
at the exhibit.

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Now. Now.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, I guess
we're leaving.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
- Reid, now.
- Nice to meet you.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
On the way.
Bye, Spencer.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,025
Sorry.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Today, we thought we'd focus on what is probably
the most important component of profiling,

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
or for that matter,
any investigative technique:

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Victimology.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The word victim stems
from the latin word victima

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
which means "sacrifice."

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No, I can't go to the gym.
i'm waiting for my shooting script.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I think it just came.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Uh, yeah. Ok. I'll see
you at the gym, babe, bye.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Victims of violent crimes
are brutalized by a subject

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
who takes upon him or herself to decide life
and death over a fellow human being.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hi.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you gonna
give it to me?

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,034
Aah!

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There are around 16 million people
 in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Every time a person
is killed, robbed, or raped,

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the most important question
you will ask yourself is why?

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why did your unsub
choose this victim--

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
At this time.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
- Natalie?
- Is there anything done

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
which provoked
the criminal to act?

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Or was the target
available or weak,

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,931
a causality of circumstance?

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Natalie?

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Natalie.

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, my god!

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, my god! No!
Natalie! No!

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,178
Oh, my god!

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,552
Criminal minds
Season 1 Episode 18

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
you know, we really
can get ourselves to the airport.

110
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:58,867
I didn't invite the FBI here to let them
make their own way around town.

111
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:00,000
We really appreciate it.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,661
I can't thank you guys enough
for conducting the seminar.

113
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:06,200
Well, don't hesitate to call if 
there's anything we can help with.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,245
Kim here.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,261
Great.

116
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:24,253
Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I drop 
the FBI agents at L.A.X.

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Everything all right?

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,698
Double murder at a hollywood bungalow.

119
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:30,954
A celebrity.

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Young movie star Natalie Ryan and her fiancé

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,979
apparently shot to death.

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,444
It's gonna be a major pain in the ass.

123
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,000
You guys care to take a quick look 
before I drive you to the airport?

124
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:42,770
It's on the way.

125
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:44,931
Absolutely.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,036
No sign of forced entry.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Same weapon.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The girl was shot execution style.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Once in the head.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The male 3 times in the torso.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,212
so you have 2 different M.O.S.

132
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,922
We have an image on the video
surveillance camera.

133
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:18,940
Looks like a messenger of some kind 
wearing a motorcycle helmet.

134
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,212
He's unidentifiable.

135
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:23,000
There's no sign of struggle between the girl 
and the unsub from the door to the couch.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,791
He most likely forced her at gunpoint.

137
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:28,174
He told her to trust him. "Do what I say. I won't hurt you."

138
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:29,543
Fatal mistake.

139
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:33,000
He asked her to sit on the couch 
and then shot her in the head.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,963
The fiancé wasn't expected. His killing's messiest.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's less controlled. It's less organized.

142
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:40,555
What do you think?

143
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,000
I've had a couple other cases recently.

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Past few months.

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Same type of weapon, .22 caliber handgun.

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Both shot in the head.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The first was an established film producer, Wally Melman.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And the second was Chloe Harris,

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Another young actress..

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
but not as well known as natalie here.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
any forensic evidence?

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No. And the guys have been going through this place all morning

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and haven't come up with anything.

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So he clearly knows how to cover his tracks.

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
In like a professional hit man?

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,242
Maybe.

157
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:18,000
Gideon, there are people actually taking
 photographs of us from the next yard.

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,531
Welcome to L.A.

159
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,000
22's are small but efficient.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They bounce around inside a person like a pinball.

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Preferred weapon of the mafia.

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
U know, there's no obvious sexual component to these crimes

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,746
which is usually the case with serial murders.

164
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,962
So are are thinking this is a serial killer?

165
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:37,000
Well, it's certainly a series of murders.

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,090
We don't know enough yet to call them serial.

167
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,000
Would you consider hanging out in L.A. A little while,

168
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
let me lean on your expertise until 
we do figure out what we've got?

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah. Just cancel our flights.

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,097
We'll have the rest of our team out here ASAP

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
First 2 victims: Wally melman and chloe harris.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Both killed in public places.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Chloe was killed while walking her dog

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
on the beach in santa monica which she did every morning.

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And wally was killed outside of a massage parlor.

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
- In culver city.
- Which he went to every tuesday.

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, if he knows their schedules, maybe that means
 he follows his victims for a while.

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and not a single witness.

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So we know this unsub can blend in.

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Regardless of the location, he has the ability to hide in plain sight.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He's meticulous.

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The media's calling Natalie Ryan's murder

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the biggest celebrity homicide since Sharon Tate.

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What does that mean for us?

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,673
That everybody will be watching.

186
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:28,046
This guy is an assassin?

187
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,000
When you look at the victimolgy,

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,934
there's no obvious links.

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All the kills are clean except in the instance 
of the last victim, Jeremy Collins.

190
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:38,000
There's absolutely no evidence 
left at the crime scene.

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There's no dna, no manifestation of psycho-sexual release,

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and there's no detectable signature of any kind.

193
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,796
Remember, our profiles are formulated

194
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:50,858
not just by what's present at the scene, 
but also what's absent.

195
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:52,000
From all the evidence that we've gathered,

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
we believe that you're looking for 
a type-4 assassin.

197
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:56,654
Type 4?

198
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:59,000
Type one's are political assassins, 
like John Wilkes Booth.

199
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:02,603
Type 2's are egocentrics looking for simple recognition

200
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:06,000
type 3's are psychopaths, cold-blooded killers 
who leave far messier scenes.

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And type 4, our unsub, suffers from a major mental disorder

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,395
and is frequently delusional.

203
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,713
The closer we come to figuring out that delusion,

204
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:15,737
the closer we'll get to finding the unsub.

205
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,945
what's he going to be doing until we do?

206
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,000
finding other victims.

207
00:10:19,894 --> 00:10:20,784
Excuse me.

208
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:22,057
Hi.

209
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:24,000
Is there a detective Kim here?

210
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:25,847
Right here.

211
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:28,000
You're heading the investigation 
into the Natalie Ryan murder?

212
00:10:28,914 --> 00:10:29,201
yes.

213
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:31,000
Um.. my--I have a client.

214
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
She's, uh..

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
is there another place we can be private?

216
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,867
We're all working this murder.

217
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,000
Well, um..

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
she received a note, my client did,

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and she freaked out. I told her not to worry about it.

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,027
Where is the note?

221
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,556
where's your client?

222
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:53,000
She's waiting in the other room.

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,227
Reid, let's go.

224
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,728
Lila.

225
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,990
Hi.

226
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
How well did you know Natalie Ryan?

227
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,700
We spoke when we saw each other in public,

228
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,700
but we were never friends.

229
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
how about Wally Melman?

230
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
What?

231
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
Wally Melman.

232
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
He's a producer who was killed a couple months ago.

233
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
The paper said that was a robbery

234
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,700
the paper was wrong.Did you know him?

235
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,700
We met a few times about a project, but..

236
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
I didn't get the part. They went a different way.

237
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Which way?

238
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,994
He cast, um, another act.

239
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Oh, my god.

240
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
what is it?

241
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,656
he cast Natalie Ryan.

242
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,614
"You owe me."

243
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
I guess that's one way to ice out the competition.

244
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
don't look at me.

245
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,700
I brought her to the police station.

246
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,700
Have you ever had a sense that someone is watching you,

247
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,700
following you?

248
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,700
From the moment i get to work,

249
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,700
I have hair and make-up and wardrobe people, producers

250
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,700
writers, my agent, my manager, publicist.

251
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Not to mention the photographers.

252
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,700
It's part of the life.

253
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Anything seem out of the ordinary?

254
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Happens on a regular basis or semi-regular basis?

255
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
what do you mean?

256
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,700
repetitive phone calls gifts left anonymously.

257
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,700
I receive flowers on the seventh of each month.

258
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,246
They just appear in my trailer.

259
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,135
Never a note. Just a plain glass bowl.

260
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,487
Red anemones.

261
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,700
My favorite.

262
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
And you don't want to know who they're from?

263
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,700
Celebrities get anonymous gifts all the time.

264
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,700
She has fans, you know.

265
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,375
You remember meeting anyone on the seventh day of the month?

266
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,700
- Or in july, the seventh month of the year?
- No.

267
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,700
Wally melman was a producer who considered hiring you,

268
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,700
but didn't. And Natalie was a rival.

269
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
And Chloe Harris?

270
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,542
She looks a lot like you, don't you think?

271
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,700
- Who? 
- A potential rival.

272
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
She was murdered, too.

273
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
So all these..

274
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
people are being killed because of me?

275
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,700
It's possible.

276
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
I'm sorry..

277
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
i can'T. I--

278
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:21,700
I have to go.

279
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Lila!

280
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
Lila.

281
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Lila.

282
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,700
What's happening, Spencer?

283
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,700
it's still rather speculative, 
but it appears there's a delusional assassin

284
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,700
who's killing people to help further your career.

285
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
It probably started as a stalker.

286
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
An erotomanic stalker.

287
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,700
The's a psychopathology of the evolution 
of these types of stalkers.

288
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,700
And the fact that he's contacting you indicates that

289
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,700
he believes you owe him something.

290
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,700
This model frequently concludes itself to one of 2 possibilities:

291
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,700
Either the stalker will kill himself, or

292
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,528
he'll kill the object of his affection.

293
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,700
With this unsub, we're looking at a compound profile:

294
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,700
A type-4 delusional assassin

295
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,700
with an erotomanic fixation on the actress Lila Archer.

296
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Erotomanics are a form of stalker

297
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
who posses the delusional belief that another person,

298
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,700
usually of a higher social status, is in love with them.

299
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,700
In the united states, at any given time,

300
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
there are over 200, 000 people being stalked.

301
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,700
Our unsub is having a fantasy love affair

302
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,700
with Lila Archer the way John Hinkley 
did with Jodie Foster.

303
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Ms. Archer was not aware of her stalker until yesterday.

304
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
He wasn't trying to impress her.

305
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
He was more like an unwanted,

306
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,700
very violent guardian angel.

307
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,700
When the stalker feels as if they've been
 in some way betrayed by their love object,

308
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,700
this often leads to violence against the target.

309
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,700
In the case of John Robert Bardo 
when actress Rebecca Schaeffer took a role

310
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,700
where she had to have a sexual relationship 
with another character,

311
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
it was enough to force him to snap 
and seek her out to kill her.

312
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Though stalkers can be either male or female,

313
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,700
it's most likely we're looking for a single male,

314
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,700
a loner, in his late twenties to early forties,

315
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,700
very intelligent,

316
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,700
with ample time to follow his victim

317
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,700
and study her habits.

318
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,700
As of yet, the unsub has not directed 
any violence towards ms. Archer.

319
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,700
But he has shifted his focus from 
those around her to her directly.

320
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,700
This doesn't preclude the fact that anyone

321
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,700
who has the vaguest association with ms. Archer

322
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,310
is a potential target.

323
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
I love you. You're my favorite client.

324
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
- No. - I haven't asked you anything yet.

325
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
I'm not stopping my life.

326
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
You can stay with me.

327
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
No.

328
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,700
A hotel? Just until the police say you're safe?

329
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,700
- Michael-- 
- you know I worry.

330
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Good-bye, michael.

331
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
Ok. Call me..lots.

332
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,700
Kisses.

333
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Hello. Good-bye.

334
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
I'm leaving.

335
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
Hey, mags.

336
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,700
He's an odd guy.

337
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,700
Yeah, but who isn't a little odd out here?

338
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
Well, that's for sure.

339
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Look, we're ready to rehearse scene 43

340
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,700
and..this was taped to your trailer door.

341
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,438
Thanks, hon.

342
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,700
I'm intrigued by this particular version of the verb "to be."

343
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Past participle.

344
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,700
Steady state of being.

345
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Preceding adverb.

346
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
- "Always." 
- In english?

347
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
That is english, actually. 
We're discussing the verb tenses--

348
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
Reid.

349
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Our stalker sounds like someone she knows.

350
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,700
Based on the tense of the verb.

351
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
Maybe it's time to get her off the street.

352
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,700
There's been no physical threat to her.

353
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,700
She might be safe just staying put as opposed to anywhere else.

354
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,700
I'm standing right here, guys.

355
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
If we did remove you,

356
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
we'd have to take you to an undisclosed location

357
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,700
i'm sure your stalker knows where you live.

358
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
I'm not having the whole show close down.

359
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,700
I only need one more scene to shoot.

360
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Look, last night i decided I wasn't 
gonna be afraid of this lunatic.

361
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,700
Am I safe here?

362
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,700
The set's cleared of everyone except essential personnel,

363
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,359
and we have increased security at the gate.

364
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Lila, they're ready for you.

365
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,612
I'm staying at work, gentlemen.

366
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Well, she's one tough girl.

367
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
yeah.

368
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
I didn't want to say anything in front of her,

369
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,700
but his anger about her going to the police 
suggests he might alter his agenda.

370
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Typical for a stalker.

371
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
She didn't go alone to the police.

372
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Her manager took her.

373
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,796
You and Reid stay here. Keep an eye on her.

374
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,700
I'll hang back, too.

375
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Where you going?

376
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,876
To talk to her manager.

377
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,700
Sorry if I was, um,

378
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,700
insensitive last night.

379
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
You were only doing your job, right?

380
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Yeah.

381
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,851
Then there's no need to apologize.

382
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,335
You don't mind sharing with me, do ya?

383
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,655
No.

384
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:39,782
You don't mind sharing with me, do ya?

385
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:42,444
- Shut up. 
- Go get 'em, lover.

386
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Hello?

387
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,079
Mr. Ryer?

388
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,726
Michael..

389
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,700
until now, every victim's a person who 
can be perceived as a threat to ms. Archer.

390
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Yeah, but michael was a friend.

391
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,318
He was a threat to the stalker.

392
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
get Lila to a safe house.

393
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,300
She's still working. Did you meet up with her manager?

394
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Gideon: Reid, take her home, have her pack some things.

395
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,391
What's going on?

396
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,294
We were too late.

397
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,300
She's gonna be devastated.

398
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,575
I know. Jj's keeping it out of the press for now.

399
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:30,606
Let's not tell her yet.

400
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:31,300
Not tell her?

401
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
No, not yet.

402
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,300
We need her to cooperate with us..

403
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,734
in order to protect her.

404
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,807
I'll talk to you later.

405
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,300
You gonna take her of the street?

406
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
I'm gonna completely deny him access.

407
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,300
Won't even give him a glimpse of her.

408
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,439
Hopefully, that'll bring him out of the woodwork.

409
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Yeah. No, we're pulling up right now.

410
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,300
Uh-huh. There's a marked car out front.

411
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
Yeah.

412
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,373
Got it. I'll check it out.

413
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Is everything ok?

414
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,300
I just need to run through some security measures with you.

415
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,910
all right

416
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Gideon,

417
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,351
you better take a look at these.

418
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Morgan, it's elle.

419
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Yeah.

420
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,300
We found a manila envelope on Michael Ryer's desk.

421
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
It's full of photos.

422
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Ok.

423
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,871
Well, they're candid shots os Lila Archer nude.

424
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,300
I'm guessing he was probably paying someone off 
to keep them out of the press.

425
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Do we know who?

426
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,300
Um, the name on the envelope was Joe Martinez.

427
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
The paparazzo?

428
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,300
You know him?

429
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Yeah, I dealt with him a lot.

430
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,519
Elle, we're on it.

431
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,181
Wow.

432
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,261
I like your house.

433
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,485
I rent it.

434
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,821
Nice. You should also probably change 
all your phone numbers.

435
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
I'm unlisted.

436
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Anytime you call an 800 number or an 888 number,

437
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,300
your phone number's put into a databank 
that's been sold to telemarketers.

438
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
If someone gets your cell phone number,

439
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,496
they can go on line and research all your records.

440
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,582
Hanging out with you can be really depressing.

441
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,300
You should also probably carry a piece of paper 
and a pen with you wherever you go

442
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,055
in case you see any suspicious 
license plates that often reappear.

443
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Photographic collage.

444
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
I like it because it's like life, you know?

445
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,474
You know, like obscure, difficult.

446
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
You should also get a dog.

447
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Uh, like a guard dog of some sort.

448
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Allergic.

449
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Um, earl grey or chamomile?

450
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
What? What?

451
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Would you like some tea?

452
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,175
Yes, yes, sure.

453
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
FBI!

454
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,084
Martinez.

455
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,189
It's clear.

456
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,039
See?

457
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,174
This guy's a real scumbag.

458
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:27,270
You got that right.

459
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
What's this?

460
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
It's a call sheet.

461
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
It's a shooting schedule for a film or television show.

462
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
- That's Lila's show.
- Yeah.

463
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
He's not supposed to have that, is he?

464
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,736
No.

465
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Hey.

466
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
Look.

467
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,300
That's Reid.

468
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,343
There's a whole bunch of them

469
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
He's a target now?

470
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,391
Not if I can help it. Let's go.

471
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Reid, it's morgan. Listen to me.

472
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
You got to watch your back over there.

473
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,900
We just find a bunch of close-up photos of you 
at this guy Joseph Martinez's studio.

474
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
Looks like he could be the unsub.

475
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,214
He had a ton of photos of Lila and Natalie, 
in plus a call sheet for Lila's show.

476
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
We're on our way right now,

477
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,079
but I need you to be real careful until we get there, all right?

478
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,622
Right.

479
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
You're hit?

480
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Yeah. Just my shoulder.

481
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,450
All right, I'll call in for help.

482
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,835
officer down. We need an ambulance at la brea and wilshire.

483
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
How we doing?

484
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,400
He'll make it. Caught one in the shoulder 
and shattered his collarbone.

485
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
You okay?

486
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm fine.

487
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
No sign of this martinez, the photographer?

488
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,400
whoever took a shot at you followed you from the set.

489
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Martinez has a bunch of paperwork in his studio 
that says where Lila is gonna be every day

490
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Gideon

491
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
At's what th thanks.

492
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,099
Garcia's gone through every article written about Lila.

493
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:24,929
She never says anything about red anemones 
being her favorite flower.

494
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,400
Well, we're looking for someone pretty close to her.

495
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
This list gets shorter everyday

496
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,698
We need to get to her house

497
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:33,399
I make sure the press doesn't 
get out of hand with this mess

498
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
feel anything yet

499
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,155
there's something definitly 
appealing about this one.

500
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,483
it's a start.

501
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
What are you doing?

502
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Going for a swim.

503
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,316
What? No. Lila.

504
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Lila, you cannot do this.

505
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,515
Five minutes.

506
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Go get a suit in the house.

507
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
What? No! I don't wanna grab a suit.

508
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Are you kidding me? No.

509
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,452
- Join me. 
- No, I'm not gonna join you.

510
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,400
Why not?

511
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,400
You're being pursued by a psychotic killer
 who shoots people in the head.

512
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:30,154
I'm not gonna stop living my life. I'm just not.

513
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,474
Lila, I'm begging of you. 
Will you please get out of the pool?

514
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:36,400
Really, spence, you should live a little.

515
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Live a little? I've known you 48 hours,

516
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,400
I feel like I've already aged 10 years.

517
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
I can't be that bad.

518
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,916
Yes. No, you are that bad.

519
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,586
Fine, can you help me out at least?

520
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Yes, very funny.

521
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Laugh it up, lila. Hilarious.

522
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,111
My gun's wet. Great.

523
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
My clothes.

524
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,526
you should have worn the suit.

525
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
This is completely inappropriate.

526
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
This? What's this?

527
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,954
This isn't--

528
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,400
No, there's this thing called transference.

529
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
You don't like me?

530
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
What?

531
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
- You don't like me. 
- I doikyo I do.

532
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
- I like you too.
- I like you too

533
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Just I'm a federal agent, you know,

534
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
and I'm supposed to protect you.

535
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Then keep me close.

536
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
I'm just, uh, I'm a little bit worried.

537
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
You know, we're-- we're in a pool,

538
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
and it's a--

539
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,400
we're pretty much exposed.

540
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
We have cops.

541
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,400
We have cops posted out front.

542
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,268
There are coyotes out back.

543
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,658
And right here it's just you and me.

544
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
i, uh..

545
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,400
stop. I'm sorry. I have to, um,

546
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
I have to tell you something.

547
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
What?

548
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,400
I didn't want to tell you this before 
'cause I was a little bit worried.

549
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
I didn't-- you don't--

550
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I don't know how to say it, but I can't not tell you.

551
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
What is it?

552
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Your manager, michael..

553
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,400
what?

554
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,400
gideon went to check on him, but

555
00:27:52,400 --> 00:28:05,400
he got there too late.

556
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Lila.

557
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,400
How could you--

558
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
how could you not tell me?

559
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I was afraid you'd be upset.

560
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
You..

561
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,400
you knew what you knew, and--

562
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
how could you not--

563
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,538
i'm so sorry.

564
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
No, don't, don't touch me.

565
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,003
Don't touch me.

566
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,874
Give me a reason.

567
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Well, we found him in the bushes.

568
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,747
I told her she should cut those.

569
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
I, uh, fell in.

570
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Yeah, and I'm sure there's plenty of photos of it.

571
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Stop shoving me, man.

572
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,400
You're a suspect in the murder of Wally Melman, 
Natalie Ryan, and Jeremy Collins.

573
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
Murder? What? Whoa, whoa--

574
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
shut up with the whoa.

575
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,400
We know for a fact that you have 
hundreds of photographs of Lila Archer

576
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
and natalie ryan on the walls of your studio.

577
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
You have miss archer's daily schedule on your desk.

578
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
You've been stalking her.

579
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Look, guys, look. Hold up.

580
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,400
every paparazzo's a celebrity stalker.

581
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
If you don't stalk 'em, you don't get the shot.

582
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
If you don't make the shot, you don't sell no pictures.

583
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Well, this one is gonna cost you.

584
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
wha--no.

585
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
That's just wrong.

586
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Tell it to your lawyer.

587
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
- I'm still being locked up? 
- That's right.

588
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,901
At the very least, you're trespassing. Let's go.

589
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,362
You're welcome.

590
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Lila

591
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Are you still--

592
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
are you okay?

593
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,134
Michael was like family.

594
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,080
I'm so sorry.

595
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,945
It's just so hard to trust people out here.

596
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:12,400
You don't--you don't know who to believe.

597
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Everybody wants something from you.

598
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,447
that's why I thought you were different.

599
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
I know I should have told you.

600
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,400
I told him not to.

601
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,643
He was only following my orders.

602
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
You know..

603
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,400
the last time I was able to fully

604
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,586
trust someone was at julliard.

605
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Before I was a somebody.

606
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Julliard.

607
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
And didn't you say you used to live on Houston street?

608
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
What?

609
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,400
You were a waitress. You lived on houston.

610
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,459
Yeah.

611
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,177
I need to take this thing apart.

612
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
What?

613
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,400
I'll-I'll put it back. I--I think I see images of you.

614
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,114
Guys.

615
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Lila, it looks like someone's been stalking you for years.

616
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Yeah, this tells your whole life story.

617
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Movie premieres,

618
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
theater playbills.

619
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,035
Everything since college.

620
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,400
that's our country house.

621
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Right here.

622
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Who gave you this collage?

623
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
He did.

624
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
This guy? Who is he?

625
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
That's the guy I went to high school with.

626
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,666
Parker Dunley.

627
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Garcia.

628
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Parker dunley.

629
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,523
E-mail me a sheet on him, all right?

630
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,400
oh, look who's here.

631
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
where's Parker?

632
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,400
I don't even get a hello?

633
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
where is he?

634
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,400
guess that follows since I never got a good-bye.

635
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,002
Parker!

636
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
friend of yours?

637
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
No.

638
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
How could I help you?

639
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,400
hey, spencer's friend, right?

640
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Yes.

641
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Did you give lila archer a collage?

642
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
What?

643
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
There's a photographic collage above lila archer's sofa.

644
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
She says you gave it to her.

645
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
so?

646
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,400
So it has your face hidden all over it.

647
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I didn't make the damn thing.

648
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
so you..

649
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,218
just happened to give her a work of art 
that contains most of her life in it?

650
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
I--no.

651
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
No.

652
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,348
If there's something you aren't saying, 
now would be a real good time to say it.

653
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,026
All right.

654
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
All right, I lied.

655
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,400
What about?

656
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
I just wanted her to like me.

657
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
I met her here.

658
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
She was a fan of art.

659
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,400
I figured if there was hip, young stars coming into the gallery,

660
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
it would help business.

661
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
what was the lie?

662
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Someone gave me the piece to give to her,

663
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
but I told her it was from me.

664
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
I said I found it and I thought she'd love it.

665
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,400
And who gave it to you?

666
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Her name's Maggie Lowe.

667
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
she, uh,

668
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
she works on lila's show.

669
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,400
She said she went to college with li. She's like a

670
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,400
P.A. Or A.D. Or some acronym.

671
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,400
She wanted to make sure that lila got the collage,

672
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
but she didn't want lila to know that she gave it to her.

673
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,026
she said to say that it was from a secret admirer.

674
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,400
But I told her it was from me, so..

675
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
I have a name.

676
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Maggie lowe.

677
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,108
She's the unsub. She's on lila's show.

678
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,635
we're on our way.

679
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
Lila, do you know someone named maggie lowe?

680
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
mags?

681
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Yeah, of course i know her.

682
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
I've known her for years.

683
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,315
I got her a job on my show.

684
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
What?

685
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,400
- That's her calling right now.
- Is she calling from a cell phone?

686
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,400
- Yeah. 
- Lila, we think maggie's the unsub.

687
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
The what?

688
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
The stalker.

689
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
No way.

690
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
Answer the phone.

691
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
That's-- that's crazy.

692
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Answer the phone. Act completely natural.

693
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,400
The longer you keep her on the line, 
the more likely we'll be able to trace the call.

694
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,676
Trust me.

695
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Hello?

696
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Hello, maggie?

697
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Maggie, is it you?

698
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
What's wrong?

699
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Oracle of quantico. Speak if you deign to hear truth.

700
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Garcia, I need an emergency trace on a cell phone 
call to Lila Archer's cell phone.

701
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Sure, go ahead.

702
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,400
3-2-3 5-5-5 0-1-2-9.

703
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Okay, keep her talking. Keep her talking.

704
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
Maggie?

705
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Oh, I am so tired.

706
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,925
Tired?

707
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,400
There's been so much upset.

708
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
In the world really.

709
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
I think it's just so tragic.

710
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,400
All of it.

711
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,190
I miss you.

712
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
I just do.

713
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
Mags.

714
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
I saw you today.

715
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,400
It's never gonna be the same as it was.

716
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
It's just never gonna be the same.

717
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

718
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,400
I'm talking about that time in college

719
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
when the heat in your apartment was off

720
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,237
and the two of us stayed in my dorm room. 
Don't you remember?

721
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,771
You were playing Ophelia on the main stage.

722
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
I remember.

723
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,498
That was the happiest time of my life.

724
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Maggie..

725
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,400
sweetheart,

726
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
that was only for a weekend.

727
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
The happiest time,

728
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,811
and you don't know anything about me at all.

729
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,394
And I did everything for you.

730
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Reid, is lila's address 6028 pike street?

731
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Yeah.

732
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
She's calling from inside the house.

733
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,027
I'll get you some backup.

734
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Lila.

735
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
How is she in the house?

736
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,714
She has keys.

737
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Why'd you have to bring these people here?

738
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Put down the gun.

739
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Maggie.

740
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,306
Don't call me maggie. You don't know me.

741
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,346
Come on, lila. Let's go.

742
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,506
We really got to go, baby.

743
00:37:23,657 --> 00:37:25,400
Maggie, don't hurt her.

744
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
You don't need to hurt her.

745
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
You don't know anything.

746
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,051
I would never do anything to hurt you.

747
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
No.

748
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,489
I created you.

749
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,987
No, you didn't.

750
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,691
Yes, I did.

751
00:37:43,726 --> 00:37:46,610
I know I did.

752
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,219
God.

753
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
You stupid,

754
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
ungrateful..

755
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
god!

756
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,400
I can't believe that I loved you.

757
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Maggie, she, uh,

758
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,633
she loves me now.

759
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,474
What?

760
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:09,400
She told me so.

761
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
We were in the pool.

762
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
She kissed me.

763
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Now she loves me, okay?

764
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,547
No.

765
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Tell her we kissed in the pool.

766
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,796
No!

767
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,043
Yes, we kissed.

768
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,290
God!

769
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Don't move.

770
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Please.

771
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Please kill me.

772
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Come on. shoot me please. 
I'd be so much happier. Please.

773
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,115
Please!

774
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,404
Come on.

775
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,563
We're gonna get you help.

776
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,571
it'll be all right

777
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Back up. Let's go.

778
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Darling, e-scape wants to do a segment on you 
this evening on the stalking event.

779
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
I told them yes.

780
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Why'd you do that?

781
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
It's okay. It's gonna be fine.

782
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
The hair and makeup people are coming in 10 minutes.

783
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,890
There's also talk about 60 minutes.

784
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,400
This kind of publicity makes me really uncomfortable.

785
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Don't be ridiculous.

786
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
I'm talking about performing a public service, all right?

787
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Stalking is a major problem in this country.

788
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,914
It's good, it's good.

789
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,611
All right, I got to take this.

790
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Looks like, uh, you're gonna be pretty busy.

791
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,400
I wish things had been..

792
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
more normal when we met.

793
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Lila, believe me when I say this.

794
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,284
I've never known a normal day in my entire life.

795
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Hey, reid. Come on. We got to move.

796
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Gotcha.

797
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Well, um..

798
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,400
if I'm ever in Washington and

799
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
I were togive you a call, that would be okay?

800
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,659
Yeah, I'd like that a lot.

801
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
I don't want to intrude.

802
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
No, not at all.

803
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,400
- Reid, sorry, we're waiting. 
- Lila, we got to go.

804
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,400
And I don't know when you're gonna be back here,

805
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,202
you know, the next time you're in Los Angeles, 
if you'll be fit for time.

806
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,682
Lila, we got to go.

807
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Bernard Shaw once said,

808
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
"an american has no sense of privacy.

809
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
"He does not know what it means.

810
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,585
There is no such thing in the country."

811
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Good night Hollywood !

812
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
come on, man.

813
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
You know, reid,

814
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,400
you're lucky they didn't get a shot of you 
next to the pool trying to draw your gun.

815
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,708
You looked like a wet rat.

816
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Hey.

817
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,094
I was playing.

818
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
Did you know that,

819
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,400
um, she, uh,

820
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
I kissed her in the pool?

821
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,400
It's so weird. It doesn't even feel like
 it really happened, you know?

822
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,400
Sure, sure. She's a beautiful young actress.

823
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Yeah, you know, I kept explaining to her 
about transference and the fact that,

824
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,400
you know, she probably only liked me 
because I was there to protect her.

825
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,793
Reid.

826
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,481
You were her hero.

827
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
I wanted to think that.

828
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
No, no, no. Don't go selling yourself short, kid.

829
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,400
You took down an armed subject without firing a shot.

830
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,289
You saved her life.

831
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,281
That's pretty much a hero in my book.

832
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Let me ask you this. Have you ever

833
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,188
crossed professional boundaries with a victim 
of a case you were working on?

834
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
No.

835
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
It's pretty bad, right?

836
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,105
Some things you can't control 
even with that big ol' brain of yours.

837
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,211
No harm, no foul.

838
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,282
Let it go.

839
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,058
Hey, Morgan?

840
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,400
Has there ever been a girl 
that you wanted to be with for more than,

841
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,531
you know, just one night?

842
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,258
Excuse me?

843
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,400
I've never seen you with the same girl twice.

844
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
What, are you calling me a dog?

845
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
No, not at all.

846
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,338
I'm just trying to figure out if this feeling 
I have is ever gonna go away.

847
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Reid, what we do for a living, it takes up all our time.

848
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
And a relationship's hard enough even in the same city.

849
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
So,

850
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
I mean, you're saying it's probably wise that

851
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
I don't call her, right?

852
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,934
I can't answer that one for you.

853
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Hey, I'll tell you what I do know.

854
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,299
You don't need to come up with that answer tonight.

855
00:42:55,394 --> 00:42:56,130
I'm out.

856
00:42:57,059 --> 00:42:57,930
Have a good weekend.

857
00:42:57,965 --> 00:42:59,747
Yeah, you too, Romeo !
