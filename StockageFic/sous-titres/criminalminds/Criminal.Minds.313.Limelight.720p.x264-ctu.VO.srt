1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,500
Bid is 150.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,500
Do I have 200?

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,900
200. Do I have 250?

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,300
A lot of stuff in this unit, people.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,500
250.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,400
Do I hear 3?

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,000
300.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,900
Stu, what are you doing?

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,800
Making my move.
You said 250 was the cutoff.

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,300
300, going once...

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,900
twice...

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,000
350!

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,200
Leave it alone, stu.

14
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,400
450.

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,200
Dude!

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,800
Gotta show this guy we're serious.

17
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,400
The bid is 450.Do I hear 500?

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,900
There are 3 other units up today.

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,600
I've got a feeling about this one.

20
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,100
450 going once...

21
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,400
the last time you had a feeling,

22
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,200
we ended up with a crate of dead car batteries

23
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,100
and a dog bed.

24
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,400
450 going twice...

25
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,800
sold. It's all yours, boys.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,900
Settle up at the office.

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Nice.

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,000
Check it out.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,600
Cha...ching.

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,600
This is like a journal or something.

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,100
Uh, dude.

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,100
That is wrong.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,600
Where do you even find stuff like that?

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
No idea.

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,300
There's gotta be a market for it, though, right?

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,800
I think we need to call the cops.

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,700
You got something?

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,700
Not sure.

39
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,300
It's from an old storage unit.

40
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,000
Case agent from the philly field office sent it to me.

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,000
Somebody you know?

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
She knows me.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
You know. Ah. A fan.

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,000
Your world's a very crowded place, isn't it?

45
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
You'd be surprised.

46
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
This is detailed.

47
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,900
Future tense.They're fantasies.

48
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,100
That agent thinks it could be more than that.

49
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,400
There's more of this?

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
A few boxes in the field office.

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,900
I'd like to drive up there
look at the rest of the material,

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,200
make a judgment from that.

53
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,200
Take reid with you.

54
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,500
Road trip--nice!

55
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,700
I've got books on tape with peter coyote
reading the entire foundation trilogy.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,200
How do you get used to the staring?

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,200
I'd feel like I perpetually
have something stuck in my teeth.

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,600
You learn to ignore it.

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm not terribly interested in what you can't do, roy.

60
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,400
We have the best resources in the world,

61
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
one of which is supposedly you.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
Just--just get me that match.

63
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,100
David rossi in my office.

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,300
Somebody pinch me.

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,300
You must be agent morris.

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,700
Jill, please.

67
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,900
And can I get you anything? Coffee?

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Actually, if you don't mind,

69
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,400
I'd like for dr. Reid and I to get to this.

70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,700
Dr. Reid.

71
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,800
Thank you both for coming.

72
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,100
You won't be disappointed.

73
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,700
What other materials do you have?

74
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,200
We found assorted artwork, torture porn, bondage.

75
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,500
But what strikes me

76
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,400
is the prose.

77
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,900
It screams of high-order  sexual predator.

78
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,500
I think we're onto something big.

79
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,900
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

80
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,200
I assume you ran the name
of whoever rented the unit.

81
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,600
Yeah, the name was fake.

82
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
Louis ivey. There's no record
of such a person.

83
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,600
Did he pay in cash?

84
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,000
Till he went into arrears.
6 months without a payment

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,300
and the owner is allowed
to auction its contents.

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,000
What I've read so far
suggests an orderly personality.

87
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,600
Not likely to miss payments.

88
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,400
Well, he screwed up.

89
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,100
They all do eventually,right?

90
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,800
Maybe I will take that coffee.

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Well, you were in there a long time.

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,100
I wanted to look at all of it,

96
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,900
to be sure.

97
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
And are you?

98
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
No.

99
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Really?

100
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,700
You--I would be lying

101
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,200
if I said I wasn't disappointed.

102
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,800
The materials are the product
of a disturbed individual,

103
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,400
but there's nothing there to convince me

104
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,400
that the person has enacted on his fantasies.

105
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,700
So you've come to say good-bye.

106
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,700
I'm afraid so.

107
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,700
We've got real cases in quantico,

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,400
cases with bodies.

109
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,100
But if I am right about this thing,

110
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,800
there will be plenty of those.

111
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,100
It was nice meeting you.

112
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,200
There was something else in the boxes.

113
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,500
In eyes of a predator,

114
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,800
you wrote that collection
of integumentary items

115
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,200
is a definitive precursor.

116
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,600
Skin, nails...

117
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,500
hair.

118
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,700
This guy's for real.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,300
I'll call my team.

120
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
We've got work to do.

121
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,200
Great.

125
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,350
I know indeed what evil I intend to do,

126
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,450
"but stronger than all
my afterthoughts is my fury,

127
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,050
fury that brings upon mortals

128
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,350
the greatest evils."

129
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,050
Euripides.

130
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,550
Is this everything from the unit?

131
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,550
No. We pulled the salient materials

132
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,150
and had philly P.D.Process the rest
of the items on site.

133
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,150
What else was there?

134
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,150
Just some books,albums, toys.

135
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,050
Toys?

136
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,050
Yeah. Old stuff, like from his childhood.

137
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,650
And we were able to lift some prints,

138
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,050
but afis was a bust.

139
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,350
He's not in our system.

140
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,850
Morgan and prentiss,go back to the unit

141
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,550
and see what else it can
tell us about the man.

142
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,650
I'll get you directions.

143
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,150
We have to establish if this guy's taking his fantasies

144
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,350
to the next level.

145
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,950
We can use these materials
to try to identify his signature

146
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,450
and connect him to any open cases.

147
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,850
On the surface it reads
like he wanted to try it all.

148
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,250
I think isolating any one aspect
might be tough.

149
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,350
Well, then dig deeper.

150
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,650
Try linguistics.Look for patterns
in the handwriting.

151
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,150
Rossi and I will take the images.

152
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,450
Find the fetish,find the fiend.

153
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,050
Hey, you want to make this interesting?

154
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,350
Best insights,loser buys lunch.

155
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,050
Ooh, bring it on, girl.

156
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,050
Ok.

157
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,750
It looks like we have a happy kid.

158
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,250
Well-rounded,varied interests.

159
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,550
This looks to have been drawn
at about the schematic stage.

160
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,350
So that would make him about 6 years
of age at the time, right?

161
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,050
It's dated 1976.

162
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,050
So that would make him about 38 now.

163
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,550
Kid's blond, assuming it's autobiographical.

164
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,050
And he's caucasian.

165
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,650
Oh, yeah, you hit that one on the head.

166
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:11,950
Ohh...

167
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,550
but, now, here, look.

168
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,150
Look at how the drawings
change over the years.

169
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,050
A bright sun, a loving family,
an idyllic home.

170
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,950
But then, the mother goes away.

171
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,750
Maybe she leaves them
maybe she dies.

172
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,750
The father struggles
to make ends meet.

173
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,450
The boy begins to withdraw,

174
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,650
retreating within himself.

175
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,550
This is his turning point.

176
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,450
So what informed his fantasies,

177
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,050
and when did it begin?

178
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,650
This is the earliest one
I found--1982.

179
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,650
It's tame in comparison
to the later stuff.

180
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,250
Vintage.

181
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,650
Think he was a collector

182
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,050
Or it was handed down.

183
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,450
From his father?

184
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,550
I can still remember
my dad's less than

185
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,250
skillfully hidden stash.

186
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,650
But this guy graduated
to harder stuff--

187
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,450
the torture porn.

188
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,450
It's brutal.

189
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,050
It brought out certain desires.

190
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,950
The early exposure was a trigger.

191
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,650
When I interviewed bundy,

192
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,250
he had a theory about pornography.

193
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,950
He said, if you want to stop people
from becoming like me,

194
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,050
don't burn  catcher in the rye.

195
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,050
Burn hustler.

196
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,350
I read your books,too, dave.

197
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,150
Got some textbooks in here.

198
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,750
Engineering.

199
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,750
Mathematics.

200
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,150
Cad manual.

201
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,250
Trade school.

202
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,750
Ok, so he's in a fix-it field.

203
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,650
Construction,home improvement.

204
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,750
That's good.

205
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,050
But I think I got you.

206
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,150
Not so fast.

207
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,050
Look at these.

208
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,550
Dresses.

209
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,550
What...

210
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,750
they're different sizes.

211
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,050
Mm-hmm. They were different sizes.

212
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,150
They've been altered.

213
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,850
Cross-dresser.

214
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,950
Tch...looks like
I'm buying lunch.

215
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,250
Extra-linguistic indicators in his writing

216
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,450
suggest he's most excited
by the prospect of electric shock.

217
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,650
As a method of torture.

218
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,750
Be specific.

219
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,550
When you're in a court,the judge will demand it.

220
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,750
See how heavy his handwriting becomes?

221
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,250
At times he so exhilarated,
he actually rips through the page.

222
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,650
The idiolect supports it as well.

223
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,550
I mean, nowhere else is he as creative
in his descriptions.

224
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,850
Good work.

225
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,650
You found a signature that's easy to track.

226
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,450
The electrical burns on his victims
will be unmistakable.

227
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,250
This is dana foster.

228
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,250
She's a 34-year-old real estate agent
from the suburb of blue bell.

229
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,750
She was murdered 5 years ago

230
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,850
when she went to meet a prospective buyer

231
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,650
at a house in bucks county.

232
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,650
Her nude body was found in a cellar,

233
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,350
and she was strangled and raped.

234
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,950
And here's the torture behavior
that reid identified from the journals.

235
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,350
The contact wounds are burn marks,

236
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,150
most likely the result of electrical current.

237
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,950
Any leads on the buyer she went to meet?

238
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,850
Fake name.

239
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,250
Louis ivey.

240
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,850
Could this guy be any more perfect?

241
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,050
Were her clothes found at the scene?

242
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,050
No. How'd you know?

243
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,350
He takes them as souvenirs,

244
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,450
and he alters them
to fit his own frame.

245
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,850
So he's bisexual?

246
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,350
Actually,most cross-dressers
are heterosexual.

247
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,250
It's fairly common
in sexual predators.

248
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,650
What about her hair?

249
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,950
Was any of it missing?

250
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,150
Not that was reported.

251
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,450
J.J.,Contact garcia and widen
the victim search.

252
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,050
Rossi and I will go visit the crime scene.

253
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,950
Watch this, daddy.

254
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,250
Hold on, son.Let me get the door.

255
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,650
Mr. Overholt?

256
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,450
I'm agent hotchner.

257
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,250
This is agent rossi.We're with the fbi

258
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,050
FBI?

259
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,550
You've lived in this house for 4 years, correct?

260
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,350
Yeah.

261
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,250
I assume disclosures
were made at the time of sale

262
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,650
about what occurred here?

263
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,350
Yeah.

264
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,250
My son doesn't know about that,

265
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,750
and I prefer to keep it that way.

266
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,650
Of course. We understand.We'll be discreet.

267
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,250
We just need to take a look at your cellar.

268
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,650
I've had it locked up since we moved in.

269
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,750
You know, it'S...kind of useless, anyway.

270
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,250
Floods when it rains,

271
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,150
you know,it's really damp,

272
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,450
and all the electrical's messed up.

273
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,850
Hope you guys don't mind
if I stay up here.

274
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,550
We'll try not to take too long.

275
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,950
So...

276
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,550
he's done with the tour
of the main house.

277
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,850
Before he goes,

278
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,350
he asks the realtor

279
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,050
to see the cellar.

280
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,750
And boom.

281
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,250
Contusion on the back of her head
says he surprised her.

282
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,450
He incapacitated her
with a blunt object.

283
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,750
Thick walls.

284
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,550
Neighbors are few and far between.

285
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,150
He can make her scream
as loud as he wants to.

286
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,450
Rope burns on her wrists.
He probably suspended her.

287
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,650
Here.

288
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,750
Like in his drawings.

289
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,550
And then he applied the current
and watched her whole body spasm.

290
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,750
And makes her dance.

291
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,250
But where does he get the juice?

292
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,750
Cattle prod? Taser?

293
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,050
Contact wounds
don't conform to that.

294
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,050
Outlet's been tampered with.

295
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,750
Careful.

296
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,750
Jerry-rigged.

297
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,550
Clamp is still there.

298
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,150
He didn't have to use a taser.

299
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,650
He pulled power from the house.

300
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,350
Handy guy.

301
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,150
Dave and hotch are back.

302
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,150
Thanks.I'll be right in.

303
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,250
Wow.

304
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,450
It's impressive.

305
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,450
Oh, it's just stuff on the wall.

306
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,950
You know, I didn't join
the bureau to win awards.

307
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,750
Then, uh, maybe you can loan me a couple.

308
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,650
Hey, um, J.J.

309
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,350
What do you think of these?

310
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,850
What's this?

311
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,050
Well, we can't call him
the unsub forever.

312
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,450
We generally try not

313
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,550
to mythologize these guys.

314
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,150
All right.

315
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,950
And these aren't very good, anyway.

316
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,150
The fact is,we don't even know
if this guy's a serial.

317
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,050
Actually, we do.

318
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,550
3 females, age 31-38,

319
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,750
discovered off freeways
in maryland, jersey,and new york.

320
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,450
All naked, burn wounds
consistent with the signature.

321
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,750
And he disposed of all of the bodies

322
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,950
in different states
to avoid detection.

323
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,050
Garcia, when were these bodies discovered?

324
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,450
Between '02 and spring of '03.

325
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,750
After the real estate agent,
he changed his methods.

326
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,750
Fast learner.

327
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,450
4 kills by the age of 30.

328
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,550
And he was just getting started.

329
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,600
We connected the 3 new bodies
with missing person cases.

330
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,900
So with a total
of 4 victims on the board,

331
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
we were able to narrow down
the unsub's type.

332
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,300
30s, attractive, caucasian,upwardly mobile?

333
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,400
Yeah.

334
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,100
College grads,above-average income,
career women.

335
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,400
You establish a cycle?

336
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
10 months between the realtor
and the first of these victims.

337
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Then 7 months,

338
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,900
3 months.

339
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,600
He's practically doubling
his pace every time.

340
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,200
As with most prolific killers,

341
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,900
the cooling-off period tends to
shorten after each murder.

342
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Last know victim was found
almost 5 years ago.

343
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
5 years?

344
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,600
So could he haedtoppve s?

345
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
No, not this guy.

346
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,200
It's more likely
we just haven't found the bodies yet.

347
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,000
And there might not even
be bodies, per se.

348
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,700
We know he wrote extensively
about creating a homemade incinerator.

349
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
So how many we talking,

350
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,900
ballpark?

351
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,800
If you extrapolate the cycle in the last 5 years,

352
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,400
he will have killed
approximately 19 more women.

353
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
It's great stuff, guys.

354
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,600
Keep me posted.

355
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,100
She does know we don't work for her, right?

356
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,200
With 4 known victims,

357
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,100
we should start by
re-interviewing friends and family.

358
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,800
We're looking for a white male
in his 30s to 40s.

359
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,300
And with his knowledge
of circuitry and wiring,

360
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,600
we think that he's either
an electrician or an electrical engineer.

361
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,900
It's a job that may give him access

362
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,200
to a victim's home or workplace,

363
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,000
the opportunity to observe his targets.

364
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,400
They're attractive,professional women.

365
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,300
He sees them as strong,

366
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
righteous, unobtainable.

367
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,500
So he seeks to tear them down,

368
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,500
to reduce them
to base sexual creatures

369
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,800
and punish them.

370
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,800
He's a true sexual sadist.

371
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,000
A typology we refer to
as anger-excitation,

372
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,300
meaning he becomes sexually aroused

373
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,900
by the suffering of his victims.

374
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Killing these women is an afterthought.

375
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,800
Their pain is what he's after.

376
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,100
And he takes his time

377
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,500
to exact maximum stimulation.

378
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,900
What about his trophies?

379
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,200
He keeps their clothes,right?

380
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,800
Yes. We believe he's using them
for rehearsal fantasies.

381
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
By dressing as his victims,
he can relive the torture.

382
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,100
It's during this time that
he most likely pleasures himself

383
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,300
in order to reinforce his association

384
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,400
between suffering and gratification.

385
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,700
And when he becomes dissatisfied with this,

386
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,200
he seeks out a new victim.

387
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,100
Keep in mind,

388
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,800
he's been doing this for a long time,

389
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
and he's been thinking about doing it
most of his life.

390
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,400
He'll continue to evolve,

391
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
finding new ways
of challenging himself,

392
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,000
increasing his stimulation threshold.

393
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,700
There are no boundaries for this man.

394
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,700
Hotch.

395
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,400
He's an individual that we believe

396
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,300
to be currently active within our community.

397
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,200
If it were not for certain evidence

398
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,700
brought to our attention
in recent days,

399
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,400
he may well have continued
to operate without our knowledge.

400
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,300
We're still investigating more specifics...

401
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,100
you know about this?

402
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,800
...Past murders and who might
have been his victims.

403
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,700
But now that he is on our radar,

404
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,600
you can rest assured
that we will find him

405
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,200
and bring him to justice.

406
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,100
Agent,

407
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,800
I don't know
how you usually do things,

408
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
but you need to let my team know

409
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,900
if you're planning on holding a press conference.

410
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,900
No, it wasn't a conference.

411
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It was just an announcement.

412
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
I think you know what I mean.

413
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,800
We're sending half
the cops in the city out to canvass.

414
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,800
The story would have leaked.

415
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,500
I was just putting a reassuring face
on the situation.

416
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,400
Your face.

417
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,700
I'm the case agent.

418
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
And you're also outranked
by every member of my team.

419
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,600
Meaning what, you'll
vote me off the island?

420
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,200
Nothing tears a case apart

421
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,000
faster than an agent trying to make
his or her name on it.

422
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,900
I'm trying to protect my city

423
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,800
from what could be the most prolific
serial killer since charles cullen.

424
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What about michael strenko,

425
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,900
florian gall,christopher hardgrove?

426
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,900
I don't know those names.

427
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,100
Those are cullen's victims.

428
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,300
Nobody remembers the victims.

429
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Everybody remembers the killer.

430
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
And that's exactly what happens

431
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,000
when an agent puts the story
ahead of the case.

432
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
And the bureau doesn't need
any more agents like that.

433
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,200
Do you understand?

434
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,400
I have no doubt she's highly capable.

435
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm just--I'm saying that

436
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,200
I find her excitement level

437
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,100
at the prospect of finding more bodies
somewhat unsettling.

438
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,100
Thank you.

439
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Yeah, J.J. Said she was making up names
for the killer.

440
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,700
And yet, if she was a man,

441
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,800
you'd say she had balls.

442
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Oh, don't even go there.

443
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,300
This is not a gender thing.

444
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,300
Right.

445
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,000
Let's get back to reid's map.

446
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,100
All right, the nearness principle tells us

447
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,100
that a killer won't travel far
to abduct his victims,

448
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
but this one's gone to great lengths

449
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,900
to spread out his abduction
and disposal sites.

450
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,500
So the sites are irrelevant
to the geographical profile?

451
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,300
The only location I can
attach a real meaning to is the storage unit.

452
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,800
4 victims and we got squat.

453
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
For years he's gone unchecked.

454
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,200
I think it's only a matter of time
before he grows comfortable

455
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
and starts killing closer to home.

456
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,000
Unfortunately,that only helps us
if there's a fresh kill.

457
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400
So there's a woman out there right now

458
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,900
who has to die so we can do our job.

459
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,100
Hi.

460
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,500
Did something happen?

461
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,600
Yeah. Uh, agent hotchner

462
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,500
tore me a new one,

463
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,000
and I owe you an apology.

464
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,100
Why me?

465
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,900
I got you to bring
the whole team up here.

466
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,100
And then...

467
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,200
the press briefing.

468
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,700
It could have waited until morning.

469
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,700
My conscience doesn't allow
sleep in these situations.

470
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,800
Looks like you could use a break.

471
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,000
There are no breaks.

472
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
But there are drinks.

473
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,700
Let me buy you one.

474
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Female ambition can be unseemly
in the eyes of some people.

475
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,600
And I forget that sometimes.

476
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,800
When I was in the academy in '97,

477
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,700
I scored 99 on my
defensive tactics test,

478
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,100
which, needless to say,

479
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,100
had an immediate chilling effect

480
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,700
on all my relations with the male cadets.

481
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,300
I bet you can't remember a time

482
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,500
when you didn't overachieve.

483
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,200
Well, the youngest kid
in a single-parent home,

484
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,700
you learn to scratch

485
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
and claw real quick.

486
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,800
Single parent.

487
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,200
That would be your father?

488
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,700
Go on.

489
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,800
A good man,

490
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,600
who you came to see as weak,

491
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,300
unable to provide,

492
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,200
probably a drinker--

493
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm guessing scotch.

494
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,400
Blended.

495
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,100
I prefer single malt.

496
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,900
I think I did a seminar
at the academy in '97.

497
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,000
Yes. "Collateral materials
on sex crimes."

498
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
I was in the third row,

499
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,500
hanging on every word.

500
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,200
Good memory.

501
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,900
Well, your first book
had just come out

502
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,000
and you signed my copy.

503
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Yeah, I kind of
had a thing for you.

504
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,600
Come on.

505
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,900
You were a star.

506
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,700
No one in the bureau
had made inroads

507
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,100
into publishing and
consulting like you had.

508
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,600
Your hair was lighter
and a big longer then,wasn't it?

509
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,000
Talk about a good memory.

510
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,600
No. I don't remember you.

511
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,700
Oh.

512
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,900
But that would explain

513
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,700
the hair that you claim
to have found

514
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,100
in that storage unit.

515
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
The hair was a keepsake,
I'm guessing?

516
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,800
You held on to it
as a vestige

517
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,400
of the femininity you relinquished

518
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,000
in the pursuit
of your career ambitions?

519
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,900
You can stop profiling.

520
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,300
You manufactured evidence

521
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,000
to get a B.A.U. Commitment.

522
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,600
And it was for the greater good.

523
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,900
I was right,wasn't I?

524
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,000
Look, jill,

525
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,000
I know you.

526
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
When I was your age
I wanted the same things.

527
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,500
But I burned a lot of
bridges in the process.

528
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,800
People got hurt.

529
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,000
Is that why you came back,

530
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,700
to undo your past wrongs?

531
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
Just be careful.

532
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,900
That ego of yours is
going to get you into trouble.

533
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,300
Now I've got to get some sleep.

534
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,700
Your little press conference

535
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,100
is gonna bury us tomorrow.

536
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Bury us how?

537
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,700
I had a nightmare
the night she went missing.

538
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,900
It woke me up,

539
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,100
but I forgot it instantly.

540
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,300
You know how that happens?

541
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,100
I know this sounds crazy.

542
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,700
I feel like

543
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,000
if I could remember that dream,

544
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,200
I'd know what happened to her.

545
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,700
When she didn't show on time,

546
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,700
I left her a message
on her cell phone.

547
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,500
I was...angry with her

548
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,600
for making us late.

549
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,500
I didn't know.

550
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,800
And that message is probably still
on her phone somewhere.

551
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
It keeps me up at night

552
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,200
wondering if she ever heard it.

553
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,900
I just want to know
if she's still alive.

554
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,600
It's the not knowing.

555
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,800
It's selfish, I know--

556
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,400
our own peace of mind.

557
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,000
She disappeared 2 months ago

558
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,200
on her way home from work.

559
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,300
This is what she was wearing.

560
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,900
We just want to know
what happened to her.

561
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,000
It hurts.

562
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,900
It hurts me.

563
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,200
You like it.

564
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,900
What?

565
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,300
You like how it feels.

566
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,900
I like it.

567
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,200
Do you love the pain?

568
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
No.

569
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,100
Yes.

570
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,500
No.

571
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,000
No. Don'T.
Ask for it.

572
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,800
No, don't!

573
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,800
Don't!

574
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,600
Don't!

575
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,300
Please!No!
Please no more!

576
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,900
Aah!

577
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,100
Oh, it hurts.

578
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,900
It's so bad.
No! No!

579
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,600
Just kill me!

580
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,900
Just kill me.

581
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,700
Just kill me.

582
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,100
Aah!

583
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,400
Philadelphia police department.

584
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,800
Man: I think I saw something.

585
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,200
It might have to do
with the killings.

586
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,100
What did you see?

587
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,400
My car broke down on I-76.

588
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
There was a field off the road.

589
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,400
A man was digging a hole.

590
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,200
What kind of hole?

591
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,100
For the body.

592
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,700
I saw it.

593
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,900
A bleeder stripped of its clothes.

594
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,800
Can I have your name, sir?

595
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,100
Mile marker 115 on the eastbound.

596
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,700
They'll find it.

597
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,500
Anything strike you?

598
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,300
Stripped of its clothes.

599
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
Objectifies the victim.

600
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,800
Exactly. Dehumanizing.

601
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,700
This wasn't just any tipster.

602
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,500
The way that he referred

603
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,100
to the body as a bleeder...

604
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,500
visible trauma to the corpse.

605
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,300
No, I don't think so.

606
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,200
I noted usage of the same word
in the pages

607
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,300
from the storage facility.

608
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,000
He refers to his targets as bleeders.

609
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,900
It's misogynistic.

610
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,300
He's referring to menstruation.

611
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,700
He'd use it as a weakness.

612
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,500
I think we need to see
what's in that field.

613
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,100
M.E.: Morning.

614
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,000
Prentiss:Good morning.

615
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,400
Body looks well-preserved.

616
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,500
Been some cold snaps
the last few months.

617
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,400
Ground's frozen.

618
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,600
Check out her stomach.

619
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,600
Prentiss:Electrical burns.

620
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,500
Fingers are in really bad shape.

621
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,900
How are her teeth?

622
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,600
Looks good for an I.D.

623
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
To say we need a rush

624
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,200
on that would be an understatement.
You understand?

625
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,300
Yeah.

626
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,000
Thank you.

627
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,900
Let's get her up.

628
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,400
Gently.

629
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,400
Hey!

630
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,800
You guys might want
to stick around.

631
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,900
He calls in anonymously

632
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,400
and hands us 2 more victims.

633
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,700
Why?

634
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,000
You vowed publicly
to bring him in.

635
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,500
He may be reacting to that.

636
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,300
To show you who
you're dealing with.

637
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,200
He's a narcissist.

638
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,000
He's preening.

639
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,000
Good.

640
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
I hope he keeps it up.

641
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,300
You don't want that.

642
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,700
He will drop a breadcrumb

643
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,200
every time he tries
something like this.

644
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,400
He'll drop bodies, too.

645
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,700
If he's making it personal,

646
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,500
he'll get sloppy

647
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,800
and give himself away.

648
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,300
Maybe that's what he wants.

649
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,600
It never tracked for me

650
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
that this guy defaulted
on that storage unit.

651
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,000
You think he wanted us
to find it?

652
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,200
Maybe he's decided

653
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,700
it's time for the world
to know his name.

654
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,100
But if he wanted a coming-out party,

655
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,900
then why not just send
his victim photos,

656
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,000
videos,something to prove
what he is.

657
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,600
He wanted us to start
at the beginning,

658
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,500
to chart his evolution.

659
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Bright childhood
grows into darkness.

660
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
He's got us chronicling
every step.

661
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,900
So if this is his story,

662
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
what chapter are we on?

663
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,800
The final one.

664
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,700
He's writing it as we speak.

665
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,800
Hey, honey, um,

666
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,700
I think we have to cancel
with your parents.

667
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,000
I know, I know.

668
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,800
I'm really sorry.

669
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,300
It's just, I'm on deadline

670
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,500
and I'm gonna be
cutting it close as it is.

671
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,800
I will make it up
to you, I promise. Ok?

672
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,000
First thing next week--

673
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,000
yes. No, we'll have--

674
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,000
Uh--

675
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,300
gil? Yeah, I, uh--

676
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,300
someone rear-ended me.

677
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,700
No, no, I-I'm fine.

678
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,400
It's fine.

679
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,300
Look, let me call you back.

680
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Yeah, ok.

681
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,000
Hey, I'm sorry
about that. Are you ok?

682
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,800
I'm fine.

683
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,400
Ohh...I just wish I could
say the same for my car.

684
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,900
Oh, it's my brakes.

685
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,000
I've been meaning
to get them fixed.

686
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,900
Well, just tell me
you're insured.

687
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,100
Oh, yeah, of course.

688
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,000
It's the law, right?

689
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,500
Ok.Just let me get my card.

690
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,500
Hey, you know, I should probably
get your information, too,

691
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,300
just to be safe.

692
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,000
Absolutely.

693
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,400
When I got shot,

694
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,500
I kept wondering

695
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,800
why god would program our bodies

696
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,300
to register that kind of pain.

697
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,100
And you know
what got me through it?

698
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,900
No, penelope, I don'T.

699
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,500
Tell me.

700
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,800
Knowing that the pain
would eventually end.

701
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,600
But these women,

702
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,700
they don't even have that.

703
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,900
When he's torturing them,

704
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,300
there's no end, just--

705
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,100
And philly lab
matched the I.D.S

706
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,300
of the dental records
on the two women from the grave.

707
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,600
Go ahead. Guys.

708
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,000
Mimi adams and sara coswell.

709
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,700
You'll find them
in the missing person files

710
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,100
we've flagged as possible victims.

711
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,300
Thanks, mama,we're on it.

712
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,500
Wait, there's something else.

713
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,200
Both women were reported
missing 4 months ago...

714
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,100
on the same day.

715
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
He's doing doubles.

716
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,600
Doubles.

717
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,500
Killer got bored,

718
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,000
upped the stakes,
and did 2 women in one day.

719
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,100
Gerard schaefer did it.

720
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,400
He took his cue from bundy.

721
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,600
Said it was twice as hard,

722
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,400
but twice as much fun.

723
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,100
Yeah, so he kills
with impunity for years

724
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,000
without the slightest bit of heat

725
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,300
and he needs a bigger fix.

726
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,400
So he starts doing two a day.

727
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
4 months later
he still can't get off,

728
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,500
so he opens his storage
locker for us.

729
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,000
Jill.

730
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,300
Chronicle holding on 2.

731
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,700
Yeah, I'll take that in my office.

732
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,400
Planning another press conference?

733
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,000
Agent morris.

734
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,700
I-it's kat townsley.

735
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,100
Look, kat, I know I owe you,

736
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,300
but I don't have anything right now.

737
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,300
And even if I did,
I couldn't tell you.

738
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,000
No, actually, I have
something for you.

739
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,300
Uh, check your e-mail.

740
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,600
Just one second.

741
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,900
You all right?

742
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,100
You sure sound tired.

743
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,600
I'm fine.

744
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,600
Um...do you have it?

745
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,900
Yeah.

746
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,800
What is it?

747
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,500
It was sent to my by the guy

748
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,300
claiming to be the pererson
you're looking for.

749
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,200
Breadcrumb.

750
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
What?

751
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,700
I need to read
the rest of this letter.

752
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,400
I'll come meet you.

753
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Ok.

754
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,000
I heard we got I.D.S
on these two bodies.

755
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,800
Mimi adams and sara coswell.

756
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,500
What's up?

757
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
This woman's husband came in before.

758
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,800
She fits the victim type.

759
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,600
I thought maybe...

760
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,400
if you have her dna,
you might want to check it against the hair.

761
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,200
What hair?
From the storage unit.

762
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,800
Agent morris found it early on.
It's the same color,

763
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,500
so it might--
it won't match.

764
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,100
Reid: I know it's a long shot,

765
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,300
but I think--she didn't get
the hair from the unit.

766
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,600
She lied?

767
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,600
When were you gonna tell us?

768
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,600
Whatever she did to get us here,

769
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,400
we're here now.

770
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,800
It's unacceptable behavior.

771
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,000
Why do you keep defending her?

772
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Because I know what she is.

773
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,500
She's me 20 years ago.

774
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,800
She's nothing like you, dave.

775
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,500
Come on, hotch,

776
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,600
I know what people think.

777
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,500
I took serial killers mass market.

778
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,500
Now everyone knows their names,

779
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,700
but not the victims, right?

780
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,900
Somewhere along the line,

781
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,000
I put myself first.

782
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,700
I admit it. I can't
go back and change it.

783
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,300
But it's not too late for her.

784
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,500
Missing persons flagged a report
that was just filed.

785
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,400
A possible victim?

786
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,700
The subject's car was found idling
at a stop sign,

787
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,800
and there was some
damage to the back end.

788
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Sounds like a bump and grab.

789
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,900
Did she fit his profile
career, age-wise?

790
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,300
Katrina townsley, 34.

791
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,500
She's a reporter
at the chronicle.

792
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,400
Chronicle?

793
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,800
What is it?

794
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,800
This letter--

795
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,200
did we have this?

796
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,300
No.

797
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,000
I've never seen this before.

798
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,000
Why would he send
agent morris a letter?

799
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,500
She's his final chapter.

800
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,700
Kat.

801
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,600
Shh. Shh.

802
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,000
they able to track her car?

803
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,600
No. She doesn't have
a nav system,

804
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,500
but her cell's got gps.

805
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,400
Is the signal moving?

806
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,100
Stationary. Reid
and rossi are en route.

807
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,300
Hey, girl. How you doing
with that e-mail we sent you?

808
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,100
I've got the sender's ip address.

809
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,500
Goes to an internet cafe
just outside germantown.

810
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,900
Ok, good.
Send us the address.

811
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,900
I've just talked to reid.

812
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,300
They found jill's phone
on the ground near her car.

813
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,000
On the ground?

814
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,700
In a parking garage
north of center city.

815
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,000
Blood here.

816
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
A couple of drops.

817
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,200
Looks like she was dragged.

818
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,100
This shouldn't have happened.

819
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,100
Her guard was down.

820
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,900
He tricked her into thinking
she was meeting a friend.

821
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,700
I told her, slow down,

822
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,800
check your ego,

823
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,500
use your team.

824
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
David, there's no way
you could have known

825
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,700
that she was gonna
go off by herself.

826
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,600
I did know.

827
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,900
Sure as I know myself.

828
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,800
Kat: Aah!

829
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,900
No! [Sobbing]
You can go louder.

830
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,800
Don't, please!

831
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Aah! [Sobbing]

832
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,400
That computer was used
exactly 4 hours

833
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,300
and 12 minutes ago.

834
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,500
Now, I need you to try
to remember the man

835
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
that was sitting there.

836
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,100
I can't remember.

837
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,200
I mean, we get a lot
of people in here.

838
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,300
I understand.

839
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,300
He would have paid in cash.

840
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,300
White, 30s to 40s.

841
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,700
Solidly built,

842
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,700
physically imposing,

843
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,600
maybe blue collar.

844
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,000
There was this one guy.

845
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,000
Big, kind of blond hair...

846
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,700
maybe left in a white van.

847
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,600
Good. Thanks.

848
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,000
Are you ready?

849
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,800
Beg me not to.

850
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,600
You will.

851
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,500
All right, here's the garage

852
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,400
where jill was taken.

853
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,900
Presumably an area
the unsub's familiar with.

854
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,700
You're not gonna abduct
a federal agent outside

855
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,600
your comfort zone.

856
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,400
Right. This is where
we are right now,

857
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,100
and the third point
is the storage unit right here.

858
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,900
It's a 4-mile radius.

859
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,600
What do we have right
here in the center?

860
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,700
Garcia,

861
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,400
I need those pretty
little hands of yours, mama.

862
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,900
Listen up, I want you to
bring up the citywide list

863
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,300
we generated for the electricians,

864
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,400
power company employees,

865
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,300
and electrical engineers.

866
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,100
They number in the thousands.

867
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,900
Can you narrow this?

868
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,500
Reid just sent you 3 addresses.

869
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,800
Triangulate and cross
the names within that surface.

870
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,700
Dozens. I need more.

871
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,600
Is that garcia?

872
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,600
Yeah.Search dmv records.

873
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,400
The manager thought he saw him leave
in a white van.

874
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,000
Morgan:Did you get that?

875
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,400
Yahtzee.

876
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
I'm gonna take my time with you.

877
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,300
They're coming.

878
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,400
It's over.

879
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,400
No, it'll never be over.

880
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Not for us.

881
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,600
Fbi!

882
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,400
Freeze!I need a medic.

883
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,500
Get a medic!

884
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,800
[Crying] David.

885
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,000
It's ok.
It's gonna be all right.

886
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's ok.

887
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,900
It's ok. It's ok.

888
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,900
It's all right.
I'm sorry.

889
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,100
It's ok. Don't worry about it.

890
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,300
It's ok.I'm sorry.
You're gonna be alril ght.

891
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,400
It's ok.

892
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,500
It's ok, jill.

893
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,300
Jeremy andrus, 41.

894
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,100
Broken home, poverty,

895
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,300
trade school,

896
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,100
petty crime, lewd behavior--

897
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,700
the whole profile's here
in black and white.

898
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,100
That's a small consolation.

899
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,000
How many is he up to?

900
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,400
17.

901
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,900
They haven't even gotten through
the 2006 pile.

902
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,400
Has he told us
where to find the remains?

903
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,400
J.J.: No.

904
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,900
He doesn't speak.

905
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,200
He just points.

906
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,300
You're sure
you're not rushing?

907
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,000
I'm fine.

908
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,400
And you didn't
need to come here.

909
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,299
I just wanted to see
if you were ok.

910
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,800
In itself
a passive-aggressive means

911
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,300
of saying, "I told you so."

912
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,800
I don't need to tell you

913
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,100
that what you've
gone through,

914
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,100
what you've witnessed,

915
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
is a trauma.

916
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,300
You're right. You don'T.

917
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,500
The fact that you didn't ask
about the condition

918
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,600
of the other victim--

919
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,900
implying that
I'm a victim when I'm not.

920
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,500
Leads me to believe

921
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,600
that you're already
in an early stage of denial.

922
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,700
I can handle it.

923
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,500
She didn't make it, jill.

924
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,300
Man: Agent morris.

925
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,500
There she is!

926
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,100
Agent morris!Agent morris,

927
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,000
what made you believe
there was a killer out there

928
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
when no one else did?

929
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,600
Man: How did his crimes
go unnoticed for so long?

930
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,400
Woman: Have you been approached
by any publishers?

931
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,500
Do you fear for your safety?

932
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,300
If I can just have
one question at at time.

933
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,600
I promise I will
get to all of you.

934
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,400
Have you been approached
by any publishers?

935
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,100
No.

936
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,000
Man: Can you tell us,agent morris,

937
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,100
did you fear for your safety?

938
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,300
Absolutely.

939
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,500
What was it liked to come face
to face with a serial killer?

940
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,600
Is there a book deal in your future?

941
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,700
What were your injuries?

942
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,200
I hear there were multiple abductions.

943
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,100
Multiple abductions.
Serial killer.

944
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,800
Do you have any
further information?

945
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,600
Do you have an agent yet?

946
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,700
Are you still working
on the case?

947
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,700
Working on the case?

948
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,800
Jill: No. At this point,

949
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,600
the case is closed.

950
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,300
Rossi: "For we pay a price
for everything we get

951
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,500
or take in this world,

952
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,300
"and although ambitions
are well worth having,

953
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,500
they are not to be cheaply won."

954
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,900
Lucy maud montgomery.
