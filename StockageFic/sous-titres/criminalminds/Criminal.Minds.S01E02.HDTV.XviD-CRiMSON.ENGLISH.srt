1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:02,597
Previously on Criminal Minds...

2
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:04,598
Anyone recognize these faces?

3
00:00:04,597 --> 00:00:06,574
Victims of the footpath killer.

4
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,331
That's what Virginia
newspapers are calling him.

5
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:11,897
We refer to him as the
"unknown subject" or "unsub."

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,461
I told Virginia P.D.,
they're looking for a white

7
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:21,413
male in his 20's, who owns
an american-made truck,

8
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:23,407
works a menial job.

9
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:26,485
I told 'em when you find him,

10
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:30,124
don't be surprised to hear him
speak with a severe stutter.

11
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:35,085
Have a n-i-- n-nice day.

12
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,616
The gun.

13
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:11,817
Ta-- take out the gun.

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,713
- Th-- throw it.
- Any particular direction?

15
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:37,104
Who-- who are y--

16
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:40,305
who are you?

17
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,167
Who are you?!

18
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:46,761
FBI.

19
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:53,642
T-- t-- t--

20
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:58,343
take out your w--
your w-- wallet.

21
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:19,044
Wh-- what--
what do you kn--

22
00:02:20,745 --> 00:02:22,345
what do you know?

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,249
About you?

24
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,250
Or about the people
who you've murdered?

25
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:32,228
I know a lot about you.

26
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:36,252
I know how you do it.

27
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:38,643
I know you can't stop.

28
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,826
And I know something that no
one's ever been able to tell you.

29
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:50,803
I know why you stutter.

30
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:57,824
Weren't you a little bit
worried he might just shoot you?

31
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:00,243
I was a lot worried.

32
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:02,530
But how did you find him?

33
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,870
I was just stopping for gas.

34
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,524
I walked into that store,
and I saw pieces of a profile

35
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:09,854
that I'd given to Virginia
P.D. almost a year ago.

36
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:13,511
Truck in disrepair, a disheveled
young man, severe stutter.

37
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:17,751
James Reese once said, "there are
certain clues at a crime scene which,

38
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:19,266
by their very nature, do not lend themselves

39
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,146
to being collected or examined.

40
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:27,730
How does one collect
love, rage, hatred, fear?"

41
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,891
These are things that
we're trained to look for.

42
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:34,387
So anyone else would have
just seen a guy who stutters,

43
00:03:34,387 --> 00:03:37,195
but you saw the footpath killer.

44
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:42,528
Right. But sometimes these guys
are still found by just dumb luck.

45
00:03:43,428 --> 00:03:45,928
Berkowitz was caught
because of a parking ticket.

46
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:49,264
Except the cop who caught him wasn't
staring down a shotgun like you were.

47
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:53,736
This is true. This is
also a good time to stop.

48
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:56,354
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

49
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:11,379
Okay, I'm curious. Why'd he stutter?

50
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,486
You're on your way to
becoming part of the behavior

51
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:17,046
analysis team now, Elle. You tell me.

52
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,703
Check. Checkmate 3 moves.

53
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:30,341
What...

54
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:32,783
you know you'll beat him
when you start learning.

55
00:04:32,783 --> 00:04:36,108
- Learning what?
- To think outside the box.

56
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,499
- Question for you.
- Shoot.

57
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:45,164
The footpath killer, why did he stutter?

58
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:47,732
Come on, Elle, we've all
asked him, and he won't say.

59
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:49,247
He wants us to figure it out.

60
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,832
Okay. I'm up for a challenge.

61
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:54,578
Good, because these go to you.

62
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:57,018
Special agent Jennifer
Jareau, JJ if you like.

63
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:58,492
- Elle.
- Greenway--

64
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:01,564
highest number of solved cases
in Seattle 3 years running,

65
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:03,302
specialty in sex offender cases.

66
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:04,649
Not bad.

67
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,018
Well, I'm the unit liaison.

68
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:08,509
My specialty is untangling
bureaucratic knots.

69
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,892
You'll probably be talking to
me a lot. My door's always open,

70
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:13,295
mostly because I'm never in my office,

71
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:15,862
so just call me on my cell,
okay? We'll talk.

72
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:18,234
Did you watch it?

73
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,756
Yeah. Think everybody should see it.

74
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:22,436
BAU team, can you meet me in
the conference room, please?

75
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:23,468
I need to show you something.

76
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:29,446
This is from the Phoenix office, Bradshaw
College in Tempe, 6 fires in 7 months.

77
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:30,546
Who recorded it?

78
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,482
A student with a digital camcorder.

79
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:35,378
He was watching a fire in the
building across from their dorm.

80
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:38,674
The other person you'll see is his
roommate, 20-year-old Matthew Rowland.

81
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,801
This is crazy. Hey, Mac, get
over here. You gotta see this.

82
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,617
The building's on fire.
Bro, you getting this?

83
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:47,601
Is that the kid?

84
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:48,740
Yeah, that's him.

85
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,535
Relax,  man. There's always
fires during rush week.

86
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:52,750
Yeah, but that's pretty
big. What building is that?

87
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,175
Dude, over here. Check this out. What is it?

88
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:58,311
I don't know, but it's
coming underneath the door.

89
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:01,553
Is someone in the hallway?
Hey, someone's trying to get in.

90
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:02,953
Hey, man, you should
get away from there.

91
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:05,928
Oh, my god! It smells like gas.

92
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:11,429
Oh, god! God! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

93
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:16,993
Put me out! Oh, my god! Oh, god! Help!

94
00:06:54,925 --> 00:07:00,271
Einstein once said: "Imagination
is more important than knowledge.

95
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:06,039
Knowledge is limited.
Imagination encircles the world."

96
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:08,687
There are 2 common stressors
for a serial arsonist.

97
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,952
Loss of job, loss of love.

98
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,191
When was the first fire set?

99
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:15,538
March. Uh, the next one was in
may, and the third one wasn't

100
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:18,066
till september, then 2 weeks
later there were 3 in one night.

101
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:20,514
He's speeding up.
Fire's are closer together.

102
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:22,290
Hey, Reid, you got a statistic on arsonists?

103
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,970
82% are white males between 17 and 27.

104
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,857
Female arsonists are far less likely,
their motive typically being revenge.

105
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:32,459
Sounds like our boy's a student.

106
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,171
Don't be so sure.

107
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,883
You rely too much on precedent,
you never allow for the unexpected.

108
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:42,154
If he went from setting one
fire to 3 in 2 weeks' time...

109
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:43,442
rapid escalation.

110
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:46,953
He's gone from the power to damage a
building to something far more satisfying.

111
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:51,042
The power over life and death.

112
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,013
Who we talking to first?

113
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:54,934
Dean of students, Ellen Turner.

114
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,514
No badges. I don't want to satisfy
the unsub's need for attention

115
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:14,619
by letting him know he got the
FBI here. Try not to look official.

116
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:17,557
Try to look less official.

117
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,842
Obviously, I'd rather be meeting
you under different circumstances.

118
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:23,698
This is fire inspector Zhang.

119
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:26,266
This morning the chemistry
department reported several

120
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:29,394
bottles of highly
flammable chemicals missing.

121
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:31,458
I'm prepared to evacuate
this campus. Thank you.

122
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,133
That brings with it its own problems.

123
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,076
You might evacuate the arsonist as well.

124
00:08:35,076 --> 00:08:37,637
Then the case goes unsolved,
the campus is reopened,

125
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:39,021
but  the fires start up again.

126
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:40,517
Hotch, Gideon, hold on a second.

127
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,540
You said the chemicals were missing today.

128
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:45,436
It says here that one of the
previous fires was set with diesel

129
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:47,444
fuel that disappeared from
the grounds keeping facility.

130
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,445
How long after it
disappeared was the fire set?

131
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,351
One day.

132
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,107
If he's holding to a pattern...

133
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:57,908
Who's to say the next
fire won't be today?

134
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:07,854
Door was locked.

135
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,754
Matthew Rowland and his roommate watched

136
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:11,490
as the doorknob turned against the lock.

137
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,867
But the unsub couldn't get in.

138
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,978
So he pours the accelerant
into the room from the hallway.

139
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:18,715
Which means he couldn't see the fire.

140
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:20,963
But he could hear Matthew Rowland screaming.

141
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:22,795
Yeah, but not for long.
He would have left quickly.

142
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,974
- Yeah, to avoid being spotted.
- It doesn't make sense.

143
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:28,296
Pyromania as a mental disorder
may just be a simple myth,

144
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:31,085
but we do know from precedent
that serial arsonists derive

145
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:33,526
pleasure from pathological fire-setting.

146
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:34,967
Sex and power.

147
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:37,820
But a serial arsonist wouldn't
just set a fire and walk away.

148
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,460
He needs to experience it.

149
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:43,108
So why would he set
a fire he couldn't watch?

150
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:46,472
He turned the water
off just before the fire.

151
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:51,152
The last 3 were set with these.
2 devices, simultaneous ignition.

152
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:53,583
There was no device used on Matthew Rowland.

153
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,888
Unsub set that one manually?

154
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:59,713
He wanted to be there
to enjoy the kid's death.

155
00:09:59,713 --> 00:10:00,578
Not necessarily.

156
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:02,850
Well, if the target was Matthew Rowland,

157
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,293
then why set the other 2 fires?

158
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:06,277
The motives for arson are relatively simple.

159
00:10:06,277 --> 00:10:09,276
There's vandalism, crime
concealment, political statement...

160
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,158
profit and revenge.

161
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,697
We interviewed Matthew Rowland's roommate.

162
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,730
He said Matthew was very well-liked.

163
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,933
No reason for revenge. What about vandalism?

164
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,876
No. The fires are too sophisticated,

165
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:20,847
and if he's trying to
make a political statement,

166
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:22,074
he's not being too clear about it.

167
00:10:22,074 --> 00:10:24,386
There's an underlying strategy in this case.

168
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:27,226
Matthew, firefighters, injured victims.

169
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,801
To the unsub, they're
not people. They're...

170
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:29,802
they're objects.

171
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:32,040
- More like,
- Uh... chess pieces.

172
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:34,741
Exactly.

173
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:44,630
All right... I want to set a dormitory fire.

174
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,081
Where  would I start?

175
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:58,682
In the basement. The
upper levels would be fuel.

176
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,243
Then why did I start on the third floor?

177
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:06,606
Oh, god!

178
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:14,303
Because it wasn't the building
I wanted to set on fire.

179
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,919
The timer sets the road flare,

180
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,193
which then lights the chemical
mixture inside the canister. Simple.

181
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:25,218
Yet sophisticated in its simplicity.

182
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,026
I mean, there's a meticulous
construction to it.

183
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:29,882
Chemical accelerant could
mean chemistry student.

184
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:32,354
Could also mean chemistry professor.

185
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:37,025
Mmm, I say student. You
need self-confidence to

186
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:40,554
lecture in front of a classroom
full of 30 college kids.

187
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:45,036
Arsonists are socially incompetent.
This guy doesn't go on dates.

188
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:47,941
He doesn't go to parties. He doesn't
feel comfortable in front of groups.

189
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,928
And, of course, he's a total psychopath.

190
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:55,320
Course.

191
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:58,571
- Think we'll get a lead from the hotline?
- No.

192
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:01,972
If you don't mind my asking, why
then did you set up the number?

193
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,918
Well, serial arsonists enjoy
manipulating authorities.

194
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,855
They like to communicate,
explain themselves.

195
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:09,271
I'm not waiting to hear
from a tipster or witness.

196
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,336
- You're waiting to hear from him.
- Yeah.

197
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,894
All right, office hours. I
have my own homework to do.

198
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:26,680
- Thank you, professor Wallace.
- No problem.

199
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:36,973
We don't want a stampede on our hands

200
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,429
because the exits out of
the campus block so quickly.

201
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:44,644
Now, we have staging areas, and we must
utilize every possible... agent Gideon?

202
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:06,579
Agent Gideon. Agent Gideon?

203
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:13,957
Everybody out of the building! Go!

204
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:15,651
What is it?

205
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:19,686
Look out! Clear the whole
building! Clear it! Now!

206
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,871
Come on! Help me! Help me!

207
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:19,993
Get off of me! There was a teacher!

208
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:23,849
Let it go! He's already dead. Let it go.

209
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,091
He might be here watching.

210
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,284
Yeah. Take pictures--
as many as you can.

211
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:40,459
You got it.

212
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:13,570
The professor's name was Wallace?

213
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,449
It's a terrible loss. He
was one of those teachers...

214
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,031
Um... he knew how to make a difference.

215
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,652
Gideon, we've got police and security
interviewing everyone in that building.

216
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:28,199
How long will it take to
finish evacuating the campus?

217
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,671
This is a college of
10,000 students and faculty.

218
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,434
Well, there's another
problem with evacuating.

219
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:34,810
You mean, we might accelerate
the unsub's timeline.

220
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:39,653
Let's round everybody up.

221
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,399
Dean Turner? Hi, I'm Jeremy.

222
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,553
I'm one of the research assistants
at the science department.

223
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:54,370
We were talking, and, uh, we'd like to help.

224
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,372
The best thing you can do
right now is just stay--

225
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,391
we know how he did it.

226
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:05,879
We've  been at this all
night, and we've got nothin'.

227
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:09,347
Look at these expressions.

228
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:13,748
We got fear, a touch of horror,

229
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,936
even a little bit of panic.
Where's the guy gettin' off?

230
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,167
When asked about his
motives, Peter Dinsdale said,

231
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:23,439
"I am devoted to fire. Fire is my master."

232
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,761
Okay, so who was our boy's master?

233
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:30,210
10,000 plus students...

234
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:40,658
and one has a serious fascination with fire.

235
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:45,463
Fire starting is one third
of the homicidal triad...

236
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:49,983
an early predictor of adult
disassociative criminal behavior.

237
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:53,351
If we looked in his childhood,
we'd probably find all three.

238
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:57,167
Bedwetting... and cruelty to animals.

239
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:00,727
Absent or abusive father,
trouble with the opposite sex,

240
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,785
chronic low self-esteem--
M.O. would be dynamic.

241
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:07,766
Evolvings, fire setting escalates,
they thrive on panic, fear.

242
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:10,278
It's just the standard
profile of a serial arsonist.

243
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:12,129
Based on hundreds of interviews.

244
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:13,329
Based on precedent.

245
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,364
Everything the unsub should
be, according to research.

246
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:18,553
We're off the mark.

247
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:20,122
Because of the 2 missing elements.

248
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,106
Sex and power-- the 2 motives
that drive a serial arsonist.

249
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:25,194
And without 'em, we do not have a profile.

250
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:41,612
Whoa! Hey! Uh, sorry. I
didn't mean to scare you.

251
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:43,364
I'm just, um, I'm campus patrol.

252
00:17:43,364 --> 00:17:44,327
I'm supposed to ask for your I.D.

253
00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:47,343
Sure, sure.

254
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,417
You're one of those FBI guys.

255
00:17:57,318 --> 00:17:59,318
Um, like a profiler, right?

256
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,774
Like, one look at a
crime scene, you can tell

257
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,475
what kind of shampoo a killer uses?

258
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,123
You sound skeptical.

259
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:08,970
Uh, maybe a little.

260
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,835
Your girlfriend thinks you're
gonna break up with her.

261
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:15,176
You're kidding, right?

262
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,552
Well, you keep adjusting your necklace.

263
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:20,380
That tells me you're not used
to wearing one or somebody else

264
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,684
probably bought it for
you, bought it recently,

265
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,701
and the chinese symbol on
it means "forever yours."

266
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:31,052
Take care of yourself, all right?

267
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:42,062
Reid. Since you're more their age,

268
00:18:42,062 --> 00:18:47,173
why don't you do the talking?

269
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:49,737
Ahem. Hi-- hi,
guys. Uh, my name's,

270
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:55,345
uh, Dr. Spencer Reid. I'm a,
uh, agent with the-- the BAU,

271
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:57,729
the Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI,

272
00:18:57,729 --> 00:19:03,057
which, um, it used to be called the
BSU, the Behavioral Science Unit,

273
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:05,169
but not anymore. They changed it to the BAU.

274
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,617
Um, it's part of the NCAVC, the National
Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime

275
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:12,836
which is also part of this
thing called the CIRG, the

276
00:19:12,837 --> 00:19:14,637
Critical Incident
Response Group, and--

277
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:18,119
what he's trying to say is we'd
love to know how you can help us.

278
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:25,218
May I, please? Thank you.

279
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:27,893
See this? Drill a hole in the side,

280
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:30,477
fill it with gasoline or
whatever's good and flammable.

281
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:33,108
Turn the light on. Boom.

282
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:36,360
That is what went down, didn't it?

283
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,904
The  stuff's all over the net.

284
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:42,763
Wanna know how to make a molotov
cocktail that sets itself on fire?

285
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:48,548
Potassium, sulfur... and normal sugar.

286
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:51,223
Sugar-- sugar,
which is--

287
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,820
not exactly plutonium.

288
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,879
You could get this stuff anywhere.

289
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:55,727
Sugar from the supermarket.

290
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:59,375
But you don't need to be
a chem major to know that.

291
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:01,032
Do you think it's a chem student?

292
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:03,000
You wanna know what I think?

293
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:09,394
I think... it would be a good
time to take the semester off.

294
00:20:18,178 --> 00:20:19,406
Hold on.

295
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:21,400
You need a key to get it
movin' after 10:00 P.M.

296
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,385
So what are you still doin' here?

297
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:25,586
I can't leave. We got projects.

298
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:28,291
You know hot to solve the 3 body problem?

299
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:32,158
Computing the mutual gravitational
interaction between the earth, sun and moon?

300
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:35,630
Do you have any idea
how many people called me

301
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,334
today with absolute certainty
that our arsonist is a firefighter?

302
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:43,399
Like, yeah, I saw Backdraft.
Uh, let me call you right back.

303
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,706
This came into the hotline
about 5 minutes ago.

304
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:52,810
You've reached the FBI tip hotline
for the Bradshaw College fires.

305
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:58,364
"Karen. I do this for Karen."

306
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,803
"Karen. I do this for Karen."
Play it again.

307
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:08,743
The call came from the
office right next to Wallace's

308
00:21:08,743 --> 00:21:10,734
5 minutes before the fire was started.

309
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:12,616
Play it again.

310
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:18,228
"Karen. I do this for Karen."
Again, louder.

311
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:26,260
"Karen. I do this for Karen."

312
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:27,743
What is it?

313
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:30,367
I'm not sure. Somethin' about it.

314
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:31,520
Is this tape clean?

315
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:34,170
I can put it through some audio filters.

316
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,077
Look, we need as close to
the real voice as you can get,

317
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:38,737
and  anything that might be in
the background. Can you do it?

318
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:40,858
Ok, you know how on Star
Trek when Captain Kirk

319
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:42,963
asks McCoy to do something
totally impossible,

320
00:21:42,963 --> 00:21:45,146
and McCoy says, "damn it, Jim, I'm
a doctor, not a miracle worker?"

321
00:21:45,146 --> 00:21:47,155
Hey, what are you tellin'
me, not to expect a miracle?

322
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:49,063
No, I'm saying I'm not a doctor.

323
00:21:50,982 --> 00:21:52,750
That's my girl.

324
00:21:56,378 --> 00:22:00,874
These are all the women on
campus with the first name Karen.

325
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,706
A lot of Karens. Hmm.

326
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,962
What if the unsub is one
of the students leaving?

327
00:22:14,962 --> 00:22:16,165
No, he's not done yet.

328
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:18,569
He's not goin' anywhere.

329
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,770
Keep thinkin'.

330
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:23,949
You mean, out--
outside the box?

331
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:25,544
That's what Morgan's
always telling me.

332
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,408
He says that's why I can
never beat you at chess.

333
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:28,946
Well, he's probably right.

334
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:33,217
But, I mean, in this situation,
what exactly is the box?

335
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:35,419
The standard profile of a serial arsonist.

336
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,234
If everything you know goes
in the box, what's left?

337
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:40,684
What you don't know. The unknown.

338
00:22:40,937 --> 00:22:42,331
Sometimes you have to get creative.

339
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:43,788
Even if you think it's utterly unlikely,

340
00:22:43,788 --> 00:22:45,959
you have to think of things
nobody else thought of.

341
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:49,234
- Like a stutter.
- Yeah, exactly.

342
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:53,673
Thank you, Karen.

343
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,527
Karen number 7.

344
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,512
You know, there's gotta
be a faster way to do this.

345
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:02,076
How 'bout we just change
the first question to

346
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:04,236
"have you recently dated
a homicidal pyromaniac?"

347
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:09,364
Speaking of questions, you figured out
yet why the footpath killer stuttered?

348
00:23:09,364 --> 00:23:11,422
Nope. You?

349
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,983
I know that embarrassment
makes a stutter worse,

350
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:17,159
and that when you're
flustered, it's more difficult

351
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,678
to control the articulatory
musculature of the face.

352
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:21,983
You sound like Reid.

353
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,199
You did not just say that.

354
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:26,565
Obviously, somebody's
been doin' their homework.

355
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:29,446
I still have no idea what causes a stutter.

356
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,865
Karen. Number 8.

357
00:24:03,228 --> 00:24:06,206
Hey. I didn't scare you again, did I?

358
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:08,925
Um, sorry. This is one of
the buildings on my patrol.

359
00:24:10,003 --> 00:24:11,461
Just lookin' at the board.

360
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:13,501
The 3 body problem.

361
00:24:15,602 --> 00:24:16,902
You know what it means?

362
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:18,464
Uh, no. No idea.

363
00:24:18,464 --> 00:24:21,642
It's physics. It's one of the
great mathematical mysteries.

364
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:26,963
You broke up with her. No more necklace.

365
00:24:27,454 --> 00:24:30,134
Yeah, I kinda wanna date someone else.

366
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:33,430
- What's her name?
- Brian.

367
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:38,393
Oh. Well, that's, uh...

368
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:40,494
that's a pretty good reason.

369
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:42,927
Did she take it all right?

370
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:43,669
Yeah.

371
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,270
Yeah, other than telling me
that homosexuality's a sin,

372
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:50,092
and that I'm going to
incur the wrath of God.

373
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,500
The wrath of god.

374
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,346
Okay, gorgeous, I've put
this thing through every audio

375
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:07,402
filter I've got.There's only one
thing I can tell you for sure.

376
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:10,482
This guy isn't saying "Karen."
It's more like "Ka-rown."

377
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:11,955
Garcia, what the hell is Ka-rown?

378
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:15,019
If I figure it out, does it earn
me a night of passionate lovemaking?

379
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:17,665
Most definitely, sweetness... with Reid.

380
00:25:18,665 --> 00:25:20,484
Bye. Hey, Reid.

381
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,185
Garcia says it's not "Karen."

382
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:23,892
- It's actually somethin' more like--
- Charown.

383
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:25,271
- Charown?
- Charown.

384
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:26,672
- "I do it because of Charown."
- That's hebrew.

385
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:27,942
- It's god's word in anger.
- Yeah.

386
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,818
The motive is now religious?

387
00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:33,754
Well, you know, in a lot of
religions, god is related to fire.

388
00:25:33,754 --> 00:25:37,973
Well, brahman is fire in hinduism, and
the jews see God as a pillar of fire,

389
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:40,084
and christians worship
god as a consuming fire.

390
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:41,683
Okay, so we're lookin' for a theology major.

391
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:43,637
Maybe he's punishing the
other students for their sins.

392
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:44,487
I don't want this.

393
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:46,727
What-- what's the most
sinful place on campus?

394
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:48,640
Come on, Elle. When I was in
college, that was everywhere.

395
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,803
A fraternity?

396
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:50,971
A campus bar?

397
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:53,540
No, 'cause that's not consistent
with the previous targets.

398
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,597
What about the idea of baptism by fire?

399
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,851
Aren't we all supposed to be
tested through fire in revelations?

400
00:25:57,851 --> 00:26:01,038
Look, it's good, it's good, but let's
please do not jump to conclusions.

401
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:03,910
Religion might be a part of it, but it's
not necessarily the prime compulsion.

402
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,882
Gideon, rush to conclusions,
jump to conclusions.

403
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:07,498
Who cares? We are running out of time.

404
00:26:08,117 --> 00:26:09,684
Compulsion.

405
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:14,114
This is crazy. Hey, Mac, get
over here. You gotta see this.

406
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,787
The building's on fire.
Bro, you getting this?

407
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,781
Get out of the way! We
should call campus security

408
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:21,543
Relax, man. There's always
fires during rush week.

409
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:23,499
Yeah, but that's pretty
big. What building is that?

410
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:26,223
Dude, over here. Check this out. What is it?

411
00:26:26,223 --> 00:26:28,383
I don't know, but it's
coming underneath the door.

412
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:31,541
Is someone in the hallway?
Hey, someone's trying to get in.

413
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,302
Hey, man, you should get away from there.

414
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:35,003
Oh, my god.
It smells like gas.

415
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:40,011
Help! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

416
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:43,912
Hold on, man!

417
00:27:03,212 --> 00:27:04,912
Outside the box.

418
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:18,280
Keep thinkin'. It's like chess.

419
00:27:18,315 --> 00:27:21,271
Don't look at just the next
move. Try to look 3 moves ahead.

420
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:31,154
This is crazy. Hey, Mac, get over here.

421
00:27:31,154 --> 00:27:32,739
You gotta see this the building's on fire.

422
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:35,877
Bro, you getting this? Get out of the way!

423
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:37,924
- Should call campus security.
- Relax, man.

424
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:39,125
There's always fires during rush week.

425
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,275
Yeah, but that's pretty
big. What building is that?

426
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:44,645
Dude, over here. Check this out. What is it?

427
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,818
Dude, over here. Check this out. What is it?

428
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:51,249
There's always fires during rush week.

429
00:27:53,776 --> 00:27:57,584
Yeah, but that's pretty big.
Dude, over here. Check this out.

430
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:16,297
3 times.

431
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:53,553
"Professor Wallace. Tuesday, 3:00."

432
00:28:55,085 --> 00:28:56,512
I know why the profiles never fit.

433
00:28:56,512 --> 00:28:59,337
You were right to tell Morgan
not to rely on precedent.

434
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,927
The fires thus far have been
completely task oriented.

435
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:04,407
So once they're set, the unsub is done?

436
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:07,479
Exactly. The unsub is not
a classical serial arsonist.

437
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,423
He's someone who uses fire because
of a completely different disorder.

438
00:29:10,423 --> 00:29:13,688
- Which is?
- An extreme manifestation of OCD,

439
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:15,480
obsessive compulsive disorder.

440
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:17,381
He does everything in 3's,

441
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,822
and if I'm right, he'll have to kill again.

442
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,672
There's a form of OCD called scrupulosity.

443
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:29,357
Religious obsession and compulsion.

444
00:29:29,357 --> 00:29:31,653
An obsessive fear of committing sin,

445
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:34,149
which creates so much
anxiety that he's compelled

446
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,527
to do something to ease that anxiety.

447
00:29:35,527 --> 00:29:36,800
Like setting fires.

448
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:39,298
Where's the behavioral evidence?

449
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:40,601
Right here.

450
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:42,802
All right. Remember the night of the 3 fires?

451
00:29:42,901 --> 00:29:46,372
We saw the doorknob
turning against the lock.

452
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:52,537
But he's not trying to get in. He's
compelled to turn the doorknob 3 times.

453
00:29:52,537 --> 00:29:54,353
Well, what about the fires?

454
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:56,754
The first ones were single fires.

455
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,661
If the unsub was OCD, shouldn't
they have all been in 3's?

456
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:03,373
They were in 3's. A trinity of 3's.

457
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:06,120
The first fire occurred on march third.

458
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,770
3:00 P.M., third day, third month.

459
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,794
It's that convergence of 3's that
causes the overwhelming anxiety.

460
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:16,066
Obsessive compulsives ease the
anxiety by performing the compulsion.

461
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:19,017
What about the other
fires? Professor Wallace?

462
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,418
Office number 3.

463
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:24,789
I checked for more patterns of
3's. His class was on tuesdays.

464
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:25,968
Third day of the week.

465
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:28,120
Matthew Rowland was in that class.

466
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,671
It was his third class of the day.

467
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:32,465
If we looked into each of the
fires we'd find a lot of patterns

468
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:34,496
having to do with 3's because
our minds are incredibly adept at

469
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:38,617
seeking out patterns. But to the
unsub, once that pattern hits,

470
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:40,266
bam-- he
sets a fire.

471
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:41,885
But if the target was always people,

472
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:44,086
why did no one die
in the first few fires?

473
00:30:44,185 --> 00:30:45,685
They were failures.

474
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:47,986
Up until Matthew Rowland.

475
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,234
What is it?

476
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:55,842
I think I know who it might be.

477
00:30:55,943 --> 00:30:58,043
And it's not a he. It's a she.

478
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:02,158
Clara Hayes.

479
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,459
A chemistry student.

480
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,012
I'll get you her records now.

481
00:31:06,076 --> 00:31:08,164
First get campus security out and find her.

482
00:31:08,164 --> 00:31:10,214
She could set her next fire within hours.

483
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:13,233
Okay, got it. Her apartment's off campus.

484
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:15,306
But how is he sure it's this girl?

485
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:17,753
When I was talking to
her and her classmates,

486
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,251
I noticed something-- a ring on
her finger. And she kept turning it.

487
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:21,081
At intervals?

488
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:21,915
Of 3.

489
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,716
And she counted off the
ingredients of a light bulb bomb.

490
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,035
Potassium, sulfur,

491
00:31:29,736 --> 00:31:31,536
and normal sugar.

492
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:34,937
Sugar.

493
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:36,294
And the word "sugar."

494
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,361
Yeah. And she kept repeating it.
Once she started, she couldn't stop.

495
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:42,145
Yeah, it's palilalia. It's the
involuntary repetition of words.

496
00:31:42,145 --> 00:31:44,366
Howard Hughes had it
when his OCD worsened.

497
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:47,174
Clara and her classmates were working
on a project about gravitational pull.

498
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:48,737
The 3 body problem.

499
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:01,951
No one in here.

500
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:10,775
Oh, you gotta be kidding me. OCD?

501
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:11,922
I'm thinking more like OMG.

502
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:14,250
- OMG?
- Oh, my god.

503
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:18,725
"A fire is kindled in my anger, and
shall burn into the lowest hell."

504
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:20,126
Deuteronomy.

505
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:23,137
"And again the fire of heaven
came down and killed them all."

506
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:26,394
"I do this for Charon."
That's Charon.

507
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:30,089
That's the greek mythological
ferryman of the dead.

508
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:31,649
It's also the name of Pluto's only moon.

509
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,874
Paradise lost.

510
00:32:34,175 --> 00:32:36,075
"Moloch, horrid king,

511
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:39,534
besmeared with blood of human
sacrifice and parents' tears."

512
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:43,678
Moloch was the demon sun
God of the Canaanites.

513
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:45,406
In order to keep from incurring his wrath,

514
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:49,010
the people would sacrifice their
children to him by burning them alive.

515
00:32:50,027 --> 00:32:55,434
16-year-old survives inferno. The
mother Ellen Hayes called it a miracle.

516
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:57,844
"My daughter was tested
by God. He tested my child

517
00:32:57,844 --> 00:33:00,917
and she came through blessed."
Look at the house number.

518
00:33:02,277 --> 00:33:04,007
333.

519
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:05,853
Hey, Morgan,

520
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:08,254
you know what magical thinking is?

521
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,757
Obsessive thoughts.

522
00:33:10,758 --> 00:33:12,358
It's like a superstition.
It controls them.

523
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:16,338
Kinda like step on a crack,
break your mother's back.

524
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:18,874
Except she actually believes it.

525
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:22,129
God tested her with fire,

526
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,130
and now when three 3's--

527
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:29,181
three 3's show up around another person...

528
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,576
God tells her to test them.

529
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:38,279
Security's checking the science building.

530
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,698
Well, where else would she be?

531
00:33:39,698 --> 00:33:41,451
We need to find the next pattern of 3's.

532
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,696
Hey, Hotch... we're lookin', man.

533
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:46,629
I don't think she would have
left behind a day planner

534
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:48,629
that says "set next
fire here" written in it.

535
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:54,445
I under-- wait till
you see this place.

536
00:33:54,745 --> 00:33:56,153
Uh, Morgan?

537
00:33:56,854 --> 00:33:57,854
I'll call you back.

538
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,370
There must be 30 homemade bombs in here.

539
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,274
Morgan, seal the building get
everybody out of there and walk away.

540
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:12,106
We need to send our people
into every building and have

541
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:13,470
them start pulling fire alarms. Please, go.

542
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,258
Mead, a map of the campus. We need
to find anything and everything

543
00:34:16,258 --> 00:34:18,210
having to do with the number
3. Where's the blueprint?

544
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,370
Hell no, I'm not leaving.

545
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,767
I have too much to do. All right.

546
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:25,488
I bought one of those mini
halon fire extinguishers.

547
00:34:25,488 --> 00:34:28,794
They started selling them at the
bookstore. It's pretty morbid, right?

548
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:32,018
Hey, I'm about to get into an
elevator, so I'll probably lose you.

549
00:34:32,018 --> 00:34:33,499
All right, bye-bye.

550
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:11,611
You got the science building?

551
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:13,363
All the corridors and stairwells are clear.

552
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:16,982
The elevator closet's checked.
No elevators are in service.

553
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,948
It's not gonna start.

554
00:35:22,948 --> 00:35:25,109
Don't you have the key?

555
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:27,189
I put it back on the hook in the office.

556
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:29,636
Aren't you supposed to be able
to hear the emergency call button?

557
00:35:29,636 --> 00:35:31,208
Maybe it's broken.

558
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:36,251
Or turned off.

559
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:39,193
I say we pry open the doors.

560
00:35:39,193 --> 00:35:42,715
You can't pry 'em all the way
open. It's a safety precaution.

561
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:44,482
Maybe we can try yelling for help.

562
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:50,296
That's the fire alarm.

563
00:35:56,303 --> 00:35:58,066
Jason, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

564
00:35:58,066 --> 00:35:59,970
Clara Hayes is very likely a good person.

565
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,146
Someone who never wanted
to do anyone any harm,

566
00:36:02,146 --> 00:36:03,610
like any other rational person.

567
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,970
But there's nothing rational about
obsessive compulsive disorder.

568
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:09,059
Research suggests OCD involves
problems in communication between

569
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:11,338
the frontal of the brain
and the orbital cortex.

570
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,235
Plus deeper structures. The basal ganglia.

571
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:15,866
You can't reason with her because you
can't reason with a physiological problem.

572
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:18,794
She's not setting these fires because
she wants to, but because she has to.

573
00:36:18,794 --> 00:36:20,154
What are you trying to say?

574
00:36:20,154 --> 00:36:23,427
Don't try to convince her to
stop, because you won't be able to.

575
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:32,087
That's it? It won't go any further?

576
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,390
I told you, it's a
built-in safety precaution.

577
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,574
Help! Somebody help us!

578
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:43,870
Hello? Somebody help us!

579
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,814
Please, somebody, we're trapped
down here. Somebody help us!

580
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:54,216
- Clara!
- Clara, thank god.

581
00:36:54,724 --> 00:36:55,856
It's all right.

582
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:58,824
Clara, go back to the office
and get the elevator key.

583
00:36:58,824 --> 00:37:02,026
It's okay. I'm here to save you.

584
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,862
Go-- go get the key,
Clara. The elevator key.

585
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:07,745
- Clara! Clara, wait!
- Clara! Get the key!

586
00:37:07,745 --> 00:37:10,146
- Is this building on fire?
- Clara?

587
00:37:11,778 --> 00:37:12,994
Not yet.

588
00:37:19,434 --> 00:37:21,053
It's clear up here. Anything?

589
00:37:21,053 --> 00:37:21,830
Nothing.

590
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:25,134
No girl, no smoke, no fire.

591
00:37:25,649 --> 00:37:27,444
Where did she go?

592
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:28,572
Maybe she's getting the key.

593
00:37:29,524 --> 00:37:30,870
I don't know.

594
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:42,125
What is she doing? Someone coming to help?

595
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:46,143
I'm here to help. I'm here to save you.

596
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:53,144
God chose you. Chose you... chose you...

597
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:54,106
Clara?

598
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,007
Father, son...

599
00:37:57,906 --> 00:37:58,516
Oh, my god!

600
00:37:58,616 --> 00:38:00,634
- Holy ghost.
- Clara, listen!

601
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:03,754
It's gasoline!

602
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:09,443
Stop it, Clara! Listen!

603
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:15,082
Security's sure that they've
cleared the science building.

604
00:38:15,082 --> 00:38:16,868
The guards made sure all floors are empty

605
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:18,343
and no elevators are in service. Hold on.

606
00:38:19,085 --> 00:38:21,086
You need a key to get it
moving after 10:00 P.M.

607
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:23,035
Clara?

608
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:26,203
Put it down, Clara!

609
00:38:26,842 --> 00:38:29,357
- I'm still looking.
- Focus on the girl.

610
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:32,701
She's failing out. This was
gonna be her last semester.

611
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:34,605
That's the stressor. What else?

612
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,054
She was a researcher
in the science building.

613
00:38:37,054 --> 00:38:39,381
We know that. They've already
cleared the science building.

614
00:38:39,381 --> 00:38:42,165
The third floor of the science
building is under construction.

615
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:43,845
I'm on my way.

616
00:38:48,532 --> 00:38:49,927
Clara.

617
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:57,425
I have to do this.

618
00:38:57,425 --> 00:38:59,151
You know it's not rational, Clara.

619
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:00,336
You were trying to tell me.

620
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:02,825
God chose me to be tested,

621
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:05,540
and now he's chosen them.
If I don't do this,

622
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,379
something terrible will happen.

623
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:08,877
What's gonna happen, Clara?

624
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:10,902
A flood? An earthquake? You
know this isn't rational.

625
00:39:11,622 --> 00:39:13,239
I know. I know. I know.

626
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,255
Then resist.

627
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:16,407
I can't.

628
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:19,752
- Clara? Clara, listen to me.
- Clara, don't.

629
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:23,449
They must be tested. God's wrath...

630
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:25,513
Clara, you told me it
was a chemistry student.

631
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:27,226
You left the message about Charon.

632
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:29,358
You want to stop.

633
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:33,856
Father, son...

634
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:34,522
Clara...

635
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:36,988
- Holy ghost.
- Clara, stop!

636
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:38,589
God chose them.

637
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,995
I thought you said
not to reason with her.

638
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:51,586
Get us out of here.

639
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:59,522
You know, I figured it out. The stutter.

640
00:40:04,306 --> 00:40:06,068
You know why the footpath killer stuttered?

641
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:08,778
When you and Hotch were talking
earlier, that's when I got it.

642
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:11,538
He said he was just trying to stall Clara.

643
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:12,410
Right.

644
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:16,617
Well, that's it, isn't
it? The footpath killer.

645
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,673
You were just trying to stall him.

646
00:40:18,673 --> 00:40:21,769
You said, "I know why you stutter"
because you were buying time.

647
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:24,137
You were stalling.

648
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:27,838
But you don't really
know why he stuttered.

649
00:40:28,437 --> 00:40:29,440
I don't?

650
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,441
I looked it up. No one does.

651
00:40:36,996 --> 00:40:39,207
There are some theories
about a neurological basis.

652
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:41,809
But they're just theories.

653
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:47,734
What really happened in
the convenience store?

654
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,061
I'll tell you what I do
know about a stutter.

655
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:54,965
I know how to provoke one.

656
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:10,371
The key.

657
00:41:48,377 --> 00:41:49,395
13.

658
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:55,159
We only found 6.

659
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,246
Are you impressed?

660
00:41:58,246 --> 00:41:59,055
Yeah.

661
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:02,056
I didn't know you could count.

662
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:05,470
Our profile said you'd be too stupid.

663
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,703
We also said you'd
be a chronic bed-wetter.

664
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:19,607
You-- y-- yo-

665
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:21,308
What?

666
00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:24,434
Th-- th-- the cam--

667
00:42:24,434 --> 00:42:25,977
I don't know what you're trying to say.

668
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:29,873
You take the cam--

669
00:42:29,874 --> 00:42:33,574
the cam-- the c-- the cam--

670
00:42:34,373 --> 00:42:37,872
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're trying to say.

671
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:43,194
You take-- you take the
cam-- the cam-- the cam--

672
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:43,874
Say it.

673
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:45,498
- The ca--
- Say it.

674
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:47,398
The ca--

675
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,299
Just spit it out. Just...

676
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:50,680
The cam--

677
00:42:56,943 --> 00:42:58,033
Come on!

678
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:07,521
Faulkner once said, "don't
bother just to be better

679
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:09,962
than your contemporaries or predecessors.

680
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,073
Try to be better than yourself."

681
00:43:15,572 --> 00:43:18,320
Check in 3.

682
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,432
Not bad.

683
00:43:31,339 --> 00:43:32,280
Checkmate.

684
