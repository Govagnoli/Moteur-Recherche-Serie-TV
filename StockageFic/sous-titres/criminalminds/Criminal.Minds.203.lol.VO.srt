00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,910
jacksonville,florida

2
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,680
you want grapefruit or cranberry ?

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,740
Coffee. 

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,090
Cranberry it is. 

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,520
Take it easy on the butter. 

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,300
Is half a stick too much ?

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,040
Yeah,well,I'm just following doctor's orders. 

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,940
It...it would be nice if you did the same. 

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,440
Hey,look. 

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,960
Laura sent the pictures from her orlando trip. 

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,360
I wonder if there are any of that new 
guy that she's so crazy about. 

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,190
Oh,wait a minute. 

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,760
I thought she said...

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,960
I thought she said pictures,not a video. 

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,550
That's a dvd,mary. 

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,050
Technology isn't slowing down. 

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,340
It's actually passing you by. 

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,150
If you don't catch up soon,you'll be 
as pitiful as your mother. 

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,470
Well,that's motivation. 

20
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,300
Come on,mary. I could show you a few things. 

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,180
You afraid to be my student ?

22
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,610
"Hi,guys. 

23
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,280
Just wanted to let you know 
I'm having a great time. Miss you both. 

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,940
" Sweet. 

25
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,050
Aw,but sooner or later...

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,500
wait a minute. This...

27
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,610
is that laura ?

28
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,620
The one it can't be. 

29
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,500
frank,what's happening ?

30
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,470
oh,my god. 

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,830
this was sent to the family ?

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,370
Father had a heart condition,died while watching it. 

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,490
so the music's not added like a regular soundtrack. 

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,960
It's in the background,so if you turn it down,
you also turn down the voices. 

35
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,840
Well,can't we get garcia 
to separate the audio tracks ?

36
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,630
She's working on it noW. 

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,990
Well,the sooner we hear how he talks to the victim,
the sooner we'll know what kind of man we're dealing with. 

38
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,310
Tell us about laura clemensen. 

39
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,060
20 years old. 

40
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,090
Sophomore at jacksonville university in florida. 

41
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,490
Assumed to be the fifth in a series of 
rapes and murders over the past 2 years. 

42
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,630
Some women were abducted in parking 
lots,others while they were running. 

43
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,660
And when was she reported missing ?

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,110
Technically she wasn'T. 

45
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,960
Roommate thought she was visiting family. 

46
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,320
Family thought she was at school. 

47
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,490
Close to her family ?

48
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,600
Very. She had dinner with them on sunday. 

49
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,540
That was 5 days ago,and nobody's 
seen her until now. 

50
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,340
She wasn't killed on the tape. 

51
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,310
And given forensics,other victims were tortured 
for weeks before they were killed,so

52
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,270
I think we should operate as if she's still alive. 

53
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,850
Not for long,if the bastard gets his way. 

54
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,030
Ok,I don't get it. 

55
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,780
This is the fifth abduction and now the second dvd. 

56
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,200
Why'd they wait to call this in ?

57
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,290
The last victim's family received this dvd 2 months ago. 

58
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,230
Jacksonville P. D. Thought maybe they'd get some 
more clues instead of just raise more questions. 

59
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,540
Can you turn that down,please ?

60
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,540
There seems to be a natural escalation to the murders. 

61
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,650
It began as brutal attacks against the victims,
and now it's psychological attacks to the families. 

62
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:01,140
So if the thrill of the kill isn't enough to satisfy his sadistic 
needs,he needs to spread panic,and he thrives on that. 

63
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,190
Sadistic killers are typically 
strangers to their victims. 

64
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,960
It's--it's easier for the offender to torture 
and kill someone that they don't know. 

65
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,050
Offenders. 

66
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,480
Man on the tape isn't doing this just for himself. 

67
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,560
He's playing to an audience,not her family. 

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,270
Someone watching...

69
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:35,090
who can appreciate what he's doing,
admire his sadistic skills. 

70
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,000
It is a characteristic of partners to record 
their crimes so they can relive the fantasy later. 

71
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,320
How can we be sure ?

72
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,180
Right there. The camera moves. 

73
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,560
one guy tortures while the other records it. 

74
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,750
Master and servant. 

75
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,860
Jacksonville P. D. 'S been looking 
for this killer for years. 

76
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,080
How long is it gonna take 'em to find a team ?

Mark twain once wrote,"of all the animals,
"man is the only one that is cruel. 

80
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,540
"He is the only one that inflicts 
pain for the pleasure of doing it. 

81
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,270
" Again. 

82
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,090
That's the third time he's 
looked back at the camera. 

83
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,230
He's looking back at his partner. 

84
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,820
Hotch: These two are clearly deranged and acting 
out their worst sadistic fantasies. 

85
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,080
Foile ?deux. 

86
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:17,110
Rare psychological phenomenon in which 2 or 
more people share the same psychotic delusion. 

87
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:23,800
In its literal translation,yes,but it often refers to the bond 
that exists between 2 people that bring out the worst in each other. 

88
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,890
Most killing teams have a dominant personality that instigates 
and plans and a submissive one who's the eager accomplice. 

89
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,210
So how do they decide who gets to kill ?

90
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,780
Well,the dominant one will usually insist on taking the life. 

91
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,290
So what's the psychology behind making these dvds ?

92
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,090
It's a shared souvenir,allows the dominant 
to keep the submissive one motivated,loyal,and aroused. 

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
It's also about control. 

94
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,270
Built-in insurance policy for blackmail,
just in case somebody gets cold feet. 

95
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,640
It makes you wonder what might have happened i
f these 2 people never had met. 

96
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,740
Chances are the women would still be alive. 

97
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,560
Jacksonville P. D. Just located laura clemensen's body. 

98
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,920
Some hikers found her under a bridge. 

99
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,280
They never hide them. They're always easy to find. 

100
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,850
Guys,laura clemensen wasn't 
missing for more than a week. 

101
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,170
The time spent torturing's getting shorter. 

102
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,350
Has her mother been notified ?

103
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,960
No. Not yet. 

104
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,350
We can cover more ground if we split up. 

105
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,770
Morgan and I'll meet local P. D. At the scene. 

106
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,030
I'll talk to laura clemensen's mother,
and since she just lost her husband...

107
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,030
I'll go with you. 

108
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,940
I'll start with the victimology,maybe find 
the reason why these women were targeted. 

109
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,080
Mary: After frank and i watched that video,I...I knew. 

110
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,410
At least she isn't suffering anymore. 

111
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,170
Is there anything that we can do for you ?

112
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,890
Um,F...

113
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,250
frank gave laura a...a pearl and 
diamond ring for graduation. 

114
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,820
Could I get it back ?

115
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,730
I will look into that right away. 

116
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,970
Thank you. 

117
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,460
As part of our investigation,we're trying 
to gain some insight into your daughter,

118
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,350
and,uh,I wondered whether she was...

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,540
shy and quiet,or was she more 
out going and made friends easily ?

120
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,610
I mean,is this really important ?

121
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,790
Yes,ma'am. I know that this is hard,but

122
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:19,280
the more similarities we can find between the victims,
the more it'll help us narrow down who's responsible. 

123
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,940
frank had a ball in her hand from the minute she could walk. 

124
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,560
She was confident. 

125
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,740
She knew everybody at school. 

126
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,910
She thought of our oldest,patrick,as her best friend. 

127
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,300
You know,she was like most girls her age. 

128
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,950
She wanted everybody to like her. 

129
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,810
Frank used to think that she was too much of a people pleaser,

130
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,870
but I think it shows a really good heart. 

131
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,850
I do,too. 

132
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:09,250
The police told us that they may have a...they may have 
a witness who saw laura giving someone directions. 

133
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,060
Does that sound like something she would have done ?

134
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,660
We--we raised our children to be...

135
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:22,400
helpful and--and kind,and...and that
 made laura an easy target for a killer ?

136
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,510
You have to know that you and frank did everything right. 

137
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:34,570
Frank was supposed to be at work yesterday,and if laura...if laura 
hadn't driven back to...to campus that night,I mean,

138
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,450
this...this wasn't supposed to happen. 

139
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,610
This wasn't s--

140
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,550
Special agents gideon and morgan. 

141
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,210
Detective robert portillo. 

142
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,380
This is the fifth girl on my watch in the past 
2 years,and we still don't have a viable suspect. 

143
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,000
We think you're looking for 2 men. 

144
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,420
Really ?Based upon what evidence ?

145
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:16,240
Well,given the level of sadistic torture 
and desire to document their crimes,

146
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,900
we're confident this was done by a killing team. 

147
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,070
She's got deep lacerations on her neck,chest,and thighs. 

148
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,730
From the color of the bruising,
torture went on for several days. 

149
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:35,380
Csi believes the cause of death was ligature 
strangulation,and it is consistent with the other victims. 

150
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,830
In the video,she's wearing a pearl ring on her left hand. 

151
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,610
No other evidence has turned up. 

152
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,440
They've combed the area,quarter-mile radius. 

153
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,630
Why would they need more trophies,gideon ?

154
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,480
Maybe passed it along as a gift. 

155
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,270
Like the green river killer ?

156
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,470
Yeah. 

157
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,850
He'd leave jewelry for his female coworkers 
and then become aroused when he saw them wear it. 

158
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,460
After everything they do to these girls,why 
do they leave 'em in these horrible positions ?

159
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,660
Haven't they suffered enough ?

160
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,470
Apparently not. 

161
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,170
This is the ultimate degradation 
to the victim and her family. 

162
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,960
Shock value for whoever finds them. 

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,990
And it sends a message to the police. 

164
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,010
What's that ?

165
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,960
"Look what we can do. 

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
You can't stop us. 

167
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,760
" Are there new victims ?

168
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,080
Garcia just sent a list over of all the unsolved 
rapes and murders in the past 3 years. 

169
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,700
There are 2 that are particularly interesting. 

170
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,830
They look the type. 

171
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,840
Anything else ?

172
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,370
Well,aside from sharing similar 
physical traits,they were also posed. 

173
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,490
The only difference is they were manually strangled,
which I think is why jacksonville P. D. Didn't find a connection. 

174
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,470
We find dna on the first 2 ?

175
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,140
That's the thing. 

176
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,550
It didn't match the recent kills,but check this out. 

177
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,880
What if the dominant one allowed the submissive one 
to rape the first 2 victims in order to sort of draw him in,

178
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,740
and then once he's hooked,he began 
keeping the prize all for himself ?

179
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,250
You tell morgan and gideon about this yet ?

180
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
They're still at the crime scene. 

181
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,930
We confirmed that laura clemensen had 
good relationships with her family and friends. 

182
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,840
She got good grades and stayed out of trouble. 

183
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,610
Just like all the other victims. 

184
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,170
Did you guys notice that the package sent to 
the clemensen family was only sent to mary ?

185
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,150
What about the first dvd ?

186
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,460
Um,let me...

187
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,330
Why are they targeting the mothers ?

188
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,960
The mother asked god to forgive the people responsible. 

189
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,950
Hotch: And ?

190
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,080
The family that received the first dvd 
went on tv pleading for their daughter's life. 

191
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,630
That must have made the unsubs angry. 

192
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,110
So sending the dvd to the mother 
is a message in itself. 

193
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,040
A very clear one. 

194
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,110
They don't want or need forgiveness. 

195
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,660
How do you get to the freeway ?

196
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,960
If you back out to warner and make a right,
you'll see the exit in about half a mile. 

197
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,920
Thanks. 

198
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,530
No problem. 

199
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,790
We're up to 7 victims now ?

200
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,230
jacksonville police dept

201
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,020
The humiliating posing of 
the body can't be a coincidence. 

202
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,010
It's just too unique. 

203
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,830
The bruising on the necks. 

204
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,470
Looks to me like the first victim struggled. 

205
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,470
I'd say the killer probably lost his grip a couple 
times and really had to fight these women. 

206
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,870
That's why he switched from bare hands to a ligature. 

207
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,450
It's more efficient,controlled,and it doesn't 
sacrifice his sadistic need for a slow death. 

208
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,010
Because the dna didn't match,jacksonville 
P. D. Just didn't put it together. 

209
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,240
Yeah,and since the weren't looking for 2 offenders...

210
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,800
signature indicates these women had the same killers. 

211
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,490
We just need to figure out who the hell they are. 

212
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,310
Well,jacksonville P. D. Searched everywhere,
even swamps,and still didn't find the victims' vehicles. 

213
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,740
I got garcia tracing vins,but my guess is 
they dispose of the cars just like they do the women. 

214
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,300
Yeah,but the bodies are easy to find. 

215
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,740
Why do they go to so much trouble to hide the cars ?

216
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,420
I didn't think it could get any hotter than yesterday. 

217
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,680
Today's a record breaker,and the A. C. 'S busted. Sorry about the fans. 

218
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,490
They're probably spreading more dust than cool air. 

219
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,420
Well,we won't keep your officers too long. 

220
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:19,040
That's not to say that the submissive partner is in any way pure or innocent in this exchange. 

221
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,990
If their criminal desire wasn't present,
their partnership wouldn't work. 

222
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,980
The offenders share a common delusion. 

223
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,850
It's one that you and i would never accept,
but it's this bond that justifies their actions. 

224
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,680
So we're looking for 2 sick minds who complete each other. 

225
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,510
It's kind of like the perfect storm. 

226
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,530
Once these deviant personalities collide,
they're deadly and unstoppable. 

227
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,420
Like the D. C. Snipers or the columbine assassins. 

228
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,830
Sometimes they've met in childhood. 

229
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,790
Other times,they can be related,like the hillside 
stranglers,angelo buono and kenneth bianchi,

230
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,470
psychopathic cousins who terrorized women in los angeles. 

231
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,370
The dominant partner makes the submissive one feel invincible. 

232
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,600
That's his reward for doing as he's told. 

233
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,640
Unfortunately there are countless 
opportunities for these twisted minds to meet,

234
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,180
and once they've pulled off their vicious acts,

235
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,210
the two accept this as common behavior 
and become bored with normal activity. 

236
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,230
They live only for their new reality. 

237
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,040
They're obsessed with it,addicted to it. 

238
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,180
And there's a fierce loyalty between the two. 

239
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,710
The submissive one,however,is usually less intelligent 
and easier to catch,and once caught,he is easier to turn. 

240
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,880
Lack of remorse increas their aggressiveness. 

241
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,540
Sexual sadists will stop when they're caught. 

242
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,860
And the need to psychologically 
torture the families...sorry to interrupt. 

243
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,830
If you've seen my daughter,please,tiffany's all I have. 

244
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,690
She--she went for a run last night,
and she never came home. 

245
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,110
She's my baby. 

246
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,520
Why weren't we told about 
this before she went on the news ?

247
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,130
'Cause we didn't know about it. 

248
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,050
Tiffany was abducted from middleberg. 

249
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,220
That's nearly an hour away,and it's 
outside of jacksonville's jurisdiction. 

250
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,070
Are you sure these are the same offenders ?

251
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,900
Well,she's their type. 

252
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,560
Grabbed her while jogging,just like their third victim. 

253
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,330
Middleberg's only an hour from here ?

254
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,360
If they see this,it's just a matter 
of time before they send a dvd. 

255
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,900
All right,jennifer jareau,fbi. 

256
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,340
You just aired a press conference with beverly spears. 

257
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,310
I need to speak to her immediately. 

258
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,800
These guys are impatient. 

259
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,710
They just dumped laura clemensen's body 24 hours ago. 

260
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,540
Which means they're more dangerous than 
they were yesterday,and tiffany spears is running out of time. 

261
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,620
You ok ?

262
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,620
Am I ok ?

263
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,490
Uh,let me see. 

264
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:45,250
I've got images of a girl being tortured burned 
inside my brain over the strains of this once-carefree choice of music. 

265
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,290
I've isolated 4 sources from one track,
and each one is more distorted than the next,

266
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,220
so no,I am not ok,and it's gonna take awhile. 

267
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,880
Penelope,you know I appreciate you doing this. 

268
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,960
Thank you,sugar. 

269
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,200
For right now,even that doesn't feel good. 

270
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,770
Eh,moving on. 

271
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,910
Some of these victims were abducted while driving. 

272
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,750
It does leave a nice trail,especially when 
all the parts lead you to trevor's used auto in georgia. 

273
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,760
Well,no wonder jacksonville P. D. Couldn't find the vehicles. 

274
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,330
The unsubs didn't drive the cars. 

275
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
They destroyed them and sold the parts. 

276
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,480
Yeah,and over state lines. 

277
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,530
These sickos are good. 

278
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,270
Parts were found in georgia. 

279
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,230
Sales were traced to a joey davin,
who lives right here in jacksonville. Joseph P. 

280
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,100
Davin,27. 

281
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,870
In and out of jail since he was 17. 

282
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,890
Number of charges,including car theft with a partner. 

283
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,150
Maybe he likes to team up. 

284
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,280
Either way,he hasn't learned his lesson. 

285
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,670
Doesn't sound too smart to me. 

286
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,300
Exactly why he needs a good leader. 

287
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,730
If it is proof that tiffany is still 
alive,still breathing,I need to see it. 

288
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,950
Ma'am,you don't understand. 

289
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,630
Do you remember what tiffany was 
wearing the last time you saw her ?

290
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,490
I told the police she was going for a run. 

291
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,210
Sneakers,tank,shorts. 

292
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,680
Well,you need to think of her like 
this until we get her back. 

293
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,660
You don't need to see what's on that dvd. 

294
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,290
I was supposed to have run with her yesterday. 

295
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,490
I should have been there. 

296
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,190
Help her,please,god. 

297
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,060
Help her. 

298
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,690
Investigators are connecting tiffany spears' disappearance 
with those of the 5 other victims murdered in the jacksonville area,

299
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,030
including laura clemensen,whose body was found yesterday. 

300
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,620
3 of the victims' cars are still missing. 

301
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:54,250
Investigators believe if they can find 
who took those cars,they will find the killer responsible. 

302
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,600
Fbi. 

303
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,870
And what can I do for you ?

304
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,270
We're looking for joseph davin. 

305
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,220
What did joey do now ?

306
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,260
Sir,we really need to talk to joey. 

307
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,710
You joseph davin ?

308
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,310
Get out of my way. 

309
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,950
Joey,don't be stupid !

310
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,760
I saw it on tv. 3 strikes,and I'm out. 

311
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,730
I'm not goin' back. 

312
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm n--I'm not goin' down for this. 

313
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,880
Put the weapon down. 

314
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,310
Put it down now !

315
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,910
Joey,put--

316
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,220
Oh,joey !

317
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,650
Why didn't he put down the gun ?

318
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,840
He didn't want that third strike. 

319
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,960
I didn't have a choice. 

320
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,040
And he was our closest link to finding tiffany spears. 

321
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,000
Can't this wait ?

322
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,120
Mr. Davin,there have been 7 women raped 
and murdered in the jacksonville area. 

323
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,670
We can tie joe to 3 of them. 

324
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,300
You know,I thought by forcing him to move back 
in here,it would keep him out of trouble. 

325
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,010
How long had your son been living here ?

326
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,930
2 years. 

327
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,200
After the M. S. Put me in the chair. 

328
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,140
Was he still running with his boys from prison ?

329
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,610
Aw,he works at a garage with a bunch of ex-cons. 

330
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,560
I tried so hard. 

331
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,000
I just couldn't get him out of that world. 

332
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,330
I kept telling him,"you're better than all this. 

333
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,120
" Agent gideon,we just found this. 

334
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,360
Your son have a friend or girlfriend with long,blond hair ?

335
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,480
Not that I know of,no. 

336
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,740
Is it possible that you wouldn't know if you did ?

337
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,750
After today...

338
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,120
nothing would surprise me. 

339
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,330
Morgan: The dominant one wouldn't have panicked like that. 

340
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,540
He would have come at us shooting 
and gone down in a blaze of glory. 

341
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,280
So where's the other half of this partnership ?

342
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,070
Witnesses saw a white minivan,correct ?

343
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,070
Morgan: That one's henry'S. 

344
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,170
It's got handicapped plates. 

345
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,500
You see any signs in henry's behavior 
that he could be part of this ?

346
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,250
Nah. 

347
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,210
But if joey drives the van,then 
he can drive while his partner snatches the girls. 

348
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,570
Have your men process the van. 

349
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:19,200
If there's anything in there that doesn't 
belong to joe or henry davin,I wanna know about it. 

350
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,390
So,how does joe meet his partner ?

351
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,880
Well,his father says he hangs with 
a bunch of ex-cons at the garage. 

352
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,940
Yeah. It's,uh...it's in springfield. 

353
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,010
I'll have hotch check it out. 

354
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,780
If he's still hanging with ex-cons,
he probably talks to his old cellmate. 

355
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,150
Find out who that is. 

356
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,090
Ok. 

357
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,080
This better be hella good. 

358
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,100
Garcia ?

359
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,310
Hello. 

360
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,070
Yes,sir. 

361
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,150
I'm here. I'm sorry. 

362
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,390
I just--I wasn't--I'm surprised that you're calling me. 

363
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,910
I need to know who joseph davin shared a cell with. 

364
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,760
Yes. Sure. 

365
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,090
Uh,it was a guy...

366
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,850
named...

367
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,720
His name was tony canardo. 

368
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,340
They were in together for 18 months,
and both were released 3 years ago. 

369
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,500
Before the killings started. 

370
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,480
Is that it ?

371
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,210
His current address is 865 kentwood in jacksonville. 

372
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,310
That's all you got ?

373
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,940
Uh,yeah. 

374
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:18,890
Garcia...

375
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,110
yes. 

376
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,750
You do great work. 

377
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,120
Keep it up. 

378
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,460
Oh,thank you,sir. 

379
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,110
Thank you. 

380
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,910
Man: Look,I got 2 guys out today. 

381
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,670
I can't help you. 

382
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,050
But my car's still leaking oil. 

383
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,100
Do you still have a receipt ?

384
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,170
It was less than a month ago. 

385
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,160
Do you have your receipt ?

386
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,360
Hotch: Excuse me. 

387
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,570
I'm with a customer. 

388
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,640
All right. 

389
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,020
What can you tell me about joe davin ?

390
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,930
I can tell you i fired him last week. 

391
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,440
Why ?

392
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,750
He wasn't very good at his job. 

393
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,800
He was shot this morning by jacksonville police. 

394
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,000
Sorry to hear that. 

395
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,640
You seem real upset by the news. 

396
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,010
I already had another guy to take his place. 

397
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,680
Well,you didn't waste any time,did you ?

398
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,660
His ex-con buddies were always at the shop. 

399
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,730
It's bad for business. 

400
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,730
You're an ex-con. 

401
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,600
I was innocent. 

402
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,360
Yeah. They all are. 

403
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,310
You know this guy ?

404
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,160
That's t-bone. 

405
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,970
Name's tony canardo. 

406
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,880
He ran with joey's crowd. 

407
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,190
This is one of the ex-cons 
that you were talking about ?

408
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,110
Yeah. 

409
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,680
When tony's around,joey's not taking orders from me,
and I can't have too many cooks in the kitchen. 

410
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,310
You know what I mean ?

411
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,790
We do. 

412
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,230
Look,I gotta get back to work. 

413
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,990
Well,joey was just surrounded by dominant personalities. 

414
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,370
If mike kroger was the killer,you'd think he'd try to hide it better. 

415
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,660
We'll have garcia run his sheet. 

416
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,950
Who are you guys ?

417
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,260
MrS. Canardo. 

418
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,040
Can we come in ?

419
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,100
Everything ok ?

420
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,370
Uh,you tell me. 

421
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,670
We're looking for your husband. 

422
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,150
He's not home. 

423
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,340
Well,he spent time in prison with a man named joseph davin. 

424
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,450
Do you know him ?

425
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,210
Yeah,I know joey. 

426
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,140
Joey's dead. 

427
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,330
Oh,my god. What happened ?

428
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,140
He pulled a gun when we were trying to question him. 

429
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,070
About what ?

430
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,860
7 young women in the jacksonville 
area who've been raped and killed. 

431
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,740
Did you know him well ?

432
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,570
He and my husband did time together. 

433
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:42,710
When tony got out on good behavior,
he tried to turn his life around,stay clean. 

434
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,880
How's he doing ?

435
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,670
Ok. 

436
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,120
Some of those are mine. 

437
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,810
Tony ever get into trouble or do 
anything that scares you when he drinks ?

438
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,410
Only when he's around joey. 

439
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,830
Those two get together,I'm afraid of what could happen. 

440
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,910
Do you know where we can find tony now ?

441
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,380
He's getting off work. 

442
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,780
He should be home soon. 

443
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,130
Is there anyplace you can go ?

444
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,620
'Cause we're gonna need to talk to him. 

445
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,300
I can call my friend kim. 

446
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,250
You wanna drive me down to the station ?

447
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,200
Can you wait here for tony ?

448
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,400
Did you run mike kroger's sheet,the guy from the garage ?

449
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,020
The boy needs a refresher course in anger management. 

450
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,510
Ok,we got assault and battery. 

451
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,900
We got assault with a deadly weapon. 

452
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,400
There's one attempted rape,but it was dropped,because 
the poor thing was too scared to testify against mr. Stinky. 

453
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,490
Where was he when tiffany spears was abducted ?

454
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,330
His credit card says miami,but not all of his alibis check out,

455
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,320
and you know if there is one loose thread,I will find it,
I will pull it,and his story will completely unravel. 

456
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,980
A tout alors. 

457
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,900
Uh,garcia's checking mike kroger's 
where abouts when the women were abducted. 

458
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,710
Some of his alibis already check out. 

459
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,250
What about tony canardo ?

460
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,480
Morgan's still outside his house waiting. 

461
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,400
Officer: Excuse me. 

462
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,340
Agent gideon,there's someone here who wants to talk to you. 

463
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,210
Mrs. Canardo. 

464
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,280
What happened ?

465
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,740
After you left,I got nervous,so I went to find tony. 

466
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,810
Please,sit down. 

467
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,030
And he--he knew something was up,so...

468
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,160
you got a kleenex ?

469
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,670
What'd you tell him ?

470
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,570
Well,I told him the truth,that the fbi was asking questions. 

471
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,220
So he hit you ?

472
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,600
I wasn't completely honest with you about tony. 

473
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,470
He fell off the wagon a while ago. 

474
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,780
I just was afraid to say something. 

475
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,530
I didn't wanna betray him. He's my husband. 

476
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,330
No,it's--it's good that you're here with us. 

477
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,130
You're safe here. 

478
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,960
I'm gonna go tell portillo and hotch that they should meet morgan. 

479
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,860
Uh,ms. Canardo,can i ask you a question ?

480
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,090
Yes. 

481
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,680
Uh,is that ring new ?

482
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,460
Tony won some money playing poker. 

483
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,730
He bought it as a gift. 

484
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,430
Why ?

485
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,240
Looks a lot like laura clemensen'S. 

486
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,470
Big mistake. 

487
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,920
Come on !

488
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,550
Morgan !
Yeah !Right here !

489
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,170
What,you couldn't wait ?

490
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,050
I didn't want him to get away. 

491
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,620
You all right ?
Yeah. I'm fine. 

492
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,720
Say anything ?

493
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,870
No. 

494
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,640
You should have stuck to beating up girls. 

495
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,140
Bring him inside. 

496
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,210
Thank you. 

497
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,420
The tapes are sitting right out. 

498
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,300
We were never in this room. We never saw them. 

499
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,410
it's tiffany spears. 

500
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,600
where is she ?

501
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,310
Help !

502
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,620
Please,help !

503
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,050
Help me !

504
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,690
Help !

505
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,940
Help. 

506
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,270
If we're gonna get anything out of tony,we gotta praise him. 

507
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,980
He's the dominant. He thinks he deserves it. 

508
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,660
Confirm instead of undermine his expectations. 

509
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,360
Make him think he's smarter than us because he saw it coming. 

510
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,160
We don't have much time. 

511
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,270
I know. I'm sorry. That's just standard procedure. 

512
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,620
I'm special agent aaron hotchner. 

513
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,880
I'm supervising this task force. 

514
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,740
I just wanna say that this case,your case,is,uh...

515
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,040
remarkable. 

516
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,230
You've got people at the B. A. U. Shaking their heads. 

517
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,680
Tony: What about you ?

518
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,990
You shaking your head ?

519
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,870
Absolutely. 

520
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,310
7 victims in 3 years. 

521
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,530
You've got every woman in jacksonville living in fear. 

522
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,790
That's pretty much what you wanted,isn't it ?

523
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,660
Well,I'm sure whoever's responsible for it is enjoying it. 

524
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,260
The B. A. U. Would like to show your 
interview,with your permission,of course. 

525
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,980
Show me what's in the boxes. 

526
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,650
This. 

527
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,410
They're all full. 

528
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,240
It's all you. 

529
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,590
We can,uh--we can open all the boxes if you want. 

530
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,160
No. 

531
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,060
I wanna see my lawyer. 

532
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,830
Well,tony sure lawyered up quick. 

533
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,370
He's playing games. 

534
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,150
Deal if you tell us where tiffany spears is. 

535
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,190
This guy's been to jail before. 

536
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,360
He knows how to keep his mouth shut. 

537
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,000
What do you think,I'm stupid ?

538
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,850
Far from it. 

539
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,340
Morgan: Look at that. 

540
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,290
Notice how he's focused on those 2 pictures. 

541
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,560
We can't forensically tie him to those victims,
but we're certain that he posed those bodies after death. 

542
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,170
Well,that's certainly not working. 

543
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,440
I'm not getting anywhere with him. 

544
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,790
Is the wife still here ?

545
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,400
We wanna put her in a room with him ?

546
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,590
We need to humanize him. 

547
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,990
I think she could do that. 

548
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,430
How he abuses her. 

549
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,860
And she takes it. 

550
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,500
She's subservient to him. 

551
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,140
You think she'd do it ?

552
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,300
If we wanna find tiffany spears,she'll have to. 

553
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,920
It's worth a shot. 

554
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,590
We'd been together 2 years,and we were gonna start a family. 

555
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,280
Sorry to interrupt. 

556
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,600
Few minuteS. Thank you. 

557
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,640
How you holdin' up ?

558
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,200
Ok,I guess. 

559
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,860
You called your family ?

560
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,100
Tony's my only family. 

561
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,010
Tony won't talk to us. 

562
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,490
What are you gonna do ?

563
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,490
I think if you go in there,he'll talk to you. 

564
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,670
You want me to go in a room with him ?

565
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,150
I can't do that. 

566
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,950
There--you gotta find another way. 

567
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,140
He'll kill me. I turned him in. 

568
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,510
Look what he did to me. 

569
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,280
I know. 

570
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,680
I believe...

571
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,300
That you're the only person 
who can get through to tony. 

572
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,650
With joe dead,tony's the only one 
who knows where tiffany spears is. 

573
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,840
And if he tells you,you've saved her life. 

574
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,630
Right now,you're her only hope. 

575
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,080
Honey,I need to know where...

576
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,010
where the girl is. 

577
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,580
Don't you mean...

578
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,010
they need to know ?

579
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,400
Why should i tell them anything ?

580
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,780
What have I got to gain ?

581
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,480
They're pinning us for 7 murders,amber. 

582
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:58,370
I can't believe you and joey killed them all. 

583
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,320
7 !

584
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,010
None of this would have happened if joey had stayed away. 

585
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,860
We were on our way to better things. 

586
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,590
Joey messed that up for us. 

587
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,750
I need you to tell me,tony. 

588
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,060
Where'd joey take the girl ?

589
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,160
I can'T. 

590
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,470
I'm begging you to end this. 

591
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,270
Tell me now. 

592
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,770
Where's the girl ?

593
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,480
There's this...

594
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,990
storage unit. 

595
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,940
Joe's dad is the only one who has the key. 

596
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,250
I can't believe my husband killed all those women. 

597
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,620
It took a lot of courage to go in there. 

598
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,920
You did the right thing. 

599
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,610
Can we get you a glass of water or something ?

600
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,440
Yeah. 

601
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,040
Water ?

602
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,100
Yeah. 

603
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,780
You stay with her,please ?

604
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,940
Yes,sir. 

605
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,920
Joe's dad ?Isn't he in a wheelchair,though ?

606
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,210
Only for the last 2 years. 

607
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,410
Henry davin could have raped and killed the first 2 women 3 
years ago,then brought in joe and tony to continue his work. 

608
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,060
Maybe it's the only satisfaction he can get. 

609
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,800
Now they record it,and he lives it though them. 

610
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,430
So it was a team of 3. 

611
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,970
We found laura clemensen's hair 
at henry's house. It makes sense. 

612
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,620
Let's take a ride. 

613
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,610
Tony canardo's one sick bastard. 

614
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,030
I'm not surprised mother abandoned him when he was 4,

615
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:11,040
and then she got clean and got him back 
until he was 11,when she got busted for prostitution. 

616
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,510
No wonder he hates women. 

617
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,100
He bounced around social services after that. 

618
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,680
I mean,this guy never had any support,no foundation,no security. 

619
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,860
How'd he get the confidence to pull off something like that ?

620
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,950
Maybe that's why he needed a partner. 

621
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,890
But he's supposed to be the dominant one,the leader. 

622
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,500
I mean,given his history...

623
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,790
how can he do that ?

624
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,750
She's not here. 

625
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,130
She was never here. 

626
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,890
What the hell's going on ?

627
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,450
This looks nothing like the video. 

628
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,060
Reid: He's really playing a tough guy with that officer,huh ?

629
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,300
He played the tough guy with hotch. 

630
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,830
It wasn't antagonistic. It was defensive. 

631
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,460
False bravado ?

632
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,710
You think he's wearing a mask ?

633
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,480
Let me see amber's tape. 

634
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,110
Why isn't she scared ?

635
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,840
She looks scared to me. 

636
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,850
No. 

637
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,230
Look. 

638
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:24,500
She initiated eye contact right there. 

639
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,150
Yeah ?

640
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,460
You guys have gotta hear this. 

641
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,810
Patch it through. 

642
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,410
If she were afraid,she'd look anywhere but his face. 

643
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,920
She's looking at the victims,and she doesn't really...

644
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,090
she doesn't seem that repulsed. 

645
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,110
She actually looks surprisingly calm. 

646
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,570
Amber: Now put that little bitch on her side. 

647
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,630
You like it,don't you ?

648
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,900
Dirty whore likes it. 

649
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,880
He's studying her. 

650
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,050
He's waiting for her lead. 

651
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,080
Where'd joey take the girl ?

652
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,630
She just gave him an order. 

653
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,100
He's protecting her. 

654
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,270
He's giving her an out. 

655
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,290
Amber: Do it again. 

656
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,570
Gideon: Where is she ?

657
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,700
Where's the girl ? !

658
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,220
Where is she ? !

659
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,880
Told you to watch her. 

660
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,280
We analyzed what we recorded of tony and amber. 

661
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,840
Turns out she's the dominant one. 

662
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,250
Garcia finally isolated the soundtrack on that dvd. 

663
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,040
Turns out it was amber giving the orders. 

664
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,570
That means she's the one doing the killing. 

665
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,710
Where is amber now ?

666
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,500
She told the cop she was going out for 
a smoke and walked out the back door. 

667
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,400
We're running out of time. 

668
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,350
You've gotta find out where they're holding tiffany. 

669
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,310
I'll change the approach. 

670
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,570
Uh,you're gonna wanna look at this. 

671
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,790
Joey davin's dna didn't match the first 2 victims. 

672
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,250
That means neither could henry'S. 

673
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,540
So who raped the first 2 girls ?

674
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,360
Lucky man,you know that ?

675
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,830
You have something really special. 

676
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,600
I mean,she had to know what you were doing 
to all those women and stayed with you anyway. 

677
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:09,110
Must feel great to be appreciated by the woman you love. 

678
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,710
It does. 
I bet. 

679
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,880
I know you and amber would do anything for each other. 

680
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:22,030
But why would you confess to killing these 
2 women when you had no idea who they are ?

681
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,610
Joey and i killed all of 'em. 

682
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,090
Really ?

683
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,190
Well,whose dna did we find at the scene ?

684
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,250
What are you talking about ?

685
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,580
Well,it's not yours. It's not joe'S. 

686
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:35,020
That poor guy probably had no idea 
these cars belonged to the women you killed. 

687
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:40,230
Makes you wonder if you and joe hadn't 
shared a cell together,maybe he'd still be alive. 

688
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,260
You got the wrong idea. 

689
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,290
No,I think you've got the wrong idea,tony. 

690
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,260
Joe wasn't your partner. 

691
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,000
Tiffany spears isn't at the storage unit. 

692
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,760
You wanna know what else ?

693
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,870
We can hear amber's voice on the videos telling you what to do. 

694
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,140
We know amber's your partner. 

695
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,290
Come on. 

696
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,450
Why ?

697
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,080
Why you protecting her ?

698
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,030
She's wife. 

699
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,580
It's more than that. 

700
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:14,700
Look,nothing would ever come between us...not you... 

701
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,890
not nothing. 

702
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,950
Besides amber would never do anything to hurt me. 

703
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,730
Reid here. 

704
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,680
No time for pleasantries. 

705
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,580
I was able to unseal a file regarding amber canardo. 

706
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,550
What does it say ?

707
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,150
When amber was 15,she walked into a tallahassee 
hospital raped and beaten something awful. 

708
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,310
Doctors deduced she was being 
abused by her father and her brother. 

709
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,020
Eventually they convinced her to go to the police. 

710
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,720
But when she did,mom showed up 
and told them that amber was lying. 

711
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,170
She obviously did nothing to protect amber from the abuse. 

712
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:47,060
She--she feels betrayed by her mother and now receives extreme 
sadistic pleasure in watching the same thing that happened to her. 

713
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:50,680
Strange. In this case the abused 
actually became the abuser. 

714
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,780
That doesn't happen a lot ?

715
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,490
1 in 8. 

716
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,460
We found the one. 

717
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,380
You ask amber how the first 2 women died ?

718
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,230
She's done it before,tony. 

719
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,870
No,she hasn'T. 

720
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,030
Yes,she has,with other men. 

721
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,110
You're not so special. 

722
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,080
Men mean nothing to her. 

723
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,070
She used you,just like the other guy. 

724
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,670
Shut up. 

725
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,120
She set you up,tony. 

726
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,770
She had you do everything. 

727
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,490
Whose dna do you think that was at the scene ?

728
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,850
Come on. Think about it. 

729
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,150
Amber beat herself up,she walked in here,she handed me laura clemensen's ring,

730
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,440
and she told us you gave it to her as a gift. 

731
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,800
You know it's true,and that's why you're upset. 

732
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:47,240
Gideon,garcia found out that amber was abused by her brother and her father. 

733
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,100
They'd take her to the woods. 

734
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,410
She betrayed you,tony. 

735
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,180
There's only one way to get her back. 

736
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,350
Because if you don't,she'll forget 
about you,just like this other guy. 

737
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,240
Tell us where she's keeping the girl. 

738
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,140
I know amber's father kept her 
in the woods so no one would hear her scream. 

739
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:15,370
Was it amber's idea to leave the girls in the woods ?

740
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,610
Where's tiffany ?

741
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,630
There's a cabin. 

742
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,550
duval county woods

743
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,760
Go !

744
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,060
Fbi !

745
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,880
Back off !

746
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,390
Amber: You got nothin' on me. 

747
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,350
Yeah,we just got your voice on the tapes giving the orders. 

748
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,160
So what ?

749
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,870
He saved one little whore. 

750
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,940
Tiffany,I'm fbi. 

751
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,520
I'm not gonna hurt you. 

752
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,030
Look at me. 

753
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,520
She'll never be the same. 

754
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,680
Morgan: You're ok. 

755
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,840
You're ok. 

756
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,920
We got amber. 

757
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,620
Tiffany spears is alive. 

758
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,270
All right. Thank you. 

759
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:10,720
Jacksonville P. D. Found the remains 
of a body on the grounds of the cabin. 

760
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,320
They think it's amber canardo's old boyfriend. 

761
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,960
And 10'll get 20 that dna'll match the first 2 victims. 

762
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,220
At least the families will finally have closure. 

763
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,410
And we did save tiffany spears. 

764
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:33,180
