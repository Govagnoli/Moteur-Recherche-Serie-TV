{\a6}CHULA VISTA,CA

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,460
Have you I.D.'D the body?

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,240
It's a girl.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,130
One of the missing girls?

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,730
All I can tell you
right now is it's a girl.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,290
Did you draw up a list of
those involved in the search?

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,470
You're gonna find the parents
of the girls on that list.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,720
Please tell me they
didn't discover the body.

12
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,940
No.As soon as our dogs caught her scent,

13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,080
we kept them away from the scene.

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,890
She'd been missing 18 hours?

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,060
That's correct.

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,690
We found the body 5 hours ago.

17
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,500
The parents have been
here all this time?

18
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,940
Yeah. And I'm running out of excuses.

19
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,330
I'm gonna go talk to them.

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,550
- J.J.,I'll come with you.
- Thanks.

21
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,430
I gotta be honest,guys.

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,380
I'm glad you're all here,because I
have never seen anything like that.

23
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,730
Her face and her hands
have been obliterated.

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,480
Bruce and i were out for dinner.

25
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,080
Jack dropped off the
girls at the movie theater.

26
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,430
And I arranged to pick them
up,but they never came out.

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,470
I went inside,but they weren't there.

28
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,700
And an usher told me he saw them leave
the,uh,the theater halfway through the movie.

29
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,280
Where'd they go?

30
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,340
He said they went
outside for a cigarette.

31
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,110
We didn't even know katie smoked.

32
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,850
- Did he say if they came back inside?
- No.

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,390
We've been here all day.

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,620
Why won't they let us know who that is?

35
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,120
'Cause they don't know
who it is. Do they?

36
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,000
Why? What did they do to her?

37
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,480
Look,until we know who it
is and what's happened,we--

38
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,310
by "we" you mean the fbi,right?

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,940
We're only here to help the
police find out who did this.

40
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,180
Well,it's a little late
for that,don't you think?

41
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,950
I'm pat mannan,jack's friend.

42
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,820
His wife passed away a few years ago.

43
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,110
Lindsey's all that he has.

44
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,270
Developed bruises,cuts,layer upon layer.

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,070
Bindings cut deep into her flesh.

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,210
And around her neck
there's heavy bruising.

47
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,440
She was strangled to death.

48
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,110
A belt was used.

49
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,890
You can see the indentation
marks of a buckle.

50
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,060
But why destroy her hands and face?

51
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,280
It indicates she knew the attacker.

52
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,410
By destroying her I.D.,

53
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,380
They're hoping to delay you making a
connection between the victim and the unsub.

54
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,340
It gives him time to get away.

55
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,180
Do you think the other
girl's still alive?

56
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,530
Until we find her body,we
should assume she is.

57
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,760
One thing's for sure--
this is only the dump site.

58
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,200
We need to figure out
where she was killed.

59
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,130
And which girl we're looking for.

60
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,500
Excuse me. Mrs. Owen?

61
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,670
The message katie left-- would you
mind I see what we can make of it?

62
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,680
Yes,of course.

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,400
Thank you.

64
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,810
Why?

65
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,420
You said she made the call at 11:20.

66
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,920
It's possible katie was
with whoever took her.

67
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,650
Mr. And mrs. Owen. Mr. Vaughan.

68
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,310
I'm sorry,but we're gonna have to
move the body for further examination.

69
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,420
You know,I can identify her.

70
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,010
I'll know if it's katie or lindsey.

71
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,060
I can do it.

72
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,050
Until we find something conclusive,I
would advise against that.

73
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,040
Garcia.

74
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,630
Hey,angelfish.

75
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,100
Right back at ya. I got a
cell phone number for you.

76
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,130
619-555-0199.

77
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,430
Access the last message left.

78
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,950
I need you to put it through a filter.

79
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,180
So can do,but it will
require all my faculties.

80
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,030
I'll call you back in a sec.

81
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,470
Please,no,please. Please stop it!

82
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,770
Stop it! Stop it!

83
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,290
Don't fight them. Don't!

84
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,640
Oh,please,god,stop!

85
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,730
Don't show them you're scared.

86
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,060
Daddy,help me,please!

87
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,720
It lasts exactly 53
seconds,and then it goes dead.

88
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,070
{\a6}CHULA VISTA POLICE DEPT.

89
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,390
I think she was strangled.

90
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,050
What do you want to do?

91
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,840
Do?There's nothing
else to do--

92
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,580
the parents can I.D.The voice.

93
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,600
Are you serious?

94
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,520
No,no,sir,they can never hear this.

95
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,800
It'll be the fastest way to
figure out who we're looking for.

96
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,330
There's gotta be another way.

97
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,910
Dna?

98
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,130
LINGTHY TORTURE  FLESH CUTS

99
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,560
My feeling is by the time
we got the results back,

100
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,030
it would be too late to
save whoever they still have.

101
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,280
It's up to you.

102
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,330
This message,what did it record?

103
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,710
It's the...

104
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,660
last moments of one of
your daughters' lives.

105
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,530
Oh,my god.

106
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,540
If you choose to wait,you can
make a public appeal to the media.

107
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,330
Either way,we're still looking
for one of your daughters.

108
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,510
Live app-ieal- don't think
that's a good idea,jack.

109
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,380
Why not?

110
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:17,470
Because we know they're set up to see the
reaction of the parent,check for signs of guilt.

111
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,710
Is that true?

112
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,510
In some cases.

113
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,530
I'm sorry,bruce,I can't
do this. I'M...sorry.

114
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,240
Go ahead,garcia.

115
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,380
Please,please. Please,no,please.

116
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,220
Please,stop it! Stop it!Stop it!

117
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,820
Don't fight them. Don'T.

118
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,120
Oh,please,god,stop.

119
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,390
Don't show them you're scared.

120
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,220
Get off of me.

121
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,650
Please,help me! Please,god!Stop it!

122
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,920
Daddy,help me,please! Please...

123
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,810

Mr. Owen...

131
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,230
that's not katie. I know her voice.

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,300
That's not her. That's not katie.

133

Bruce.

134
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,210
Mrs. Owen,I'm so sorry.

135
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,650
No. No,lori,it's ok.

136
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,200
It's not her.

137
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,340
Bruce...

138
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,600
no,jack. Jack.

139
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,550
Jack,it's not katie,right?

140
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,640
- You know--
- bruce.

141
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,490
Jack,it's not katie.

142
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,260
- It's katie.
- No.

143
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,710
No,it's not.

144
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,260
Jack,please...

145
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,770
Come on.

146
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,870
I want lindsey's picture everywhere.

147
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,930
What they did to katie took a long time.

148
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,200
It was very violent and
we know katie screamed.

149
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,690
Yet no calls from
complaining neighbors.Why?

150
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,620
They're weren't any.

151
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:57,220
The abduction site is 9 miles north
of the dump site on the edge of town.

152
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,760
Both are indicators of a comfort zone,

153
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,430
so I'm assuming the kill site is
somewhere between these 2 points.

154
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,720
That's a wide area.

155
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,370
Do a grid search.

156
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,620
Narrow it down to wooded
areas,industrial sites,abandoned houses.

157
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,180
He needed privacy and he
needed a controlled environment.

158
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,000
What's critical right now
is a heavy police presence.

159
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,790
Rossi,in the morning I want you,reid,morgan
to go in and search jack vaughan's house.

160
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,550
Prentiss,you and I will go to
where the girls were last seen.

161
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,300
Prentiss: 2 girls missing,one dead,and
life goes on as though nothing happened.

162
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,700
Holiday weekend. What do you expect?

163
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,900
A sense that something's changed.

164
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,660
Do we know what movie they saw?

165
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,610
Whatever it was,they left halfway
through to have a cigarette.

166
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,400
What do you think they're talking about?

167
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,950
Boys.

168
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,610
Think their parents know they smoke?

169
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,550
Mine didn'T.

170
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,940
And if they saw me
dressed like that--ho ho.

171
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,960
Two teenage girls free of parents,breaking
the rules,and dressed like that for a reason.

172
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,950
Here comes the reason.

173
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,380
They obviously don't know them.

174
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,900
But they want to.

175
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,490
Do you think they'll go with them?

176
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,210
Since news of katie's death? No.

177
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,940
See?

178
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,680
So,brightly lit. No alleys.

179
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,710
Wide-open holiday weekend.

180
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,580
Hard to abduct 2 girls
without being seen.

181
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,530
Unless they knew whoever took them.

182
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,830
Jack Vaughan's Residence CHULA VISTA,CA

183
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,870
What happened to lindsey's mother?

184
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,080
Does it matter?

185
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,820
It does to lindsey.

186
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,930
It's called victimology.

187
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,390
It helps us understand
more about lindsey.

188
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,120
How?

189
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,570
How she carries herself.

190
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,350
How she interacts socially with others.

191
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,410
She's just like any
other 15-year-old.

192
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,190
No,she's not.

193
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,070
I'm sorry?

194
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,340
Everything in our house is an
externalization of ourselves.

195
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,030
This room isn't what you'd
expect of a teenage girl.

196
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,260
No J.T.Posters.

197
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,600
No framed pictures.

198
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,770
No journals,no cuddly toys.

199
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,360
The walls are a mute tone.

200
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,840
All this suggests that
lindsey keeps herself hidden.

201
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,590
She's shy and...

202
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,140
shares very little with others.

203
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,340
Except to one
person-- katie.

204
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,280
Garcia?

205
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,780
All that from this room,huh?

206
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,540
Is he wrong?

207
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,080
Her dad,jack,he-- he never lets
up. I mean,he doesn't let her...

208
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,770
reid,I ran a check on the folks
involved in the search. All good.

209
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,380
Nice neighborhood,no sexual offenders.

210
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,270
But,here's the big news.

211
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,840
I found a blog katie
ran on faceplace.Tv.

212
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,720
She talks a lot about lindsey,and,boy,she
did not like lindsey's dad.

213
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,570
Cleans for him,and-- he treats
her like a wife,not a daughter.

214
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,910
He's just-- he's
just a creep.

215
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,410
Lindsey and jack moved to
chula vista 6 years ago.

216
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,130
Up until 9,according to
katie,lindsey lived in maine.

217
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,100
Jack owned a fishing boat with
his 3 brothers,mom stayed at home.

218
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,960
But then,tragedy struck.

219
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,850
Fish stock went down,dad
was forced to sell his boat,

220
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,500
the family fell apart,mom
died in a car accident.

221
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,890
It sounds familiar.

222
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,530
It should.

223
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,310
It's the exact life story of a girl named lindsey
in a book called the emerald sea of dreams.

224
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,300
I've read it like 5 times.

225
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,810
If lindsey stole her name and her story from a
book, why didn't her father say anything about it?

226
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,950
And his computer's set to automatically
clear the web browser history

227
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,900
and wipe the temp file on a daily basis.

228
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,350
Give me his I.P.Address.

229
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,440
374...

230
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,980
Nothing.

231
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,730
Must be using a gray box proxy server.

232
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,060
It makes tracking his
internet history impossible.

233
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,160
can I help you?

234
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,110
Reid?

235
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,970
I was just,uh,checking to see if lindsey
had contacted anyone on the internet.

236
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,370
Predators tend to--
tend to do that.

237
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,370
- Is that right?
- Yes.

238
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,440
Statistically,actually,43%
of predators--

239
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,370
lindsey doesn't like computers.

240
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,120
Cool.

241
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,110
Excuse me.

242
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,550
Doesn't look much like a home.

243
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,930
State-of-the-art security system,but
the furniture looks rented.

244
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,130
The walls are bare of any real art.

245
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,760
The shelves are devoid
of any family photos.

246
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,230
Spyware wipes your
computer file history daily.

247
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,380
Awhatre you getting at,agent?

248
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,620
In the recording,katie said what you'd
expect of any teenager about to die.

249
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,870
She begged for her life.

250
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,640
Lindsey did exactly the opposite.

251
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,030
Which is what?

252
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,450
Lindsey's emotional
response and the--

253
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,930
and the words that she chose to say in a
situation as violent as the one she faced...

254
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,270
strongly
suggests--

255
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,760
look--lindsey was either coached or
she's experienced sexual abuse before.

256
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,580
You son of a bitch!

257
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,230
No! Let me go!

258
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,050
Gun!

259
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,850
Put your hands where I
can see them,both of you!

260
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,640
Do not move!

261
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,760
Stop! Ok?

262
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,660
Ok,just calm down.

263
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,140
I'm gonna reach into my pocket...

264
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,450
and I'm gonna take out a badge.

265
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,750
Just calm down.

266
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,050
Ok?

267
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,370
United states marshal.

268
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,550
Jack and lindsey are under my authority.

269
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,970
Which is what?

270
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,940
Witness protection.

271
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,140
What's going on?

272
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,950
I'm gonna go find out.

273
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,410
What's wrong?

274
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,830
It's nothing out of
the ordinary,mrs. Owen.

275
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,360
Have they found lindsey?

276
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,550
We haven't found lindsey,no.

277
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,470
Now,why don't we all just go inside?

278
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,650
No,I want to talk to jack.

279
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,740
You can,as soon as they're done.

280
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,430
You're trying to keep
me away from jack. Why?

281
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,630
What's going on?

282
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,420
Jack's in witness protection.

283
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,850
10 years. Must be real important.

284
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,640
Why didn't you tell us immediately?

285
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:55,940
Because he's a state's witness whose
identity needs to be protected at all costs.

286
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,560
You know,jack,this may not
have anything to do with--

287
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,700
- with what?
- His past?

288
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:07,640
Jack,every person in this room,with the
exception of him,is here for your daughter.

289
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,710
If this does have anything to do with
me,they'll be coming out of boston.

290
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,460
Irish-american. 2 or more men.

291
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,950
Let's get them back to the station
and keep them there until this is over.

292
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,560
Hey,you know,you have no idea who
or what you're dealing with here.

293
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,190
Then enlighten me or stay out of my way.

294
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,780
He's under arrest?

295
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,230
No,he's not under arrest.

296
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,990
Mr. Owen,please don't make
this harder than it is.

297
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,610
You're lying to me.

298
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,190
Jack?

299
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,640
- Rossi.
- Mr. Owen,please calm down.

300
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,480
Let go of me. What's going on?

301
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,190
I want to know what he did to my katie.

302
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,190
Ok,first you need
to calm down--

303
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,080
don't tell me to calm down.

304
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,170
Why are you arresting him?

305
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,840
Sir,we're just asking
him questions. That's it.

306
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,730
Jack!

307
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,660
If you had anything to do with
this,I swear,I will kill you!

308
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,610
That's enough,sir! That's enough.

309
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,490
Garcia.

310
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,650
Sir.

311
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,020
I need you to check flights for
the last 72 hours into san diego,

312
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,050
orange county,and
private airports as well.

313
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,460
We're looking for one,maybe 2
men,possibly irish,out of boston.

314
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,280
I got it.

315
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,570
Checks motels,hotels,car
rentals,everything you can.

316
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,130
I've interviewed hundreds of killers.

317
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,770
All types of crazy motives
for doing what they did.

318
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,730
They all share one thing
in common. All of them.

319
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,780
It's in their eyes.

320
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,770
Until what they hold
most precious is gone...

321
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,850
and then they're lost.

322
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,800
Just like the rest of us.

323
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,040
Shut up.

324
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,490
Shut up.

325
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,140
Shut up!

326
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,060
You stop!

327
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,250
shut up.

328
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,760
You could have just asked.
I would have turned it off.

329
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,460
You don't know,do you...

330
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,020
who I am?

331
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,240
But I know who you are... lindsey.

332
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,340
And now you know who I am...

333
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,400
and what I can do...

334
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,710
what I will do...

335
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,890
if you don't shut up!

336
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,690
one way or another,you're gonna die.

337
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,430
Ladies first.

338
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,380
Who do you work for?

339
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,890
The mccrelan corporation,from boston.

340
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,740
I love how you guys sell that.

341
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,420
By "corporation," you
mean the mob,don't you?

342
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,000
No one's been able to
get anything on them.

343
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:19,950
Until now.

344
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,570
That's because they murdered anyone who was
a threat to them,civilians and cops alike.

345
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,770
Is that what you did,jack?
Did you eliminate the threat?

346
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,830
Do those pills help the memories,or
do they just hide the real jack?

347
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,650
The only thing that
keeps me alive is lindsey.

348
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,680
What they did to katie,do you
think that was a message to you?

349
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,200
If it is,it's working.

350
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,510
Do you recognize the method?

351
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,060
I didn't send messages.

352
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,210
I just went straight to the source.

353
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,380
In 2 weeks' time,the mccrelan
brothers will face trial.

354
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,850
It looks like the
mccrelans are gonna walk.

355
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,970
Where?

356
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,000
All right. Thanks.

357
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:57,900
You were right.

358
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,910
We just found something
in an abandoned house.

359
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,820
Lindsey?

360
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,490
Where,exactly?

361
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,040
Here.

362
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,430
On the outskirts of town.

363
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,080
It's still in the comfort zone.

364
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:08,960
What does that mean?

365
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,160
It means the unsubs
are local. Still here.

366
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,330
Let's go.

367
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,120
Agent hotchner.

368
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,220
Whatever you find,I want to see her.

369
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,540
What is it to the dump site,5 miles?

370
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,800
- 6.2 miles south.
- Why?

371
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,050
Why didn't they dump katie's
body on the other side of town?

372
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,500
And risk heading out on the open road while
everyone was out looking for the girls.

373
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,680
Something forced them to move on.

374
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,030
Katie's cell phone.

375
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,940
2 different sets of footprints.

376
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,150
2 unsubs.

377
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,740
Jack said there'd be 2 of them.

378
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,270
There's cigarette butts everywhere.

379
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,680
For professionals,this is a real mess.

380
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,730
Multiple beer and liquor bottles.

381
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,470
This could be the belt
they used to strangle katie.

382
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,910
You'd think they'd just want
to do the job and move on.

383
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,180
They're sending a message.

384
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,730
Why obliterate the
I.D. And hide the body?

385
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,870
Why not go straight to the source?

386
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,160
Garcia checked all the names
against the ice database and nothing.

387
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,960
Katie and lindsey may have left the
movie theater of their own free will,

388
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,150
but they sure didn't
count on coming here.

389
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,380
So this has nothing to do with the mob?

390
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,770
Hey,guys,this blood trail goes
all the way out the back here.

391
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,410
Must have run out this way.

392
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,850
Maybe it was lindsey.

393
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,820
Well,whoever it was,they
lost a lot of blood.

394
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,750
It's thinner the further we go.

395
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,740
It's an arterial bleed.

396
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,320
And it stops here.

397
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,750
Ok,spread out. Search the
grounds and every house.

398
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,120
Guys,the last house on the
left,second floor. I've got something.

399
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,830
He was stabbed 3 times.

400
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,430
Look at his face.

401
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,320
Scratch marks.Both arms.

402
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,700
And on his hand a bite mark.
These are all defensive wounds.

403
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:08,010
At some point for him,things got
out of hand and he wanted out.

404
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,040
And whoever he was with wasn't
about to let that happen.

405
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,170
He makes a run for it and...

406
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,840
gets stabbed in the process.

407
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,160
It's dark. They can't find him.

408
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,410
They think he's gone to the police and they
have to think fast,so they take katie...

409
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,040
and they dump her across town.

410
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:29,190
And to maintain some amount
of control,they take lindsey.

411
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,220
This is one of our unsubs.

412
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,030
We just need to find his friends.

413
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,910
A teenager did this?

414
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,780
He was involved.

415
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,320
So do you think she's still alive?

416
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,850
I do.

417
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,790
But I also think you
should let us do our job.

418
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Can you do that?

419
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,330
Like I said,jack,this has
nothing to do with you.

420
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,680
Nothing to do with me.

421
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,260
This punk kid took my daughter.

422
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:34,660
All this,jack,it's karma,for
what you did to all those people.

423
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,030
Defensive wounds,bite indentations,scratch
marks on his face,hands,

424
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,220
and arms all indicate that he was involved in
the murder and abduction of katie and lindsey.

425
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,530
He's just a teenager.

426
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,480
So were the lords of chaos.

427
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,110
3 teenagers bewitched by
a boy named kevin foster.

428
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,470
Kevin persuaded his friends to
murder their own high-school teacher.

429
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,200
Social dynamics of teenage boys.

430
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,330
In this case,intoxicated
by drugs and alcohol.

431
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,610
When worked up into a
frenzy by a dominant male,

432
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,230
the adolescent mind can be pushed past
what the adult mind perceives as acceptable.

433
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,760
Hotch: What started out as
a good time quickly devolved,

434
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,760
and katie fell victim to the violent
drunken rage of a juvenile gang.

435
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:21,710
Check every high school in the chula vista
area,males between the ages of 15 and 18.

436
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,300
Ok.

437
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,200
chula vista has 7 public schools and 3 private
schools,so I'm gonna need more than that.

438
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,820
Uh,let's see here.

439
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:36,100
Brown hair,5'9",approximately
142 pounds.

440
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,310
More.

441
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,500
Most of the activity's in
the southeastern district.

442
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,070
The socio-economic dynamic's
predominantly working class.

443
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:47,050
Look within a 3-mile radius
of the castle park area.

444
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,750
2 high schools.

445
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,450
Start with the largest.

446
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,540
Ok,let's see what we got.

447
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,830
I got,like,5 faces.

448
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,200
Jinkies.

449
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,080
We believe this unsub
got scared and wanted out.

450
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,970
And the dominant male,in order
to maintain control,attacked him.

451
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,480
Douglas silverman,18 years old.

452
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,680
We need to interview kids in his
class,parents,teachers,find out who his friends were.

453
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,860
It's at least 2 or more boys.

454
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,450
One older,early to mid-20s.

455
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,560
He'll think of himself as a real badass,somebody
who broke the rules,defied the system.

456
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,450
And have flunked or gotten kicked out
of high school,possibly the same one.

457
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,390
He'll also have a record--
petty theft,larceny.

458
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,640
But douglas silverman's been missing
for 2 days. How come no one's called?

459
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,770
It's a 3-day weekend.

460
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,410
His parents are out of
town,or he called,said he's ok.

461
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,550
And now that the weekend's over,I can tell you
with what's happened,it's gonna end violently.

462
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,700
We still got a chance
to get out of this.

463
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,530
After what you did? What chance?

464
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,010
What you did,too. Remember?

465
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,040
I didn't kill her.

466
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,680
Says who,huh? You?

467
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,380
It's your word against mine,bud.

468
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,340
I just want this to end.

469
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,040
It will,all right? You just gotta
relax and you gotta trust me.

470
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,710
What do we do?

471
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,640
We got something they want.

472
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,400
Now we just need a gun.

473
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,450
What? A gun?

474
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,520
Where are we gonna get that from?

475
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,060
You said that your
old man had one,right?

476
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,370
- He let you shoot it one time?
- No.

477
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,650
No,no way. I'm not doing it.

478
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,700
Listen,we can get out of
this. We have her.All right?

479
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,290
Go get the gun.

480
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,090
You really are as dumb as you look.

481
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,600
You're forgetting one thing.

482
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,650
I saw what you did.

483
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,180
Don't matter.

484
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,470
'Cause none of us are walking away.

485
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,050
What is it?

486
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,700
How can I help you?

487
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,340
- Mr. Silverman?
- Yeah.

488
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,780
I'm ssa hotchner.

489
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,840
This is ssa prentiss.

490
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,990
- Is there someplace we can talk?
- We can talk here.

491
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,380
- It would be better
if- - what's this about?

492
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,690
It's about your son doug.

493
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,850
My son doug?

494
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,630
When was the last time you spoke to him?

495
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,450
Well,hang on. I can
call him for you here.

496
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,310
Sir,he's not going to answer.

497
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,620
Sir.

498
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,640
His name's doug silverman.

499
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,410
He went to the same high
school as katie and lindsey.

500
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,530
Maybe. I don't know.

501
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,480
Why? Has he got
something to do with this?

502
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,050
All we know right now
is he was involved.

503
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,050
There are others.

504
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,570
- So this has nothing to do with jack.
- No.

505
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:21,830
Why,I vetted every boy that came into katie's
life,made sure I knew everything about them.

506
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,420
I had to.

507
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,070
I can't afford to forget a
face. His I've never seen.

508
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,280
Maybe these guys,she didn't want you to
meet,afraid of what you might say or do.

509
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,150
Lindsey and i don't have any secrets.

510
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,970
That's not quite true,though,is it?

511
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,300
No,it is true. She knows
who I am,what I was.

512
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,310
10 years ago your wife
died in a car accident.

513
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,090
Is that why you turned state witness?

514
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,490
I promised my wife on her death bed that

515
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,940
I would do whatever was
necessary to protect lindsey.

516
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:59,250
Did you tell lindsey it was supposed
to be you in that car and not her mom?

517
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,990
Yes.

518
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,350
Why,then,with all that you taught her,would
she allow herself to get caught up in this?

519
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,770
She wouldn'T.

520
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,040
What about katie?

521
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,460
Boys suck.

522
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,850
Especially at my
school. They're all so...

523
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,600
busy being busy.

524
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,510
There's this one guy,though. Real cute.

525
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,050
Hangs out with 2 dweebs.

526
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,300
But lindsey says to stay away from him.

527
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,610
Go.

528
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,170
Back to high school boys who flunked
out or got kicked out. Go back 10 years.

529
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,950
Lindsey says there's-- there's
something not right about him.

530
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,100
I think katie's talking
about him right now.

531
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,560
Thanks,garcia.

532
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,460
But she's never met him. I don't know.

533
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,740
Where are you,you son of a bitch?

534
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,670
No,no,no,he wouldn't do this.

535
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,640
He did what he was told to do.

536
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,090
Oh,wait. What was he told?

537
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,860
I mean,doug is a real shy guy,ok?

538
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,870
He doesn't make friends easy.

539
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,830
Has he changed recently,become
a little more defiant?

540
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,700
His grades slipping?

541
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,240
I thought it was just a phase.

542
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,960
A phase manipulated by someone who
targeted your son for his own needs.

543
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,980
Did he ever mention anyone to you?

544
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,500
Oh,god.

545
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,290
A couple of months
ago,there was this older kid.

546
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,640
I--I said invite him over for
supper and he didn't want to.

547
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,800
Ryan.

548
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,330
Ryan. I don't know.

549
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,380
Oh,god.

550
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,210
How am I gonna tell his mom?

551
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,630
Lindsey protected katie
like a--like a sister.

552
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,780
So if a few boys pulled up
curbside and offered katie a ride?

553
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,740
Lindsey would have gone
along to make sure she was ok.

554
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,170
Lindsey is still alive
because of what you taught her.

555
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,330
I taught her to stay
away from men like me.

556
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,580
I'd like to speak to jack
if I may,to apologize.

557
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,140
Sure.

558
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,720
5 years we've known each other.

559
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,690
No...

560
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,020
- Bruce,I'm so sorry.
- Just...listen,please.

561
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,330
I don't know who you
are or what you've done.

562
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,110
All I want to know is,are you capable
of still doing whatever it is you did?

563
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,930
Why?

564
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,140
That dead kid up there...

565
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,090
I know who he is.

566
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,950
I know who he hangs out with.

567
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,330
Garcia: Ok,I got 3 ryans.

568
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,640
The ryan we're looking for probably went to high
school with lindsey and katie a few years back.

569
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,820
He got expelled or at least flunked out.

570
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,120
Ryan phillips. He was expelled
for smoking pot years ago.

571
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,620
Oh,no.

572
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,820
- Reid,what's going on?
- He's taken my car.

573
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,230
The bastard took my car.

574
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,520
This is pat mannan.

575
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,580
All units,all units,I want
an apb out on jack vaughan.

576
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,480
Jack's taken off.

577
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,460
We heard.

578
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,800
Where's he gonna go? He
can't know where lindsey is.

579
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,340
- No,but he might know who's got her.
- How?

580
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,860
You showed bruce owen
doug's photo,right?

581
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,130
He recognized it.

582
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,610
Which means he knows
who doug's friends are.

583
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,010
So now he's sent a psychopath
after his daughter's killer.

584
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,030
Garcia's got a name.

585
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,490
Ryan phillips,28.

586
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,290
Needs get a unit over to phillips'
house before jack turns up there.

587
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,640
On thing's for sure-- we
know ryan won't be there.

588
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,420
We'd better figure out
where he is before jack does.

589
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,030
Come on. Come on,damn it.

590
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,640
You need a hand with that?

591
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,600
Who the hell are you?

592
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,780
I'm mr. Vaughan.

593
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,140
- What are you doing in my house?
- Lindsey.

594
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,080
Where's my daughter?

595
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,160
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah?

596
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,850
I think you do.

597
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,400
Hey,what are you doing? Stop!

598
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,960
Get out of my house! What are you doing?

599
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,280
This thing's not loaded,is it?

600
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,730
What are you doing?

601
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,860
Oh,god! Oh,god,you shot my leg.

602
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,130
You got 2 legs. I got one question.

603
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,180
Where's my daughter?

604
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,110
You gotta find him,and fast.

605
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,970
What does it look like I'm doing?

606
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,940
Coloring in a map.

607
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,140
All the activity is focused
in the southeastern district.

608
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,280
The abduction site,the dump
site,ryan phillips' house.

609
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,010
There's gunshots coming
from jackson street.

610
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,010
Are you coming?

611
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,390
3-day weekend,you've gotta find
a secure,private location. Where?

612
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,830
Army of cops and feds all over
town. It's gonna be real hard.

613
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,000
Every abandoned building,warehouse,lockups--
it's all been searched.

614
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,730
Guys,it seems jack just paid a
kid named taylor coleman a visit.

615
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,690
Paramedics are working on him now.

616
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,190
Reid,good news,please.

617
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,180
After inputting all the sites,

618
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:45,270
I've come up with a 2-dimensional probability service
overlay map that indicates the offenders' operating eaar.

619
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,470
Reid,where is he?

620
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,730
I know it sounds crazy,but I think he's taken
her to the mayford high school 2 blocks from here.

621
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,550
I'll meet you there,and
reid...Be careful.

622
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,500
thanks.

623
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,990
Mayford high school.

624
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,030
Damn it,pick up the phone!

625
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,020
He's not coming back,ryan.

626
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,110
What are you gonna do now?

627
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,590
Looks like it's just you and me.

628
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,280
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

629
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,420
It's something I've been
meaning to do all along.

630
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,080
See,I wasn't really
that into katie. You.

631
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,360
There's something special about you.

632
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,910
Where you goin',baby?

633
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,450
What you do to me will be nothing
compared to what my dad will do to you.

634
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,920
I'm scared.

635
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,330
Go on,daddy,kill him!

636
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,500
You son of a bitch,you
killed her! He killed katie.

637
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,740
Kill him! Kill him,daddy!

638
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,210
- Put the gun down!
- Please!Please help me!

639
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,140
Jack,put down the gun.

640
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,290
She begged him to stop
and he laughed at her!

641
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,150
He laughed at her!

642
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,650
I didn't laugh at her. I
would change it if I could.

643
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,180
But I can'T. Please...

644
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,110
- just don't kill me.
- Jack...

645
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,430
you swore to your wife
you'd protect lindsey.

646
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,970
Listen to her,jack.
Listen to what she wants.

647
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,650
She's-- she's begging you to kill
somebody right in front of her.

648
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,700
What do you think your wife
wanted you to protect her from?

649
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,000
Jack...

650
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,130
your life has been,uh...

651
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,650
it's been about violence,and if...

652
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,080
you do this,lindsey's will be,too.

653
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,120
Do you want that?

654
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,680
No,you don't want that!

655
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,920
When does it end,jack?

656
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,140
- Put down the gun!
- Kill him.

657
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,550
When does it stop?

658
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,190
Tomorrow.

659
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,670
I think it came from in here.

660
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,210
Let's go.

661
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,600
Hang back! Hang back!

662
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,960
you ok,reid?

663
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,390
I--I
tried.

664
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,600
I tried,really. I couldn'T...

665
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,670
what's gonna happen to jack?

666
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,080
It depends...

667
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,610
how important a witness he is.

668
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,660
"It is a wise father
who knows his own child."

How you doin'?

00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,770
It's jack.
