1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,510
go,go,go,go!

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,790
Clear. Clear.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,090
We clear here .

4
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,610
Surveillance had them all 
going inside 45 minutes ago.

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,380
Did anyone bail out 
on the perimeter?

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,540
No,ma'am. All secure out here.

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,960
Boss,this isn't a meth lab.

8
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,110
So why an escape tunnel?

9
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,850
Need to take a look at this.

10
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,070
Hotchner.

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,700
When?

12
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,520
Did they raise the terror alert?

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,080
No,that's probably best.

14
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,600
All right,get everybody in now.

15
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,030
I'll be there in a minute.

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,650
What's going on?

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,060
Nothing. I just have 
to go to the office.

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,300
It's 6:15,and you're talking 
about a terror alert?

19
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,390
It's bad,isn't it?

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,980
I don't know yet.

21
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,870
Please don't lie to me.

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,510
It might be.

23
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,200
I may not be home tonight.

24
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,360
I mean,I might be home late.

25
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,050
I know.

26
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,470
Shoot. I forgot.

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,080
Tomorrow is the day we scheduled to 
take jack to have his pictures taken.

28
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,690
Don't worry about it. 
I'll reschedule.

29
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,780
No,no,no,no. Go 
ahead and take him,

30
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,650
and I'll do my best 
to be there,ok?

31
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,630
Just come back safely.

32
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,080
I will.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,140
Bye.

34
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,830
Everybody,meet agent prentiss.

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,660
you had a date. I've been 
filling her in on protocol.

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,720
- Derek morgan.  
- Emily prentiss.

37
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,050
We can make nice later. 
What do we know?

38
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,630
The dea raided what they thought was a hardened 
meth lab right here in northern virginia,

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,660
but they found this instead.

40
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,020
That could be a dispersal 
device for a chemical weapon.

41
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,910
Sophisticated.

42
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,860
Homeland security's thinking al qaeda.

43
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,610
They've developed devices that span 
the spectrum of sophistication,

44
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,050
some as simple as soda 
bottles and paint cans.

45
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,820
They're called al ikhteraa.

46
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,580
- Literally "the invention."  
- They are.

47
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,520
Do we know what the biological 
or chemical agent is yet?

48
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,090
No,not yet.

49
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,710
The cell members bailed 
out through a tunnel.

50
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,330
The dea recovered a nextel 2-way 
and managed to intercept a message.

51
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,940
That's not the transcript. 
No,it's in arabic.

52
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,720
our friends surprised 
us and eloped.

53
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,460
We can no longer wait for 
the wedding as planned.

54
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,780
We can deliver our gift 
at the next crescent.

55
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,010
I lived in several middle 
eastern countries growing up.

56
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,270
Next crescent?

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,750
Muslims sometimes 
use a lunar calendar.

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,610
- I'd have to look it up...   
- next crescent moon is in 2 days.

59
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,520
So whatever they're attacking,it's 
happening in less than 48 hours.

60
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,770
It sounds like it,sir.

61
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,180
Payment for the nextel 
is linked to this man.

62
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,280
Jind allah.

63
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,500
Literally soldier of god.

64
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,610
That's pretty poor operational 
security for a sophisticated plot.

65
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,000
2 months ago,jind allah was 
captured leaving the U.S.

66
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,960
Using a forged pakistani passport 
via richmond international airport.

67
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,860
He's been held as a ghost detainee 
in guantanamo bay ever since.

68
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,350
So technically,he doesn't exist.

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,450
Soldier of god isn't a name.

70
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,850
No,it's most likely a name taken 
on for the jihad,meaning struggle.

71
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,150
Extremists claim it's a holy war.

72
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,070
Yet the words "holy" and "war" 
never appear together in the qu'ran.

73
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,290
Do we know his real name?

74
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,890
Cia interrogators have gotten 
nothing out of the guy.

75
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,310
They need us to break him.

76
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,330
We do know from past intercepts 
that he's a recruiter.

77
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,650
He came into this country 
to assemble the omega cell,

78
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,500
a sleeper cell with 
an unknown mission.

79
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,980
We have 48 hours to do what the cia 
hasn't been able to manage in 2 months.

80
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,410
We could be looking at the first 
attack on our soil since 9/11.

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,470
Hey. Car here? I told 
reid 5 minutes.

85
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,400
I think you should take 
prentiss with you to guantanamo.

86
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,050
Excuse me? 
She could be of help.

87
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,120
I don't know enough 
about her abilities.

88
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,490
There's plenty for 
her to do back here.

89
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,340
I don't know what she's capable of either,
but we've got to find out sooner or later.

90
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,450
Well,it's an interrogation,
not a training exercise.

91
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,660
She's the only member of 
the team fluent in arabic.

92
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,770
Well,there are other translators.

93
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,320
Yeah,but they haven't 
studied behavior.

94
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,060
She ever have her ready bag yet?

95
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,390
My guess is there isn't much 
this woman's unprepared for.

96
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,620
Car leaves in 4 minutes.

97
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,050
Yes,sir.

98
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,870
The old term used,

99
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,230
some of the best lessons are 
learned from past mistakes.

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
The error of the past is 
the wisdom of the future.

101
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,200
Excuse me,sir.

102
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,530
I just wanted to let you 
know how much I appreciate--

103
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,440
do not thank me.

104
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,610
- Sir?  
- It's not a favor.

105
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,780
Of course. I know that.

106
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,110
You're coming to do a job.

107
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,680
Do you think the interrogation 
of jind allah will work in time?

108
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,540
Interrogation's the most 
dynamic form of profiling.

109
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,060
That's not an answer.

110
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,290
Sir.

111
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,490
He's been locked away in gtmo.

112
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,260
He doesn't know we raided 
the cell's safe house.

113
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,850
That's an advantage for us.

114
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,650
The main thing is to get 
him talking about anything.

115
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,040
Then his language and body 
movements will betray him.

116
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,060
It's like this-- you just focus on 
the way your opponent holds his piece.

117
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,550
How quickly and firmly he places it. 
Then you watch his face and body.

118
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,060
It'll telegraph a player's 
strategy,his training,

119
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,440
maybe his motivations.

120
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,960
Is that what you need us to do?

121
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,010
No. I need you to listen.

122
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,570
You're fluent in arabic.

123
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,620
I won't know the 
nuances like you.

124
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,640
Every word,every phrase.

125
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,140
Be on the lookout for 
subtext,ulterior meanings.

126
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,740
What do you want me to do?

127
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,960
I want you to watch for tells.

128
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,270
Non-verbals,micro-expressions.

129
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,370
Watch him when he's 
comfortable and relaxed,

130
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,300
then note the behavioral changes 
when he's under stress.

131
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,220
If we can establish a baseline,we'll be able 
to read him once I challenge his belief systems.

132
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,310
Before I can get him to give 
up where or how they'll attack,

133
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,640
I'll first have to cause him 
to reveal something of himself.

134
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:36,920
Game oveR.

135
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,020
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,940
Gtmo's runway is perpendicular 
to cuban airspace,

137
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:55,160
so approaching aircraft have to negotiate a last 
minute 90 degree right turn in order to land.

138
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,740
They call it the gtmo twist.

139
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,690
I was winning.

140
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,160
Actually,he would 
have had you in 3.

141
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,980
- Bonnie ryan.  
- Aaron hotchner.

142
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,800
Dea team. We ran this raid.

143
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,210
Derek morgan.

144
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,200
This must have slowed 
you down some,huh?

145
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,610
Enough for them to get 
out through the tunnel.

146
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,750
They must have done escape drills.

147
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,210
Hey,morgan.

148
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,920
Hey,kenny. Been a minute,man.

149
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,110
Yeah.

150
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,700
- We good in here?   
- Yeah,

151
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,020
don't worry about it. 
Everything's been rendered safe.

152
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,560
These guys weren't 
messing around.

153
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,620
Hotch,these tubes surround what 
would be the explosive charge.

154
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,670
And this cylinder right here?

155
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,680
It's gotta be where they put whatever 
bio or chem agent they plan on dispersing.

156
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,000
That's happy thought.

157
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,900
Yeah. Tell me about it.

158
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,580
Looks like a 4 man cell.

159
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,990
They assimilated 
into the community.

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,260
Just like any other suburban gangster 
wannabes rolling at the mall.

161
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,770
Who do you think we're dealing with?

162
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,690
Most likely middle eastern males 
in their early twenties.

163
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,690
And judging by that device out there,
they're looking at significant targets:

164
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,390
Military installations,
government buildings.

165
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,060
You must be the bau boys.

166
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,170
And gal. Pardon me.

167
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,760
- I'm jason gideon.  
- Andy bingaman,fbi.

168
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,540
Agent prentiss,dr. Reid.

169
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,730
I'm the intelligence 
supervisor here at gtmo.

170
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,890
You guys having a hard time 
getting jind allah to talk?

171
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,540
Not only can't they get him 
to budge,but 2 weeks ago,

172
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,660
word got out that one of the other 
detainees was spilling secrets.

173
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,040
Jind allah managed to have a 3 minute 
conversation with him in the shower line.

174
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,120
That night,the other 
detainee committed suicide.

175
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,750
He's reciting the 
qu'ran from memory.

176
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,390
He's most likely a hafez.

177
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,930
He must have done it a dozen times 
since he's come to this facility.

178
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,280
Some muslim children are 
able to do it since age 12.

179
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,960
2 months of interrogation,that's all the 
cia's been able to get out of him.

180
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,860
There are cuts and bruises 
under his right eye socket.

181
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,500
What kind of tactics are they using?

182
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,430
I control the actions 
to the detainees,

183
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,480
but I can assure you,my protest 
about their methods has been ignored.

184
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,860
Let the interrogation 
proceed normally.

185
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,470
I'm gonna interrupt and 
demand they stop harassing.

186
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,910
Maybe I should tell 
them in advance.

187
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,610
No,it's better if 
they don't expect it.

188
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,690
The reaction will be more 
visceral,more believable.

189
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,430
- Go ahead with phase 2 as planned.  
- Got you

190
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,790
You really gonna put a 
show on for these guys?

191
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,760
No,no for them.

192
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,890
For jind allah.

193
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,580
He's needs to see me as a complete contrast 
to what he's come to expect from his captors.

194
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,130
It's the best way to jump 
start him into talking.

195
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,280
We have less than 36 hours.

196
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,930
Have at it.

197
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,100
You 2 ready?

198
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,470
- Yeah,this way.  
- Thank you.

199
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,110
Do you understand?

200
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,740
Every day--

201
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,550
who the hell are you?

202
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,910
Supervisory special 
agent jason gideon.

203
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,850
I'm an fbi behavioral analyst.

204
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,170
It's time to show this 
man some respect.

205
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,810
You gotta be kidding me.

206
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,130
You have orders from 
agent bingaman to leave

207
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,650
so I can speak with 
this detainee alone.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,570
I'm sorry for the 
treatmentyou've suffered.

209
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,060
If you don't mind,I'd like to 
spend some time with you.

210
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,130
He stopped his recitation.

211
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,540
He's sizing gideon up.

212
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,720
If I don't mind?

213
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,730
Like to get to know you as a person.

214
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,640
Your faith,your ideology.

215
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,970
To what end?

216
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,540
Studying human 
behavior is what I do.

217
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,520
You know,if these guys 
are fundamentalists,

218
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,750
you'd think they'd have 
qu'rans,prayer mats.

219
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,800
No. We didn't find 
any of that here.

220
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,650
They must have at least 
one other location.

221
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,910
Ryan,

222
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,650
hotch.  what is it ?

223
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,010
That looks like a 
list of chemicals.

224
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,100
I'm gonna check with garcia.

225
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,300
Go,doll.

226
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,050
Hey,I'm gonna read off a 
list to you. it's criminals

227
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,920
I'd like to believe,with 
greater understanding one day,

228
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,390
we can come to a peaceful 
resolution of our differences.

229
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,060
Is that so?

230
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,950
Look,I don't know what you've done 
or what you may have planned to do.

231
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,950
But unlike the other detainees here,

232
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,260
you have the education,intelligence
to convey the nuances of your culture.

233
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,180
That's what interests me.

234
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,020
Until I don't give you what you want.

235
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,080
Then you will resort to other tactics.

236
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,340
I swore an oath to uphold 
the united states constitution,

237
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,110
no matter where I am,no 
matter who I deal with.

238
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,620
You're sure?

239
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,510
All right.

240
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,670
What'd she say?

241
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Garcia says this looks like a list of 
additives needed to weaponize anthrax.

242
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,510
could they get enough anthrax?

243
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,990
The letter sent to senator tom daschle's office 
in 2002 only contained 2 grams of purified spores,

244
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,670
enough to kill 25 million people 
if effectively distributed.

245
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,820
Are you willing to have a chat with me?

246
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,380
Go ahead. Good.

247
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,400
Let's chat.

248
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,710
He's from egypt. Cairo.

249
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,550
You sure?

250
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,730
No,he could be yemeni,but 
odds are he's egyptian.

251
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,930
What type of name is gideon?

252
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,160
American.

253
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,640
I often forget that in your country you 
put your country first and your god last.

254
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,660
Sir,he was born and raised in egypt.

255
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,960
They pronouce "j" sounds as a "G."

256
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,850
You don't consider yourself 
egyptian as well as muslim?

257
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,080
Egyptian.

258
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:05,430
In 2 minutes,you know more about me 
than those thugs found out in 2 months.

259
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,760
They and I have very,very different 
motives and methodologies.

260
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:17,110
And yet your country relies 
on them to protect you from us.

261
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,110
Sometimes they're 
their own worst enemy.

262
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,720
Yeah. Who is your worst 
enemy,agent gideon?

263
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,790
It's not a who.

264
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,480
It's a what.

265
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,110
Ignorance.

266
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,880
You're a very honest man.

267
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,750
And you?

268
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,450
Must have become a hafez by what,age 10?

269
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,530
9.

270
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:45,010
Any person with the discipline and dedication 
to memorize the entire qu'ran by age 9

271
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,660
must have a very serious reason 
to choose a life of violence.

272
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,570
Perhaps.

273
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,880
We are through already?

274
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,880
No,not at all.

275
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,670
The sun is about to set.

276
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,710
Mecca's in that direction.

277
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,940
I'll have a prayer rug 
and water bowl sent in.

278
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,000
What the heck is going on here?

279
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,470
The nsa is routing all messages 
to us for language analysis.

280
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,090
You know,rumor has it,much to my chagrin,
that during national security emergencies,

281
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:28,570
our fair country turns all of its satellites homeward 
and records all electronic traffic in the whole U.S.A

282
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,180
Is this even legal?

283
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,320
Yeah,I don't really want to 
think about that right now.

284
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,040
Somewhere in this slew of chatter could be a shred 
of something that could save a whole lot of lives.

285
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,830
All right,well,cross reference 
gift with wedding allusions.

286
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,720
They'll be consistent with their code.

287
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,070
Here's something.

288
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,820
It rained all over the wedding,but 
the gift is waiting in the barn.

289
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,950
When was that call made?

290
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,770
Looks like just 
over 2 hours ago.

291
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,590
Let's run the words 
"barn and "wedding" through.

292
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,050
The wedding will now be held at 
vincent's barn off link and annandale.

293
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,490
Route the gift for delivery.

294
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,650
That's not a gift I wanna get.

295
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,650
I'll call hotch.

296
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,730
Yeah,jj.

297
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,750
We think we just found the 
cell's backup location.

298
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,440
It looks like a construction 
site in annandale,virginia.

299
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,550
Sounds like they may have 
another device ready to arm.

300
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,650
I'll get agent ryan to organize another 
raid. And notify gideon and reid.

301
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,030
Ok.

302
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,980
Can I offer you some water?

303
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,640
I offer you some first.

304
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,080
They only kept it there to 
show me what I could not have.

305
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,380
I'd like you to explain something to me.

306
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,660
How can you ignore the fact

307
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,450
that muhammad preached 
passivitywhile he was in mecca?

308
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,300
Do no violence.

309
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,710
His later message from 
medina was perfectly clear.

310
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,710
When violence come upon you,

311
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,150
you must fight back with violence.

312
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,920
He's quoting from the 
hadith,not from the qu'ran.

313
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,360
It's called the verse of the sword.

314
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,680
They argue that it cancels 
out earlier teachings.

315
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,280
Verse of the sword.

316
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,830
Just someone's spin on 
the words of the prophet.

317
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,490
It's not even part of the qu'ran.

318
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:24,980
But it does say in the qu'ran fight and 
slay the infidels wherever you find them

319
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,270
and seize them in every stratagem of war.

320
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,090
Unless they repent.

321
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,050
Establish regular prayers 
and practice regular charity.

322
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,600
Is it your intention,mr. Gideon,

323
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,900
to become a man of faith 
and revert to islam?

324
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,010
I am a man of faith.

325
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,210
I have repented,I pray regularly,

326
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,420
and I practice charity.

327
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,680
I have never committed 
violence against you,

328
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,350
so how is it that my faith would allow 
you to live and worship as you please,

329
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,440
and yours would take my 
life and snuff it out?

330
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,090
You are simply misguided 
people of the book.

331
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,770
- But if you revert to islam...   
- a billion muslims...

332
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:15,440
one billion muslims manage to 
practice their faith in peace...

333
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,660
for allah is surely merciful.

334
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,860
You...

335
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,440
inquired about my childhood earlier.

336
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,360
I will tell you...

337
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:42,210
that it was a happy one until 
one day a bomb fell out of the sky

338
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:48,120
and leveled the bazaar that 
I was in with my family.

339
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,630
I was only 8.

340
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,870
Must have been horrifying 
for such a young boy.

341
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,050
He's opening 
up about himself.

342
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,480
Maybe.

343
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,780
We need to verify 
what he's saying,though.

344
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,610
Speak.

345
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,270
Garcia,I need you to 
check something for me.

346
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,350
I'm looking for a stray bombing in a bazaar 
somewhere in egypt approximately 30 years ago.

347
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,780
Ok,greaT. That's not too obscure.

348
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,110
I don't need you to give me details.

349
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,750
We're just trying to set a baseline 
for jind allah's truthfulness.

350
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,510
I just need to know if 
it happened at all.

351
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,900
- When I know,you'll know.  
- Thank you.

352
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,140
When the rubble was cleared...

353
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,740
half...

354
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,460
of my family was dead.

355
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:37,520
It was on that day that I swore 
my life to vengeance for allah.

356
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:45,800
And for that very reason those holding 
you here can never let you leave.

357
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:54,920
Your only hope is to tell me so I can hopefully
one day share your struggle with the world.

358
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:01,520
Your government won't 
even admit that I exist.

359
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:08,650
How possibly can you tell 
my side of the story?

360
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,550
Hey,guys,we want silence. 
No conversation.

361
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,320
Let's be careful. We don't 
know what to expect.

362
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,860
- Ready?   
- Ready. Let's do it.

363
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,830
Clear!

364
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,710
This place is completely empty. 
We missed them again.

365
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,730
You got gideon,prentiss,and me.

366
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,540
It's hotch. We're at 
cell location number 2.

367
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,870
No cell members,no lab,no dispersal devices.

368
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,550
We're still looking for escape tunnels.

369
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,950
Call us.

370
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,950
We're running out of time. The attack's 
supposed to take place in less than 24 hours.

371
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,770
So getting jind allah to talk is
our only chance of finding them.

372
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,660
Time I confronted him with the truth.

373
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,670
What are you going to do?

374
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,330
Show him my hand.

375
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,430
I'm going to give you the respect 
of telling you what just happened.

376
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,180
A team of agents raided 
an omega cell location.

377
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,940
Actually,both of them.

378
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,920
Our men are in place in 
annandale as we speak.

379
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,610
You gain nothing by remaining silent.

380
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,660
Jihad is forever.

381
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,910
Something's wrong.

382
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,470
His hands.

383
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,130
Gideon,something's wrong.

384
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,360
This guy seemed relieved 
by what you just told him.

385
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,590
Excuse me.

386
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,760
- What's the problem?  
- Get everybody out of there.

387
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,370
Now! Now! Now!

388
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,230
Everybody out.

389
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,870
It's a trap. Now!

390
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,980
I said out! Go!

391
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,280
How did a terror cell get its hands on anthrax 
without a single lab reporting a security breach?

392
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,170
Would we know if a foreign lab had a breach?

393
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,720
A foreign lab? Actually,no.

394
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,450
Garcia,isn't annandale where 
morgan and hotch are?

395
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,440
That's not a gas main explosion.

396
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,220
Please pick up.

397
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,000
Please pick up. Please pick up.

398
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,470
Yeah,it's morgan.

399
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,320
Hello? Garcia,can you hear me?

400
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,320
We saw the explosion on tv.

401
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,700
Yeah,I know. We lost a swat agent.

402
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,040
Oh,god.

403
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,370
Don't worry. Don't think you're 
gonna get rid of me that easy.

404
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,270
Do you need anything?

405
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,190
I know who to call if I 
do. Thanks,baby doll.

406
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,730
That's ok.

407
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,290
Is he all right?

408
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,010
Yeah.

409
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,820
We lost a swat agent.

410
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,490
Son of a bitch.

411
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,220
Sorry about that.

412
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,580
Yeah,me,too.

413
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,020
The chatter was a set-up. 
They knew we'd be listening.

414
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,710
They led us straight here.

415
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,240
Just tell me you know 
where to look next.

416
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,350
Not yet.

417
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,510
They ok?

418
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,320
We were right about the trap.

419
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,170
It was rigged to explode.

420
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,570
A swat agent was killed.

421
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,120
- Was anthrax involved?   
- No.

422
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,460
Then that's not the final target.

423
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,730
You look troubled,my friend.

424
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,510
You killed one of my men.

425
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,980
I was here with you.

426
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,560
The second location was a trap.

427
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,390
One of my agents was 
killed in the explosion.

428
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,260
This is war.

429
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,310
We expect casualties.

430
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,170
Shouldn't you?

431
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,490
He was a good man.

432
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,000
Well... if he would convert,

433
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,380
there would be no reason 
for him to fear death.

434
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,800
What do you say to his family?

435
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,360
I say...

436
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,790
where... were you to mourn...

437
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,080
when my son was murdered?

438
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,660
His son?

439
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,070
Did you see that?

440
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,680
When he told the story 
about his childhood,

441
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,280
the bomb landing in the 
bazaar,his behavior changed.

442
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,530
We know he was lying.

443
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,000
Garcia couldn't find any record of a 
bombing during the time jind allah was a boy.

444
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,890
Exactly,but this time when he mentioned 
his son,he looked at his hands,

445
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,830
like he had to concentrate 
to control his anger.

446
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,370
That first story wasn't about him.

447
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,130
It was about his son.

448
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,540
Which means it must 
have been more recent.

449
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,530
Garcia.

450
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,450
I need you to look for a 
bombing again in egypt,

451
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,580
but this time anything 
in the last 10 years.

452
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,290
On it.

453
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,970
We're looking for civilian 
casualties,an 8-year-old boy.

454
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,060
Ok. I'm cross referencing 
bombings and child victims.

455
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,560
7 years ago,in the heart of cairo,

456
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,860
egyptian government 
blamed hezbollah,

457
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,120
but conspiracy theories on the 
street claimed it was a joint U.S

458
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,580
Israli strike that went astray.

459
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,460
Your gross detainee's 
name is jamal abaza.

460
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,140
How about his son's name? 
Do you have that?

461
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,450
Amir abaza. 8. Killed in the blast.

462
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,280
All right. Find out everything you 
can on that. I'll get back to you soon.

463
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,920
We know his real identity.

464
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:16,470
It appears that there will be no peaceful 
resolution to our difficulties after all.

465
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,460
I haven't given up that hope.

466
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,520
It's time for your 
salut-ul-isha prayers.

467
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,180
May we speak again tomorrow?

468
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,600
You are asking me?

469
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,170
Yes.

470
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,300
Tomorrow,then.

471
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,390
Jamal abaza's been in 
the U.S. For a while.

472
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,060
He volunteered as the prison imam at the 
dearfield correctional center 3 years ago.

473
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,800
How could the cia not know that?

474
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,810
They're focused overseas. 
We're domestic.

475
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,430
Yeah. They probably sent a request 
for a domestic information search,

476
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,370
and it's somewhere making 
its way through channels.

477
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,480
If he was a prison imam,he must have 
recruited militant islamic society members.

478
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,140
M.I.S. Is an atypical 
prison organization.

479
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,620
They pick up an amalgam 
of ethnicities.

480
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,810
The qu'ran says that my lord...

481
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,830
those that slip through the cracks are 
the ones that traditional groups won't accept.

482
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,740
Outside these walls,you 
need to understand...

483
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,560
it's made up largely of 
american citizens.

484
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:26,120
American citizens with a reason 
for hating the government.

485
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,560
We're looking at 
home grown terrorists.

486
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,420
What the hell do you want?

487
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,710
The name jamal abaza. Does 
it mean anything to you?

488
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,500
Abaza was an imam in cairo.

489
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,100
He preached jihad to his followers,

490
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,390
but he fell off the grid 7 years ago.

491
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,560
That's because when his son died,
he took the jihad name jind allah.

492
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,320
He came to america to 
recruit sleeper cells.

493
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,470
You're telling us that that 
detainee in there is jamal abaza?

494
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,260
Amazing what you learn
when you talk to people.

495
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,740
He was also a prison imam 
in virginia 3 years ago.

496
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,180
Are you familiar with the 
militant islamic society?

497
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,200
They're home grown?

498
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,070
We know the cell that abaza put 
together has access to anthrax,

499
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,480
but we can't find any reports of 
any going missing in the states.

500
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,340
We have protocols that 
we have to follow.

501
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,360
You really going to allow 
a terrorist attack on U.S.

502
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,310
Soil because of protocols?

503
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,460
I told you what I learned in 
there because you and I,fbi,cia,

504
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:26,190
right now we have the ability to break 
through all the protocol and share information.

505
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,340
Let me see what we have.

506
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,190
Coordinate with agent jareau 
and penelope garcia at quantico.

507
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,850
Please.

508
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,220
Think it'll work?

509
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,370
I don't know.

510
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,370
Cia's tough. They play it 
pretty close to the vest.

511
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,050
Well,if we don't all work 
together,more people are gonna die.

512
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,910
A lot more.

513
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,660
How goes it with the cia?

514
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,210
I don't know what 
gideon said to them,

515
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,420
but they are feeding me 
information like crazy.

516
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,850
- They sure do generate intelligence.  
- Yeah.

517
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,180
Hopefully not too 
much to interpret.

518
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,390
Slept well?

519
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,540
For the first time 
since I've been here.

520
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,820
Good.

521
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,880
Until yesterday,

522
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,900
I was not permitted 
regular prayer.

523
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,270
We receive comfort 
from our prayers.

524
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,520
- We?  
- Human beings.

525
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,400
I say something wrong?

526
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,790
You placed us on the same level.

527
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,400
Aren't we?

528
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,690
Well,here I am thought 
of as less than human.

529
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,980
And in your jihad,I am.

530
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,010
Gideon...

531
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,990
what do you really want from me?

532
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,210
I already told you.

533
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,400
I want to understand you.

534
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,700
And if that is not possible?

535
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,650
Then that would be my loss.

536
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,950
It's almost time for your midday 
prayers. May I return later?

537
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,170
- I look forward to it.  
- Thank you.

538
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,250
Most of these tips are so new they 
haven't even been authenticated yet.

539
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:16,670
Yeah,but there's nothing in the established 
information that's remotely helpful.

540
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,740
Wait a minute. Anthrax.

541
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,820
- What?  
- Genimmune.

542
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,700
A dutch biotech firm reported that they may have 
had a security breach involving anthrax last week.

543
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,640
May have?

544
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,060
They're still doing a 
security and inventory sweep,

545
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:33,730
but they may be missing up to 
20 grams of lab grade anthrax.

546
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,310
20 grams.

547
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,010
Could potentially kill a 
quarter billion people.

548
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,430
He seems much calmer 
than he was yesterday.

549
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,680
May make any reading of his 
body language less accurate.

550
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,140
I know.

551
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,390
Is that what we want?

552
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,750
I hope so.

553
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:56,980
Well,isn't that the exact opposite of--

554
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,950
he hopes so?

555
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,030
We have less than 10 hours before 
the new crescent moon rises.

556
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,210
9.

557
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,940
Aren't you worried?

558
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,940
I've been with him long 
enough to trust him.

559
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,910
Cia is funneling you their 
dutch terror watch list.

560
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,930
Ok,I can cross reference that with any port of 
entry information we have as well as customs

561
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,140
and immigration enforcement.

562
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,590
You know,it would sure be a lot easier if there 
was a centralization of all this information.

563
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,110
Oh,dream on,J.

564
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,810
No one wants the other kids 
peeing in their sand box.

565
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,120
Tariq muhammad. Dutch 
citizen,islamic convert.

566
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,960
Traveled here 4 days ago 
under his original name.

567
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,550
Andre janssen.

568
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,180
And we have the address he 
listed on his customs form.

569
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,580
Thank you.

570
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,780
- We just got a lead.  
- Got a name?

571
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,340
And an address.

572
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,810
How does a terrorist cell 
exist right here in mayberry?

573
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,850
Infrared scanning still 
shows no one inside.

574
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,120
We're doing a soft entry in 
case it's booby trapped.

575
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,830
Sir,get in here!

576
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,510
We have 5 deceased males and 
what looks to be a crude lab,

577
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,770
all shot in the 
head execution style.

578
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,100
Any anthrax on the scene?

579
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,270
Only residue.

580
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,490
There's also packing and 
tags from 4 new backpacks.

581
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,540
All right,listen up.

582
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,520
- Backpacks?  
- They're already on the move. We're too late.

583
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,320
have you finished?

584
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,240
As you said,the sun is set.

585
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,400
Yes.

586
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,050
I'd like you to meet a 
colleague of mine. Dr.Reid.

587
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,030
- May we speak?  
- Of course.

588
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,930
I have a little time.

589
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,290
That was a joke.

590
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,260
I have all the time. Please.

591
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,950
A joke.

592
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,730
Well,we're making progress.

593
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,890
Yes,progress. That is true.

594
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,380
Is there no way for this 
thing to end? This jihad?

595
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:34,270
The jihad will end when 
allah wills its end.

596
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,120
Then how will you know 
that it is allah's will?

597
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,160
When the jihad ends.

598
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,920
I have been lying to you.

599
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,310
Of course you have.

600
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,530
My colleague has been outside 
watching us as we talked on monitors.

601
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,550
Watching your body language,
trying to figure you out.

602
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,290
Were you successful?

603
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,340
Somewhat.

604
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,060
Your name is jamal abaza.

605
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:02,780
Your son amir was killed in 2003 in the 
bombing at the mahfouz bazaar in cairo.

606
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,540
Since then,you've been recruiting M.I.S
Members in prison by convincing them

607
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,560
that U.S. Economic policies 
are exploiting third word nations

608
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,760
and turned them into extreme fundamentalists 
by promising a better existence with allah.

609
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,860
I would say that you were
more than somewhat successful.

610
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,770
But I did not learn

611
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,920
where your M.I.S. Cell was going 
to make an anthrax attack in the U.S.

612
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,920
At the new crescent tonight.

613
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,910
I have no knowledge 
of such a thing.

614
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,980
Yes,you do,mr.Abaza.

615
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,650
And there is still time.

616
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,740
What?

617
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,130
Are you sure?

618
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,290
something has happened?

619
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,650
How could you?

620
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,740
You choose to contort islam into 
an excuse for a life of violence.

621
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:28,950
You have perverted your 
faith to justify murder.

622
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,270
Now we are finally 
chatting,gideon.

623
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,670
You accuse americans of being 
puppeteers of the third world,

624
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:42,370
yet you used your own people's faith 
tonight to make them dance for you.

625
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,640
Why?

626
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:50,210
Why is it always those who profess to 
be the most fervent believers in this war,

627
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,430
they always manipulate other 
people to die for them.

628
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,040
Does your president 
go to battle?

629
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,930
Or does he send your children?

630
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,920
Tonight...

631
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,860
all those innocent people.

632
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,480
There is no such thing,
gideon. They were infidels.

633
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:14,610
And they were engaged in activities that 
spread american policies over the entire world.

634
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,140
Your incessant need to own things,

635
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,430
material things.

636
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:24,690
Your capitalism rests on the 
back of third world countries.

637
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,650
No one's hands are clean.

638
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,460
No one is innocent.

639
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,440
Those people tonight,
they were innocent.

640
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,230
They never hurt you.

641
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,240
They hurt me by existing.

642
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:42,820
Yes,the infidels shall fall 
at the hands of the righteous.

643
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,240
And that is when the 
jihad will end.

644
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:52,110
So you are ready to 
murder 4 billion people.

645
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,170
America has learned 
nothing from the past.

646
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,260
You harden targets 
like your power plants,

647
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,360
but you leave the soft 
root for our taking.

648
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,770
What has happened tonight will 
affect your economy for years,

649
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,520
the way september 11th 
affected air travel.

650
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:15,290
And maybe the next time a 
giant shopping center opens,

651
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,830
people will think 
twice before going.

652
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,260
And maybe next it 
will be a school.Hey!

653
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,790
You can shut the video 
feed down now,garcia.

654
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,960
Has the sun not set yet?

655
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,470
No.

656
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,140
No...

657
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,670
A shopping center.A mall.

658
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,270
It's a grand opening tonight 
not long after sunset.

659
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,830
That gives you about an hour.

660
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,100
God help us if they don't make iT.

661
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,750
Let's just hope we 
have somewhere to go.

662
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,780
Grand opening of the 
usa mall today.

663
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,280
It's the third largest in the country,and it's 
right smack in the middle of mclean,virginia.

664
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,470
Let's move.

665
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,040
What's going on with you?

666
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,540
You look like you've 
seen a ghost back there.

667
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,580
Haley's supposed to take jack to the 
new mall to have his portrait taken.

668
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,710
Well,go ahead and call her.

669
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,090
It's a breach of security.

670
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,640
You lose haley and jack,
screw this job.

671
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,450
You won't have a life.

672
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,700
I can't reach her.

673
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,570
Morgan,I'm going to find 
the security office.

674
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,820
Morgan!

675
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,360
Looks like loading 
dock security.

676
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,780
- Should we evacuate?   
- No,no.

677
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,500
We'd have mass panic.Let's go.

678
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,750
Hello!

679
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,620
- Fbi.   
- Fbi?

680
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,990
Are these all your security cameras?

681
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,200
Yes,sir.

682
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,620
What's this camera here?

683
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,000
That's the roof. East end.

684
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,410
Morgan,I've got 4 guys on 
the east end of the roof.

685
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,750
What's on that 
side of the roof?

686
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,450
Nothing.

687
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,800
No access doors to the mall?

688
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,530
Not unless you go 
through the air vents.

689
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,440
Morgan,it's the air vents.

690
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,540
They're going for the air vents.

691
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,160
Don't move!

692
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,920
Put the devices down and put 
your hands where I can see them!

693
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,520
Gun!

694
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,200
Police tonight foiled an apparent 
robbery attempt at the new usa mall,

695
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,540
which presumably have marred an 
otherwise successful grand opening.

696
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,120
Haley?

697
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,770
Hey,in here.

698
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,630
You're home.

699
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,210
Did you see that there was an 
attempted robbery at the new mall?

700
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,850
I'm glad I cancelled 
jack's photos.

701
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,620
I just decided I 
wanted you to be there.

702
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,180
It's better if we 
do it as a family.

703
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,900
Is everything ok?

704
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,740
Yeah,everything's perfect.

705
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:59,530
Ralph waldo emerson once said in order to 
learn the most important lessons of life,

706
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,220
one must each day surmount a fear.

707
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,340
When did you know you were 
gonna have to trick him?

708
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,850
The first time I talked to him.

709
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,260
You realized you couldn't break him?

710
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:16,540
Well,I realized he was too smart to have had 
that nextel phone registered to him accidentally.

711
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,730
He drew us there.

712
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:22,210
He wanted our presence at gtmo 
to confirm that he was successful.

713
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,440
And that's when you started 
moving up the time of his prayers.

714
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,480
If I'd used an actual clock,
he might have caught on.

715
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,130
So it was all a chess game.

716
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,220
We won this round...

717
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,780
but you heard him.

718
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,330
Jihad never ends.

719
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,590
Mate.

720
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,560
I quit.

721
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,000
Yield.Surrender.

722
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,370
Capitulate.I'm 
gonna take a nap.

723
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,270
Prentiss.

724
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,230
Sir?

725
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,720
You play?

726
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,030
Yes,sir. I play.
