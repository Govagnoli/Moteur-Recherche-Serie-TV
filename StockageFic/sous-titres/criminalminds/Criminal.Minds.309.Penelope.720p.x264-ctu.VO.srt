1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,700
<i>Previously, on criminal minds...</i>

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,200
- I met a guy.
- Where?

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,100
Coffee shop.
I fixed his computer.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,200
Maybe i could
take you to lunch.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,800
Can you believe that?
A complete stranger.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,700
It happens.

7
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,300
Not to me.
Not like this.

8
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,600
I think you should
always trust your gut.

9
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,800
Maybe you should
walk the other way.

10
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,000
I was wondering
if you'd let me

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,700
Make that thank-You
lunch a dinner

12
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,200
I'm asking you out,
garcia.

13
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,200
Hey, garcia.

14
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,300
I've been thinking about
doing this all night.

15
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,800
I was inside.
I heard the shot, but i didn see anything.

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,500
Gsw, chest through abdomen.

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,800
???
Airways paten,
good breath sounds.

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,700
Get a backboard
and a c-Collar.

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,100
- Is she gonna make it?
- Ma'am.

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Can you hear me?

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,000
Hi. Hello.
Can you tell me your name?

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
???
60 and dropping.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Her name is penelope.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,900
Ma'am, please.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Thank you.

26
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,300
Everything's gonna be fine.

27
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,700
Ma'am, did you
hear anything?

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,600
It sounded like a--
A broom handle snapping in two.

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,700
I didn't even realize it was a gunshot
at first.

30
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,500
Stay with us.
Stay with us.

31
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,800
Can you hear me?
Can you hear my voice?

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,600
On 3--1, 2, 3.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,900
There we go.

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,700
There you are.
Everything's great.

35
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,400
Yeah.

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,700
Can you tell me your name?

37
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,100
Penelope garcia.

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,800
Let's get her in, guys.
Go, go, go.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,800
I think she works
for the fbi.

40
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,000
Penelope, everything's
gonna be fine.

41
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Great. You're doing so good.
Hang in there.

42
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,500
Step.

43
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,100
Stay with me.

44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
- Stay with me, penelope.
- Curb.

45
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,500
That's it, penelope.
You're doing great.

46
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,600
Stay with us.

47
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,100
What, you trying to make me
look bad by staying here
later than me?

48
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,000
J.J.

49
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,600
Sats are dropping--82.

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,000
Come on,
wake up and breathe.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,800
She's hypoventilating.
Hand me the bag.

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,500
Come on.

53
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,400
Come on, penelope, stay with us.

54
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,000
30-Year-Old, single gsw,
chest to abdomen.

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,100
Pulse?

56
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,500
Tachy in the 140s.

57
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,100
Dropped her systolic
to 78.

58
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,300
Intubate, and red-Line
to the o.R. Now.

59
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,000
Hang in there, penelope.
Hang in there.

60
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,900
Come on.

61
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,900
Go, go, go, go.

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,700
She's in surgery.

63
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
There's no word.

64
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,100
This is crazy.

65
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,900
- On the i-Pack.
- Yes, doctor.

66
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,600
- Clamp.
- Field's too bloody.

67
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,700
I need suction.

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
Can't find the source.

69
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,800
Turn up the suction.

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,700
Here we go.

71
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,400
What do we know?

72
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,100
Police think it was
a botched robbery.

73
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,100
Where's morgan?

74
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,500
He's not answering his cell.

75
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,600
I'll call him again.

76
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,700
What aren't you saying?

77
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,900
I spoke to one of
the paramedics who brought her in.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It doesn't look good.

79
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,100
She's in v-Tach.

80
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,900
Charge to 360 and clear.

81
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,400
Wait. We gotta find
the bleeder.

82
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,500
- She'll go into v-Fib.
- We have to find the bleeder.

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,400
They can't give me
an update.

84
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,000
Morgan's phone just keeps going
straight to voicemail.

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
Where the hell is he?

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
Another 750
out of the chest tube.

87
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,000
How's it getting up there
when she's bleeding down there?

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,300
Pressure's dropping.
67 over 42.

89
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,900
Bullet must have ripped
right through the diaphragm.

90
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,000
And bagged
the splenic artery.

91
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
Put direct pressure.
Right here.

92
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,000
- She's bleeding too quickly.
- More blood.

93
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,600
- We're way behind.
- More pressure.

94
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,300
All right, keep pressure on the artery
while i tie her off.

95
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,300
Ok. Hold on.

96
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,800
???

97
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,300
V-Fib.

98
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
???

99
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Clear.

100
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,000
Clear.

101
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,400
Lidocaine 100 on the bones.

102
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,500
No change.

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Charge.

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
300.

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,900
Clear.

106
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,200
No change.

107
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
- Charge.
- 360.

108
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,400
This isn't working.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,900
Charge.

110
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
Nothing still.

111
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,300

And prolene.

130
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,600
She's been in surgery
a couple hours.

131
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
I was at church.
My phone was off.

132
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,700
There's nothing you could
have been doing here.

133
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,500
The police
got any leads?

134
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,900
I spoke to
the lead detective.

135
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,100
He doesn't think we'll get
anything from the scene.

136
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,800
Penelope garcia?

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

138
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
The bullet went in her chest

139
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,800
And ricocheted
into her abdomen.

140
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,300
She lost a lot of blood.

141
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,400
It was touch-And-Go
for a while,

142
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,100
But we were able
to repair the injuries.

143
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,200
So what are you
saying?

144
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
One centimeter over

145
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,900
And it would have torn
right through her heart.

146
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,300
Instead, she could actually walk out
of here in a couple of days.

147
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,300
And i'd say
that's a minor miracle.

148
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,300
She needs her rest.

149
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,600
You can see her
in the morning.

150
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

151
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,600
David and i
will go to the scene.

152
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
I think the rest of you should be here
when she wakes up.

153
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,400
I don't care about protocol.
I don't care

154
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,900
Whether we're working
this officially or not.

155
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,900
We don't touch any new cases
until we find out who did this.

156
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
Hey, garcia.

157
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,900
Our guess is he saw her enter,
then kicked the door in after her.

158
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,900
He robs her, she tries
to chase him,

159
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,000
Then he turns and shoots her
as he's getting away.

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,900
You have an estimate
on how far away the gunshot was?

161
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,200
Approximately 15 feet.

162
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,500
Any reason besides the door

163
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,900
That you think
it was a robbery?

164
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,300
He took her purse, dumped half of it
before he took off.

165
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,800
Did you find
a shell casing?

166
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,800
So he hit her
square from here?

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,300
Hell of a shot
on the run.

168
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,400
Why does he risk coming in
to an enclosed courtyard

169
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
To steal a purse?

170
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
World's
boldest purse-Snatcher?

171
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,800
It doesn't make sense.

172
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

173
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,200
Good.

174
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,900
We'll be right there.

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
She's up.

176
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,800
Hi.

177
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,300
No tears.

178
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,200
I'm afraid
if i start crying

179
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,900
I'll come unstapled.

180
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,800
How are you feeling?

181
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,100
Oh...

182
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,200
Confused...

183
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,400
Stupid, and...

184
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,700
In pain.

185
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,100
Are you up for
some questions?

186
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
I never saw it coming.

187
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,900
He seemed...

188
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,100
Deliciously normal.

189
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
You know him?

190
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,500
You were right.

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,900
I should have
trusted it.

192
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,500
What are you talking about?

193
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,100
It's that guy
i told you about.

194
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,700
The one i met
at the coffee shop.

195
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,800
I wanted to believe
he was interested in me.

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,700
Forget that.

197
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,400
I let my guard down.

198
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,300
Do you have any idea
why he would have done this?

199
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,700
Did he threaten you?
Did he want something?

200
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,300
I just thought
he liked me.

201
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,000
Ok. Um...
we're gonna--

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,900
We're gonna come back
in a little while.

203
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,200
We need a name.

204
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,700
James colby baylor.

205
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,900
J.J.

206
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,700
Can you stay for a sec?

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
We need to stay calm.

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,400
Don't tell me what to be.

209
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,400
Do you remember anything
she said about him?

210
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,100
No.

211
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,900
I just talked to hotch.

212
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,700
They think he used
a revolver.

213
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,400
Who the hell
uses a revolver?

214
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,200
Somebody who doesn't
want to leave

215
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,400
Shell casings
behind as evidence.

216
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,300
What about witnesses?

217
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
None so far.

218
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,100
And he staged it
to look like a robbery.

219
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,900
Which means
if he's smart enough

220
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,100
To use forensic
countermeasures,

221
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,800
Odds are the name he gave garcia
is probably bogus.

222
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
What did she say?

223
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,200
She made me promise not to talk
about her like a victim.

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,500
So victimology--Why garcia?

225
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,400
Look at her.

226
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
What are you saying?

227
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,300
You don't look like that
by accident.

228
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,700
She wears her individuality
like a shield.

229
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,800
Leading someone
to be antagonistic?

230
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,500
She stands out. Single woman.

231
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,700
Could be someone was
watching her for a while.

232
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,500
The sadist who gets off
on gaining her trust

233
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,900
And then trying to kill her?

234
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,100
Pretty common.
Kemper, bundy, robert anderson--

235
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,500
They all had
an element of it.

236
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,800
What's bugging you?

237
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,000
A sadist who just happens to
choose an analyst for the fbi?

238
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,800
I asked her
to go out last night.

239
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,100
But she was pissed at me.

240
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,100
She blew me off.

241
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,900
So you ended up
in church?

242
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah.

243
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
What does it mean?

244
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,900
On one hand,
if she'd gone out with me,

245
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,500
She would have never got shot.

246
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,600
On the other hand...

247
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,300
What are the odds
that the first time i pray in 20 years,

248
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,500
She's on the table?

249
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,900
She's asking for you.

250
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,700
Hey.

251
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,500
How are you feeling?

252
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,700
Good news, bad news.

253
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,700
The morphine's wearing off.

254
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,900
When i was in the ambulance,

255
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,500
<i>I could hear
the song heroes</i>

256
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
Playing in my head.

257
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,100
I kept flashing in and out
of consciousness.

258
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,000
Everything
was really bright.

259
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,900
And i remember thinking,

260
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,800
Wait...

261
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,100
Is david bowie really god?

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,200
We have a, uh...

263
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,900
We have a sketch artist
coming in.

264
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm still a little hazy.

265
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,100
It's ok.

266
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,400
Anything you tell us
will help.

267
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,700
Yeah.

268
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,500
This guy say what he did
for a living?

269
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,300
He said he was a lawyer.

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,100
Did...did people know him
where you went?

271
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,700
He said he wanted
to show me a place.

272
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,900
It was half an hour away.

273
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,700
You drove together?

274
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,800
What kind of car?

275
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
White.

276
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,000
4-Door sedan.

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,300
American.

278
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,600
It smelled new.

279
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,400
Rental car maybe?

280
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,000
Maybe.

281
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't know.

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,900
I don't look at things
like you guys do.

283
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't see danger--

284
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Ok. Take it easy.

285
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,300
Take it easy.

286
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,500
<i>What else can you remember?</i>

287
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,900
He smelled good.

288
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,100
Good night.

289
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,600
Good night.

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,100
He seem nervous?

291
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,200
I thought he was just afraid
to kiss me good night.

292
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Hey.

293
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,400
You sure
you're up for this?

294
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,500
Hey, garcia.

295
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,200
Yeah.

296
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,300
I've been thinking
about doing this all night.

297
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,100
I could hear him walking.

298
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
He leaned over me
and i held my breath

299
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,200
So he'd think
i was dead.

300
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,000
What happened here?

301
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,500
A shooting.

302
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,000
It was horrible.

303
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,600
She's in intensive care.

304
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,800
She survived?

305
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,100
I have no idea how.

306
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,300
Miracles of science, right?

307
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,400
Yeah.

308
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,300
They get the guy?

309
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,200
No clue at all?

310
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,800
Probably some crackhead.

311
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
It's crazy.

312
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,700
Police around here
can't even keep you safe.

313
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,900
This whole city's going to hell.

314
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,900
You look like crap.

315
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,200
Well, 4 days, no leads,
i feel like crap.

316
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,200
Any word
from the hospital?

317
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
She's out of the icu.

318
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,300
Doctor said she could go home
in a couple of days.

319
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,900
Reid and morgan
are replaying it with her

320
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,400
And they'll
keep us posted.

321
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,800
We can always round up
the 3 million guys

322
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,100
The sketch looks like.

323
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
That was the police.

324
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,000
They took the sketch
back to the coffee shop,

325
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,900
Restaurant,
came up empty.

326
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,500
I even ran it
through vicap.

327
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,400
No hits.

328
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,000
No luck with
the rental car companies.

329
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,200
No prints at the scene.
No shell casings.

330
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,300
The cell phone the guy used
to call garcia at work

331
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,400
Was a disposable.

332
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,100
The guy's a cipher.

333
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,700
Hypervigilance, right?

334
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Something like that.

335
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,200
You know, most people
these days are looking

336
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
- For a semi-Automatic.
- Yeah?

337
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
Yeah. Holds more rounds.

338
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,700
You don't need more rounds
if you don't miss.

339
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,000
Penelope, i know it's gotta be hard
to keep reliving this.

340
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,300
I just don't know what else
there is to remember.

341
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,800
Let's start
with the behavior.

342
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,700
That's all--That's all profiling really is,
just noticing behavior.

343
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,400
Sweetheart, any details you can remember
will tell us who he is.

344
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,400
- Ok?
- Mm-Hmm.

345
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,700
All right, so let's go back
to when you first arrived
at that restaurant.

346
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,900
Was he nervous?

347
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,200
No.

348
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,700
The opposite, actually.

349
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,800
Can i start you
with anything to drink?

350
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,800
We'll have a bottle
of sancerre.

351
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,200
Actually, i drink red.

352
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,000
Trust me,

353
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
You'll love it.

354
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,100
So he was trying
to impress you

355
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
By showing you how
he can take charge.

356
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,300
I guess so.

357
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,300
Tell me about his watch.

358
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,600
It's a fake rolex.

359
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,700
You sure about that?

360
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
I know my knockoffs.

361
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,500
Clearly he was playing
with it, though,

362
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,600
'Cause he wanted you
to notice. I mean,

363
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,800
He wanted you to think
that it was real.

364
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,200
Garcia, are you ok?

365
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,700
I'm feeling really exposed.

366
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
You're doing just fine.

367
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,200
Just fine.

368
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,600
So you work
for the fbi.

369
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,800
- That's glamorous.
- Mm-Hmm.

370
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,200
If you want to call
14-Hour days

371
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,500
Cloistered in a small, dark room,
surrounded by violent images,

372
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,000
Glamorous, then hells yeah.

373
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,100
Absolutely. It's paris
in the twenties.

374
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,700
You work murder cases?

375
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,200
Mm-Hmm. 24/7.

376
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,100
I see.

377
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,100
That's the big-Time
right there.

378
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,100
You're like a cop
and big brother

379
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,600
All rolled into one.

380
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,000
I like to think of myself

381
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,400
As a tireless crusader
for world karma.

382
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Right.

383
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,100
What about you?

384
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Ah, i don't know.

385
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,000
School in new haven,

386
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,200
Law school in boston--

387
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,600
Cambridge, i guess,
technically.

388
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,400
It's all
one college town.

389
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,000
What kind of law
do you practice?

390
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
I was a city attorney.

391
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,200
But once you've had
a murder case dismissed

392
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,900
For judicial ineptitude
or a random collateral
estoppel,

393
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Let's just say private practice starts
making a lot of sense.

394
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,300
People can get away
with murder

395
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,500
For other people's
incompetence.

396
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,100
Well, why am i
telling you this?

397
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,200
I'm sure you see it
all the time.

398
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,400
To karma.

399
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,100
City attorneys
don't try murder cases.

400
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
What?

401
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,300
He knows enough
to use legal terminology,

402
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,500
But he's not actually
a working lawyer.

403
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,800
I think we're looking at someone
who failed out of law school

404
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,900
Or didn't pass the bar.

405
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,200
Did garcia say if he gave
any details about the cases

406
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
- He was supposedly working?
- No specifics.

407
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,900
If he failed out of the system,
it could explain

408
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,500
Why he's got a working vocabulary
and not much more.

409
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,300
It could also
explain his anger.

410
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,200
Even in his lie,
he rails against

411
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,700
Other people's incompetence.

412
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,000
Well, he's clearly a narcissist.

413
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,100
The clothes, the watch,
the subtle hints

414
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,600
At where he went to school.

415
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,700
He's faking humility

416
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,100
When he's saying new haven
and cambridge

417
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,600
Instead of yale and harvard.

418
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
J.J., we need an analyst

419
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,300
Who can, uh,
put our information

420
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,500
Through the legal databases.

421
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I'm on it.

422
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,500
Now, you sure another tech
is ok with me in her system?

423
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,800
We're kind of weird
about that.

424
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,200
We just need you to run
some bar association records.

425
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Why doesn't she do it?

426
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,400
She's in the hospital.

427
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,700
You're talking about
the analyst who was shot.

428
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,800
That's right.

429
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,800
You know who hit her?

430
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,900
That's what we're hoping
to find out.

431
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,300
What?

432
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,500
We're the gatekeepers to a whole
lot of information, man.

433
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,300
It's enough to make us all
a little paranoid.

434
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,000
You know, i could have
done this at my computer.

435
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,900
First we need you to look up the name
james colby baylor

436
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,300
And see if it shows up
anywhere in the system.

437
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,500
Whoa.

438
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,000
What is it?

439
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,600
This system is insane.

440
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,600
It's completely linux-Based.

441
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,000
Open-Sourced programming.

442
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,000
You don't see this
in government systems,

443
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,400
I mean outside of, like,
switzerland.

444
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,300
James colby baylor.

445
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Right. I get it.

446
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,800
Chop-Chop. Jeez.

447
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,000
Uh-Uh. Nothing.

448
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,600
All right, let's start with a list
of everyone in the area

449
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,900
Who either failed
the bar exam

450
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,300
Or was fired
from a large law firm

451
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,700
In the last 5 years.

452
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,800
What, are you serious?

453
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,200
That's got to be, like,
thousands of names.

454
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,300
Try narrowing it down to
anyone with the initials j.C.B.

455
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,600
He had monogrammed shirts.

456
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,000
Trust me, they ain't cheap.

457
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,200
Is there a problem?

458
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,200
This might be the coolest
girl i've ever met.

459
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,600
You've never
laid eyes on her.

460
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,900
Well, her gooey
is mind-Blowing.

461
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,900
The list.

462
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Oh, that's weird.

463
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,200
Well, this isn't good.

464
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,700
What's hotch doing?

465
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,800
Right now i'm guessing
he's wishing

466
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,000
Anybody else was the leader
of this team.

467
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,700
Hey.

468
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
How are you feeling?

469
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,500
You know, i've had
better dates.

470
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,500
What's going on?

471
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
We found an encrypted file
on your computer.

472
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,900
Are you involved in something
that i need to know about?

473
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,700
No.

474
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,900
Hotch, what's going on?

475
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Could this be connected
in any way to whoever shot you?

476
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't think so.

477
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,500
I need the password.

478
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,300
Is this
really necessary?

479
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,400
Yes.

480
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,800
The password.

481
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,800
Gilman street.

482
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,000
Thank you.

483
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,500
They don't honestly think
garcia's a security risk, do they?

484
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
I don't know.

485
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,300
We've been ordered by internal affairs
to stop working the case.

486
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,200
What?

487
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,000
And until this is cleared up...

488
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,500
You've been suspended.

489
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
I'm sorry.

490
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,200
Right.

491
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,800
- What are you doing?
- I need to get out of here.

492
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

493
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,900
Please, baby,

494
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,000
Listen to me.

495
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
We're gonna get it
straightened out.

496
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,100
I'm gonna find out
who did this to you.

497
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,200
Okay? I don't give a damn
what i.A. Wants me to do

498
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,800
Or doesn't want me to do,
but right now you need to rest.

499
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
But...one of
the last things i said

500
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,700
Before he shot me was,
"everything happens for a reason."

501
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,200
Derek, if i lose faith in that,
then nothing in my life makes sense.

502
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,800
I get that.

503
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
No, you don't.

504
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,400
Is this really
necessary?

505
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,400
It's protocol.

506
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,100
Yes, it's necessary.

507
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,000
Mr. Lynch here will do
an audit of her computer.

508
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,200
I will oversee
the investigation.

509
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,100
A federal employee
was just gunned down

510
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,300
And you make it seem like
investigating her is more important

511
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,600
Than finding out
who shot her.

512
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,400
Well, that's not true.

513
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,500
The police have jurisdiction,
and trust me,

514
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,900
I will offer them
the full force of the fbi

515
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,300
To solve this case.

516
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,200
With all due respect,
sir, the b.A.U. Is part of that force.

517
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,100
Look, i'm sorry. I realize
how hard this must be.

518
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,000
But?

519
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But the first thing
you look at is victimology.

520
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,800
Correct?

521
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,200
The bureau needs to know
what she's involved in

522
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,600
And whether it has to do
with why she was shot.

523
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,800
She's not involved
in anything.

524
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And you're certain of that.

525
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,300
Absolutely.

526
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,200
What do you know about how
she was recruited to the fbi?

527
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,100
After my parents died, i...

528
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,700
Kind of went off the rails
for a while.

529
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,300
I dropped out of cal tech.
I lived underground,

530
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,300
Basically.

531
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,400
But i kept teaching
myself code.

532
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,100
It was like the one thing
that kept me together.

533
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,600
The bureau keeps track
of computer hackers--

534
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,800
Ones who have the skill to
be either extremely useful

535
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,600
Or a potential menace.

536
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,400
So garcia
was on a watch list?

537
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,600
No. Watch lists are long.

538
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,800
I'm talking about only a handful of people
on the planet.

539
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,500
What did she do
to get on that list?

540
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,700
I'm afraid i'm not
at liberty to answer that.

541
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,700
So they
offered you a job?

542
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,400
Mm-Hmm.

543
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Like frank abagnale.

544
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,800
The bureau figured
if you can't beat 'em,

545
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,400
Hire 'em.

546
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,200
Yeah. Something like that.

547
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,500
Garcia, what's on
the encrypted file?

548
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,700
I'm required to keep a record
of everything the team does.

549
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,300
And after my system got hacked
and elle got shot,

550
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,700
I just didn't want anyone else
to be able to get at you.

551
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,800
We'll talk to the doctor,
see if he'll clear you to leave.

552
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,200
Hi. I'm mike fleming.
I'm on till midnight.

553
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,600
Officer cranbeck
will be here after that, ok?

554
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,200
Thank you.

555
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,100
You're welcome.

556
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,600
Come on,
let's get you inside.

557
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,200
Come on.

558
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,800
It washes off.

559
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,100
I promise.

560
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,400
I, um...

561
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,200
I would expect
nothing less.

562
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,300
You should be
flattered.

563
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,200
Not many people
are invited in off the grid.

564
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,300
Super-8?

565
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,400
Yeah.

566
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,900
I always imagined myself
fighting crime.

567
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,700
My parents were hippies.

568
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,300
I think it horrified them.

569
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,600
How old were you
when you lost them?

570
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,100
18. Drunk driver.

571
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,700
I volunteer once a week

572
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,900
To counsel family members
of murder victims.

573
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Baby, you don't get enough
of this stuff at work?

574
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,500
I look at those crime scene
photos all day long.

575
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,200
I can't know that
those families are out there

576
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,400
Trying to cope
and not do something to help.

577
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,100
You do know it was stupid
to encrypt that file?

578
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,600
Yes, i know.

579
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,500
Old habits, i guess.

580
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,000
You need some rest.

581
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,800
You're right.

582
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,500
Go.

583
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,900
Be free, my love.

584
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,000
Hey. I'm not
going anywhere.

585
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,200
I'm fine. I got my
goon squad parked out front.

586
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,800
Goon squad
or no goon squad,

587
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,500
That couch right there
is gonna be my best friend

588
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,000
Until we find this guy.
Now leave it alone.

589
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,700
Ok.

590
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,900
But if you're thinking
of trying to take advantage of me...

591
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,000
Let me call my doctor
so he can revive me afterward.

592
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,000
Hey, silly girl.

593
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Hmm?

594
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,700
I love you.
You know that, right?

595
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,600
I love you, too.

596
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Go to bed.

597
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,200
Can i help you
with something?

598
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,800
I need you to stop
right there.

599
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,600
Stop--

600
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,300
Garcia!

601
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,600
What's going on?!

602
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,900
Stay right there.
Stay there!

603
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,900
Come here.

604
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,200
Come here. Come with me.

605
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,700
Get in the corner.
Get in the corner.

606
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,200
Garcia, you listen to me.

607
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,100
Take this gun.

608
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
I don't believe in guns.

609
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Ok, trust me, they are very real.
Take it.

610
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,000
All right, you keep your finger
off that trigger.

611
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,300
If somebody walks through
that door,

612
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,800
You grab ahold of it
and you squeeze.

613
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,000
Fire, you hear me?

614
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,300
- Morgan!
- Stay there!

615
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
107 leavenworth.
I got an officer down.

616
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,800
Repeat--Officer down.
Send me an ambulance.

617
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,300
All right,
this is dispatch.

618
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,100
We copy your request. Ambulance.

619
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,200
Aah! Aah!

620
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,300
Garcia! It's me.

621
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,700
Don't shoot. It's me.

622
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
It's morgan, baby.

623
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,200
Why is this
happening to me?

624
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,500
I don't know.

625
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,700
What's going on?

626
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,700
I don't know. This guy's
getting seriously bold,

627
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,200
And i can guarantee
it's not over.

628
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,300
You ok?

629
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,700
I don't know what
he wants from me.

630
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,300
Could you know something
about him?

631
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,200
I don't know.

632
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,500
Maybe you have
something he wants?

633
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,800
I don't know who he is.

634
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,200
I'm so scared.

635
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,700
I know.

636
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,800
Just so you know,

637
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,900
Your office called
cato tell me

638
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,200
We're supposed to
run point on this.

639
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,700
They don't want you
working the case.

640
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,500
We're just here
to comfort a friend.

641
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm about to have to tell
a good friend's wife

642
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,700
Her husband got murdered.

643
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,900
I don't care
what your office says.

644
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Any help you can give
is good in my book.

645
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,200
Thanks.

646
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,100
I'm sick of being
behind this guy.

647
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,600
We gotta end this.

648
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,200
Hey. Did you get
a look at him?

649
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Nothing solid.

650
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,800
Garcia, we need to get you
back to the hospital.

651
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
- No.
- You know what?

652
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,200
You should still be there.
We need her someplace safe.

653
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,600
I feel safe
with all of you.

654
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,500
We can take you
to the b.A.U.

655
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,900
Garcia?

656
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,100
Ok?

657
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,300
Get in the corner.
Get in the corner.

658
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,100
When we were at dinner...

659
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,900
They wanted to seat us
by a window,

660
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,200
But he insisted on sitting
at the worst table in the place.

661
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,300
And he sat with his back
to the corner.

662
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,500
Detective.

663
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,900
Can you clear the room
for just a minute?

664
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,500
I got a dead cop
downstairs.

665
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,000
I consider this
part of the crime scene.

666
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,400
I know.
Just a couple of minutes.

667
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,900
Do what you gotta do.

668
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,600
Thank you.

669
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,400
Tell us about the car.

670
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,200
Why?

671
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,200
Just go with him.

672
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,000
You said it was white,
4-Door, american. What else?

673
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,600
That's it.
It was just a car.

674
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,000
No, come on, think.
Anything. Go back.

675
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,000
The seat belt was buckled
behind his back.

676
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,700
Why does that matter?

677
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,200
It wasn't a rental.

678
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,900
It was for surveillance.

679
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,500
Agents don't wear
seat belts.

680
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,800
They need to get out
in a hurry.

681
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,400
All right,
let's cut the crap.

682
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,200
You need to be straight with us.
Right now.

683
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,200
Look at me, not them.

684
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
I'm not hiding anything.

685
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,300
You got shot. Most people
get shot for a reason.

686
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,600
Eyes here!

687
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,500
Ease up, rossi.

688
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,900
You got a roomful
of people here

689
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,700
Willing to believe that an fbi agent
has tried to kill you.

690
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,800
We need to know everything
you do on company time

691
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,300
That we don't know about.

692
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,300
- What?
- Come on, man.

693
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,600
- It's nothing bad.
- Spit it out!

694
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
It's ju--

695
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,500
I counsel victims' families

696
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
And they know where i work,
so sometimes they ask me

697
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,700
To look into cases for them.

698
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,600
What does that mean?

699
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,900
It just means
that the cases,

700
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,100
The unsolved ones,
i tag them,

701
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,400
So whoever's
investigating them

702
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,900
Knows that the fbi considers them
a priority.

703
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,200
You're not authorized
to do that.

704
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,800
I know. I was just
trying to help.

705
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,700
But whoever's working those cases
thinks you're watching them.

706
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,500
I just wanted to put pressure on them
so that they don't slide.

707
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,000
How many cases
are we talking about?

708
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I don't know. 7, 8 maybe.

709
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,300
I need to get into
my system.

710
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,600
You can't.
You're suspended.

711
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,500
Wait a minute, garcia.

712
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,000
On your date, you said
this guy was pressing you

713
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,700
To find out if you were
working murder cases.

714
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,000
Hotch, we gotta look
at those files.

715
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,300
I told you, i'm sick of this
jagoff being in front of us.

716
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,200
Dave's right.

717
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,700
We'll go back to the b.A.U.

718
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,900
Morgan, reid, prentiss,
you stay here and make sure

719
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,900
No one forgets
to log out of the system.

720
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,700
Garcia should
not have access.

721
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,600
Understood.

722
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,700
What the hell?

723
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh, no, you don't.

724
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,000
I do not have time
for this.

725
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,100
All right, no chance.

726
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,500
Huh.

727
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,100
And yet...

728
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,900
Oh, you want to play?

729
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,500
What is she doing
in there?

730
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,900
Do you really want to know?

731
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,900
Oh, no.

732
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,000
You are not seriously
trying to backhack me?

733
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,300
Oh, nicely played.

734
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,700
Ok.

735
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,100
New plan.

736
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,400
Well, now, this is just
way too easy.

737
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,900
Yeah, that's right.
Chase me.

738
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,200
I thought you had skills.

739
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,700
Oh, boy.

740
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,900
Have fun getting out
of the wormhole.

741
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,000
Those are all the cases
i flagged.

742
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:56,900
Ok.

743
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,300
Everybody take a copy.

744
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,400
We need to see
if any of the agents overlap

745
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,700
In all of the cases.

746
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,400
Now...

747
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,000
What were you looking for?

748
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,300
There aren't any agents
working on these cases.

749
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,000
But the same deputy
was a first responder in 3.

750
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,100
What's the name?

751
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,400
Jason clark battle.

752
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,500
What are the cases?

753
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,700
Uh, all 3 were drive-Bys,

754
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,600
At close range,

755
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,800
Shot with a revolver.

756
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,600
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

757
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,100
He's been honored twice
as a hero.

758
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,700
So why is he
stuck at deputy?

759
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,400
Because even to his superiors,

760
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,700
Something was off about him.

761
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,800
Makes sense.
The showy clothes,

762
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,500
The subtle bragging.
He presents himself

763
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,000
As a prominent attorney
when he's actually

764
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,100
Just a deputy sheriff.

765
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,300
Underapprecied in the world

766
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,700
And overappreciated
in his own mind.

767
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,700
I don't understand.

768
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,500
I think you may have stumbled
upon an angel of death.

769
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,400
I thought those are nurses
who put people out of their misery.

770
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,900
Yeah, that's one model.
The other is someone

771
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,000
Who puts people at risk
in order to save them.

772
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,200
So he shot them
so that he could save them?

773
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,100
Yeah. And when he couldn't,
he made it look like a random murder.

774
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,200
It's how he was able
to be the first responder.

775
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,000
It's called
hero homicide complex.

776
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,500
It's most commonly found
in firemen who set fires

777
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,800
In order to save the day.

778
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,700
Garcia.

779
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,400
You flagged these cases.

780
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,900
He thought you were onto him.

781
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,100
I wasn't.

782
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,600
But you're the only person
in the world

783
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,500
Who was gonna make the connection.
In his mind,

784
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,200
He had to eliminate you.

785
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,500
Deputy battle, please.

786
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,000
Ok, what time
is his shift over?

787
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,900
No, no message. Thank you.

788
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,300
Ok, he didn't sign out
to a location.

789
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
His shift is over at midnight.

790
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,900
Until then, i do not want this guy
knowing that we are onto him.

791
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,600
- Why?
- What's the profile say?

792
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,300
He'll keep getting bolder
trying to cover his tracks.

793
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,300
And if that doesn't work,
he'll die shooting.

794
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,500
Great.

795
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Thanks for having me in.

796
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,700
Oh, we want you to know
we take bureau interference

797
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,800
With local law enforcement
seriously.

798
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,300
I appreciate that.
It's good to know we're on the same team.

799
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,300
Mr. Lynch, i need you
to access some files.

800
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,200
Yeah, i'm kind of busy.

801
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,100
We'll step in here.
It'll just take a second.

802
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,900
Deputy.

803
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,300
Jason battle.

804
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,200
B-A-T-T-L-E.

805
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,200
I just don't understand
why one of your analysts

806
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,100
Would be looking into
my murder cases.

807
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,600
To be honest, the woman
we're talking about is currently

808
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,900
Under investigation.

809
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,200
You don't think
she could be involved

810
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,900
In a killing somehow,
do you?

811
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,100
We haven't made
any determinations.

812
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,800
Wouldn't it be easier
to just let me speak to her?

813
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,600
I'm afraid
she's in the hospital.

814
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,600
This the woman
who was shot?

815
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,500
Yeah.

816
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,700
Every cop in the city's
working overtime,

817
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,300
But they can't come up
with anything.

818
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,000
Think she might be
dirty?

819
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,200
Like i said, we haven't
made any determinations.

820
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,600
Well, until you do,
is it possible

821
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,600
To remove my files
from your system

822
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,300
For security's sake?

823
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,500
Yeah, we can do that.
Mr. Lynch?

824
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,400
Yes, sir.

825
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,700
Ok, that's funky.

826
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,800
What's going on?

827
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,300
He just logged in
to my system.

828
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,100
There's a link up on my screen.

829
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,500
Maybe it's a mistake.

830
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,800
No. He's good.
He's not careless.

831
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,100
Could he be trying
to show you something?

832
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,800
He could be baiting me.

833
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,000
What do you mean?

834
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,400
If he's with internal affairs,

835
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,400
And i follow his lead,
whosever login i use could lose their job.

836
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,500
What's your gut say?

837
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,900
He's a hacker.
We have a code.

838
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,900
You trust it?

839
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,700
I have to.

840
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:01,900
Do it.

841
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,800
Make contact.

842
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,900
It's the b.A.U.

843
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
God, that's him.

844
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,000
Hotch, it's morgan.

845
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,200
He's in the b.A.U.

846
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,600
Deputy sheriff, mid-Bullpen,
just past my desk.

847
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,900
Got him?

848
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,600
I got him.

849
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,300
Don't let him know
we're onto him.

850
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,100
He's a classic narcissist

851
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,500
With a hero homicide complex,
and he's spiraling.

852
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,800
If you let him know we're onto him,
he's gonna start shooting.

853
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
He's trying to prove to himself

854
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,700
He's smarter
than all of us.

855
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,700
It's too crowded in here.

856
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,100
We can't get an angle on him

857
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,300
Without putting people
in jeopardy.

858
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,000
We gotta slip somebody
in behind him.

859
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,000
Can you get us the cameras
outside the bullpen?

860
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,100
Is there a problem?

861
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,900
No, i'm sorry.

862
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,800
It's--It's not my system.

863
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,100
It's taking me longer.

864
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,100
Oh, my girl.

865
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,900
Come on, j.J.,
pick up the phone.

866
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,500
Pick it up.

867
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,600
J.J., it's morgan.
Listen to me.

868
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,900
Listen to me
very carefully.

869
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,300
Okey-Doke.

870
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,900
You're sure my files
are wiped off the system?

871
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,700
Yes, sir.

872
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,300
All right,
i'll keep you updated

873
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,600
On our investigation.

874
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,800
He knows they know.

875
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,400
This is crazy.
We gotta get over there.

876
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,000
- I'm going with you.
- No, you are not.

877
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,300
You do not have time
to argue.

878
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
You're a cop.

879
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,500
You know this isn't
gonna end well.

880
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,000
You're standing
in the middle of the fbi.

881
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,900
You think i'm afraid
of the fbi?

882
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,400
I know how this
is gonna end, and so do you.

883
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,600
I'm a decorated officer.

884
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,500
That's right.

885
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,200
And this is not how
you want to be remembered.

886
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,400
You're in control here.

887
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,600
You write the ending.

888
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,600
Your choice.

889
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,900
The best minds in the fbi.

890
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,500
You can't even stop me.

891
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,800
He's clear!

892
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,000
It's really over?

893
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,100
Yeah.

894
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,000
It's really over.

895
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,300
Now can we please
get you back to the hospital?

896
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,800
I...

897
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,800
Oh, don't worry about
your reinstatement papers.

898
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,200
He'll sign them as soon as
his hand stops shaking.

899
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,700
Hey.

900
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,600
I never wanted you to have
to do something like that.

901
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,400
I never even blinked.

902
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,500
You do whatever it takes
to, uh...

903
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,800
Protect your family.

00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,200

905
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,800
She'll make sense of it.

906
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,700
And you?

907
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,300
How's your faith?

908
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,100
Day to day.

909
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,600
I think someone's
watching you.

910
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,000
Do you believe everything
happens for a reason?

911
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:28,800
You.

912
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
You.

913
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,300
You're good.

914
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,400
You're better.

915
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,400

00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,900
