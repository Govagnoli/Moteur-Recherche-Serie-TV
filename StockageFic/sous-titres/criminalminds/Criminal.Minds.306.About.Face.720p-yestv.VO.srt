LITTLE CREEK RESERVIOR, VA

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,660
Go on, mudgie! Go on, boy.

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,980
Attaboy!

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,110
Go on, boy.

5
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,090
Come! Come!

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,500
Strauss, I'm coming in to
see you this afternoon.

7
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,450
Well, then cancel it.
I'll be there at 2:30.

8
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,690
That's it. Come on, boy!

9
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,010
Come on! Yeah.

10
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,840
I really don't understand this, david.

11
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,110
What's to understand, erin?

12
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,520
You've been retired for nearly 10 years.

13
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,800
B.A.U. Is a man down.

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,800
I'm offering to help.

15
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,180
You've written... how many books?

16
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,420
World tours.

17
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,620
Speaking engagements.

18
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,430
Big payday private consultations.

19
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,270
You've made quite a name for yourself.

20
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,970
Well, this is getting boring.

21
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,640
You know, you won't be in charge.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,540
Agent hotchner's the S.A.C. And
I'll be seeking his endorsement.

23
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,490
I'm not looking for
anyone's permission here.

24
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,140
So you're coming in in
a subordinate position.

25
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,930
- Is that a question?
- The question is, why?

26
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,250
To help.

27
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,820
A completely selfless act.

28
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,130
Is that so hard to believe?

29
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,890
Yes.

30
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,340
I missed you too, erin.

31
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,660
You'll meet the team tomorrow.

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,520
CARROLLTON, TEXAS

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,020
HAVE YOU SEEN ME?

34
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,390
It was next to my front
door when I got home, frank.

35
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,020
God, I hate halloween.

36
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,630
- Here you go, sir.
- Halloween?

37
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,820
Less than a week away.

38
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,290
{\a6}Police Department,
CARROLLTON, TEXAS

39
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,050
It's a prime time for stupid pranks.

40
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,640
So you think it's just a prank?

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,890
Well, you're obviously
not missing, michelle.

42
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,790
Where'd they get a picture of me?

43
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,520
It's probably one of your friends.

44
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,370
I don't know anybody
that'd think this is funny.

45
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,610
Molly didn't think it was funny.

46
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,370
She's the one who told me
to come right down here.

47
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,220
If my wife had just called, I
probably could have saved you the trip.

48
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,250
I'm sure it's nothing, really.

49
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,100
You sure?

50
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,910
Look...

51
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,870
I'll come by and check on you after
work and make sure you're safe.

52
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,030
I appreciate that, frank.

53
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,990
Hey. Serving and
protecting is what I do.

54
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,790
No, no, I didn't say it was funny, molly.

55
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,500
I said
someone might--

56
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,820
I--I know she's your best
friend. That's why I'm here.

57
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,870
No. No, I don't think it's
weird she didn't call--

58
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,990
look, I'm here already.

59
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,970
All the lights are out.

60
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,380
She--she probably
went to bed early.

61
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,730
I'll have her call you.

62
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,610
Yeah,20 minutes. I love you, too.

63
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,070
This wasn't funny the first time.

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
Michelle?

65
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,030
Michelle?

66
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,960
Michelle, it's frank!

67
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,820
Michelle?

68
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,110
Oh, my god.

Erasmus wrote, what else is the whole
life of mortals but a sort of comedy,

72
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,800
in which the various actors, disguised
by various costumes and masks,

73
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,410
walk on and play each one his part,

74
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,870
until the manager waves
them off the stage?

75
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,040
I'm waiting for you!

76
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,420
Reid...

77
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,270
happy all hallows eve, folks.

78
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,360
To paraphrase from celtic mythology,

79
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,160
tomorrow night all order is suspended,

80
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,530
and the barriers between the natural and
the supernatural are temporarily remooooved!

81
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,750
See, that right there is
why halloween creeps me out.

82
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,890
You're scared of halloween?

83
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,310
I didn't say I was scared, I
said I was creeped out.

84
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,240
There's a difference there, youngster.
You should look it up.

85
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,330
What creeps you out about it?

86
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,030
I don't know. People wearing masks.

87
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,700
I don't like folks in disguises.

88
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,050
That's the best thing about halloween.
You can be anyone you want to be.

89
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,100
Nah, I'm pretty good just being me.

90
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,530
Yeah, why is it that neither of
those points of view surprise me?

91
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,320
You know what, though? On the flip side,

92
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,340
it does provide a pretty good
reason to cozy up with a scary flick

93
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,460
and a little halloween honey.

94
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,130
Halloween honey. Now I'm creeped out.

95
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,140
Guys, he's here.

96
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,400
Agent hotchner.

97
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,770
- I'm sure you
remember-- - Dave.

98
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,810
how are you, aaron?

99
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,040
- I'm good. I'm great.
- I would say so.

100
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,430
Saw you on tv last week.

101
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,170
Can't believe you
want to come back here.

102
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,370
Well, I'll let the two of you catch up.

103
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,950
- If you need anything, I'm in my office.
- Thanks.

104
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,900
So how long's it been?

105
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,470
Dinner, almost 3 years ago.

106
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,020
But the last time I was in the B.A.U.

107
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,590
You were sharing a desk with 2 other
agents in that god-awful bunker we were in.

108
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,480
I remember.

109
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,880
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

110
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,120
Well, there's one just like this
next door if you're interested.

111
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,040
I'm ready to give the briefing.

112
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,040
Agent jareau, this is ssa david rossi.

113
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,720
Hi. Everyone calls me J.J.

114
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,800
It is such an honor to meet you, sir.

115
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,070
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Thank you.

116
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,380
And what's your function here?

117
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,930
I'm the communications
coordinator and liaison.

118
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,980
Pretty much the go-between for
the team and the rest of the world.

119
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,300
So I'll gather everyone.

120
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,630
We'll be right there.

121
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,510
- It is so nice to have you here, sir.
- Great.

122
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,160
We didn't have that 10 years ago.

123
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,870
What do you mean?

124
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,550
- Communications coordinator.
- Right.

125
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,150
Oh, lots has changed. Come meet the team.

126
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,440
Ssa david rossi, this
is ssa emily prentiss.

127
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,960
Sir.

128
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,570
Ssa derek morgan.

129
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,770
It's an honor, agent rossi.

130
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,840
Please, just dave.

131
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,150
And dr. Spencer reid.

132
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,440
Sir, if I could talk to you later about
your work with the scarsdale skinner.

133
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,640
Psycho-linguistics is an
incredibly dynamic field,

134
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,320
and the fact that your profile of his
reading habits ultimately led to his capture

135
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,820
- is something I find so incredibly
intrig-- - reid, slow down.

136
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,110
He'll be here for a while. You
can catch up with him later.

137
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,140
- Sorry.
- No problem, doctor.

138
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,530
Maybe you guys can talk on the jet.

139
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,910
- Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
- The jet?

140
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,740
We have a jet now.

141
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,920
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. It comes in pretty handy.

142
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,670
Come on. J.J.'S waiting.

143
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,530
Carrollton, texas, is a suburb
just outside of dallas.

144
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,940
4 days ago, michelle colucci found
this flier on her front door.

145
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,580
She found it?

146
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,110
Meaning she wasn't actually missing?

147
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,610
Yet. She took the flier
to a friend's husband,

148
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,340
detective yarbrough,at
the carrollton P.D.

149
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,110
Who told her it was probably just a
halloween prank, and he sent her home.

150
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,320
Well, I don't blame him.

151
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,910
Halloween brings out
the fool in everyone.

152
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,650
Still, he stopped by michelle's
house later to check on her.

153
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,900
The door was open, and when
he went inside, he found this.

154
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,180
He still thought maybe it could be
some kind of a prank, until yesterday.

155
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,250
Michelle was found floating in a
small creek just outside of carrollton.

156
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,170
She had been sexually assaulted...

157
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,150
and her face had been removed.

158
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,690
Removed? It wasn't animals or fish?

159
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,300
The dallas county M.E. Say that the
edges of the wounds were smooth,not torn.

160
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,350
A very sharp instrument had been used.

161
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,230
He also found water in her lungs.

162
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,140
Oh, my god!

163
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,690
What is that?

164
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,860
Technical analyst penelope
garcia, this is ssa david rossi.

165
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,410
Is it gone,J.J.?

166
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're safe.

167
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,850
OK. Just to, um...

168
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,550
carrollton,texas,has
nearly 117,000 residents,

169
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,050
a diverse population with
A... it's all in there.

170
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,340
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,670
Very happy to meet you, sir.

172
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,660
I'll be in my office.

173
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,040
Sorry.

174
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,180
She's different.

175
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,060
You have no idea.

176
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,170
Uh, so, the unsub tells her she's going to
go missing to psychologically torture her,

177
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,320
then tortures her physically.

178
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,540
Textbook sadist.

179
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,080
A sophisticated one.

180
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,230
That's elaborate.

181
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,260
Number one.

182
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,300
That particular mask is
known as a false face.

183
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,090
It's most commonly worn during
halloween and mardi gras.

184
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,760
Creepy. I rest my case.

185
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,630
False face.

186
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,910
Her face-- he mocks
it, then destroys it.

187
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,010
Oh, and, hotch-- local media
has the story. It broke big.

188
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,250
Tell carrollton we'll be there
first thing in the morning.

189
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,850
- Let's stop this one at one.
- Yes, sir.

190
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,910
If you want to take some time to get
situated, maybe start on the next case?

191
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,660
I'm not back to get
situated, hotch, I'm here to work.

192
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,420
Everybody get your things
together. We're going to texas.

193
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,220
Abbey, what's the latest?

194
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,890
Police sources tell me they
have no leads in the case

195
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,460
they are calling the
"have you seen me"Murders.

196
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,710
Where the hell do you get this stuff?

197
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,400
No, not you, agent jareau. The television.

198
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,870
The press is saying we gave
this thing a stupid name,

199
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,800
like it's some kind of
damn game or something.

200
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,390
Just...

201
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,280
call me when you all get in tomorrow.
I'll take you wherever you need to go.

202
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,670
All right. Good night.

203
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,310
Abbey, do we know when
this flyer first surfaced?

204
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,570
We have heard reports that ms. Colucci
received this flier late tuesday afternoon

205
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,350
when she returned home from work.

206
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,380
*****

207
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,160
Never saw the point at
throwing an egg at anything.

208
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,210
{\a6}DALLAS, TEXAS

209
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,280
Or even the connection to
halloween, for that matter.

210
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,490
What the hell...

211
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,790
oh, my god. That's me.

212
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,990
Oh, my god!

213
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,860
Let's go over victimology.

214
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,000
Would you like to join us, dave?

215
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,900
Reid, what have you got?

216
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,360
Uh, michelle colucci was single,

217
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,150
lived alone, no boyfriend
and no ex-husband.

218
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:02,950
Dating?

219
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,300
There's nothing in the reports.

220
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,170
She was an architect.

221
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,590
Friends and co-workers say
she's a class workaholic.

222
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,830
Basically a loner who
rarely went out of the house.

223
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,650
So she's extremely low risk.

224
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,360
If it wasn't someone she knew personally,
it's possible she was being stalked.

225
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,940
- Interesting.
- What's that?

226
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,170
Oh, I'm just thinking out loud.

227
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,560
- Something to add?
- No.

228
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,870
Sorry to interrupt.

229
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,540
Well, she's pretty.

230
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,200
It could be that the unsub
met her casually and...

231
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,860
made her part of some kind of fantasy.

232
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,940
And he tries to act on
it and she rejects him?

233
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,310
So he tortures her, out of anger?

234
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,120
Masks often represent a state of mind.

235
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,680
This one's blank, expressionless.
Doesn't really coincide with anger.

236
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,740
Reid, it's hard to imagine he did
this out of anything less than rage.

237
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,400
Hey, guys.

238
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,890
What's up? You got something for us?

239
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,690
A list of michelle colucci's clients.

240
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,750
She designed office space. Mostly
big corporate remodeling plans.

241
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,710
No private
clients, one-on-one contact?

242
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,500
Doesn't look like it, no.

243
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,800
- Thanks, baby girl.
- Yeah.

244
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,390
It's right this way, ma'am.

245
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,710
Police Department CARROLLTON. TEXAS

246
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,420
- Detective yarbrough?
- Fbi?

247
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,410
We got another flier--
this time metro dallas.

248
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,370
Enid white.

249
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,800
Her roommate called
dallas P. D. This morning.

250
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,650
Enid never game home after
walking her dog last night.

251
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,740
So she is missing.

252
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,230
Well, he wallpapered the neighborhood with
fliers for 2 blocks around their apartment.

253
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,640
Outside. That's different.

254
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,320
No one saw him putting them up?

255
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,940
Dallas P. D. Is still
canvassing, but nothing so far.

256
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,460
They're waiting for
you on the new scene.

257
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,230
- Mind if I keep this?
- Not at all.

258
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,430
Morgan, you and prentiss go
to michelle colucci's house.

259
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,570
J. J. And I will talk to enid's roommate.

260
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,140
Dave, do you mind walking the disposal
site with the detective and reid?

261
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,980
Whatever you need.

262
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,100
We'll regroup in an hour.

263
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,260
These houses sure are close together.

264
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,980
Yeah.

265
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,900
So how do I get a woman out of
her house without anyone seeing me?

266
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,790
Well, he must have been watching her for
a long time and knew that it was safe.

267
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,740
There isn't a lot of
cover on this street.

268
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,740
I have a vehicle.

269
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,110
Big enough so I can
watch without being seen.

270
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,110
But not so big as to
draw attention to itself.

271
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,200
No.

272
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,800
Neighbors will notice a strange vehicle parked in
front of their house day after day, night after night.

273
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,690
It's human nature.

274
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,970
You would notice something out
of place in your own neighborhood.

275
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,800
And you would definitely notice a man
repeatedly standing on your street.

276
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,010
Yeah. It just doesn't make any sense.

277
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,180
He didn't watch from here.

278
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,480
As we reported earlier, enid white
is still considered missing...

279
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,820
big story.

280
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,010
Leeches.

281
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,610
Haven't had something this
big to play in a long time.

282
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,350
Did the press run with
the story about the mask?

283
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,710
Mask?

284
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,730
A mask was left at michelle
colucci's apartment.

285
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,360
First time I'm hearing about it.

286
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,170
Good.

287
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,730
- Let's make sure that stays ours.
- Yeah.

288
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,080
Miss white's roommate says that enid walks
her dog every night at the same time,

289
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,550
takes the same route, right
down this street.

290
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,800
Nothing a stalker likes
better than routine.

291
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,400
Well, she definitely would have seen this

292
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,670
if this was here
before she went missing.

293
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,900
A couple of neighbors say they may have
seen a guy putting up a flier during the day,

294
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,510
bueaey rt thlly couldn't
remember anything about him.

295
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,980
All right, well, we're gonna have to
know everything we can about the victim.

296
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,360
I know you sent some
stuff over to quantico,

297
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,850
but it would help us if we could
interview the roommate ourselves.

298
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,480
We have her downtown now.

299
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,860
- Where's her dog?
- Excuse me?

300
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,790
If she was abducted while she was
walking her dog. Where's her dog?

301
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,870
We went over this
area pretty thoroughly.

302
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,970
There's no evidence left.

303
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,090
I just want to stand where she was.

304
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,040
Dr. Reid, do we still keep all the old
files in the fourth floor storeroom?

305
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,010
I think some are up there. You know, most
of our information's on computer now.

306
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,650
Right.

307
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,550
Have you had a chance to go through
our data since you've been back?

308
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,380
Not yet.

309
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,340
You'll be amazed.

310
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,580
The original
team--

311
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,170
I mean, you interviewed something like,

312
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,460
- uh,45 serial killers, right?
- Something like.

313
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,320
Today we have interviews
with over 1,000 offenders.

314
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,600
Serial killers, child
abductors, sex offenders--

315
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
I'll go through it with you sometime
if you like, answer any questions--

316
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,440
sounds good.

317
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,600
Michelle's body was found right here.

318
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,240
I really thought it was a prank.

319
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,970
You can't really blame
yourself for that.

320
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,530
She made herself dinner.

321
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,030
Excuse me?

322
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,820
She had time to make herself dinner.

323
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,080
I mean she was home
for a while before he...

324
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,120
there was time to help her.

325
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,120
Water.

326
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,090
Obliterates a body...

327
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,940
destroys evidence.

328
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,530
But you weren't in the water
that long, were you, michelle?

329
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,180
She had rocks tied to
her to weigh her down.

330
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,690
She floated to the surface
before there was any other damage.

331
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,380
Just what was done to her already.

332
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,740
The salient point is that it was the
first thing the unsub wasn't good at.

333
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,140
Green river dumped most
of the bodies in the water.

334
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,940
- But they weren't weighed down.
- Yeah.

335
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,000
We know now it's'ause he
didn't care if they were found.

336
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,300
He had no connection to them.

337
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,750
This is where I'd wait.

338
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,160
Yeah.

339
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,190
I'd never be able to
see you from the house.

340
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,790
Prentiss.

341
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,420
He was here a lot.

342
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,620
Watching everything she did.

343
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,590
we got anything?

344
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,960
Agent rossi pointed out that since
the victims were weighted down,

345
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,870
it suggests the unsub
didn't want them found.

346
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,890
It suggests some sort of
connection between them.

347
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,740
Detective, how long was michelle missing?

348
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,420
She was found on the fourth day.

349
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,570
So if she wasn't in the water
long, then he held her for 3.

350
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,880
Garcia?

351
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,350
I've been running all of
enid white's credit cards.

352
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,100
And?

353
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,800
She made a purchase at 9 A. M. This morning
at a sporting goods store in dallas.

354
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,880
This morning?

355
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,930
What did she buy?

356
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,010
A shotgun.

357
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,990
Thanks.

358
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,720
The man was seen posting fliers around the
neighborhood where enid white was known to walk her dog.

359
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,300
The police are still unable to give
us any information at this time,

360
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,280
and they are saying they
still have no possible leads.

361
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,070
We will continue to keep you posted

362
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,400
as we receive more details
about the hunt for enid white...

363
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,030
she can buy a gun that easily?

364
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,270
This is texas.

365
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,440
There's no license or waiting
period for most rifles or shotguns.

366
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,960
Is there video surveillance of
guns sales in sporting goods stores?

367
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,120
There's supposed to be.

368
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,080
J.J.,Call the store.

369
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,640
Find out if it was enid or the
unsub using her credit card.

370
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,130
Right away.

371
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,080
Detective yarbrough.

372
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,340
There's an urgent call
from a woman on one.

373
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,060
Detective yarbrough.

374
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,860
My name is enid white.

375
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,810
Where are you, enid

376
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:01,700
The news reports said that the police didn't believe
that other woman when she saw the missing fliers.

377
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,730
That was a mistake, enid.

378
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,660
I have a gun.

379
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,610
I don't think I can stay
awake very much longer.

380
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,900
Enid, this is agent hotchner of the fbi.

381
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,330
We believe you, and we want to help you.

382
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,820
Can you tell us where you are?

383
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,980
El royale motel in dallas.

384
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,500
It's room 6.

385
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,950
I saw the fliers.

386
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,300
Hurry, please.

387
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,540
He's gonna kill me.

388
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,200
Don't move, enid. We're on our way.

389
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,820
Fbi!

390
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,960
Clear.

391
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,000
She's gone.

392
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,940
20 minutes.

393
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,170
We were here in 20 minutes.

394
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,350
I can't believe we lost her.

395
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,590
We may not have lost her.
He kept michelle for 4 days.

396
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,660
But we got nothing.

397
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,670
That's not true. Look at
the difference in the scenes.

398
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,390
What do you mean? There's
the masks, the fliers.

399
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,120
Yeah, but these fliers weren't tacked up,

400
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,340
they were just thrown around the room.

401
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,130
So?

402
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,680
He left in a hurry like
he knew we were coming.

403
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,900
OK, this was under the bed.

404
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,230
972 area code.

405
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,620
That's carrollton.

406
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,880
The hotline number.

407
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,790
She used a cell phone.

408
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,160
You can get a cell interceptor
at any electronics store.

409
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,970
You can?

410
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,510
Yeah. They don't cost that much.

411
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,160
He probably sat right out here
and heard everything she said.

412
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,630
But if he followed her here from dallas,

413
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,640
why wait till she
calls us to move on her?

414
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,740
To make sure it was the
police who found the mask.

415
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,530
We need to gather your
men and give a profile.

416
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,300
He's a white male.

417
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,820
His shoe prints have been examined
and put him at about 5'11,165.

418
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,260
So we've narrowed it down to
anyone of average weight and height.

419
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,890
Exactly.

420
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,020
Speak and be recognized
by your empress, mortal.

421
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,210
Is this the technical analyst girl?

422
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:16,940
Who's this?

423
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,890
Dr. Reid said this was your
direct line from the team.

424
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,470
It is.

425
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,080
This is agent dave
rossi. We met yesterday.

426
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,920
Of course, of course.
I'm sorry--sir.

427
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,270
Uh, yeah, I already started processing the
footprint information on michelle colucci--

428
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,300
no, no, no. This is about something else.

429
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,210
All the past open cases the
B. A. U. Worked on are on computer now?

430
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,020
Most of them.

431
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,910
There may be a few left to catalog.

432
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,260
If I give you a victim's
name, could you find the old records?

433
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,240
Oh, records are my specialty, sir.

434
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,780
The original case--
I'm going back 20 years.

435
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,330
Won't be a problem.

436
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,950
The name is galen.

437
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,700
Diana and richard galen.

438
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,590
They had 3 children.

439
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,820
OK. I will get back to you
super fast. Scout's honor.

440
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,220
No, no, um, just put a file together.

441
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,000
I'll get it when I get back.

442
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,330
It's really no problem, sir. I
could just send it--

443
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,120
not necessary. I'll look
at it when I get back.

444
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,390
And let's keep this between
us, if you don't mind. For now.

445
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,640
OK.

446
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,210
Thank you.

447
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,020
My pleasure entirely, sir.

448
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,650
There's a sophistication and patience in what
this unsub does that suggests a level of maturity.

449
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,240
We believe this puts his age
in the mid-30s to 40s range.

450
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,620
Michelle colucci was taken
from the primary crime scene

451
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,640
and disposed of at the tertiary
crime scene 4 days later.

452
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,280
That means she was held
somewhere for at least 3 days.

453
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,550
You can't really just hold a
victim anywhere for days on end,

454
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,380
so he most likely has access
to a house of some kind.

455
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,360
And he's also fairly tech savvy.

456
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,090
The fliers were made on a computer.

457
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,160
And it's probable that he used a device
to intercept enid white's phone call.

458
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,760
Witnesses in enid
white's neighborhood say

459
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,910
they may have seen a white
man putting up fliers,

460
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,630
but none of them could describe him, even with
all the media attention this case has received.

461
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,460
Great.

462
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,330
Actually, what that tells us is that there is
absolutely nothing remarkable about this man.

463
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,530
He is exceedingly average.

464
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,810
As you said, detective
yarbrough, average height, average build.

465
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,750
It extends to his
professional life as well.

466
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:27,180
He most likely works in a field where he
doesn't stand out, doesn't really make a mark.

467
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,820
His lack of distinction
is part of his psychopathy.

468
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,830
We have hundreds of interactions
with people every day.

469
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,100
Most of those involve someone
overlooking someone else.

470
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,660
Most of us don't pay any attention to
being ignored, but to this kind of unsub,

471
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,790
each oversight is intentional.

472
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,060
Especially when it comes from
his object of sexual desire.

473
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,620
He begins to obsess over her
until she's all he can think about.

474
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,920
And the rage builds until
he has to attack that person.

475
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,550
So he's pissed off
that nobody notices him?

476
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,830
Have you seen me?

477
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,800
Wait. That's not about the women.

478
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,100
No. The masks are
about the women--

479
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,730
number one, number 2.

480
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,870
The fliers probably refer to him.

481
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:11,070
Removing his victims'faces transfers his
feelings of being ignored into a mission

482
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,240
and it gives him a sense of power.

483
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,210
And the power can make him arrogant, but
it doesn't make him notable.

484
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,350
So how the hell do we
catch an invisible man?

485
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,560
I'm pretty sure we can
get him to contact you.

486
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,130
What?

487
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,610
Well, the crime scenes show he wants
to deliver his message to the police.

488
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,800
He isn't going public.

489
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,790
Hopefully, by playing on his anger...

490
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,940
J.J.,How'd they get that?

491
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,810
Not from
me. I--

492
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,870
hotch, I called all the local police
departments and I stressed withholding the mask.

493
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,330
I called them.

494
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,190
What?

495
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,280
I said the fbi thinks the
masks mean he's impotent.

496
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,550
Can I speak to you for a second?

497
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,090
Why would you do that?

498
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,740
It'll make him contact us.

499
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,830
He's screaming for it.

500
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,160
We aren't prepared.

501
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,820
Prepared?

502
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,270
We need to set up a trap and trace.

503
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,320
Trap and trace?

504
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,960
They never stay on the
phone long enough for that.

505
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,770
Dave, they're a lot faster
than they used to be.

506
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,210
We also need to prep the
detective on what to say to him.

507
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,090
He's not gonna want to
talk to the detective.

508
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,780
He's gonna want to talk to the fbi.

509
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,970
We don't step over the
local police like that.

510
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,970
They called us in.

511
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,480
Yes, but if the perception is that

512
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,830
we're to embarrass the locals by telling
the media that we're gonna fix things,

513
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,500
then they'll stop calling us.

514
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,380
Relax, hotch. I've got this.

515
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,810
You see, that's the problem, dave.

516
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,600
There is no I.

517
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,100
We function as a team.

518
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,660
I've been doing this before
you were out of high school,

519
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,390
probably before the rest of
your team was in school at all.

520
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,610
I know that.

521
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,280
Things have changed.

522
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,870
The bells and whistles changed.

523
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,040
An unsub is still an unsub, and
I know how to deal with an unsub.

524
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,280
- No, dave, it's not just that.
- Hotch.

525
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,390
What?

526
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,350
Garcia found something.

527
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,550
Garcia, talk to us.

528
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,560
So, michelle colucci
recently drew up the plans

529
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,860
for a remodel of 3 floors of a
company called techco communications.

530
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,800
It's a high-tech communications
company in downtown dallas.

531
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,600
And enid white?

532
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,430
Worked there until 2 months ago.

533
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,570
He's on 2.

534
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,580
The unsub?

535
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,980
Demanded to speak to the fbi.

536
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,950
This is fbi supervisory
special agent david rossi.

537
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,010
You called me impotent.

538
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,860
Did I?

539
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,130
I'm not impotent.

540
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,950
Why are you whispering?

541
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,640
You lied.

542
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,570
You lied.

543
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,680
Is someone around you?

544
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,300
Are you at work?

545
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,840
You have to tell the news the truth.

546
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,470
I'll get you on the news, then
you can correct me yourself.

547
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,430
No, you, you, you correct it.

548
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,980
By the way, I was, um, looking
at the police security tapes

549
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,330
for the day michelle
colucci went missing.

550
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,630
What?

551
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:20,090
You watched her long enough to
know she didn't have visitors.

552
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,590
She was a loner.

553
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,720
Yet you knew that detective
yarbrough was coming over.

554
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,210
You must have been right here
in this station when he told her.

555
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,900
Now, your face is gonna be on one
of those tapes, and when I find it,

556
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,240
I'm gonna paper this city with
it, just like you did with those women.

557
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,250
Everyone will see it.

558
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,930
They won't be able to ignore you now.

559
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:51,530
But you won't inspire fear, you'll
inspire hatred and ridicule,

560
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,490
because the only power
someone like you has is a mask,

561
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,110
and once that mask is removed,

562
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,480
you'll be as insignificant
as you've always been--

563
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,770
a loser!

564
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,190
You just signed enid
white's death warrant.

565
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,650
Lieutenant, I need you to lock
the techco building down tight.

566
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,050
Nobody in, nobody out. It's vital.

567
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,330
Rossi, you really think the unsub's
still gonna be there after that call?

568
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,450
Of course. He thinks he has
all the time in the world.

569
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,970
You think they got an image off
the police security camera yet?

570
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,660
The security camera doesn't
work. I lied about that.

571
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,290
You lied about that?

572
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,020
He doesn't know.

573
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,390
Dave, that was incredibly reckless.

574
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,400
Hotch, he didn't weigh
the body down well.

575
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,490
What do you mean?

576
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,170
He didn't want michelle
found so quickly.

577
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,690
He screwed that up.

578
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,560
This kind of guy, when
he plans something,

579
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,900
if he has the time, if he's
in control, he's meticulous.

580
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,700
But being on the edge of the river, out
in the open, he was not in control.

581
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,430
He was in a hurry, and he made a mistake.

582
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,960
That's what you're hoping.

583
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,670
Trust me.

584
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,010
With an unsub like this, you
need to throw him off his game.

585
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,850
His hand needs to be forced.

586
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,880
I know that, dave, but the point
is, you did it by forcing ours.

587
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,220
- Is the building sealed?
- Top to bottom.

588
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,660
Yarbrough, make sure it stays that way.

589
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,110
Garcia, which floors did
michelle carlucci remodel?

590
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,430
Got
it--7,8,9.

591
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,460
Morgan, take 7.

592
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,150
We're looking for a
rank-and-file employee

593
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,010
who made a scene in the last
20 minutes or was here and gone.

594
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,110
Prentiss,8, reid,9.

595
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,700
Don't approach him. Just...

596
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,390
try to get a name, maybe a picture.

597
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,010
He's somewhere in this lobby.

598
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,630
Why?

599
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,060
Can't you feel it?

600
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,670
Display your credentials. Fbi.

601
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,260
He thinks we know what he looks like.

602
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,780
Yeah, reid?

603
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,950
Got him.

604
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,120
Sir?

605
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,610
Sir!

606
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,570
Max pool.

607
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,230
We have your address, max.
There's no place to go.

608
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,390
This is agent rossi, max.

609
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,700
If you do what you're thinking, you
won't get to tell them I lied.

610
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:53,830
Come on, max, slowly put your
hands on top of your head.

611
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,910
Listen to him, max.

612
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:58,010
I know what you're thinking
and you don't have to do it.

613
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,420
It doesn't have to end here, max.

614
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,210
Please.

615
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,000
Down!

616
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,950
- You OK?
- Yeah.

617
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,120
- He's gone.
- What about enid white?

618
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,290
We have his home address.

619
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,570
Is she there?

620
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,370
Let's hope so.

621
00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:00,670
<i><u>"Home" by Chris Daughtry</u></i>

622
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:54,290
You said out there, the
team shares everything.

623
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,750
That's right.

624
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,640
There is no I?

625
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,140
It seems a big thing to withhold.

626
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,820
Separating from your wife, your child.

627
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,180
What are you talking about?

628
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,760
You used to call haley 10 times a day.

629
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,400
We've been together 48 hours, I
haven't seen you call her once.

630
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,890
Haven't mentioned her.

631
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,740
And you're not going home now.

632
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,030
What's your point?

633
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:25,150
I guess you're just not used to sharing.

634
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:28,590
My private life is
not the same as a case.

635
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:33,130
I'm just saying, sharing
is a learned skill.

636
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,830
You know...

637
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,460
when this all started...

638
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,580
there were only a few of us.

639
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,870
We'd go out on the road alone.

640
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,190
We didn't... groupthink.

641
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,460
We don't groupthink.

642
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,680
We think as individuals, and we share
the thoughts with the rest of the team.

643
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,770
We don't write them down in a little
notebook and keep them to ourselves.

644
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,670
Dave.

645
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,840
All this-- the people we've
helped, the ones we've put away, it'S...

646
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,240
because of you and the
guys who started this unit,

647
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,040
who believed when nobody else did that

648
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,960
there was a way of understanding
these crimes and getting ahead of them.

649
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,100
And?

650
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,440
I don't see that you
have anything to prove.

651
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,500
You don't have to come back.

652
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,640
I know that.

653
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,750
So why?

654
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,600
Maybe I have unfinished business.
