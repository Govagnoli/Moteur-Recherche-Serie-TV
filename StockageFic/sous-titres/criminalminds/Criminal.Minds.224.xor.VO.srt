1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,650
Previously on criminal minds...

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,400
If the remains aren't related to the 
same killer,where's he been for 10 years?

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,810
Killing.Unsolved case files going back 30 years.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,560
The same M.O.Right rib bone is missing.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,460
I'm frank.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,030
I thought I'd seen the very worst of
 what humanity had to offer until you.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,620
A killing machine-- incapable of
 remorse,compassion,love.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,700
Early toxicological investigations of the
 victims' blood indicated high levels of ketamine.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,760
Ketamine is primarily a horse tranquilizer.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,810
Jane,run.

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,340
In street lingo it's known as being
 stuck in the "k" hole.

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,990
Whatever it is he came for is coming here 
to this diner.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,430
Jane.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,600
He has the children,jane.

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,450
Give me jane,and they'll have their children back.

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,390
With jane in my life,I will never harm
 another human being.

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,420
The most prolific serial killer ever.

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,280
- What do you want,honey?
- Oh,something flowery.

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,370
Flowery.Ok,well,help me out here.

20
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,020
Purple?

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,550
- Purple 
- Uh,maybe--maybe not purple.Uh-- 

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,670
- Come on,man.
- More of a mix of something.Um...

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,210
You're killing me here.Make up your mind.

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,070
- Just back off,pal.
- What did I do?

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,360
I wasn't talking to you.I guess roses.

26
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,660
- Are you on a date?
- No,uh,hold on-- hold on the roses,will you?

27
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,620
- And you didn't tell me?
- Tell you what?I'm not on a date.

28
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,050
- I'm just buying flowers.
- For who?

29
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,970
Old college friend.Hotch,tell me something.

30
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,570
- Do roses say the wrong thing?
- What do you want to say?

31
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,880
Welcome,hi,good to see you,sorry I'm so damn late.

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,550
Uh,roses say more than that.

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,940
Face it,buddy.You want some action,it's the roses.

34
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,490
She's right.

35
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,730
Do you have a yellow flower-- they're like,um-- 
they're little yellow flowers.

36
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,270
They look like dandelions or like weeds,
but they're not weeds.

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,790
They have a little black spot in the middle.But
 they don't have a black spot,they're sort of round and puffy.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,550
Button mums.

39
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,930
Do you have those?Can I see what those look like?

40
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,990
- It's a date.
- I'm not on a date...exactly.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,030
Well,how about some white stuff and...
you know,make it look...happy.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,840
- Baby's breath.
- Ok,great.Sorry!

43
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,740
I don't know what else,whatever looks good.

44
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,040
So what do you need?

45
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,500
I got a request from safe guard for
 personnel files on certain agents.

46
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,880
So it's an annual evaluation.Who cares?

47
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,360
It's 6 months early,jason.

48
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,670
It's not a routine evaluation.

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,320
I think it's an assessment of the B.A.U

50
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,910
They're redistributing funds,
they're making cuts in all departments.

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,770
So what are they going to take,the jet?
I prefer trains anyway.

52
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,690
Well,I think we may lose more than that.

53
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,580
It's been a hard year for us,jason.

54
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,090
You know.What happened to morgan in chicago.

55
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,990
We both know about reid's issues.
Elle greenaway's suspect killed.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,590
- It all adds up.
- To what?

57
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,770
The only file they didn't request was mine.

58
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,440
$30?What,are you kidding me?

59
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,250
- You should have seen the price of the roses.
- Oh,lord.

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,570
Thanks.Hey,hotch,you're the best
 unit chief I know.

61
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,660
Jason,I'm the only unit chief you know.

62
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,510
Look,you need a break.Go home,
kiss your family,and...

63
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,330
Impossible.

64
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,110
What?

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,120
I thought I...I thought--never mind.

66
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,080
We both need a break.

67
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,840
- Jason?
- Yeah?

68
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,550
Button mums are something you give your mother.

69
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,640
Yeah.

70
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,450
- Good night.
- Good night.

71
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,330
Have fun.

72
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,060
Sarah,sorry I'm so late.
I got caught up at the office.

73
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,670
What is your fascination with birds,jason?

74
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,170
Who is this?

75
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,970
Paintings of birds,etchings of birds,
books about birds.

76
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,650
Frank,please.Please don't hurt her.

77
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,170
Birders can be extremely single-minded 
in their pursuits.

78
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,520
Almost...obsessional.

79
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,910
She's innocent.She's somebody 
I knew a long time ago.

80
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,250
Are you obsessional,jason?

81
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,330
Do you lie awake at night and think about the...

82
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,520
- bird that got away?
- Please,frank.

83
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,020
Please don't involve her.

84
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,840
Have you seen my jane lately,jason?

85
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,710
I know she came here,to washington...

86
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,630
to find you.

87
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,120
- Frank...
- I want her back.

No Way Out: Part 2</font>

91
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,220
I choose my friends for their good looks 
my acquaintances for their good characters

92
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,540
my enemies for their good intellects. Oscar wilde.

93
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,950
I've never seen you like this.

94
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,370
You have not seen what I've seen.

95
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,970
You chose the B.A.U.

96
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,700
True.I enjoy my work.

97
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,380
Even when in the pursuit to understand why...

98
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,200
A person feels the compelling need to 

99
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,990
brutally torture,murder

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,980
and dismember a child,mother or father,

101
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,090
an entire family.

102
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:50,510
The unsubs,devoid of any morality,
humanity,remorse when caught,

103
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,910
often come to believe that we're the 
only ones who understand them.

104
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,010
And they're right.We do.

105
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,960
Otherwise...how could we catch them?

106
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,190
Tell me what happened friday...

107
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,400
after agent gideon called you.

108
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,740
About 7:15 I got a page requesting the B.A.U

109
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,980
At 181 arthur street.Agent gideon's apartment.

110
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,330
Hotch.

111
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,010
- Where's gideon?
- I called his cell.It's right there.

112
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,790
- It seems he left in a hurry.
- P.D.Thinks he did this?

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,660
They have 6 witnesses who saw him running down
 the street,covered in blood,wielding a gun.

114
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,270
Ok,he was probably chasing 
the son of a bitch who did do this.

115
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,390
Either way,we're under strict orders not to
 get in the way of the investigation.

116
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,520
Gideon's a suspect,we're his colleagues.

117
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,640
Conflict of interest.There's no way
 they'll ask for our help.

118
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,680
Which he needs badly right now.

119
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,330
- Well,who spoke to him last?
- I did,about 2 hours ago.

120
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,350
What did he say?

121
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,550
He said he was late for a date.

122
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,520
- Do we even know who she is?
- An old school friend.

123
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,240
We're conflicted out of the investigation.

124
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,260
We're just here to answer questions the M.P.D might
 have,so we need to assess what we can while we can.

125
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,610
Evisceration of the torso,
removal of various organs.

126
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,750
The guy's clearly a sexually sadistic psychopath.

127
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,310
He's well-versed with a scalpel.
He's done this before.

128
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,710
We need to at least get photos.

129
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,360
J.J.,Your cell phone-- get as many as you can 
as quickly as you can.Get them to garcia.

130
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,640
Oh,J.J...it's friday night.

131
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,370
The cute guy from counterterrorism...

132
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,780
3 cocktails in,I am looking at second base,
so this better be good.

133
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,220
It's far from good.

134
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,360
- Where are you?
- Gideon's apartment.

135
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,430
No sign of forced entry.Why?

136
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,030
Everything is as it was.

137
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,760
Nothing has been disturbed.

138
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,350
Wine poured but not drank.

139
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,860
The victim simply let the assailant in.

140
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,670
And why wouldn't she?She was waiting for gideon.
It's his home.

141
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,040
Forensics won't find any defensive wounds.Why?

142
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,740
Because she didn't defend herself.She couldn'T.

143
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,640
He came here looking for gideon and he found her.

144
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,530
Now,he knew he didn't have a lot of time,but...

145
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,000
here she is,and here he stands-- a sexual sadist.

146
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,340
A psychopath with the need to kill just
 as natural as his need to breathe.

147
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:46,960
He moved swiftly,every stroke of his blade exact,
from lower torso to throat.

148
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:52,190
She was awake the entire time,
until mercifully she passed away.

149
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,190
The toxicology report will find high levels 
of ketamine in her blood.

150
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,710
He opened her up,removed her lower-right 
rib bone,which is missing.

151
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,000
Prentiss,left hand.

152
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,490
That looks like part of the rib bone.

153
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,170
- It was a gift.
- It's human rib bones.

154
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,890
Frank's back.

155
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,950
If this is who we think it is,he took the
 rib bones as gifts to give to jane.

156
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,450
And yet this one he gave back to sarah.Why?

157
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,380
It's not for sarah,it's for us.It's a message.

158
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,860
What is that?

159
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,320
We need to tell the police what we found.

160
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,040
- Wait.
- For what?

161
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,570
If we know anything about frank,he wouldn't
 have left a trace of his dna in here.

162
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,930
There are a number of ways this scene could be
 interpreted,and all of them could indicate gideon.

163
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,970
As long as frank's out there,
we can't afford to stop and explain any of it.

164
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,120
Last time he did all of this for jane.

165
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,210
Well,things seem to have changed dramatically.

166
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,370
Maybe she's dead.They had a lovers' quarrel
 and he killed her?

167
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,010
If he came here looking for gideon,
maybe he found him.

168
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,480
Let's go find out where gideon went.

169
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,440
Hello?

170
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,530
Hello?Who is this?

171
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,450
- I nearly had him.
- Where are you?

172
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,200
I saw him walking off down the street.
He was just-- just walking.

173
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,910
He dropped something in the trash out
 in the street.

174
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,080
I couldn't get a clean shot.
The streets were too crowded.

175
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,370
- Was jane with him?
- No.

176
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,120
But I saw her when I was talking to you.

177
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,620
I saw her in the street seconds 
before he called me.

178
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,590
- He called you?
- He came after me.He came to my home.

179
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,280
Then he's out of his comfort zone,in a big city 
with feds who know what he looks like.

180
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,790
It's my fault.It's me he wanted.

181
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,030
And if I hadn't been late...she'd still be alive.

182
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,960
He butchered her,hotch.

183
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,080
- Jason...
- I'm coming in.

184
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,620
No.Do that and this investigation moves 
inside an interrogation room.

185
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,860
And by the time the cops catch up,
we're going to be looking at more dead bodies.

186
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,690
- Right.
- He's going to change who he goes after.He has to.

187
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,130
- I know.
- We know who frank is.

188
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,160
We don't know the why.

189
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,250
You help us find out the why and we'll catch him.

190
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,750
For that I'm going to need my files.

191
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,360
I'll have garcia bring them to you.

192
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,160
You find some place quiet where you can work.

193
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,360
And,jason...

194
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,590
we'll get him.

195
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,720
Frank had to have come out the same way 
down this street.

196
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,470
If they saw gideon,they saw frank.

197
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,980
Well,we know frank will do whatever it takes 
to blend in and not stand out.

198
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,270
Well,to avoid attracting attention,he would 
have simply walked calmly out of that crime scene.

199
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,360
The evisceration of sarah,though,
means he would have been soaked in her blood.

200
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,110
No,he had access to gideon's closet.

201
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,170
He cleans up,gets a change of clothes,he's out.

202
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,020
Yet he left no trace of evidence
 at the crime scene.

203
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,410
- Gideon said he dumped it en route.
- You spoke with gideon?

204
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,550
- Where is he,hotch?
- He's safe.

205
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,540
Well,that's all the proof we need,right?
We can turn him over to the M.P.D now.

206
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,790
By the time this comes back from the lab,
frank's long gone.

207
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,300
If the cops find out we're hiding evidence
 and a material witness from them-- 

208
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,480
We're not hiding evidence.
We'll give this to forensics,let them search for dna.

209
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,750
We'll look for frank.

210
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,400
- Agent morgan?
- What the hell?

211
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,210
They say beauty can cover a multitude of sins.

212
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,840
- What?
- But underneath it all...

213
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,040
we all look exactly the same.

214
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,860
That's frank.He said that to me in the diner.

215
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,300
Give me jane or I'll kill them all.

216
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,190
- Frank thinks we have jane?
- We need to find her fast.

217
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,040
Can I have my 10 bucks now?

218
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,840
Nervous whistles,stop it.Stop it,Everything is...

219
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,520
Everything cool,garcia.

220
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,660
Gorgeous tech kitten found in lonely...

221
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,480
dark parking lot.

222
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,940
Throat slashed,ear to ear.

223
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,230
Horrific.Tragic.

224
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,970
With the very files of one of the most
 prolific serial killers ever.

225
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,280
Tonight he remains at large,
the blood of quantico's finest-- 

226
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,870
Oh,god!Oh,my god!

227
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,360
- Drive.
- Right.Drive,yes,drive.Drive where?

228
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,930
- Just drive.
- Just drive,just drive.

229
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,800
Gideon saw jane just before frank called him.
If we find jane,we'll find frank.

230
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,750
Last time we found frank,he outsmarted us.

231
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,860
He took a busload of children hostage.
He gave us no options.

232
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,390
He's not going to give us any now.

233
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,510
Frank's message-- he said,I'll kill them all.
Who's he referring to?

234
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,280
- J.J.?
- Hey,uh,gideon had a book,a black leather-bound book.

235
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,890
Garcia discovered something.
It looks like the first page has been ripped out.

236
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,080
You can only really see what's left on the side of
 the page,but it's definitely gideon's handwriting.

237
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,910
- Looks like some kind of a list.
- It's his murder book.

238
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,970
Murder book?

239
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,970
When he opens it to the first page,
it reminds him y he does what he does.

240
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,060
It's a list of all the people he's ever saved.
Names,dates,personal details.

241
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,670
And now frank has the list.

242
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,370
Frank said,"I'll kill them all.
"That's who he's going after.

243
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,520
Yeah,at least the ones he can get to,
the ones that are nearby.

244
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,810
J.J.,Start locating all the possible targets.

245
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,440
- We need to call them and warn them.
- Got it

246
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,070
- Do we tell gideon?
- Absolutely not.

247
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,980
We need to find out who frank is first.

248
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,330
The Smithsinian lnstitute 
WASHINGTON.D.C

249
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,700
I'm sorry for your loss,jason.Truly.

250
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,550
Thank you very much for doing this.
You're a good friend.

251
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,460
Security knows you're here.Take care of him.

252
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,210
I grabbed everything I could find 
pertaining to the case.

253
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,210
Turdus polyglottus.Mockingbird.

254
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,700
They've provided insights into 
the origin of syntax.

255
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:27,400
Essential first steps into the evolution 
of human language.

256
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,570
If we stand any chance of stopping him,
we need to understand the evolution of frank.

257
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,970
What created him.

258
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,600
- Took these from gideon's office.
- What about jane?

259
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,690
I gave photos of jane and frank to all media 
outlets,and I'm liaising with washington M.P.D.

260
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,260
J.J.,If you locate her,make sure we're the 
first to interrogate her.Don't let P.D.Get to her.

261
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,870
- Is that wise?
- No,but it is an order.

262
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,630
Whatever you do,bring her here first.
She's the only one who knows who frank is.

263
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,920
So far we've narrowed it down to 
9 possible targets.

264
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,530
Their contact details are in the files.
Everybody grab a phone.

265
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,670
Let's start calling.

266
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,330
5 sugars.

267
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,890
I have a sweet tooth.

268
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,930
Thank you for coming,
but it really wasn't necessary.

269
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,350
We at the B.A.U Like to follow up on our victims.

270
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,330
She's in the basement downstairs!

271
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,130
Is the house on fire?

272
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,850
- Rebecca!
- Get me out of here.

273
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,540
Hurry!

274
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,080
Let's go,we've got no time.

275
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,060
I try not to think of myself as a victim.

276
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,140
That's good.Very healthy.

277
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,550
A sound strategy.

278
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,030
Oh,my,this is perfect.

279
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,180
I am glad to get a chance to personally thank you.

280
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:03,550
You wrote me this lovely letter.I keep it at home.

281
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,280
You were t only member of the team I didn't get a 
chance to meet face to face,agent gideon.

282
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,600
Please,call me jason.

283
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,130
Did you know recent studies into
 female rape victims found that 

284
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,170
a high proportion of them later in life
 are raped again?

285
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,410
No,I wasn't raped.

286
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,680
It's almost as if they emit a kind of...signal.

287
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,620
- But I wasn't raped.
- But you are on a list.

288
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,310
- A list?
- A list of lives saved.

289
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,310
How were you saved,rebecca?

290
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,780
What happened to you?

291
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,090
What happened?

292
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,900
Your letter was so...nonspecific.

293
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,750
- But don't you-
- Were you afraid?

294
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,700
I've never felt the feeling of fear.

295
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,810
Apparently I'M...incapable.

296
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,640
Tell me,rebecca.

297
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,600
What's it feel like-- fear?

298
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,740
I should get that.

299
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,080
Saved by the bell.

300
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,150
- Hello?
- Rebecca brian?

301
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,850
Hi,this is jennifer jareau with the fbi.

302
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,820
He's not agent gideon,is he?

303
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,350
Excuse me?

304
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,900
Rebecca,this is agent hotchner.

305
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,280
If you can,very calmly excuse yourself 
and get out of the house.

306
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,820
Can you do that?

307
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,810
Rebecca,just calmly hang up,
walk to your door,and leave.

308
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,050
Ok?Rebecca?

309
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,580
- What's going on?
- Rebecca...

310
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,930
Rebecca?

311
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,460
Rebecca?

312
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:55,240
Hi,I regret to inform you that rebecca's name
 should be moved to a new list.

313
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,930
Frank,we don't have her.We do not have jane.

314
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,750
I will not stop until I have her back.

315
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,850
Frank...frank!

316
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,470
FBI!

317
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,070
- Clear.
- Clear.

318
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,390
Hotch...nothing could have stopped this.

319
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,590
Guys...

320
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:05,020
we've got a note from frank.7 A.M.Union station.

321
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,040
All 8 other targets on that list are 
safe and accounted for.

322
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,710
Then we've missed someone or something.
Now that he's set a meeting-- 

323
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,670
He's going to raise the stakes.
Just like he did last time.

324
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,680
He's going to make it impossible for us to not
 trade jane for whoever he's got.

325
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,330
- Yeah,J.J?
- I think I found jane.

326
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,490
The beat cops picked up a woman who was ranting 
and raving about needing to talk to the B.A.U.

327
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,230
She,uh,assaulted one of the police officers.
She's being processed as we speak.

328
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,900
So what have we missed?

329
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,290
Frank's incapable of experiencing normal feelings.

330
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,740
- Yeah,but he takes what normal people hold sacred.
- Children.

331
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,540
J.J.,I'm going to have prentiss call you 
to find out where to pick up jane.

332
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,920
We'll all meet back at the B.A.U.
I'm going to wait for the crime scene unit.

333
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,960
I heard you.He's going after children now.

334
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,440
I also need you to look at relocations,
anything involving children.

335
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,550
Families that have moved into the D.C.Area
 since the case.

336
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,350
I'm on it.

337
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,830
This is hopeless.
We don't even know frank's surname.

338
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,400
But we do know the only person ever 
to survive abduction by frank.

339
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,300
Jane.He fell in love with her.

340
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,890
Oh,he was a psychopath.He's incapable 
of emotionally bonding with anyone.

341
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,930
Yet he was prepared to risk everything
 to have her.

342
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,420
Amongst all those he killed there
 has to be one constant

343
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,780
One repetitious act,a break from pattern.

344
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,210
One he's probably not even aware of.

345
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,600
If they don't come soon,
somebody's going to get hurt!

346
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,100
If you don't shut the hell up,you'll get hurt.

347
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,280
I would like to leave now!I don't want to be here.

348
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,210
Hello?Hello?Excuse me!

349
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,030
- Bitch,shut it.
- Please,I don't want to be in here!

350
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,550
Shut the hell up or I'll do it for you.

351
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,300
- Shut up!Shut up!
- Hey,knock it off!Jane.

352
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,820
- Come in here and get this mouthy bitch out of here.
- Back off!

353
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,920
- Agent prentiss,fbi.
- Fbi?

354
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,430
Do you remember me?From nevada?

355
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,720
- I asked for agent gideon.
- We know.

356
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,770
We'll bring you to him.

357
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,330
I told you!

358
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,880
Agent gideon's right,you know.

359
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,780
Frank,he can't feel love.

360
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,710
He wants to,but he can'T.

361
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,680
He's coming for me,you know?

362
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,390
He's already here.

363
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,390
Tracey belle.

364
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,000
Hotchner.

365
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,570
Hotch,tracey belle and her family relocated 
to mclean,virginia,8 months ago.

366
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,130
It--it's her,hotch.She's the only one 
who's unaccounted for.

367
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,730
Belle Residence 
McLEAN,VIRGINIA

368
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,900
FBI!

369
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,550
Get the unit crime scene team.

370
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,130
That's my house.

371
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,460
- Mr.Belle? 
- You have to let us in.

372
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,170
- My daughter's in there.
- You can't go in right now.

373
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,370
Where's tracey?Where is she?

374
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,910
What's important to know right now 
is tracey is alive,ok?

375
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,700
- Your daughter's alive-
- Sir--sir!She's not in there.She's not in there.

376
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,140
I promise you we will find her,
and she's going to be fine.

377
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,330
- No,no,no...
- It's ok.

378
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,650
No,no,no.No...

379
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,240
Did I do the right thing by coming here?

380
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,550
Yes,you did the right thing.

381
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,170
Please,sit down.

382
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,320
Is that my bag?

383
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,560
- Tell us something good,reid.
- We have jane.

384
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,790
- That's good news.
- Not entirely.

385
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,690
Frank hasn't hurt anyone,has he?

386
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,540
He wouldn't do that.

387
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,690
Not while he has me.

388
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,640
He doesn't have you.We do.

389
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,460
- He came after agent gideon.
- Why did you leave frank?

390
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,600
What...changed?

391
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:04,030
He did.Frank changed.

392
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,380
He changed just like agent gideon said.

393
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:12,970
And he was so angry with agent gideon because
 he knows frank better than anyone else.

394
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,840
And frank knows that,too.

395
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,020
Frank wants agent gideon to stop him,doesn't he?

396
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,260
Well,if anyone can,agent gideon can.

397
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:27,510
- Not without you,jane.
- What do you mean?

398
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,300
Considering the 3 factors of determined behavior-- 
bio,psycho,social...

399
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,770
- Sir-
- First,biology.

400
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,220
Genetics gave him the predisposition.
Add to that the second factor,psychology.

401
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,160
- Clearly a psychopath.
- Ok.

402
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,860
That's the filter through 
which he experiences his environment.

403
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,100
Finally,socialization-- life experiences.

404
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,060
Like all of us,he's a complicated
 manifestation of all 3.

405
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,140
So you put that all together and...

406
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,600
think of frank as a living murder weapon.

407
00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:01,770
His genetics load the gun,his psychology aims it,
the environment pulls the trigger.

408
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,790
That's why his victims are so important.
We study them.

409
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,570
- They reflect back on him.
- Ok.He killed mostly women.

410
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,330
Since he used a trailer,their occupations,
locations,and ages are all over the place.

411
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,220
Plot out the ages.

412
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:23,990
Um,he killed 43 in their 50s,51 in their 40s,
64 in their 30s,and 12 in their 20s.

413
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,730
- 12?
- Is that odd?

414
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,700
Precedent tells us the number of victims 
should rise as the age falls.

415
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,370
So it's a break from pattern.Why?

416
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,040
He wasn't attracted to them.

417
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,330
No,that doesn't make any sense because 
he doesn't feel attraction or love.

418
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,230
No,no,no,no.You're onto something.

419
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,540
That's great,I don't know what.

420
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:48,290
- Who was the only victim he didn't kill?
- Jane.

421
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,120
She was 22 when frank first abducted her.

422
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,790
And through the years he kept on coming back.

423
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,200
Kept visiting her,bringing her gifts,
making sure she was ok.

424
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Mother protects her children.

425
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,520
In frank's case,it was vice versa.

426
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,000
He didn't kill jane because he sees 
her as his mother.

427
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,780
Tell me about frank.Where's he from?

428
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,970
- Manhattan.
- Manhattan?You sure?

429
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,070
Yes,I'm sure!

430
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,930
He talked about it all the time.

431
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,040
He told me where he lived and 
how he grew up,everything.

432
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,900
He wanted me to know everything.

433
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,800
Did he ever say where in manhattan?

434
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,700
He lived with his mother.She was german.

435
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:41,550
Breitkopf.Mary breitkopf.

436
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,660
And frank never knew his father.

437
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,820
So he uses his mother's name?

438
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,830
And she would take him every sunday

439
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,870
to the fair on long island.

440
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,430
He talked about her constantly.

441
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,370
And they would have dinner parties,
and--and frank would dress up,

442
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,380
and he would be the barman,
and he would serve all the guests...

443
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,820
cocktails.

444
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,500
Jane,when you were with frank,
did he ever hurt anyone else?

445
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:23,020
Being on the run can be very romantic,you know.

446
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,660
Did frank try to kill anyone else?

447
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,500
- Is it wrong?
- Is what wrong?

448
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,430
Loving frank?

449
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,850
Uh,you don't choose who you fall in love with.

450
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:48,630
Maybe you thought you could change him.
And you did,too,for a time.

451
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,700
Yes.

452
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,580
Until the desire to kill overwhelmed him.
And you saw that,didn't you,jane?

453
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:57,250
- You saw it in him.
- Yes.

454
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,730
Who did he try to kill?

455
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,700
Me.

456
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,100
But he stopped himself.
We had an argument...

457
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:13,200
and I screamed at him,
and I said that gideon was right

458
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,130
and he became so angry.

459
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,550
And I had to run here.

460
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,990
But as long as he's trying to find me,
he won't kill again.

461
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,900
He has already.

462
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,640
And he's not going to stop until he gets you back.

463
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,290
- Oh-
- I'm sorry.

464
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,740
Got it.Thanks,hotch.

465
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,550
Mother's name is mary breitkopf from manhattan.

466
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,410
Wait.

467
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,020
The diner.

468
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,480
Adam and eve on a raft,sink 'em,and a strawberry 
shake for the gentleman at table 8.

469
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,870
Ah,finally,you walk into my life.
What took you so long,handsome?

470
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,010
Honey?

471
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,140
- Mind if I sit here?
- Please.

472
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,870
He was obsessed with facts.

473
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,710
Recent record lows have sent desert floor 
temperatures plummeting into single digits.

474
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,960
He said something about manhattan.

475
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,030
15 million people inhabit manhattan.

476
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,580
Did you know that?

477
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:26,310
- I read about a woman whose body was found 
- In her apartment,upper east side.

478
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,480
That was the only thing he said that
 genuinely seemed to move him.

479
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,250
- He was talking about his mother.
- Mary breitkopf.

480
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,300
He said his parents named him frank.

481
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:46,530
- I'm frank.Germanic,third century...
- third century.

482
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,220
Derived from the name of a type of spear.

483
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:54,380
- I wonder what aspirations...
- my parents had for me.

484
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,150
German mother,probably immigrated to
 this country in the fifties.

485
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,750
If he likens jane to his mother...

486
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,790
then she must have been in her late teens 
when she arrived in manhattan.

487
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,830
I've got 3 mary breitkopfs living in upper 
east side during the fifties and sixties.

488
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,510
- Jane said she was a lawyer.
- No lawyers here.

489
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,840
A 52-year-old mary louise breitkopf.
She died of cancer,1973.

490
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,750
Tailor's assistant.Mary breitkopf,nurse.

491
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,580
Killed in a traffic accident.Mary breitkopf...

492
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,090
What?

493
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,260
This mary breitkopf was arrested...63 times.

494
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,040
- What for?
- Solicitation.She was a hooker.

495
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,220
- Is she deceased?
- Uh,no.No death certificate.

496
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,310
Uh,she's alive and living in manhattan.

497
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,570
Search for a story involving a woman found dead 
in her apartment-- dead for over a year.

498
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,310
- Upper east side,manhattan.
- Zip.Nothing.

499
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,790
So it never happened.

500
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,080
Frank's been hiding her existence from everyone.

501
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,580
Why?

502
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,640
Yeah?

503
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,140
Garcia,get me jason.I have someone
 who wants to talk to him.

504
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,700
It's for you.

505
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,950
- Yeah?
- Jason?

506
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,460
- Who's this?
- It's tracey belle.

507
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,250
Go ahead,tracey.Its ok.

508
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,750
Please,mr.Gideon...you saved me once.

509
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,210
- Don't you remember?
- Of course I remember you.

510
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,530
How could I ever forget you?

511
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,640
Tracey,everything's going to be all right.

512
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,870
Please,I'm scared.I just want my mommy.

513
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:29,430
Please.Please!

514
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,740
- Jason.
- You son of a bitch.

515
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,710
I swear to you I will find you 
and I will stop you.

516
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,530
Jason.

517
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,520
I chose e station because 
I know how much you love trains.

518
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,140
I saw the toys in your apartment.

519
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,960
I--I can't trace that call.It wasn't long enough,
and even if it was,I--I can't triangulate it

520
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:02,120
um,what do you want me to do?Talk to me,
please.Tell me what I can-- 

521
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:05,850
Call hotch.Read that to him.He'll know what to do.

522
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,740
- What are you going to do?
- End this.

523
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,700
Union Station WASHINGTON,D.C.

524
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,790
Anybody got eyes on the target?

525
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,550
Nothing.

526
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,440
Did gideon say where he was going?

527
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,260
He'll be here.

528
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,270
- In what capacity?
- What's that supposed to mean?

529
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,220
As an agent or an executioner?

530
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,100
12 o'clock.Platform 11.Target.Target east side.

531
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:12,300
I have eyes on the target,
and I have a clear shot.Over.

532
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,350
We're about to find out.

533
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,220
Hold your fire.I repeat,hold your fire.
There are civilians on the platform.

534
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,650
Let's go!Go!Back,all of you back off!
We need you out of here!

535
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,660
2087 E.78th St UPPER EAST SIDE,MANHATTAN
It's right this way.

536
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,220
Whoa,hey.

537
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,290
No matter what happens this time,
we don't split up,clear?

538
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,490
Crystal clear.

539
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,230
Frank.

540
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,610
Agent hotchner,we haven't had the pleasure
 of a formal meeting.

541
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,090
Where's tracey belle?

542
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,410
Do you have something for me?

543
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,690
No,I don'T.

544
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,230
Then you'll never see her again.

545
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,270
Go ahead and bring her in.

546
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,450
- Jane.
- Where's tracey,frank?

547
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,340
- Wait here.
- Yes,ma'am.

548
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,160
Did you think I wouldn't come looking for you?

549
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,690
You killed 2 innocent women.

550
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,600
Without you,I am lost.

551
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,400
Tracey,frank.

552
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,400
Not until we're safely away.

553
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,360
Stop it,frank.I'm not coming.

554
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,320
It's you and me-- forever.

555
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,250
I can't go with you.

556
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,440
I will never be taken by these...people.

557
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:59,060
And without you,I will not stop,not ever.

558
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,790
Sarah was a doctor.

559
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,470
- She was a mother of 3 boys.
- Hello,jason.

560
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,840
She worked and ran a treatment center for
 patients with terminal cancer.

561
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,090
Do you know the birder's term "twitching," jason?

562
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,000
She dedicated her life to easing
 the pain of others.

563
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,090
The pursuit of a previously located rare bird.

564
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,270
You took the lives of hundreds.

565
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,580
All because your mother was a whore?

566
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:30,700
Mary louise breitkopf,single mother,
german immigrant

567
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,770
lived on the upper east side of manhattan.

568
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:38,940
She gave birth to her only son,frank breitkopf,
a bright but ultimately strange boy.

569
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,400
A boy that only a mother could love.

570
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:47,810
His needs were such that even the 3 jobs she worked 
didn't provide for this special child.

571
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,540
A child she would not let out near the world

572
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,850
When******

573
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,370
and the boy witnessed every single
 terrible visitation.

574
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,640
You're not a rare bird,frank.

575
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,050
Nothing special about you.

576
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,380
You're common,pedestrian...boring.

577
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:16,130
Jane.This world,we don't fit in it.

578
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,060
No one understands what we are.

579
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,380
Jane,he sees you as his mother.

580
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,010
Nothing more,nothing less.

581
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,590
Have you ever been happier than 
when you've been with me?

582
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,210
Never.

583
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:31,330
- Didn't we have fun?
- Jane!

584
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,420
- So much!
- Come with me now.

585
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,790
It doesn't have to end here.

586
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,700
Jane!

587
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:46,030
- I love you.
- I love you,too.

588
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,080
Jane,jane!Jane!

589
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,970
Hang on a second.I'm walking to him.

590
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,330
Just one second.Here he is.

591
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,110
It's for you.

592
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:11,500
- Hello?
- Agent gideon?

593
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:15,900
- Tracey.
- I just wanted to call and thank you.

594
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:19,450
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

595
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:45,340
Once again the team had battled a monster and won.

596
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,630
The future of the B.A.U.is not
 in the balance here.

597
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,790
The residual impact as a result of the
 investigations into the crimes 

598
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,730
and criminals you pursue is.

599
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,670
Every cause has its effect.

600
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,360
You think I don't know that?

601
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,550
I believe you are no longer effective
 in your post.

602
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,840
The modern furniture,the strategically
 placed magazines,the framed diplomas

603
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,990
the art on the wall,are all in conflict 
with your family photos.

604
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,240
You have 3 children,
but you favor the middle one,your son.

605
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,230
- What do you think you're doing?
- Of course you love all your children

606
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,960
- but not like your son.
- That's enough.

607
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,760
The bonsai you obsessively nurture is to compensate
 for feelings of failure as a mother.

608
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,280
Agent hotchner,I said that is enough.

609
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,690
My position is not in question here.

610
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,090
As your superior,I am questioning your 
ability to lead your team.

611
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,490
My team?Let me tell you about my team.

612
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,010
Agent morgan fought to protect his identity 
from the very people who could save him-- why?

613
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:47,300
Because trust has to be earned,and there 
are very few people he truly trusts.

614
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,160
Reid's intellect is a shield which 
protects him from his emotions

615
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,640
and at the moment his shield is under repair.

616
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,520
Prentiss overcompensates because 
she doesn't yet feel she's a part of the team.

617
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,880
She needn't worry.

618
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,420
Every day,agent jareau fields dozens 
of requests for our team.

619
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,480
And every night she goes home hoping 
she's made the right choices.

620
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,630
Garcia fills her office with figurines and color
 to remind herself to smile as the horrofills her screens.

621
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,920
And agent gideon,in many ways,is damned
 by his profound knowledge of others.

622
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,900
Which is why he shares so little of himself,yet
 he pours his heart into every case we handle.

623
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,280
I stand by my actions,and I stand by my team.

624
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:38,980
And if you think that you can find 
a better person for the job,good luck.

625
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,770
Agent hotchner.

626
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,850
How do I know you favor your son?

627
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,450
I'm good at my job.

628
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:53,360
I put you in the B.A.U.
I knew how badly you wanted it.

629
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,090
Everyone did.

630
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,490
You were never exactly shy about letting us know.

631
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,370
But there were those who didn't think assigning
 you to the B.A.U was a good idea.

632
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,200
They thought you were too reckless.

633
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,260
I believed in you,however.

634
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,650
It's time to pay back the faith I had.

635
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,700
Your team is in trouble.

636
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,010
They've lost sight of the big picture.

637
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:23,370
I believe they are reckless 
and at times out of control.

638
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,730
It's time for agent hotchner's career 
to come to an end.

639
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:36,930
And if you want to stay in the B.A.U.
agent prentiss

640
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,920
you're going to help me make that happen.
