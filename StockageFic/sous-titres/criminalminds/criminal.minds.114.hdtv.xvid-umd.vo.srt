1
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:17,320
Sarah Jean and Jacob Dawes butchered what? Twelve girls?

2
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:20,495
Thirteen counting the girl that was just found.

3
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,000
Hilary Dickson.

4
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:24,942
Disappeared 15 years ago.

5
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:27,542
Buried her under Sarah's mother's living room.

6
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:29,145
You think that was the last victim?

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,003
Well, that's what we are here to find out.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,128
There is nothing about the dynamics of Sarah Jean and Jacob's relationship.

9
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,386
The state isn't interested in dynamics or profiles,

10
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:42,453
they just want this case to go away.

11
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:44,694
They were caught, they confessed, they got the death penalty.

12
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:48,672
You guys do realize that visiting death rows is not part of my job description?

13
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:52,616
Garcia, this will be the first serial killer couple ever recorded for VICAP.

14
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:56,652
They slaughtered 13 young girls with blond hair, hello?!

15
00:00:56,687 --> 00:00:58,709
Sarah Jean Dawes.

16
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:01,092
Media called her the 'ice queen'.

17
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,268
That's how they interpreted her demeanor during the trial.

18
00:01:04,303 --> 00:01:07,013
- You see it different?
- Na, I didn't say that.

19
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:09,724
She killed her 2 year old son and 12 teenage girls.

20
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,284
She only confessed to the murder of her son Riley.

21
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,340
Well, she hasn't cooperated with any request to interview her.

22
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:19,418
Well, if she doesn't talk now, she's going to take that story with her to old sparky.

23
00:01:27,556 --> 00:01:29,698
For the next 36 hours,

24
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:33,525
a guard will remain outside your cell.

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,099
Your personal effects will be along shortly.

26
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:42,303
You will remain in the death watch cell until the hour of execution.

27
00:01:42,338 --> 00:01:47,388
Your last meal cannot exceed $20.

28
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:50,100
It will be a full moon tomorrow.

29
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:52,478
Is there any chance I could see it?

30
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,414
That's against regulations.

31
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,671
Open on 4.

32
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:37,709
Here it is.

33
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:41,684
They call themselves 'the women of Jacob'.

34
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:44,487
Trying to look like his victims.

35
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:46,635
Creepy.

36
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:50,700
There's only 12 of them.

37
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:53,441
Should we tell them they're one short?

38
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:55,819
At least.

39
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:04,246
I think we will find Hilary Dickson was by no means Jacob's last victim.

40
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:55,509
"Whoso sheddeth a man's blood,

41
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:58,101
by man shall his blood be shed"

42
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:02,005
Genesis 9:6.

43
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:09,705
1985, there's a string of missing girls reported in Northern Florida.

44
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,056
Police subsequently got an anonymous call

45
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:14,721
from a woman claiming to have seen Jacob with some of the girls.

46
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:16,768
Did they ever find out who the anonymous woman was?

47
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:17,405
No.

48
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:18,748
Police interviewed Jacob Dawes,

49
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:22,745
also present with Sarah Jean Dawes and their 2 year old son Riley.

50
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,500
Police was suspicious they came back 3 hours later with a search warrant

51
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:27,459
only to find that Riley had vanished.

52
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:30,780
They also eventually found the dismembered bodies of 12 missing girls

53
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:33,812
buried in the ground underneath Jacob's workshop.

54
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:35,487
Fearing that the police were on to them

55
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:37,092
Jacob figured Riley would slow them down

56
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:40,707
so he ordered Sarah Jean to kill him and dispose of the body.

57
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:43,860
Sarah confessed to killing Riley but

58
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:46,301
never admitted her role on the deaths of the girls.

59
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:47,888
Ya, but she never denied it either.

60
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:50,589
Well according to Jacob, Sarah Jean was fully complicit in the targeting

61
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,302
abduction, and murder of all 12 and well, now 13 victims.

62
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:57,981
Prison records show that Jacob is a sexual psychopath.

63
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:00,047
It were inconclusive on Sarah Jean though,

64
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,709
they said her demeanor was more like that of a war victims?

65
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:04,829
And as with all sexual psychopaths,

66
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:08,523
Jacob is obsessed with the idea of the total possession of his victims.

67
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,117
He's shown no remorse or guilt.

68
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:12,183
Oh, well, Jacob saw Sarah Jean as a possession,

69
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:14,568
somebody to control, to dominate.

70
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:16,902
Just so we're clear, they have agreed to these interviews?

71
00:05:16,937 --> 00:05:17,157
Yes sir.

72
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:19,217
Oh, we- I'm sorry, who are you exactly?

73
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,242
I'm Sam Shapiro, their appeal's attorney.

74
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:26,013
Not only have they agreed to them, they were initially requested by them.

75
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:27,666
Ya, I can't get them a stay of execution.

76
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:30,720
Garcia, remember 75% of all communication-

77
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:31,763
Is non-verbal.

78
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,607
Hotch interview Jacob, Morgan, El-

79
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:35,354
I'm not going to get anything new but...

80
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:36,135
Well, find out a way to ask.

81
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,049
696 Hennessy Street, Jacob and Sarah Jean's home

82
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:41,606
stood for demolition. Take a look around.

83
00:05:58,077 --> 00:06:01,174
Jacob's workshop is out the back.

84
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:05,442
He claimed that Sarah Jean would lure the victims from mall parking lots.

85
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:07,677
She'd invite them to smoke pot in her truck.

86
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:11,151
They'd find Jacob but no pot.

87
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:12,853
They bring them here.

88
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:17,638
I studied this case, I'll never forget it.

89
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:20,251
This is where the workshop stood.

90
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:22,795
There was an arch right here.

91
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,266
He used his workspace as a torture room.

92
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,623
The marks on the bodies match many of his tools.

93
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:32,946
He used the bench saw to dismember the bodies.

94
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:36,833
And then, he buried them under the floor.

95
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:40,271
Until he ran out of room.

96
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:45,958
We know that Jacob was abused as a child. What about Sarah Jean?

97
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:48,917
Her mother refused to give any testimony in her defense.

98
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:50,653
She never talked to anybody.

99
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:52,319
Maybe she's willing to talk now.

100
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,931
Let's go pay Sarah Jean's mother a visit.

101
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:57,487
We call this the 'dead man valley'.

102
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:01,126
Did she have any contact with Jacob?

103
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:04,119
Well, until today she's declined contact with anyone.

104
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:08,115
For her own safety, we keep her away from the other prisoners.

105
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,989
The hate for this woman is as fresh today, as it was 15 years ago.

106
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:15,884
Open on 4.

107
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:29,224
Accomplished work.

108
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,431
I've had plenty of time.

109
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:42,410
What is it that you want to know?

110
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:47,667
I think it's time the mothers of those girls learn why their children had to die.

111
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:50,947
Don't you?

112
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:56,612
Hello?

113
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:02,836
Anybody? Hello!

114
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:05,893
Mrs. Mason?

115
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,499
Ya?

116
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,994
Are you Sarah Jean Dawes mother?

117
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,617
Who the hell are you?

118
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:15,347
FBI. We are from the behavior analysis unit.

119
00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:20,895
My daughter and her son of a bitch husband buried a 13 year old girl under my floor.

120
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,101
What more do you need to know?

121
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,339
Ma'am, Sarah Jean has agreed to meet with our colleges

122
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:27,482
to talk about why they killed those girls.

123
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:31,685
We'd like some background information, if you don't mind.

124
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,380
Extensive remodeling.

125
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,081
Jacob built the original extension?

126
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,255
I see he liked arches.

127
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,203
Teenage girls, that's what he liked.

128
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:51,532
How was Sarah Jean growing up?

129
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,827
Fine, until she met Jacob.

130
00:08:56,427 --> 00:09:00,901
She was shy and quiet.

131
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:02,244
And also smart.

132
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,985
And her relationship with her father?

133
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:11,228
Was Sarah Jean ever abused?

134
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:14,120
He was strict.

135
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:16,552
He was a military man. they-

136
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:19,914
They didn't always see eye to eye.

137
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:23,241
That's all history. He's dead.

138
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:27,194
She's about to die.

139
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:33,265
Mrs. Mason, if we better understand the dynamics of her relationships,

140
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,834
we can get a better idea of why and what actually happened.

141
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:37,510
Dynamics?

142
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:41,552
Well, it might answer why Jacob never killed Sarah Jean.

143
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:44,268
They shared something.

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,080
They shared pain.

145
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:51,443
How strict was your husband?

146
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:53,967
How did he discipline Sarah Jean? Was he physical?

147
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:56,675
He was a mean bastard,

148
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,665
but he only hurt me.

149
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,585
Why didn't you leave?

150
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,993
Because we had no place to go.

151
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:07,982
An anonymous caller tipped the police off about Jacob, was it you?

152
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:13,163
No. But I know who it was.

153
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:22,281
This came this morning.

154
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:28,939
What's it say?

155
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:33,023
It's a statement of innocence.

156
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:39,545
A doctor, so young.

157
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,236
Your mother must be very proud.

158
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:43,758
Sarah Jean!

159
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:46,246
Sarah Jean!

160
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:50,294
You look so fine, baby cakes.

161
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:52,980
This was meant to be, our names will live forever!

162
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:54,322
Let's go.

163
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:55,789
- It's a beautiful thing!
- Let's go!

164
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:59,739
Listen, it's a beautiful thing!

165
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,357
You designed that to happen.

166
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:10,454
Did you learn anything, agent?

167
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,621
You want to see a trick?

168
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,178
Pick a card.

169
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:29,002
You're a diagnosed psychopath.

170
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:31,709
Sexual psychopath.

171
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:32,762
Now pick a card.

172
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:34,963
How many other girls did you kill?

173
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:39,282
Do you ever smile?

174
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,490
I mean, it's hard to trust a guy who never smiles.

175
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:44,036
Are there more bodies?

176
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,512
If I told you that,

177
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:49,046
what would I have left for myself?

178
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:52,265
You can help these families get closure before you die.

179
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,351
Oh...

180
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:57,295
Pass.

181
00:11:57,686 --> 00:12:01,965
Come on, just one trick.

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,847
It's a good one.

183
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:05,496
Pick a card.

184
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,076
Come on.

185
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:10,740
Just one card.

186
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:13,445
So what did you see in Jacob?

187
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,448
Freedom.

188
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:18,227
Freedom from what?

189
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,513
Garcia.

190
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:24,220
<i>Hey, it's El.</i>

191
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:24,825
Hey, El.

192
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,902
<i>I need Gideon, please.</i>

193
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:27,806
Yeah, I'll pass you through.

194
00:12:27,974 --> 00:12:31,237
Gideon, it's El. She says it's urgent.

195
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:34,257
<i>We're at the mother's house.</i>

196
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,849
<i>She gave me a letter. I want to read to you.</i>

197
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,635
Read the letter, El.

198
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,083
Mom, I know how difficult

199
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:44,609
this must be.

200
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,616
Things between us were never what they should be

201
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:47,857
between a mother and a daughter.

202
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,764
That is a private letter.

203
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:52,206
I want you to know that the best part of me the most important part of me

204
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:54,852
is now in a better place than you and I will ever be.

205
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:55,811
Stop it!

206
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:56,614
I'm responsible

207
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,714
for the death of those girls.

208
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:01,515
I neglected my duties as a woman and as a mother.

209
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,309
Stop it!

210
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:03,656
Take it easy.

211
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:13,619
Neglected your duty?

212
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:15,519
That doesn't make you responsible.

213
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:18,398
You didn't kill those girls.

214
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:26,293
Why didn't you say this in court?

215
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:30,128
I know he brought women back to his workshop.

216
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:35,757
It's a long way from knowing he was killing them.

217
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:41,512
They died as a result of my neglect.

218
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,135
This letter suggests to me,

219
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:53,430
that an innocent woman is about to be executed for crime she did not commit.

220
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,956
They died as a result of my neglect.

221
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:05,345
<i>This letter suggests to me,</i>

222
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:11,150
<i>that an innocent woman is about to be executed for crime she did not commit.</i>

223
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,003
I could tell you right now, it's not enough to get a stay.

224
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:16,430
Well, facts. Reid.

225
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:19,510
Human sexuality is a complex dynamic of three components.

226
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:22,295
Biological, physiological, and emotional.

227
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,442
Jacob's needs were informed by the emotional, sexual abuse

228
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:26,980
that he received at the hand of his mother.

229
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:30,422
Long term appetitive abuse informed the template of his love map.

230
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:32,799
Something we refer to as a signature.

231
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,269
Jacob was an only child-

232
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:36,318
Thus he was alone when the abused occurred.

233
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:41,363
So in order for him to fulfill his fantasy he has got to be alone with his victims.

234
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:45,062
<i>If I told you that what would I have left for myself?</i>

235
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:46,329
He said myself.

236
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:49,198
If Sarah Jean was present, it would have destroyed his fantasy.

237
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:50,898
She confessed to killing her son.

238
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,776
Yes, true.

239
00:14:51,777 --> 00:14:54,044
But we are also convinced that she is the anonymous caller

240
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,124
that made the phone call that nailed Jacob.

241
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,077
Guilt-ridden, filled with remorse, she called the police.

242
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,995
It's not the profile of a woman who would then kill a child.

243
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,236
- What else do you need?
- Evidence.

244
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:08,557
If we prove Jacob killed Riley, would that get a stay?

245
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:10,948
Absolutely.

246
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:14,607
She protects the painting, she protects the boy.

247
00:15:14,642 --> 00:15:16,345
What?

248
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,307
Paintings are her statement.

249
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:21,905
We need to figure out what they say.

250
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:29,707
Tension is mounting here as the FBI's BAU team presence means

251
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,704
that they're conducting a series of deathbed interviews

252
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:35,632
in an attempt to find if there are anymore victims.

253
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:39,174
<i>Now it is rumored they're calling for a stay of execution.</i>

254
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,052
Who the hell told them that?

255
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:44,379
It doesn't matter. I don't see Hotch getting anything out of Jacob.

256
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:49,423
<i>Up to the very last minute, the last second.</i>

257
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,046
Maybe I can help.

258
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:53,590
What are you doing?

259
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,593
Uh, just get Hotch in here.

260
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:10,002
Oh, I know I know. One day, these are going to kill me.

261
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:14,914
Come on, Hotch! That was funny!

262
00:16:18,163 --> 00:16:21,414
And who are you?

263
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:23,773
My friends call me JJ.

264
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:26,097
- Well, hello-
- Sit down.

265
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:28,024
Sit down.

266
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,003
Hello, JJ.

267
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:34,306
You're not my friend.

268
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:36,575
You can call me Jennifer.

269
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:38,886
Ouch.

270
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:49,611
Um... Sorry about before.

271
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:53,050
You know, breaking your ear thing.

272
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:58,717
You have a lovely smile.

273
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,142
Thank you.

274
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:04,743
But you don't smile much.

275
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:06,303
Do you?

276
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:09,216
What's your excuse?

277
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,798
I took the liberty of getting these from your cell.

278
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,316
No, those are private.

279
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:16,718
Thank you.

280
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,609
Riley running free.

281
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:34,120
The river. Falling positive energy maybe.

282
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:39,015
Twelve roses. One for each girl Jacob killed.

283
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,696
Twelve not thirteen.

284
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:44,307
We found number 13.

285
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:46,721
You didn't know about her.

286
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:48,086
You didn't really know about any of them.

287
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:51,501
I never said I did.

288
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,780
That was a nice touch bringing in the hottie.

289
00:17:56,815 --> 00:18:00,661
You really want to know if there was others, don't you?

290
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:03,251
I'll tell you what.

291
00:18:03,286 --> 00:18:05,771
Draw a book, you win,

292
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:07,042
I'll give you another girl.

293
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:08,474
So there are more.

294
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:10,646
Do we have a bet?

295
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,783
What if you win?

296
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:19,960
I get to smell Jennifer's hair.

297
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:20,992
Oh, come on!

298
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:23,268
All she has to do is lean over and I get to smell her hair.

299
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,756
No.

300
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,148
- I thought you wanted answers.
- Go to hell.

301
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:32,657
It's okay, Hotch.

302
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:36,272
You see that?

303
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:39,217
It's okay, Hotch.

304
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:48,081
JJ deals.

305
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:52,041
Can't let you deal from your own deck.

306
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:04,170
You confessed to killing Riley.

307
00:19:04,664 --> 00:19:06,933
Why would you lie about killing your own son?

308
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:08,982
I didn't.

309
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:12,372
Well, where's the body?

310
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:15,433
Do you have any children?

311
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:17,446
That's irrelevant.

312
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:20,382
Do you carry pictures of your children, agent Gideon?

313
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,109
We are getting off point.

314
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:23,900
Are we?

315
00:19:24,394 --> 00:19:29,302
You know how long it's been since I could actually play with someone?

316
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:32,558
All I've had is solitaire.

317
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:36,017
- Cards?
- Two.

318
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:47,154
I think I'll play these.

319
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:54,258
How old would your son be now?

320
00:19:55,719 --> 00:20:00,520
17? Imagine what he could have become.

321
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:05,287
Jacob put an end to any chance of that.

322
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:09,408
Does the strain of your work effect your marriage?

323
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:13,155
- I'm not married.
- You were, right?

324
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,889
Why would you still be protecting Jacob?

325
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:22,900
Did you divorce because of putting people like me away?

326
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:25,732
I think you're innocent.

327
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,668
We are all guilty of something.

328
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,267
But it's...

329
00:20:32,302 --> 00:20:37,398
It's our children who suffers for our sins, isn't it?

330
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:39,751
You'd have to ask him.

331
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:42,792
How old is he?

332
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:46,569
He's 25.

333
00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:49,446
Do you have a picture of him?

334
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,661
In my office.

335
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,620
You don't carry him with you?

336
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,633
No.

337
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:58,094
To protect him.

338
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:02,344
You want to leave him somewhere safe,

339
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,631
somewhere clean.

340
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:08,234
You killed Riley to protect him from Jacob?

341
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:12,115
I protect my son as you protect yours.

342
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,649
Where's he buried?

343
00:21:13,684 --> 00:21:16,123
All that matters is that he's safe.

344
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:17,185
Where is he?

345
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,839
He's in a better place.

346
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:25,192
The chaplain's here to see you.

347
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:32,371
What do you got?

348
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:35,960
I've got aces and eights, two pair.

349
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:40,239
The dead man's hand.

350
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:44,554
I should have had that, but then of course I would have lost.

351
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:48,217
Straight to the Jack.

352
00:21:48,252 --> 00:21:52,084
And unless the rules of poker changed since I've been in here...

353
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:55,286
You lose.

354
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:01,196
Oh, sorry. Full house. This is higher.

355
00:22:02,892 --> 00:22:05,002
Man!

356
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:11,026
You would have been so nice.

357
00:22:12,326 --> 00:22:14,894
But then, answer to your question.

358
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:18,370
There are no other bodies.

359
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:25,565
JJ, Oh.

360
00:22:27,397 --> 00:22:29,987
The governor's just commanded us a stay of the execution to Sarah Jean.

361
00:22:30,022 --> 00:22:31,890
What? They can't do that.

362
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:33,405
They don't believe she killed your son.

363
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,369
She killed him.

364
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:39,534
I could tell you exactly where he's buried.

365
00:22:41,848 --> 00:22:43,319
It's got to be here.

366
00:22:43,354 --> 00:22:44,756
Jacob built this gazebo.

367
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:48,242
We've searched everywhere else.

368
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:53,396
The workshop and extension in dead Mason's house had arches.

369
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:57,082
We know he had to built this for Riley.

370
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:01,361
Hey, you got something here.

371
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:19,163
Guys, the body's ID is coming through.

372
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,151
It's not Riley Dawes.

373
00:23:29,186 --> 00:23:32,648
It's Ashley Farley. She was 14 when she was killed.

374
00:23:32,683 --> 00:23:34,768
Why would Jacob give us another victim?

375
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:38,097
He completely goes against his need for power manipulation and control.

376
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:41,391
Taking the secret of an old victim to his grave satisfies that need.

377
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:43,063
Why give it up? I mean, what's the payoff?

378
00:23:43,098 --> 00:23:46,537
Sarah Jean's the payoff. Sarah Jean will be his last victim.

379
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:48,625
And be the ultimate of control.

380
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,531
Gideon, check this out.

381
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:52,591
Guess who used to be the Farley's house cleaner.

382
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,554
My last supper.

383
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:13,817
Like some? Look! It came with a toy.

384
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,433
May I sit down?

385
00:24:15,468 --> 00:24:16,987
Please.

386
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:23,522
Ashley Farley.

387
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:25,917
You cleaned her parents' house.

388
00:24:25,952 --> 00:24:29,153
- Remember?
- Farley?

389
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:32,944
We found her buried beneth the children's gazebo.

390
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:35,130
At another house Jacob renovated.

391
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:37,617
He put her there.

392
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:41,507
I might as well have brought along with that bastard.

393
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:44,037
Thanks, doc.

394
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:47,601
You lied to me, it wasn't Riley.

395
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:51,154
- It wasn't?
- And she was 14 years old.

396
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,649
Ah, and really pretty.

397
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:58,110
How many others are there?

398
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:02,436
I only have a few hours left and

399
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:06,407
though I like you and I do like you.

400
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:09,615
I'd like to be alone now.

401
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,789
Good meeting you, Hotch.

402
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:18,715
- I'm not done yet.
- Oh, me neither.

403
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:31,551
Behind reeds,

404
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:34,177
the river.

405
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:38,560
This here, what is this?

406
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:40,609
A basket?

407
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:44,955
A boy in that painting is what, 10?

408
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,916
Maybe more?

409
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:53,551
Is that how you see him or how he is?

410
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:57,181
I only have a few hours left.

411
00:25:57,216 --> 00:26:00,288
I'm respectfully asking you to leave.

412
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:02,961
Where is he?

413
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:05,599
Where is Riley?

414
00:26:06,622 --> 00:26:08,593
Please see agent Gideon out.

415
00:26:08,628 --> 00:26:10,468
Open 4.

416
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:27,504
Garcia, pull up the interview with Sarah Jean.

417
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,658
- What is it?
- Exodus 2:3.

418
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:31,115
Moses.

419
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,549
Hebrew sons were supposed to be drown.

420
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:37,303
Moses's mother sent him down an isle in a basket.

421
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:38,880
<i>Where's he buried?</i>

422
00:26:38,915 --> 00:26:41,326
<i>All that matters is that he's safe.</i>

423
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:42,320
<i>Where is he?</i>

424
00:26:42,355 --> 00:26:45,399
<i>He's in a better place.</i>

425
00:26:46,378 --> 00:26:49,357
Jacob didn't bury Riley anywhere.

426
00:26:49,392 --> 00:26:51,400
Because Sarah Jean had already taken care of him.

427
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:52,755
Then she did kill him.

428
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,096
No, she sent him somewhere where she believed he'd be safe.

429
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:58,260
He's alive.

430
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,726
We're running out of time.

431
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:06,881
This is the proof we need to save Sarah Jean.

432
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:32,221
Check all police and hospital records dating back to September 1990.

433
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:33,763
You know, you should check local newspapers

434
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:35,914
to see if anyone reported any abandoned babies.

435
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:37,995
Ya, I don't give a damn where the governor is,

436
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,146
we may have found proof that Sarah Jean is innocent.

437
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:44,483
She really only had a maximum of 3 hours between police visits.

438
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:46,861
It was 4pm so traffic was pretty heavy.

439
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:48,983
Whatever she did with Riley had to be local.

440
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:51,070
1990, 3 babies where abandoned in September.

441
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:53,001
3 year old boys?

442
00:27:55,144 --> 00:27:56,474
None.

443
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,423
Why doesn't she just tell us where Riley is?

444
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,282
She'll protect him for as long as Jacob is alive.

445
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:02,694
Look, they are being executed within an hour of each other

446
00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:04,541
what hope do we even have to finding him in time?

447
00:28:04,576 --> 00:28:05,480
You know, it's quite possible,

448
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:06,974
she doesn't even know where he is anyway.

449
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:08,998
No, she knows.

450
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:11,772
We've got to get into her cell.

451
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:21,603
You've come to see the show?

452
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:24,272
I need to get into Sarah Jean's cell.

453
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:26,283
- I believe the proof-
- I can't do that!

454
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:29,469
All official lines of communication are now over.

455
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:32,025
- I just need 5 minutes.
- Agent!

456
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:37,333
They want the memory of these 2 individuals erased.

457
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:43,988
5 minutes. That's all I need.

458
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:47,174
- 5 minutes.
- Thank you. Come on.

459
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,883
I thought it was against regulations.

460
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:58,065
Well, don't tell anybody.

461
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:02,651
It's cold.

462
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:04,175
You need a jacket.

463
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,192
- Vincent, give me your jacket.
- Oh, no. I'm fine, really.

464
00:29:07,227 --> 00:29:12,452
It makes me feel, you know... alive.

465
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:38,253
How are your sons, warden?

466
00:29:38,288 --> 00:29:39,374
They're good.

467
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,875
Good.

468
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:44,076
Darren just graduated.

469
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:48,014
Ya? Did you ever tell him about the man in the moon?

470
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,599
Sure.

471
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:52,408
I used to tell Riley

472
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:55,001
that no matter where we were

473
00:29:55,036 --> 00:29:59,975
the man on the moon would be looking down on both of us.

474
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:41,399
We should get back.

475
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:46,164
Sarah, if there is something you know that can save you...

476
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:49,339
Thank you, warden.

477
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:52,676
This has been wonderful.

478
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:57,563
Your kindness to me, I thank you.

479
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,658
That's Riley. It's her son, isn't it?

480
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:06,616
Someone tell me it's him, please.

481
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,294
JJ circulate this photo to the press.

482
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:11,391
See if anybody recognizes this boy.

483
00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:12,979
Do I say who we think he is?

484
00:31:13,014 --> 00:31:14,969
No just put him out as the missing persons.

485
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:16,100
OK.

486
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,990
What does that mean?

487
00:31:19,025 --> 00:31:23,148
It means Jacob is being moved to the execution chamber.

488
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:28,046
Sarah Jean!

489
00:31:28,081 --> 00:31:31,088
I've been waiting for you!

490
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:35,560
You wish to make your peace to God, Jacob.

491
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,542
I've made my peace 18 times.

492
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:42,065
And each one was prettier than him.

493
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,871
Why take them with you, Jacob?

494
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:47,583
You know why.

495
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:50,260
Take him down.

496
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,915
If you don't mind, gentleman,

497
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,493
this is one walk I can make myself.

498
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,414
Sarah Jean!

499
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:07,794
I told you we'd be together forever!

500
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:11,234
He's just confessed to killing 4 more girls.

501
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:14,368
There's nothing I can do.

502
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:40,526
Are you ready, Sarah Jean?

503
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:45,399
We're going to ride the lightning, baby!

504
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,877
She cut around the photo so no one can read the text.

505
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:06,855
He was 2 when he disappeared. This boy is 16 or 17.

506
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,764
If he's Riley, it would mean it's a recent photo.

507
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:14,566
Once Jacob's dead, you think Sarah Jean would tell us if this is Riley?

508
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,199
Any last words?

509
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:13,995
Bring it on.

510
00:34:21,788 --> 00:34:23,991
Riley.

511
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,890
- You lose.
- No!

512
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,406
Jacob is gone.

513
00:35:09,495 --> 00:35:13,012
He's no longer any threat to Riley.

514
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:15,434
Tell me where he is.

515
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:17,971
We can stop this madness.

516
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:23,511
There is no greater gift in life than that of being a parent.

517
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:29,054
Yet so many of us abuse and squander that gift.

518
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:31,670
You can change that right now.

519
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:34,628
I made my decision 15 years ago.

520
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:37,246
This has never been about Jacob.

521
00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:39,795
It's always been about Riley.

522
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,777
That's why I can't let you do this.

523
00:35:41,812 --> 00:35:43,535
This isn't about you and me.

524
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,623
I know it isn't.

525
00:35:45,975 --> 00:35:49,325
That's why I'm not going to let Riley lose his greatest gift he knew he had.

526
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,113
But that is my gift to him.

527
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:54,302
And I'll not let you destroy that.

528
00:35:55,878 --> 00:35:59,109
Only people Jacob allowed Sarah Jean to know were the family she cleaned for.

529
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:01,466
Sarah Jean worked for wealthy families all over Hampton.

530
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:03,200
Let's go over all the families in the state of Florida

531
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:06,165
who were looking to adopt in 1990 and let's see how many lived in Hampton.

532
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,059
Families looking to adopt, hundreds.

533
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:09,959
- How many from Hampton?
- Uh... 3 families.

534
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:12,612
The James's, the Coulfied's and the Sheffield's.

535
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:16,060
Looks like the Sheffield's removed themselves from the list in October 1990

536
00:36:16,095 --> 00:36:17,159
and then moved out of Hampton.

537
00:36:17,194 --> 00:36:19,017
That's one month after Riley vanished where did they go?

538
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,090
Uh... Keystone Heights.

539
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,808
We got a match on the photo.

540
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:24,457
It was in a local daily news.

541
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:26,779
Call Morgan and El, tell them to get to the Sheffield's house.

542
00:36:26,814 --> 00:36:28,776
Byran Sheffield.

543
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:35,209
Local cello prodigy 17 year old Byran Sheffield won a scholarship to play cello.

544
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,667
How many miles to Keystone Heights?

545
00:36:39,702 --> 00:36:40,518
Way too many.

546
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:41,791
We're never going to make it in time.

547
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,064
Not if you keep running your mouth.

548
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:45,343
So you'd better buckle up!

549
00:36:49,453 --> 00:36:52,228
We found him. We found her son.

550
00:36:52,263 --> 00:36:55,563
Unless I receive an official stay of execution from the governor

551
00:36:55,598 --> 00:36:57,904
I'm duty bound to see this through.

552
00:36:57,939 --> 00:36:59,539
My son is dead, agent Gideon.

553
00:36:59,574 --> 00:37:01,920
I have agents on the way to his house as we speak.

554
00:37:01,955 --> 00:37:03,246
And the governor is standing by.

555
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:05,234
Why can you not accept the truth?

556
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:08,437
I can't. This isn't it.

557
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:15,633
Agents are with in minutes of finding her son, alive.

558
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:21,986
I am truly sorry, hold here.

559
00:37:25,003 --> 00:37:27,613
What wouldn't you do for your son to give him a life

560
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:31,414
you could never hope to dream of?

561
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:35,145
I am at peace in the knowledge

562
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:40,115
that my son is free to be whatever he chooses to be.

563
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,191
If he knew who you were

564
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:48,122
do you think he'd choose to allow you to walk in there?

565
00:37:48,157 --> 00:37:51,946
If he knew who his parents were

566
00:37:52,248 --> 00:37:57,203
can you imagine the damage my legacy would leave him?

567
00:37:57,238 --> 00:38:00,337
Can you imagine what he would feel?

568
00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:03,887
Knowing his mother spent 15 years on death row,

569
00:38:03,922 --> 00:38:06,515
innocent of all charges,

570
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,216
just so he can be free of her?

571
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:13,090
Not me, Jacob.

572
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:16,561
It isn't just my life you have in your hands.

573
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:20,497
It's Riley's life, too.

574
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:25,523
You have the chance to save my son's life.

575
00:38:25,558 --> 00:38:28,441
I choose to save yours, too.

576
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:33,520
My life ended the day I met Jacob.

577
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:42,926
Garcia, we made it.

578
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:47,182
Hello! Open Up! FBI!

579
00:38:47,217 --> 00:38:48,358
Hello?

580
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:50,618
Garcia, tell Gideon we are here.

581
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:52,843
Ya, but I'm afraid nobody else is.

582
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:54,536
Garcia. Pass us through.

583
00:38:54,571 --> 00:38:58,189
Gideon, I've got El. She says they're at the Sheffield's house.

584
00:38:58,224 --> 00:38:59,827
It's time.

585
00:38:59,862 --> 00:39:02,057
Take your hands off her.

586
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:03,817
Tell Morgan to kick the door and

587
00:39:03,852 --> 00:39:05,663
Get in the house whatever it takes.

588
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:06,671
FBI!

589
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:07,966
I said take your hands off her.

590
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:09,133
Agent Gideon!

591
00:39:09,168 --> 00:39:11,377
A few moments, please.

592
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:15,945
FBI!

593
00:39:17,241 --> 00:39:19,455
Morgan.

594
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:31,526
Stay in the car.

595
00:39:32,192 --> 00:39:33,665
Can I help you?

596
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,104
Frank Sheffield?

597
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,760
- What is this about?
- This is about your son.

598
00:39:37,795 --> 00:39:39,522
My son?

599
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,852
Is that your son in the car?

600
00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:48,987
I don't understand, what is this about? Tell me.

601
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:49,845
We're federal agents.

602
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,752
Hey Hotch we got him. He's here.

603
00:39:52,753 --> 00:39:53,702
What do we do?

604
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:56,531
Gideon, they've got him. What do are we doing here?

605
00:39:56,532 --> 00:40:01,516
I'm standing here because of choices I've made.

606
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:08,175
Don't let my son be Jacob's last victim.

607
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,175
Let me go.

608
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,809
Let us both go.

609
00:40:42,258 --> 00:40:48,527
Tell Morgan... it's not her son.

610
00:40:48,562 --> 00:40:51,524
That we've made a mistake.

611
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:54,486
Let him go it's not the boy.

612
00:40:56,197 --> 00:40:58,308
Hey Derek.

613
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:04,057
Wait there sir.

614
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,179
Mr. Sheffield... I'm uh...

615
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:23,976
I'm very sorry, we have the wrong house.

616
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:28,464
I apologize for any inconvenience.

617
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:32,130
Agent!

618
00:41:36,148 --> 00:41:38,293
Thank you.

619
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:06,377
Would it be too much to ask if yours is the last face I see?

620
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:44,438
Albert Pine said,

621
00:43:44,473 --> 00:43:47,581
"What we do for ourselves dies with us,

622
00:43:47,616 --> 00:43:53,605
what we do for others and the world remains and is immortal".
