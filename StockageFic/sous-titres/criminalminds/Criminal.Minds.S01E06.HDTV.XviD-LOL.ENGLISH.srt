1
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,240
Now pull it in,run it back. Let's go.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,180
Come on.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,480
I gotcha.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,760
On swat,we broke shots down into 3 steps.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,750
One--front sight.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,850
Focus on the front sight,not on the target.

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,400
2--controlled trigger press.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,340
3--follow through.

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,270
After the shot,you come right back to the target.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,290
- Now what did you do wrong?
- I didn't follow through.

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,230
Right. You came off the target to see where you hit.

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,370
Hotch,my firearms qualification is tomorrow morning.

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,100
I barely passed my last one.

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,130
Front sight,trigger press...

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,270
follow through.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,200
You do those 3 things,you'll hit your target every time.

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,670
I'm not fallin' for it.

18
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,600
Come on,pop.

19
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,790
Stop playing.

20
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,300
Oh,my god.

21
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,240
Dad!

22
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,980
Dad!

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,720
Did elle teach you that?

24
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,720
They're gonna take away my gun.

25
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,480
A profiler is not required to carry.

26
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,870
Yeah? And yet you carry 2 of them.

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,310
When I joined the bau,gideon said to me,

28
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,660
"you don't have to carry a gun to kill someone."

29
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,470
- I don't get it.
- You will.

30
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,260
Good luck tomorrow.

31
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,400
- Reid failed his qualification.
- He can re-test in 2 weeks.

32
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,110
Yeah,but he's gonna be embarrassed about it,so let's not mention it.

33
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,880
Yeah,let's not.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,840
Not a word.

35
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,020
Hey.

36
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,060
We're all here for you.

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,430
I'm serious.

38
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,250
If you ever need anything...

39
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,530
Just blow on that.

40
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,150
Ok,franklin park,des plaines,yesterday afternoon.

41
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,590
3 victims shot at distance.

42
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,320
It's the third such shooting in 2 weeks.

43
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,400
- A sniper?
- We don't use that word.

44
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,160
Why not?

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,420
The public perception is that the fbi doesn't have an exemplary record with snipers.

46
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,020
Besides,a sniper is a professional marksman.These guys aren't snipers.

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,440
- What do we call 'em then?
- L.D.S.K.

48
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,460
Long distance serial killers.

49
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,080
How many of these guys have we caught using a profile?

50
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,780
None.

51
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,470

54
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,130
2 weeks,3 shooting incidents,6 victims,all shot in the abdomen.

55
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,030
First and only fatality,henry sachs,married,father of 3,

56
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,410
was shot in a shopping center parking lot.

57
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,260
9 days later,

58
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,120
doug miller and kevin parks were playing basketball at a community center.

59
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,390
Franklin park,4 days later,jerry middleton,kate murray,and tim reilly.

60
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,430
Des plaines police have found no link between any of the victims.

61
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,230
Ballistics?

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,550
He's using frangible rounds,which fragment on impact,

63
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,380
making ballistics comparisons impossible.

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,800
The good news is that all the park victims are gonna make it.

65
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,170
The bad new is that none of them saw anything.

66
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,540
However,one of the patients does have an intact bullet lodged in his spine.

67
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,760
What's the prognosis?

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,530
There's a disagreement among surgical staff

69
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,980
as to whether they can remove the slug without paralyzing the patient.

70
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,940
Well,without a useful witness or a solid piece of forensic evidence...

71
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,910
the profile's all we'll have.

72
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,080
Nietzsche wrote,

73
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,920
"the irrationality of a thing

74
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,550
"is not an argument against it's existence,

75
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,630
rather,a condition of it."

76
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,910
L.D.S.K.S are so rare,

77
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,720
we haven't been able to build a standard profile.

78
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,510
Here's what we do know:They're always male,

79
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,400
and they frequently have law enforcement or military experience,

80
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,470
and they always contact the police or the media.

81
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,980
To take credit or relive the experience?

82
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,190
Both.

83
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,230
All serial killers attempt to relive the ecstasy they get from their killings.

84
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,300
Some use souvenirs taken from the victims,

85
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:00,270
and others return to the dump site to interact with the body.

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,210
Both modes require contact with the victim,

87
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,840
contact which,by definition,long distance serial killers don't have.

88
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,490
The beltway shooters left a tarot card at one of their crime scenes.

89
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,310
Later they called a tip hotline,which ultimately led to their capture.

90
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,600
But our unsub hasn't contacted anybody.

91
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,230
He will.

92
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,200
Until he does,what do we have?

93
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,710
Sometimes it's not what the unsub does that reveals the profile.

94
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,470
Sometimes it is what they do not do.

95
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,400
He doesn't kill his victims.

96
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,150
Underkill's a unique signature.

97
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,730
The question is,

98
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,480
does he shoot them in the stomach intentionally just to wound them,

99
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,080
or is he just aiming at the biggest part of the target?

100
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,900
Specifically,does the unsub lack the skill to make the head shot,

101
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,780
or simply the will to take it?

102
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,670
Agent hotchner.

103
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,040
Detective calvin,this is agent morgan,agent reid.

104
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,340
Thanks for comin'.Follow me.

105
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,640
The cones mark the places where the victims were,

106
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,090
so we know he fired from somewhere in this area.

107
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,710
Close enough to hit all 3 victims,

108
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,820
but far away enough not to be seen.

109
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,890
His wounding his victims intentionally would classify him as a sadistic killer.

110
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,920
That would help us?

111
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,030
We know a lot about sadists.

112
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,380
But most want to be close to their victims to watch them suffer.

113
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,390
A powerful scope would allow him to observe it from a safe distance

114
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,930
So how do we determine if he's a sadist?

115
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,940
We spend some time in his shoes.

116
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,880
We let him tell us.

117
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,800
Come on,barry,you don't know that!

118
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,400
Good morning,doctors.

119
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,350
Forgive us.We were just reviewing the cases at hand.

120
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,110
This is dr. Neil erstadt,chief of surgery,

121
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,980
and our trauma specialist,dr. Barry landman.

122
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,370
These are the fbi profilers,agents gideon,jareau,greenaway.

123
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,200
How are you?

124
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,910
Forgive me.I don't shake.

125
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,970
My hands,you understand?

126
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,660
Of course.

127
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,610
So as psychological profilers,s,what exactly are you looking for?

128
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,730
How the victims were shot.

129
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,950
That could reveal the shooter's signature behavior.

130
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,570
These separate wound channels blossom from the entrance wounds.

131
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,510
You can see the trauma's extensive.

132
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,970
- You performed the surgeries?
- On patient miller.

133
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,490
I consulted with dr. Landman on the others.

134
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,130
The intact slug lodged between the l4-l5 vertebrae.

135
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,600
Any attempt to remove it,would likely leave the patient paralyzed.

136
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,440
In your opinion.

137
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,390
In my opinion.

138
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,320
Disagree?

139
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,100
- With the right surgeon,there is no risk.
- There's always risk.

140
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,320
What significance does the bullet have in building a profile?

141
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,770
Well,even if we can't get a ballistics match,we can get a rifle type,

142
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,680
and the specific type of rifle the suspect uses,

143
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,710
that could be very significant to the profile.

144
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,550
You believe you can safely perform the surgery,dr. Landman?

145
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,630
I know I can.

146
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,140
This handicapped spot couldn't be further away from the entrance to the building.

147
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,410
Yeah?

148
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,420
It also has line of sight to all 3 victims and the flagpole.

149
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,770
What are you thinkin'?

150
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,520
At this range,the unsub would have to factor in wind direction and speed as he shot.

151
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:22,970
To do this,he needed a spot with the widest field of fire and line of sight to the flagpole.

152
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,720
He came here before the shooting,

153
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,760
decided this was his spot...

154
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,300
and ensured that it would be empty when he came back.

155
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,920
My guess is he's shooting from his car.

156
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,310
Well,that would mean he wanted to get away from here quickly,

157
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,550
that he didn't stick around to watch his victims suffer.

158
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,770
So he would not be a sadist.

159
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,880
What would he be?

160
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,900
A very smart,very resourceful,very paranoid sociopath.

161
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,700
If I'm the unsub,why do I shoot my victims between 2:55 and 3:15?

162
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,010
That's when I'd do it.There are fewer cops on the street.

163
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,590
- Why is that?
- Well,the police overlap shifts

164
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,030
so there's always someone minding the store.

165
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,790
Second shift starts at 3:00,first shift walks at 3:30.

166
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,260
Wouldn't there be twice as many cops on the street at that time?

167
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,650
In theory.

168
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,270
The first half-hour of your shift,you're in roll call.

169
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,760
You're not on the street.

170
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,440
And the last half-hour,you're at the station.

171
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,210
You're finishin' reports,you're booking prisoners,

172
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,680
so the 25 minutes around the first/second shift,

173
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,480
that's a bad guy's golden window.

174
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,320
How many people outside law enforcement would know that?

175
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,420
But the unsub does,and you've already thought of this.

176
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,930
I had considered it.

177
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,320
Hope you find it useful.

178
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,200
Dr. Landman?

179
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,490
How's mr. Middleton.

180
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,150
Patient will make a full recovery...

181
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,460
as I told you he would.

182
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,700
Radiology is set up to take photos and e-mail them out for consults.

183
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,370
Call hotch.We're gettin' the bullet to garcia.

184
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,710
Fill him in on the shift change theory.

185
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,550
Give me a second.

186
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,110
Yeah. Morgan.

187
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,540
Isn't this spooky?

188
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,880
Isn't what spooky?

189
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,740
That right now you were thinking about me,

190
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,760
and out of the blue,your phone rings?

191
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,510
And it's me. Huh?

192
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,590
How's that for a spiritual connection?

193
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,290
Um... do I know you?

194
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,240
Why do you hurt me?

195
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,750
Garcia,please tell me you've nailed down the geographic profile on our guy.

196
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,980
Ok,I'll give you the good news first,which is not that good,

197
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,930
but it's better than the bad.

198
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,250
We think the shooter has intimate knowledge of law enforcement procedures.

199
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,020
Detective calvin,

200
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,560
how far out of your jurisdiction was crime scene number 2?

201
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,270
About a sixth of a mile. Why?

202
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,330
If he knew how difficult it is

203
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,130
for local police departments to interact with each other,

204
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,140
he may have intentionally crossed jurisdiction lines.

205
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,950
- Y'all are sayin' the shooter's a cop.
- We're saying it's a possibility.

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,770
He scouted and prepped each crime scene.

207
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,490
He chose and elevated position with excellent enfilade and perfect field of fire.

208
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,220
- That's textbook military practice.
- True.

209
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,270
Yeah,but maybe he was in the army.

210
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,370
He was probably a marine,ranger or other specialized unit.

211
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,500
Garcia says the bullet was a .223 fired from the m-4 variant of the m-16.

212
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,180
All the services use an m-4.

213
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,090
It's got a shorter barrel than the m-16.

214
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,240
It's less accurate,and it's a lot harder to fire,especially at these distances.

215
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,680
This level of skill indicates specialized training.

216
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,560
If he has specialized training,

217
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,190
he knows exactly what he's doing.

218
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,730
- He intended to wound them.
- The underkill is deliberate.

219
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,970
Everything he does is deliberate,

220
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,270
but it's as if he needs to show us how smart he is.

221
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,940
Since the crime scenes aren't centered around one single location,

222
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,910
garcia can't get a geographic profile without additional data.

223
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,570
- What kind of data?
- More crime scenes.

224
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,410
She's gonna get 'em.

225
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,870
This guy's got something to prove.

226
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,530
- How did it play out?
- He's been suspended

227
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,050
but my guess is that the school board's gonna go after him,

228
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,140
and they're gonna try to expel him.

229
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,110
I don't feel very good.

230
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,500
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room,ok?

231
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,980
Ok.

232
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,580
Honey,you have something on your dress.

233
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,360
3 more victims with nonfatal wounds,

234
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,280
and it's only been 48 hours since the last shooting.

235
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,450
The media attention and the fbi presence will only escalate his desire to shoot again.

236
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,310
Meaning?

237
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,260
This is gonna get much worse.

238
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,260
The we need to give the police a profile immediately.

239
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,470
- You ready?
- State troopers.

240
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,400
This is the second time he's crossed jurisdictions.

241
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,550
Yeah,we're ready.They're not gonna like it.

242
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,260
This initial profile is not ready to be given to the media.

243
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,130
Releasing this profile prematurely can get people killed.

244
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,080
We're looking for a 30 to 40-year-old male veteran,

245
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,090
driving a car large enough to shoot from,

246
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,200
but not so large it was noticed.

247
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,400
Like the beltway shooter,it's probably a sedan,

248
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,850
customized to conceal the shooter,his weapon,and the sound of his shot.

249
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,270
The unsub suffers from both narcissistic and paranoid personality disorders.

250
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,910
He works out obsessively and is never without a weapon.

251
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,990
He's completely self-centered and cannot empathize with others.

252
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,330
Incapable of admitting fault,

253
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,840
he blames his shortcomings on those around him.

254
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,710
He has no friends,

255
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,110
and his career history has been marked by frequent job changes.

256
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,740
He's drawn to high-stakes jobs by a need to prove his superiority

257
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,380
to a world he perceives has undervalued him,

258
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,200
and these shootings are the ultimate expression of that need.

259
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,600
We believe he changes jurisdictions intentionally

260
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,640
and strikes during the first/second shift change,

261
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,020
indicating and intimate knowledge of law enforcement.

262
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,510
You're saying he's one of us.

263
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,290
We're saying he once was or is now a police officer.

264
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,330
Is he driving a white van,too?

265
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,340
Enough.

266
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,710
That'll be all for now.

267
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,320
We can talk in my office.

268
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,460
Thank you.

269
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,630
Sergeant weigart,we would like to reenact the third shooting during the shift change.

270
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,420
Why?

271
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,590
Well,to better understand his M.O.

272
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,980
How does he get there?How does he leave?

273
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,310
- What's the traffic like?
- It could help us with witnesses.

274
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,430
Maybe the victims or bystanders saw something,

275
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,910
but don't realize the significance of what they saw.

276
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,530
All right,let's do it.

277
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,480
How you holdin' up?

278
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,920
Look at me.Without a gun on my belt,I look like a teacher's assistant.

279
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,840
You're not worried about how you look.

280
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,760
Hotch told me that when he came to the bau,

281
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,980
you told him he didn't need a gun to kill somebody?

282
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,000
Well,the only truly effective weapon we have

283
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,300
is our ability to do the one thing they can'T.

284
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,960
- Which is what?
- Empathize.

285
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,230
They dehumanize their victims.We humanize the killers.

286
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,490
You're just saying that to convince me I don't need to carry a gun.

287
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,390
I don't care you carry a gun or not.

288
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,290
Deadliest weapon we have is a thorough and accurate profile.

289
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,500
Of course you believe that.

290
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,680
Footpath killer,he had a shotgun in the back of my head.

291
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,210
I'm here,he's not.

292
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,610
Elle,jerry littleton was facing a little further south.

293
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,900
Can you give it to us?

294
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,500
How's that?

295
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,110
Perfect.Hold your camera right there.

296
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,910
It doesn't look like jerry middleton had a clear view of the sniper's vehicle when he was shot.

297
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,140
The tree branches were in the way.

298
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,390
I do have a clear view of the vehicle from here.

299
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,830
Tim reilly would have seen it if he'd looked down from the kite.

300
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,670
Good. Have the unsub pop the trunk.See if reid can see it.

301
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,570
No,sorry.

302
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,480
Nothing from position one.

303
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,390
Ok,everyone,move to position 2.

304
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,700
And now,we go to john jenkins,

305
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:10,620
reporting live from franklin park with breaking news on the sniper investigation.

306
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,620
- Through anonymous sources we've learned
- you gotta see this.

307
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,180
The fbi profilers have told the police task force the sniper is,

308
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,120
in fact,a member of the des plaines police department.

309
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,000
Who could have leaked this?

310
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,060
The only people who had the profile were your people.

311
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,240
And the profile implicates them.

312
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,190
Why would a cop leak sensitive information the would not only implicate one of his own,

313
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,940
but make every citizen in the county afraid to get pulled over?

314
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,490
What does he get out of it?

315
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,950
Contact with the media.

316
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,270
What?

317
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,280
The cop who leaked this story is a good suspect.

318
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,750
Contacting the media could have been his sick way of keeping this alive.

319
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,930
Vic,why don't you go ahead and call the station

320
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,440
and find out what they've got in mind for one of the later shows.

321
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,220
Mr. Jenkins,I'm special agent jennifer jareau with the fbi.

322
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,200
We need you to identify your source.

323
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,430
No way.I know my rights.

324
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,640
Hey,hey,shoot this.Vic,shoot this.Get this all on tape.

325
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,500
You should know the fbi considers these shootings an act of terrorism.

326
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,100
Under the patriot act,we can detain you as long as we need to.

327
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,330
All I know is his cell number.

328
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,540
We have a lead.

329
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,100
Rainmaker.How wet do you want it?

330
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,170
It's hotch. I have a cell phone number,and I need the name on the account.

331
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,880
Yeah. If you call the cell,I can throw in the real time location,no charge.

332
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,570
- Are you ready?
- I was born ready.

333
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,190
Can't you pull your people out of the park?

334
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,800
If we do and the shooter is here,he'll sense something is wrong.

335
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,590
He could start shooting.

336
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,340
That cell is part of a batch purchased by the des plaines police department.

337
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,690
I need a name,garcia.

338
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,250
It's gonna take a second.I have to pull it from their system.

339
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,170
Then give me the location.

340
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,120
Franklin park,des plaines.

341
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,990
He's here.

342
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,400
The name,garcia.

343
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,170
Mccarty,scott.

344
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,040
Scott mccarty.

345
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,360
- Mccarty's the unsub.
- But where is he?

346
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,880
Mccarty is playing the unsub.

347
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,440
we need to talk to scott mccarty.

348
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,550
He's the leak.

349
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,980
Mccarty. Why am i not surprised?

350
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,730
I need swat in the lot asap.

351
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,490
It's mccarty.We need to come heavy.

352
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,440
We didn't say he was the shooter.

353
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,650
We could just call him on the radio and tell him to come to us.

354
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,050
Best case,he leaked the story.

355
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,650
Worst case,I'm not about to let him take down any of my men.

356
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,240
We come heavy,and we take him clean.

357
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,100
This is mccarty.What's goin' on?

358
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,520
Toss your rifle and your side arm out of the vehicle and show us your hands.

359
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,160
- I don't understand.
- We know what you did,scotty.

360
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,750
- Look,I can explain.
- Don't make me give the order!

361
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,940
Ok,all right!All right!

362
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,070
Now open the trunk lid slowly.

363
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,580
Come on.

364
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,060
That's it.

365
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,840
Get him up.

366
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,310
Get down!

367
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,000
How did mccarty end up playing the unsub?

368
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,280
Weigart punished mccarty for mouthing off during the profile briefing by making him the unsub

369
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,020
and sticking him in the trunk of the car all afternoon.

370
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,120
Wait. Then how did the unsub find out about the reenactment?

371
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,760
Come on. Cops talk.

372
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,550
Pissed-off cops talk loud--

373
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,140
at home,at the bars,at gyms,and to anyone who'll listen.

374
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,560
What do we know?

375
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,320
Our unsub went from wounding civilians to executing a police officer,

376
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,280
so he's escalated.

377
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,150
He's not staying on script.

378
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,440
Sometimes it's what they don't do.

379
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,170
He did not pick mccarty at random.

380
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,700
- He didn't take the gut shot.
- Why?

381
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,290
He wants to send a message.

382
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,420
"Nobody takes credit for my work."

383
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,800
Yes,sir.His ego won't allow it.

384
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,220
He feels underappreciated.

385
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,930
Ok,but we still don't know why he wounds them.

386
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,880
Excuse me.

387
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,230
We know if the killer has no contact with his victims,

388
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,390
he will contact the media.

389
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,500
But he hasn't contacted the media.

390
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,590
He has contact with his victims.

391
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,270
And there's only one way.

392
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,730
All right,thanks.

393
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,100
Garcia nailed down the geographic profile.

394
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,490
The crime scenes are centered on 2 separate locations.

395
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,010
The hospitals.

396
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,860
I believe it's a case of hero homicide.

397
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,790
What's that?

398
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,630
The best-known case was hospital nurse richard angelo.

399
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,450
He would inject toxins into his victims,

400
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:34,870
then wait for them to crash so that he could run to the rescue and save them.

401
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,690
He killed 25 people,and that's just what we know of.

402
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,390
If he attacked 'em to save 'em,why'd he kill 25 people?

403
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,610
Wasn't very good at it.

404
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,160
Yeah,and hospitals don't keep records of people who almost died.

405
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,100
So what's the profile on one of these guys?

406
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:53,170
Arrogant,conceited,feels superior to everyone around them.

407
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,210
You've just described every surgeon I've ever met.

408
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,790
Uh,forgive me.I don't shake.

409
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,420
My hands,you understand.

410
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,400
Of course.

411
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,920
Landman.

412
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,750
Let's start with landman.

413
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,130
Call weigart and tell him we need a discreet perimeter around this block.

414
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,660
I'm gonna go check out landman's car.

415
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,470
Ok.Courtesy of garcia.

416
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,960
Landman was army,started out in M.P. School.

417
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,440
Well,there's your law enforcement.

418
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,080
But he was smart,

419
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,430
got a degree on uncle sam,

420
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,480
and ended up a doctor with special forces

421
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,690
and bounced around from hospital to hospital since his discharge in 2001.

422
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,120
Has dr. Landman been Has he had a reprimand?

423
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,000
has he had any kind of major blow to his ego?

424
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,330
Last month,he was passed over for chief of surgery.

425
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,220
Let's get a warrant for his house.Let's see if we find the weapon.

426
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,620
Ok.

427
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,600
What can I do to help?

428
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,110
You can tell me where he is right now.

429
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,410
Where's marston?

430
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,290
She's not coming.

431
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,390
Look,I'm very busy right now.Perhaps you could make an appointment.

432
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,280
Busy with what?

433
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,600
Things.

434
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,880
What kind of things?

435
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,280
You're considering me a suspect?

436
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,010
Yes.

437
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,070
Well,that's disconcerting.

438
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,080
I heard what happened to your last suspect.

439
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,210
- Do you wanna know why?
- Collective incompetence?

440
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,450
Have you ever heard of hero homicide?

441
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,960
Would I be less suspicious if I let my patients die?

442
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,590
Absolutely.

443
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,690
You get anything from his car?

444
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,900
It's a red 2-seat maserati.

445
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,290
Heh. Of course.

446
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,370
If he's the shooter,he has another vehicle.

447
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,780
This type of killer seeks the power over life and death and covets the power of god.

448
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,780
- You know anyone like that?
- I want you to understand something.

449
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,240
When my patients are in the operating room,they need god,

450
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,120
and that's exactly what I give them.

451
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,120
When someone's holding your beating heart in their hands,

452
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,800
who do you want holding it,me or god?

453
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,480
Where were you today at 3:00?

454
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,510
- I was in my office.
- Alone?

455
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,230
I was in my office with dr. Hannah pate.

456
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,090
I'm not the only one who thinks I'm a god.

457
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,170
She's in the E.R.Right now.

458
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,460
Go on.

459
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,430
Ask her.

460
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,120
Great. Let's take a walk down to the E.R.

461
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,470
My guess,dr. Pate is gonna corroborate landman's alibi.

462
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,860
You don't think landman's the shooter?

463
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,820
Richard angelo wanted to be a hero because in his everyday life,he was a nobody.

464
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,880
Landman's a surgeon.He has power and recognition.

465
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,410
Yeah,but you know,surgeons are a different breed.

466
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,160
There are stars in the field,and landman is definitely not one of them.

467
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,940
Excuse me.

468
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,540
I'd like to speak with dr. Pate.

469
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,520
Yes,sir.I'll go find her for you.

470
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:25,120
The motivations for hero homicide are excitement,power,and respect,

471
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,810
and even though landman's not a star,he still gets respect.

472
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,510
Racing against the clock to save someone's life is exciting.

473
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,920
But maybe it's not exciting enough.

474
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,670
That's--that's why he shoots 3 people at a time.

475
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,260
But he can only operate on one at a time.

476
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,470
It wouldn't be any more exciting.

477
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:52,550
At least,not for landman and not in the O.R.

478
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,410
The policemen and E.R. Personnel are on the exact same 24-hour shift schedule.

479
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,080
The unsub wasn't shooting at shift change

480
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,840
because there are fewer cops on the street.

481
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,780
He works the second shift in the emergency room.

482
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,400
Contact with the victims.

483
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,720
Sir,you can't use the cell phone in the hospital.

484
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,880
Excuse me,please.

485
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,060
We're fbi agents,

486
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,450
and we believe that one of your staff members might be the sniper.

487
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,800
The man we're looking for works second shift,

488
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,540
and he would have transferred from arlington about 2 weeks ago.

489
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,070
We haven't hired any new personnel in 2 months.

490
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,510
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

491
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:45,010
He has the worst narcissistic personality disorder I've ever seen,

492
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,750
but it's not likely him.

493
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,710
Look,I've got patients who need me.

494
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,870
He's in his thirties.

495
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,880
He's vain,rude,arrogant.He works out.

496
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,970
He shows up to work late.

497
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,290
He blames others for his mistakes,

498
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,970
doesn't take responsibility for his behavior.

499
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,530
All of his coworkers detest him.

500
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,520
It's phillip dowd.

501
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,930
He's--he picks up shifts at arlington.

502
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,840
Is he here today?

503
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,950
- Oh,my god.
- Ok...

504
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,550
ok,your patients need you.

505
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,960
Tell me,is dowd working today?

506
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,170
Do you see him?

507
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,080
Go tell gideon.

508
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,280
Reid.

509
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,930
Nobody moves,and nobody dies.

510
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,610
Better be a head shot.

511
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,110
I got this on full auto.

512
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,630
Anything less,I go down squeezing the trigger.

513
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,680
Get up!

514
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,830
Get over here!

515
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,160
Double time! Let's go!

516
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,870
You,take your partner's gun,put it on the counter.

517
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,020
He's not armed.

518
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,070
See for yourself.

519
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,240
Hands on your heads.

520
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,710
Get up,keith.

521
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,730
Put those on 'em.

522
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,220
Now put 'em on yourself.

523
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,010
Now step back.

524
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,820
Back up.Back up. Back up.

525
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,510
Get down on the ground.

526
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,190
Have a seat.

527
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,490
Now,what kind of an fbi agent doesn't carry a gun?

528
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm a profiler.

529
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,690
Profiler?

530
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,680
They sent you to figure me out.

531
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,260
- We did.That's how we found you.
- Shh. Keep quiet.

532
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,110
No,don't shut up.

533
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,500
Tell me what you think you know about me.

534
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,410
Go ahead,genius.Tell him.

535
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,230
Tell him.

536
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,800
But remember,get it wrong,and he's gonna kill you.

537
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,500
Ok.

538
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,360
You're the boss.You tell me.

539
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,690
Who am I?

540
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,160
What's my plan?

541
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,870
I know you shot 11 people in broad daylight and left us nothing,

542
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,840
you executed a cop in front of the fbi and got away clean,

543
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,410
and I know your plan is to go down in a hail of bullets.

544
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,950
What else do you know?

545
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,730
He joined the army at 18,went to ranger school,

546
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,110
did 6 years before being dishonorably discharged in '95 for conduct unbecoming,

547
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,720
obviously lied about it,joined the arlington P.D.

548
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,110
- You were right.He was a cop.
- For 9 months.

549
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,520
When they found out he lied about the discharge,they kicked him out.

550
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,670
Soon thereafter,dowd got his nursing license.

551
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,830
He's been bouncing from hospital to hospital ever since.

552
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,910
I know you're the smartest guy in every room you've ever been in,

553
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,300
and no one's ever known it.

554
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,580
People feel threatened by you and try to sabotage you every chance they get.

555
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,870
You're not a bad person.

556
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,000
You help save all of your victims afterwards.

557
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,030
First guy wasn't your fault.

558
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,970
If the emts had been there on time,he would've lived.

559
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:19,130
Took those guys 13 minutes. 13!

560
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,360
You want to barricade the door.

561
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,110
- What?
- Let me and the kid do it.

562
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,300
Let 'em see that you've got 2 fbi agents in here doing your bidding.

563
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,700
Right,let you give them a signal.

564
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,150
What signal?They knew you were in here.

565
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,250
They knew you were armed.What can I tell them?

566
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,650
What is this,some sort of profiler trick?

567
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,370
New negotiation tactic?

568
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,940
I think it's a good idea.

569
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,520
Why would you wanna help me?

570
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,900
I don'T.

571
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,800
You said they knew I was in here.

572
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,710
I said they know you're in here.

573
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,000
- No. That's not what you said.
- Why does it matter?

574
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,120
It matters because your partner wants to help me

575
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,870
even though he doesn't know it.

576
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,580
Go ahead,boss man.

577
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,960
Tell him why.

578
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:17,200
If you lie or leave anything out,pop.

579
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,400
They knew he was in here,they knew he was armed and dangerous,

580
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,950
and they knew that he was gonna fight till the last round,

581
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,840
and they sent me in here with an unarmed kid

582
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,590
who can't shoot his way out of a wet paper bag.

583
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,690
They set you up.

584
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,520
Exactly,and they're probably laughing about it right now.

585
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,170
That's why you wanna help me.

586
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,480
I wouldn't say I want to help you,

587
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,950
but when they come in here to get revenge for the cop you killed,

588
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,080
you're gonna go down fighting,

589
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,370
and in the crossfire,a lot of us are gonna die.

590
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,830
They sent me in here.I figure why make it easy for them.

591
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,760
Can I talk to you for a minute?

592
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,020
Please don't send your men in yet.

593
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:08,200
You have to consider the possibility that your men are dead or at least disarmed.

594
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,200
Agent hotch is a very experienced profiler.

595
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,490
He's gonna do whatever he has to to get dowd to like,trust us.

596
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,780
And once he does...

597
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,640
he'll get dowd to end this peacefully.

598
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,090
I--I just...ask that you give him time.

599
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,810
Dowd's already shot 10 people.

600
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,710
He killed a cop.

601
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,930
The cop is dead.

602
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,190
This man is a violent,deranged paranoid.

603
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,270
It's a game.

604
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,510
He's gonna--he's gonna do whatever he has to.

605
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,120
You send in your men,

606
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:41,420
they're just gonna become villains in his little hero fantasy.

607
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,470
You're lettin' him call all the shots.

608
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,260
How are your unarmed men gonna stop him?

609
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:49,190
They're not unarmed.They have his profile.

610
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,380
They understand him.

611
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,610
3 minutes. Then my men are ready to take the E.R.

612
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,180
Your men...have 3 minutes.

613
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,230
You know why they took away boy genius's gun?

614
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,050
Why?

615
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,040
He failed his qualification.

616
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,700
Twice I year,I gotta listen to him whine about requalifying.

617
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,770
So I tutor him...

618
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,460
and he fails again.

619
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,230
You think you got it rough?

620
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,220
These people done nothing but undermine me since I got here.

621
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,680
Put him next to the barricade.

622
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,130
That way,when they blast their way in here,both of our problems are solved.

623
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,390
That sort of thing can ruin a cop's career.

624
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,190
You are one sick dude.

625
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,400
How do you think I found you?

626
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,690
Time's up.

627
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,970
Ready teams for assault.

628
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,270
- Can I ask you a favor?
- You can ask.

629
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,150
I figure the chances of my getting out of here alive are pretty slim.

630
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,660
So?

631
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,130
I want to kick the snot out of this kid.

632
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:19,990
He's made my life miserable for 3 lousy years.

633
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,330
Go ahead.Knock yourself out.

634
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,720
How smart are you now,smart guy?!

635
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,960
It's front sight,trigger press,follow through!

636
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:41,910
That's enough!

637
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,300
It's not that hard!

638
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,240
A dalmatian could do it!

639
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,600
Let go!Let go!

640
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,240
Feel better?

641
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,170
I think he got a messege

642
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,730
What's that?

643
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,330
We go in 5...

644
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,960
4...

645
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,020
we go now!

646
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,150
Hold your fire!

647
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,170
Hold your fire!

648
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,260
It's all clear.

649
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,560
Shakespeare wrote,

650
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:39,880
"nothing is so common as the wish to be remarkable."

651
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,070
You all right?

652
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,110
Nice shot.

653
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,130
I was aiming for his leg.

654
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,320
I wouldn't have kept kicking,but I was afraid you didn't get my plans.

655
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:05,050
I got your plan the minute you moved the hostages out of my line of fire.

656
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,180
Well,I hope I didn't hurt you too badly.

657
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,290
Hotch,I was a 12-year-old child prodigy in a las vegas public high school.

658
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,540
You kick like a 9-year-old girl.

659
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,850
No. Keep it.

660
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,420
As far as I'm concerned,you passed your qualification.

661
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Reid,you all right?

662
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,170
Touche,kid.

663
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,270
How you doin'?

664
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:55,380
You were right.You don't need a gun to kill somebody.

665
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,580
No,you don'T.

666
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,500
But it helps.

667
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,200
Yes.

668
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,560
Yes.

669
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,690
I--I know I should feel bad about...what happened.

670
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:15,930
I mean...

671
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,050
I killed a man.

672
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,530
You know,I--I should...feel something.

673
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,050
But I don'T.

674
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,310
Well,knowing what you're feelin'...

675
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,600
that's not the same as not feelin'.

676
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,230
This is gonna hurt you...

677
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,490
and when it does...

678
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:43,650
there's only 3 facts you need to know.

679
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,520
You did what you had to do...

680
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,880
and a lot of good people are alive because of what you did.

681
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,280
What's the third?

682
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,040
I'm proud of you.
