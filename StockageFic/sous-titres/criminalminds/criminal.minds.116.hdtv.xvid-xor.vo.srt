1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It so cool
we got in here.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,915
Ok. You two have fun.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Where you been?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Where did you say
the bathroom was?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Upstairs. Second door
on the lt.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,679
I'll be right back.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,106
Man: there's our girl... 
That's her !

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,387
Ingrid?

9
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:48,291
Ingrid?

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,572
Hey, you guys
seen ingrid?

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What are you doing
out of your bunker?

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I was on my way to file

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
the things that i..

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
file.

15
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:49,362
Excuse me.

16
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:50,054
Hi.

17
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm..

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
sean, hey.

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Derek.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You must be
looking for your brother.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.
Right this way.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Brother as in..

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
that's hotch's brother?

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Maybe hotch is adopted.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, georgetown law?

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're doing big things.
Congratulations.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thanks.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Top of the stairs.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Come in.

30
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,000
Sean, hey.
Let me call you back.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hey.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is a surprise.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Haven't cut your hair
since thanksgiving.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's what you said
at christmas.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Sorry.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Um..

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
it's your first time here,
let me give you the ur.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, i can't stay long.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm working
the lunch shift.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well, not for long.
Congratulations.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You must be
pretty excited.

42
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:36,249
I'm not going
to georgetown.

43
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,000
What?

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I changed my mind.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I got this job offer

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
to work at this
restaurant in new york.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's not a chef,
but it's under
the right ones.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I can learn from them.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What are you
talking about?

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I made up my mind.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Sean, you've always
wanted to be a lawyer.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Just like dad,
just like me.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And look what it
got dad, huh?

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Heart attack. 47.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think i'm doing ok.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Look, if it's about
being in new york,

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
nyu's got a great law school.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Columbia, fordham.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't ink
you're hearing me.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
All i'm asking you to do
is think it through, you know?

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The logical thing is for you
to go to georgetown.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have to trust
my instincts.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Look, sean, it's typical
for someone

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
who lost his father
at a young age..

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and you know what?

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're not him.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Then why are you here?

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,605
That's a really
good question.

69
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:24,716
Here he comes.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's hotch's brother?

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Uh-huh.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't see it.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Sean, listen to me.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All i'm saying is
you're 25 years old.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,487
You know what,
don't profile me, aaron.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,890
Now, i see it.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Terra mesa, new mexico.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
5 dead, and all from mesa
university.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No signs of sexual assault,

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,275
and no sign of theft.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
519-year-olds.
Minimal defensive wounds.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
One of them was impaled
on a 6-foot wooden pole.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Who'd want to torture
5 college freshmen?

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They weren't tied up
and no one escaped?

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No single unsub
could've exerted

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
this much control
over so many people.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So you think
there was mo than two.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think we're looking
at a pack.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
A pack?

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
3 or more that kill
in unison,

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
as in, nature of
the group dynamic,

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
dictates the pack's survival
is dependent on their ability

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
to hunt successfully.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And as in nature of
pack will keep on killing

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
until it runs
out of prey

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
or is stopped.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Stopped by what?

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,994
Stronger pack..

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Nietzsche wrote,

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the individual has always
had to struggle

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
to keep from being
overwhelmed

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,884
by the tribe.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Sheriff, i'm
special agent hotchner.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The are agents
reid and gideon.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I was hoping
there were more of you.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The other agents went straight to
the station house

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to look at
the victim's files.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,817
Has forensics
had any luck?

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
County csu went through

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
for prints
and trace evidence.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They said with
all the workmen
trampling through here,

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
looking at footprints
would be a waste.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,094
Come on.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The bodies were almost
completely skinned,

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
yet there's
so little blood.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think i know why.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The unsub avoided
areas of skin

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
on the wrists
and the throat.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Areas where the veins
and arteries

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
are closest to the surface.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why would they do that?

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They didn't want them
to bleed out.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,393
These kids
were skinned alive.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Two cases of beer,
two sleeping bags.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
There's a third
sleeping bag upstairs.

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Everything you need for a 
night of teenage romance.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's unlikely
the two couples

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
brought a fifth wheel
to take notes.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Sheriff, it's possible
there was a third girl here.

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
A sixth victim.

131
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll get my deputies
to canvass the areas.

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
See if anybody saw a girl.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You said there was
another one outside?

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,234
Yeah.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He was like the others.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Coroner said
from the amount of blood,

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
he was alive
when they impaled him.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I know this is
gonna sound strange,

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
but the way the victims
were flayed alive,
mutilated,

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and now
the impalement display
of this last victim..

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
what?

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
These were all
war rituals

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
of the native american
plains indians.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That mean something
to you, sheriff?

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll say, it does.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Everything you see
around us is apache land.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This whole basin's
a sacred burial ground.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And was the sight of
a number of massacres,

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
as i understand.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So this development
is on their land?

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It was their land.

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But they didn't
have the money

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
or the inclination
to build on it,

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
so the town seized
half of.

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, last year,
the supreme court ruled

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
cities could use
imminent domain authority

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to seize and repossess
undeveloped private land

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,601
for private development.

159
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,000
And now the town
is looking for investors

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to build on
the other half.

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The apache
are fighting it,

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,003
of course, in court.

163
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:15,804
Is there been any violence
until now?

164
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,369
Nothing like this.

165
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,936
You know anybody
on the reservation
capable of this?

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't know. Reservation's
federal jurisdiction.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Sounds like where
we need to go.

168
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:26,840
Go call garcia.
See what she can find.

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Ok, one order of bad guys

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
on the apache reservation
coming right up.

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's hear it.

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Apparently there was
a militant group there

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
in the 70s
called the irm.

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Any of them
still around?

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No. There's a guy
on the reservation now

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
who's been locked up
more than a few times

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
for demonstrations,
resisting arrest.

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Mostly political protest
type stuff.

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yowsa, get this.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
His father was killed
in a shootout

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
with federal agent
wounded knee.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
His name,
Benjamin blackwolf.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The son, john Blackwolf.

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thanks, Garcia.

185
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:55,984
Blackwolf?

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
John blackwolf?

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You know him?

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Indian activist.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He's been in
a little trouble.

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Related to his activism,

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
but nothing violent.
Not around here.

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Should we call
the reservation police
and alert them?

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't think
that's a good idea.

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why not?

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,535
Blackwolf is
the reservation police.

196
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,701
Jane bear, these are
fbi agents.

197
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:33,000
Gideon.
Hello.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hotchner
how do you do?

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And reid.

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Miss bear is the president
of the tribal council

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and principal of
the reservation school.

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
President
and the principal.

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You must be a busy woman.

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We'rout here
on our own, agent Gideon.

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We all do our part.

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Is, uh..
John inside?

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Is this about
the terra mesa killings?

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
They just want to
talk to him.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
John blackwolf has done more
to help his tribe

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
than anyone.

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hell, jim,
how many times

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
have you called him in
to find lost hikers?

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How many drunken campers

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
has he tracked down
for the park service?

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
John is
a peaceful man..

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
who would not hesitate
to defend this tribe

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,762
with force if attacked.

218
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:09,000
What does this have to do
with terra mesa?

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, a lot,
if john considers

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
the building of
the terra mesa development

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,407
on apache land
to be an attack.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The developers have paid
a lot of families

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
to leave the reservation.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So many families
have gone now

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
that we can barely fill
a single class.

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Forcing the dene,
the apache nation,

227
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
to abandon their homes

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and live in
government controlled
internment camps.

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Does anybody know
the last tribe

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
to surrender to
the american government?

231
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It was
the chiricahua apache.

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And does anybody know

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,715
the name of the last
leader of the apaches?

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Geronimo.

235
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's right.

236
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He was caught by
the u.s. Army 5 times,

237
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:52,000
but the ga'he had given him
so much strength

238
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:54,493
he escaped..

239
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
each time.

240
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,100
Samuel.

241
00:10:58,135 --> 00:10:59,000
Yes?

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Tell the men from the fbi
who the ga'he are.

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The ga'he are mighty spirits
who dwell in desert caves.

244
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Reid.

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Is your name samuel?

246
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,053
Sorry.

247
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:13,000
Are the ga'he good spirits
or bad spirits?

248
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They're both.

249
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,032
Like men.

250
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,900
I'll take over
for you, john.

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Mr. Blackwolf,
i'm agent gideon.

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
These are agents
hotchner and reid.

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You look like
a college professor.

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You look like a student.

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You..

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you look like fbi.

257
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We're with
the behavioral
analysis unit.

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Profilers should
know better.

259
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
How's that?

260
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We don't
do massacres.

261
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:52,000
You do.

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Me, personally

263
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
your government.

264
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:57,000
Mr. Blackwolf,

265
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
'd like for you
take a look
at these photos

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,007
and help us figure out
how these kids were killed.

267
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:03,000
You're not asking
because i'm a cop.

268
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No.

269
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,965
We're asking
because you're an expert

270
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,549
on native american culture.

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't base my opinion
on pictures, mr. Hotchner.

272
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,532
I have to walk the ground.

273
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We should start inside.

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Forensics says the outside's
been contaminated

275
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
from all
the construction traffic.

276
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Of all the native
american tribes,

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
the apache
are most renowned
for their tracking ability.

278
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's said they can track
a man or animal

279
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
through any condition by

280
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
simply noticing the slightest
disturbance in the environment.

281
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,238
He's profiling the dirt.

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,943
I notice you don't
carry a gun.

283
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,678
21 feet.

284
00:12:42,176 --> 00:12:42,924
What?

285
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:44,779
Ask agent
hotchner there.

286
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:46,380
He's the real
gun hand.

287
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:47,000
Why do you say that?

288
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:48,919
You carry
two guns.

289
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,000
The maximum distance
an attacker with a knife

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
can close in the time
it takes to react,

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
draw your sidearm
and fire is 21 feet.

292
00:12:56,923 --> 00:12:58,652
Inside 21 feet, i win.

293
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:00,000
Outside,
i have other options

294
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
besides shooting a man.

295
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Like negotiating.

296
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Like running.

297
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:06,499
Why do you say
i carry two guns?

298
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,343
Your right instep print's heaver
than your left.

299
00:13:09,692 --> 00:13:10,000
And since
you dot appear

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,010
to have a clubbed
right foot..

301
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:13,000
you can't tell that
from my footprints.

302
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
it's no perceptible
difference between them.

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Your problem isn't
with your prints.

304
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,057
It's with
your perception.

305
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:25,558
What do you see?

306
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:27,703
There's a saying.

307
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:30,000
Once too much blood
has been spilled
on the same ground,

308
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
that ground develops
a thirst for it.

309
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
This is all consistent
with native american

310
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
warfare rituals,
but it's not apache.

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Whoever did this
carried out

312
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
the most brutal practices
of the apache.

313
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Navajo, comanche, pueblo.

314
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And sioux.

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No one tribe
every did them all.

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Not like this.

317
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Real indians would know that.

318
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:54,633
This wasn't indians.

319
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:58,000
And if you wanto
figure out who did this,

320
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
it might help to know

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,923
there was a sixth person
in the house.

322
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:01,996
Why do you say that?

323
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:05,000
Female. 90, 95 pounds.
Size 6 shoe.

324
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,464
Fallen arches.
She was walking alone,

325
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:09,723
when she was ambushed
by two men.

326
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:12,000
We also believe
there were at least
three suspects.

327
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Three?

328
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah.

329
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Two over here plus at least
six over there.

330
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Because while these two
carried this girl,

331
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
struling to their vehicle
to the east,

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
at least six others
ran single file

333
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
to hide their numbers
from the west.

334
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So you're saying
that there were eight?

335
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,716
At least.

336
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,216
And one hostage.

337
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You waed to see
how i behave

338
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
at the scene
of therime,

339
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
you can at least
tell me how i did.

340
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're lack of
anmotional reaction

341
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
at seeing the crimes

342
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
leads me to believe
you'rennocent.

343
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
A guilty man would've
feigned disgust?

344
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Exactly.

345
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you know what
counting coup is?

346
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No.

347
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The apache knew
they could easily prove
their superiority

348
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
by killing many
of the enemy tribe.

349
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But they also knew killings

350
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
would start
a fierce blood feud

351
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
which would result
in t waste of
lives and resources.

352
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Makes sense.

353
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So the apache
proved their superiority

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
by counting coup.

355
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Stealthily
stealing property,

356
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
usually horses,
from right under the nose

357
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
of their enemy.

358
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
To the apache, killing,
unless absolutely necessary,

359
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
was a sign of stupidity.

360
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And weakness.

361
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Ifhis your way

362
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
of saying you're not
the killer,

363
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
we already know that.

364
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So why am I
still talking to you?

365
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Hotch.

366
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So if there was another
girl out there,

367
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
no one's
reported her missing.

368
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
None of the papers
have received

369
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
any claims of reonsibility
or ranm demands.

370
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
'D like for you
to stay

371
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and help with
the profile briefing.

372
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If it'll keep the fbi
off the reservation,

373
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
i'll stay.

374
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Each torture ritual

375
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
had specific
religious significance,

376
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
but only to the tribe
that pcticed it.

377
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's highly unlikely
that any one tribe

378
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
would mix them
all together like this.

379
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Meaning?

380
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Whoever did this
obviously had knowledge

381
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
of native american culture,

382
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
but they had absolutely
no practical understanding of it.

383
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What we know, ishis pack
shares a singular vision

384
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
whether they share
religious faith,

385
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
racist ideology,

386
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
or political manifesto,

387
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
each member of this unit

388
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
has surrendered
its individual identity

389
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
to the group.

390
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's the act of kidnapping
that reveals the nature
of this pack.

391
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
From the german
red brige

392
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to the munich olympics

393
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
to iraqi insurgence.

394
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The act of kidnapping

395
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
is a characteristic
of political terrorist groups.

396
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
We could be looking for
a domestic terrorist
organization

397
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
like the symonese
liberation army

398
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
that kidnapped patty hearst.

399
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But these
are indians, right?

400
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I seriously doubt it.

401
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The torture
and mutilation you see here

402
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
are very confused
imitations

403
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
of warfare practiced by
native american tribes.

404
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Are you trying to
tell us

405
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
that indians wouldn't be
so brutal?

406
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No. I'm saying that indians
wouldn't be so confud.

407
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Can we really
be sure he's right?

408
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Well, i'm fairly certain

409
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
blackwolf wasn't in on it,

410
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
but you don't need
to be einstein

411
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
to realize
these people were indians,

412
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
or people that made it
look like indians.

413
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why would anyone want
to frame these indians

414
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
possibly to turn
public opinion
against them.

415
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Sheriff, you mentioned

416
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
the apache were fighting
the land grab in court.

417
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Public opinion would be
a significant factor.

418
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Is there anyone
besides the developers

419
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
who might be
vehemently opposed

420
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
to the indians
getting the land back?

421
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The adu.

422
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Who's that?

423
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
American defense union.

424
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Founded by a local businessman
named roy minton.

425
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
They're like the minute men
who control the borders,

426
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
only these guys blame
everything on the indians.

427
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Who are the members?

428
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Mion's people
are mostly white,

429
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
construction workers,

430
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
building supply vendors.

431
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Working class people

432
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
that believe indians
are standing in the way
of progress.

433
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And commerce.

434
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Whether they feel
the indians
are standing in the way

435
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
of progress or profit,

436
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
or they're just
nuine racists,

437
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
i think minton and the adu
are strong suspects.

438
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Let's bring minton in.

439
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Mr. Minton, any idea
who might be behind
these killings?

440
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The indians have a history
of violent behavior.

441
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Pecially the apaches.

442
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Did you know that they
used to kill white settlers,

443
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
decapitate the bodies,

444
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
put their victims heads
on wooden pikes

445
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
outside their houses?

446
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That was a long time ago.

447
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You still seem
pretty upset about it.

448
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That was the other night.

449
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
My family's beenealing
with the apache
for years.

450
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You know, your rhetoric
sounds just hateful enough

451
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
to justify violence.

452
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
We don't need to stoop
to their level.

453
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We're fighting
the indians in court.

454
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Is that right?

455
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Then why
all the guns, roy?

456
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Our recordshow
that your members

457
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
carry over firearms.

458
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We're simply exercising
our constitutional right

459
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
under the second amendme.

460
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We have the right
to defend ourselves.

461
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
guns, roy.
I don't think so.

462
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's n self defense.
That's plain paranoid.

463
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Not anymore.

464
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If minton is as fanatical
as he pretends to be,

465
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
he wouldn't file lawsuits.

466
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Or organize labor unions.

467
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The indians are keepg
minton and the members
of the adu

468
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
fr making a lot of money

469
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
on the development
and construction
of the apache land.

470
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I agree.

471
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
He's using racist ideology

472
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
to cover simple greed.

473
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Sheriff, i'd like you
to put minton under
surveillance.

474
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You think he's guilty?

475
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Not likely, but we've just
given minton reason
to believe

476
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that some faction
of the adu

477
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
may have taken matters
into their own hands,

478
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and minton
may lead us to them.

479
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's garcia.

480
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hey, what have you got?

481
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I have an ncic hit
on one of the prints

482
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
on the sliding glass door.

483
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Ingrid griesen,
19 years old,

484
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
family moved her here
two years ago from texas.

485
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Where they require
fingerprints

486
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
for driver's license
applications.

487
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
She wasn't among
the victims on the scene.

488
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Ok.

489
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Nice job.

490
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Think we might have found
our sixth victim.

491
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
How old was ingrid
when your wife
passed away?

492
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
14.

493
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And then,

494
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
you raised her
on your own?

495
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Why didn'tou report
your daughter
as missing, mr. Griesen?

496
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I didn't know
she was missing.

497
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
She has her own place.

498
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
She has her own life
at school.

499
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Her own friends.

500
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

501
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Couple weeks ago.

502
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
She's been going
through a phase
the past couple of months.

503
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Distancing herself.

504
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Has anyone
threatened ingrid?

505
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Not that i know of.

506
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Have you received
any menang phone calls

507
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
or seen anyone
in the neighborhood?

508
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Anything that's been
unusual at all.

509
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No. Nothing like that.

510
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We have reason to believe

511
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that people
who kidnapped your daughter

512
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
may be politically
motivated.

513
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
They killethose kids,

514
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and they kidnapped
ingrid in the name
of their cause.

515
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Think the first thing,
or the best thing

516
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
you can do
to help your daughter

517
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
is for you to go
on the news.

518
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How will that
help ingrid?

519
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If we can personalize
ingrid to the public,

520
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
the public will take
any harm that
comes to her

521
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
at the hands of
the kidnappers personally.

522
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Hurting her
would hurt their cause.

523
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That'll stop them
from killing her?

524
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It might.

525
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Ok.

526
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Hey.

527
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So?

528
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Fathers blame themselves
when a child is kidnapped.

529
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
As irrational as it is,
it's typical.

530
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This guy didn't do that,
why not?

531
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Well, in these situations,
innocentarents

532
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
don't hide their
feelgs of guilt,

533
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
while guilty parents do.

534
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So we're thinking
this guy's guilty?

535
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Of something.

536
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Ingrid is my only child.

537
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
She's my whole life.

538
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Please return ingrid to me.

539
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Talk to her, and you'll see,
she's a sweet child.

540
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
She's never hurt..

541
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
you have to see this.

542
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
/.. anything you need.

543
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
/Contact me directly.

544
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
/I will try..

545
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
what do we do?

546
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
/.. everything i can to help.

547
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We get rid of her.

548
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
/Whatever it takes.

549
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
/I'm asking you,
/please, leher go.

550
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
We've got a caller
on the line.

551
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Has griesen been prepped.

552
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Caller doesn't want to
speak to griesen.

553
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
In fact, he doesn't
want griesen to know

554
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
at he's even calling.

555
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is special ent
aaron hotchner.

556
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah. We have
ingrid griesen.

557
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
We'll turn ourselves
and the girl in

558
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
under one condition.

559
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm listening.

560
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You don't tell griesen
about it.

561
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What does it matter to you
what i tell griesen?

562
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Because he paid us
to kidnap her.

563
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Don't move!

564
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hey, don't shoot.

565
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Where's the girl?

566
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
She's in the van.

567
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Got her.

568
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Ingrid?

569
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
My name is Elle.
I'm with the fbi.

570
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Are you ok?

571
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Just tell me what happened.

572
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Peter griesen
hired us.

573
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He knew about
our records,

574
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
but he said
he'd ge us a chance.

575
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Two weeks ago,
he called us
into his office,

576
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
said he had some
off the clock
work for us.

577
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What kind of work?

578
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
He said his daughter
was in tuble.

579
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
He said he wanted us
to follow her, grab her,

580
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and take her
to the motel.

581
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You didn't question
his motives?

582
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Well, of course, we did.

583
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But then he gave us
half theoney.

584
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
He said if we
harmed her accidental
or otherwise,

585
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
he'dake sure
we paid for it.

586
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So he wanted you
to kidnap her
but not hurt her.

587
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah.

588
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So we grabbed her,
took her to the motel,

589
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
then we called griesen,
and he said co by
in the morning.

590
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But he didn't show.

591
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What about the killings?

592
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We didn't know
anything about that.

593
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
We saw it on the news
the next morning.

594
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
We called mr. Griesen,
he said, hold tight,

595
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
he'd come around
in the afternoon,

596
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
but he didn't show,

597
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
so, then the next night,
he's on the news.

598
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And he's talking
about kidnappers,

599
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and.. look, man..

600
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
we may be dumb, all right?

601
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
We're not stupid.
I made the call right then.

602
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You kidnapped the girl,
but then you leave

603
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
just minutes before
someone else comes

604
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and kills those kids.

605
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
We didn't kill them kids.

606
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
We was with her
the whole time since.

607
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You can ask her.

608
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Well, that's quite
the story.

609
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Thing is, they're telling
exactly the same one.

610
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I believe it's the truth.

611
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Why'd you kidnap
your own daughter?

612
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You kidnapped your daughter

613
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and coincidentally
saved her own life?

614
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Right now, at
the very least,

615
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
it looks like you had
prior knowledge
of the killings.

616
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And at worst..

617
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
i had nothing to do
with the murders.

618
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You paid leland
and van owen
to kidnap ingridwhy?

619
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I want my phone call.

620
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ifhat you're saying
is true,

621
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
it seems likely
your daughter

622
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
was somehow involved
in these killings.

623
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
She had nothing
to do with it.

624
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You stay the hell
away from her!

625
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I want the names
of all your daughter's
friends at school.

626
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Boyfriends.
I want her class schedule.

627
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Ingrid's very private.

628
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
We have 5 dead kids.

629
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Tortured, mutilated,
and murdered.

630
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And all we have to go on
is you and your daughter.

631
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Do the math!

632
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's garcia.

633
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I got this.

634
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You re?

635
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

636
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:30,000
All right. Yeah.
Talk to me.

637
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Hello, ingrid.

638
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm dr. Spencer reid.

639
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm with the fbi,
and i was wondering
if you could

640
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
griesen, ingrid..

641
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Excuse me?

642
00:24:43,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Griesen, ingrid.

643
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Doesn't look like minton
or the adu were part of it.

644
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
My men have been looking
at him and his friends.

645
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Checking on alibis.

646
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Nothing.

647
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The only thing
i'm certain of

648
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
is that peter griesen
is trying to
protect his daughter.

649
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hotchner.

650
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Ingrid isn't
catatonic anymore.

651
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But she's answering
evy question

652
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
with only her name
and social security number.

653
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Like a prisoner of war.

654
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
There's more.
Garcia did some checking.

655
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Ingrid hasn't been
enrolled in school
for over a year.

656
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
She had good grades.

657
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Just suddenly dropped out

658
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and vacated
her campus apartment.

659
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
She left
no forwarding, hotch.

660
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
We have no idea
where or how
she's been living.

661
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Thanks.

662
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I need to see
ter griesen's phone records.

663
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
How long has your daughter
been in a cult?

664
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Unit 4, i'm still on
a code 6

665
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
outside the minton residence.

666
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Looks like everyone's
gone to bed. Over.

667
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:24,000
/10-4, patrol. Base out.

668
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
About a month ago,
you placed a call

669
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
to a psychiatrist
in boulder named
dr. Richard frank.

670
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
He's a deprogrammer,

671
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and his specialty
is getting kids
out of cults.

672
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Your daughter joined
a dangerous cult.

673
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And you couldn't
convince her to leave,

674
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
so you had her kidnapped.

675
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Now you're
protecting her

676
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
because you think
ingrid and her cult
killed those kids,

677
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and you're
probably right.

678
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
There's another killing.

679
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
A family of 5
was slaughtered

680
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
in exactly the same way
as the terra mesa killings,

681
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and among the dead
are three girls.

682
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Ages 5, 8, and 1

683
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
legally, this could
go a long way

684
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
in distancing
your daughter
from the others.

685
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
If ingrid had
a change of heart,

686
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
a case could be made
for brainwashing

687
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
or even
temporary insanity.

688
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Mr. Griesen..

689
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
we need you
to tell us
what you know

690
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
about ingrid's
situation.

691
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's all my fault.

692
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Ever since her mother died,

693
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
i've done everything
i could for her.

694
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Somehow i left her
vulnerable to these people.

695
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Given the wrong
circumstances,

696
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
this could happen
to anyone's child.

697
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Tell us what happened.

698
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Ingrid was in
her first semester.

699
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
She started acting strange.

700
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
She hardly visited anymore,

701
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
when she did, she was..

702
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
different.

703
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
How? How was she
different?

704
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
The way she spoke.

705
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
She kept repeating
these words.

706
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This jargon.

707
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I didn't know where
she was getting it.

708
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And she just disappeared.

709
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Cults commonly
have theirwn language.

710
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
They invent or redefine
certn words

711
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
only the cult members
understand.

712
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's a way of
isolating the members
from outsiders.

713
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's a very powerful form
of thought control.

714
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
If you could help us
identify some of
the key word

715
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
perhaps we could get
ingrid talking.

716
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
She said i was a trespasser.

717
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
That i had no right
to be here.

718
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
New mexico?

719
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
In the desert.

720
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
She said grandfather
had taught her the ways of,

721
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
oh, what was the word?

722
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Ofahi, gaji..

723
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
ga'he.

724
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yes. That's right.

725
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Thank you.

726
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
We're looking for
the cult leader.

727
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Typically men between
the age of 25 and 35

728
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
with a high level
of intelligence.

729
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Sociopathic underachiever,

730
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
with an extremely
abusive childhood.

731
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And obviously someone
with an interest in

732
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and affinity for apache
culture and rituals.

733
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Look for males
with criminal records

734
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
for lesser type crimes.

735
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Drug possession,
petty theft.

736
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
What about
school records?

737
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
The victims
from the first
crime scene

738
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
was terra mesa
university.

739
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Maybe the leader
was there, too.

740
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That's great.

741
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Look for students
who stied

742
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
native american
cultures extensively.

743
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We need to do it all.

744
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:06,000
With this second strike,
it could be a spree.

745
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Sorry about
your man, jimmy.

746
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I appreciate that.

747
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That her?

748
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
She won't give us
anything but her name
and her social.

749
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Thanks.

750
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Ok. They're ready.
Everybody out.

751
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Come with me.

752
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
My friend wants to
show y something.

753
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Ingrid, name
is john blackwolf.

754
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I know who you are.

755
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You're the son
of benjamin blackwolf.

756
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
The chiricahua apache.

757
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Come with me.

758
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:09,000
What do you think
happened here, ingrid?

759
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I think three little
trespassers

760
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
met the vengeful blade
of the tribe.

761
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Whatribe would that be?

762
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
There are only
two peoples.

763
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
The apache knows who
trespass against us.

764
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You're not
apache, ingrid.

765
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
No. You are not apache.

766
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Not anymore.

767
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Grandfather tested me.

768
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
He sent me
to the desert mountains

769
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to be blessed
by the ga'he.

770
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The ga'he have brought
grandfather back to us

771
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
to build his new tribe.

772
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
To reclaim the sacred land
for the apache.

773
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Where is grandfather?

774
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Did grandfather
ever tell you

775
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
where the name apache
comes from?

776
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It comes from
the yuni word, apachu.

777
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It means enemy.

778
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And if grandfather
knew the first thing
about the real apache,

779
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
he would've taught you
to refer to us
as the dene.

780
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It means, the people.

781
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Grandfather said
that you and all
the living apache

782
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
are like
the jews of old.

783
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Lost and wandering
the desert

784
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
in search of their messiah.

785
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And he has..

786
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the dene don't believe
in a messiah.

787
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You were lied to, ingrid.

788
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The ga'he said..

789
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
don't use a word
you don't understand.

790
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The ga'he are not
magic fairies.

791
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
They're not gods
as you understand them.

792
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
This is not the blood
of an enemy!

793
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
This is the blood
of a little girl

794
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
just like you are.

795
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You've been fed
bits and pieces
of a culture

796
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
you don't understand.

797
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You don't know.

798
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What we do know
is you've been manipulated

799
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and exploited by
a very disturbed individual.

800
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You're a liar.

801
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You have disavowed
your ancestors.

802
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Only those who dwell
at the deadlands

803
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
deserve to live.

804
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The deadlands are on
the southern edge
of the western tract.

805
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You said cults like this
se out remote places, yes?

806
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They like to isolate
their followers

807
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and give them freedom
to create
their own societies.

808
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Ok. I got it.

809
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It doesn't get
any more remote
than the deadlands.

810
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
How big an area
is this place?

811
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
About square miles.

812
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
We'll need to
narrow it down.

813
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
We might just have
our cult leader.

814
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's a guy named
jackson cally.

815
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He was expelled
from tmu six months
before the others.

816
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
What for?

817
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Mescaline. Peyote.

818
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Terra mesa was the last
in a string of colleges.

819
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
He studied religion
and native american culture

820
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
in every school and
he was in a seminar

821
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
in native american culture
with ingrid griesen.

822
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That's how they know
so much about me.

823
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I've been
a guest lecturer
in that seminar

824
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
for the past 4 years.

825
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
If cally's
our cult leader,

826
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
we need more
information on him.

827
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Have garcia pull every shred
of cally's life of
the system.

828
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
She's already
pulling it.

829
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Do we know he's still
in the area?

830
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
He was arrested
for trespassing

831
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
on a bunch of
motel properties.

832
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Breaking into
unoccupied rooms.

833
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But his last known aress
turned up cold.

834
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Most cults don't have

835
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
any legitimate means
of paying rent.

836
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
They tend to seek out
abandoned, previously
standing structures.

837
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Like manson's spahn ranch.

838
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
There's an abandoned motel
off route 29.

839
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Right in the middle
of the deadlands.

840
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Let's go.

841
00:32:42,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'll stay with reid,
and we'll pull
as much as we can on cally.

842
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Fbi, don't move.

843
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Put your hands
out to the side

844
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and turn around
very slowly.

845
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Jackson cally.

846
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Grandfather.

847
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
There's no one
else here, hotch.

848
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,043
Where are the others?

849
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:39,020
Hunting.

850
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,868
Jackson Gordon Cally.

851
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:45,267
32 years old.

852
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:46,000
Spent most of
his childhood

853
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
moving from foster home
to foster home.

854
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,643
/Hang on a second.
/I'm gonna put you
/on speaker.

855
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Ahead, reid.

856
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Simply another sad
but unremarkable statistic.

857
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Aside from the fact
that he had an iq of 189.

858
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,683
Any criminal record?

859
00:33:59,683 --> 00:34:02,000
At 18 he spent 22 months
in prison for auto theft.

860
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I just spoke to the warden
at the prison,

861
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
said when he was there,
he found religion

862
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and began preaching
to his fellow inmates.

863
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,897
And that he once convinced
a mass murderer

864
00:34:09,897 --> 00:34:11,000
he was doing time with
to beat to death

865
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
an inmate that was
threatening Cally.

866
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Ever since he was a child,
this guy just survived

867
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
on cunning
force of personality.

868
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,727
Spent 22 months in the clink,

869
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:20,000
was released
and then bounced

870
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
from university
to university.

871
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:24,245
Studying, you guessed it,
native american cultures.

872
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:25,175
Ok, thanks.

873
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,000
What's his connection
to the apache?

874
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Aside from
taking your class,

875
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
nothing that they
could find.

876
00:34:30,753 --> 00:34:31,856
With sociopaths
like cally,

877
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:32,924
there is no connection.

878
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:34,000
If it hadn't been apache,

879
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
he would've found
some other culture

880
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,842
to attract and manipulate
his followers.

881
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:38,000
Like manson,
cally has been forced

882
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
to become an expert
profiler of sorts.

883
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,124
He reads the people around him.
 He finds a way in.

884
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,601
And then he brainwashes them
to serve his needs.

885
00:34:44,636 --> 00:34:47,029
And the only way to figure out his game
is to play it.

886
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:48,633
I'm gonna give him
exactly what he wants.

887
00:34:48,927 --> 00:34:49,644
What's that?

888
00:34:50,292 --> 00:34:51,473
An audience.

889
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Mr. Cally, i'm special agent
aaron hotchner with the fbi.

890
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You know, i spent
my whole life

891
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,250
talking to cops and doctors.

892
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,734
Something different
about you.

893
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,449
You're not just a cop,
are you?

894
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You're very perceptive.

895
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:16,886
So, what are you?

896
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,376
I'm a profiler.

897
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:19,968
So am i.

898
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Your colleagues
respect you a great deal.

899
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,071
Looking to you to find
all the answers.

900
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:27,298
Leadership is a grave
responsibility.

901
00:35:27,298 --> 00:35:29,285
They don't call me
grandfather.

902
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:32,260
Well, in my tribe, grandfather is simply
another word for teacher.

903
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,700
Did you teach your tribe
to murder?

904
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
No, i don't teach murder.
I teach love.

905
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,700
Love of land.

906
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Love of ancestors.

907
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,175
Love of the tribe.

908
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
These trespassers
poison the land.

909
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,700
The apache will soon
remember who they are

910
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
and they will hunt
these trespassers

911
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,685
off their land.

912
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,116
Until no one
but the apache remain.

913
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:52,502
You think you speak
for the apache.

914
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:56,200
But you're nothing
but a coward.

915
00:35:57,453 --> 00:35:58,559
And a killer.

916
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,700
I haven't killed anyone.

917
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,700
Do you think that
your little tribe

918
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,700
is going to wage a war

919
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,700
with all the white
peoplen this state?

920
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Pretty soon,
we won't have to.

921
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,430
Why is that?

922
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,700
What's going to happen when the angry 
white men come to the doors

923
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,700
of your children
blaming you

924
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,844
for the killing
of their people?

925
00:36:14,493 --> 00:36:15,954
What are you going to do,
call the cops?

926
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,715
No. You're going
to string them up.

927
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:20,634
You're going to put
their heads on poles

928
00:36:20,634 --> 00:36:22,112
and rape their women.

929
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:24,601
Just like the savage animal
you really are.

930
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,988
Too bad you couldn't be the leader that your father was.
Before they shot him down...

931
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:29,990
Enough! Blackwolf !

932
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:42,596
Let me in with him alone.

933
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,700
I'll get him talking.

934
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,776
You've done more than we
could' hoped for.

935
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:47,700
You guys take cally down
to the sheriff's office.

936
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,700
You tell that man

937
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,893
he's welcome
on my reservation anytime.

938
00:36:53,393 --> 00:36:54,646
I'll give you
a ride back.

939
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,300
Blackwolf got Cally
to reveal his true nature.

940
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,300
He's a racist.

941
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
None of this
was for the sake
of the apache.

942
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,300
Never was.

943
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,300
It was always about cally.

944
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,300
It was about power
and manipulation.

945
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
Charles manson claimed

946
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,300
that he ordered his
followers to kill whites

947
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,300
in order to initiate
a race war.

948
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
Something he referred to
as helter skelter.

949
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,300
And he believed
in the aftermath

950
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,025
of helter skelter, the blacks,
who he deeme inferior,

951
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,420
would need a white man
to lead them.

952
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:16,300
There was a large
cache of guns

953
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,517
missing from
minton's house.

954
00:37:17,552 --> 00:37:19,300
Why? Why would cally
suddenly need guns?

955
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,777
His whole m.o.
Is to fight a war

956
00:37:20,777 --> 00:37:22,045
using the native
american methods.

957
00:37:22,045 --> 00:37:23,300
Maybe he isn't trying
to fight a war.

958
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,265
Maybe he's trying
to start one.

959
00:37:24,265 --> 00:37:26,300
The first attack
was designed to look like indians.

960
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
In an attempt
to manipulate the A.D.U.

961
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,300
to retaliate
against the reservation.

962
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,855
But they didn't.
How could they?

963
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:32,112
We had them put
under surveillance.

964
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:34,300
So cally tried
to provoke them further

965
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,890
by killing the head
of the A.D.U.

966
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,122
Minton and his family.

967
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,300
Right, but that
didn't work either

968
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,593
so now he wants to attack
the other side.

969
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:41,300
He's trying to provoke
the indians

970
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,300
by staging an adu attack
against them.

971
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,337
Call blackwolf.
We need to get to
the reservation.

972
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,952
The school is for our most
vulnerable target.

973
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:49,947
Killing kids ???

974
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,300
In 61, cochise
led his followers to fight..

975
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,300
put that away.

976
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,300
What?

977
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,972
You don't need it.

978
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,398
Use your baton.

979
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,581
The are many paths
to the same place.

980
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,896
Trust me.

981
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
Just so you know,

982
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,998
you sound like
a fortune cookie.

983
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,204
Split up.

984
00:38:39,392 --> 00:38:40,065
Find them.

985
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,572
Hey.

986
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,536
Psst.

987
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,670
Big mistake.

988
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,383
Stay down.
I don't want to hurt you.

989
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:20,911
Down!

990
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,429
Don't move!

991
00:41:25,464 --> 00:41:26,537
Don't shoot!
I give up!

992
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,385
You ok?

993
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,216
Just had to shoot
somebody, didn't you?

994
00:41:51,233 --> 00:41:51,522
The children?

995
00:41:51,557 --> 00:41:53,590
They're fine.
We got them out before they got here.

996
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,300
We took down these four.

997
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,157
Without firing a shot?

998
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
Captain america here
shot number 5.

999
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,354
You're welcome.

1000
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,982
Number 6 is cut up
pretty bad.

1001
00:42:01,982 --> 00:42:03,001
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

1002
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,732
At least i didn't
shoot him.

1003
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,735
I think i'd rather
be shot.

1004
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,300
There's an old
apache saying.

1005
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,794
You can take many paths
to get to the same place.

1006
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,300
Be with you in a second.

1007
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,431
nice.

1008
00:42:37,646 --> 00:42:38,300
What's this?

1009
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:40,300
Paul morris. He's in
the new york field office

1010
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,300
if you ever need anything,
give him a call.

1011
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,649
He'll take care of you.

1012
00:42:44,637 --> 00:42:45,300
This your way of saying

1013
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,300
i can't take care
of myself?

1014
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,243
No. It's my way of saying
i'm a jackass.

1015
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,564
Yeah, well, it must be
hereditary.

1016
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:56,300
Sean..

1017
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,722
it's really important
that you do this your way.

1018
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,300
You know, what you feel

1019
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,300
is every bit as important
as what you think.

1020
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,300
Dad knew that.

1021
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,300
I forgot.
You reminded me, and..

1022
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,285
thanks.

1023
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,300
This is, uh,
a pretty messed up

1024
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,046
going away present,
you know that?

1025
00:43:16,236 --> 00:43:17,308
Brother worries.

1026
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:19,300
You need to get out
of the office more.

1027
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,188
Tell me about it.

1028
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:22,300
So I'm starved.
How's the food?

1029
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,265
It's pretty good.

1030
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,300
Let me fix you
something special.

1031
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,300
I'm in your hands.

1032
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
Want a beer?

1033
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,169
Sure, man. Thanks.
