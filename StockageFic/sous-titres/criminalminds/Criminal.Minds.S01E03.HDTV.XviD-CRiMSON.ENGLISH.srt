1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,628
The forecast,plenty  
of sunshine through today

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,754
with seasonal temperatures.

3
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,964
We should reach  
our normal high of

4
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,050
about 82 degrees  
by this afternoon.

5
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,552
Look for clear skies  
tonight with a low near 70.

6
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,054
Increasing cloudiness

7
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,472
tomorrow,  
sticky and humid with-

8
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,318
Clurman!

9
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,410
Why didn't you  
return my calls, Gil?

10
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,204
Come on, Joe, give me a break.

11
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,246
I'm late for a meeting.

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,123
I left messages on every line.

13
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,791
I even talked  
with your assistant.

14
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,376
Look, I've been really busy, ok?

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,961
We have a meeting  
scheduled tomorrow.

16
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,004
We'll talk then.

17
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,881
That's right, we will.

18
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,466
You blow me off again

19
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,009
it's gonna get ugly,

20
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,428
and I won't be so  
understanding next time.

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,007
Clurman's was the  
second bombing this morning,

22
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,051
both in residential  
neighborhoods in palm beach.

23
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,510
Homeland  
Security been notified?

24
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,012
And ATF. In  
addition to a profile,

25
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,388
they want a threat assessment.

26
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,473
Is the media onto it?

27
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,266
Of course. JJ's  
keeping tabs on that.

28
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:41,893
What do we know 
about the bombs?

29
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,352
Morgan hooked up with ATF.

30
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,562
They're sending pictures of

31
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:46,022
bomb fragments  
as they find them.

32
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,275
Pipe bombs.

33
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,735
Packed in cardboard boxes.

34
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,736
Package bombs

35
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:52,820
Sent through the mail?

36
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,905
No.

37
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,239
The other picture in your hand

38
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,657
is of the  
switch that atf found.

39
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,327
Same mechanism for both 
bombs, mercury-activated.

40
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,411
What does that mean?

41
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:01,871
There are  
contacts to a detonator

42
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:03,831
on either end of a  
bent tube full of mercury.

43
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:05,750
What it means is  
all you have to do is to

44
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,168
tilt the  
package to detonate it.

45
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:09,211
So they couldn't have  
been sent through the mail.

46
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,464
The bomber had to  
deliver them himself.

47
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,716
Exactly. Strange way to
commit an act of terrorism.

48
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:14,842
Why go to all this trouble

49
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:15,968
to kill just a few people?

50
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,511
Let's recommend not raising

51
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,054
the terror  
alert level for now.

52
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,848
No reason to spread panic.

53
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:22,141
We got news.

54
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:23,601
This is just a local channel,

55
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:25,895
but the coverage  
is everywhere now-

56
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:28,147
CNN, FOX, MSNBC, Al-Jazeera,you
name it.

57
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,065
So much for not 
spreading panic.

58
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,234
According to  
doctors, he's badly injured,

59
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,069
but in stable  
condition in the I.C.U.

60
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,821
Now, neighbors say  
that they heard a blast

61
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,033
at about 10:30 this  
morning, and police arrived...

62
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,826
if DHS doesn't raise 
the terror alert now,

63
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:41,869
they'll look weak.

64
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:43,370
Make sure Homeland Security

65
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,747
knows that this is everywhere.

66
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:46,999
I just felt that!

67
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,710
Are you all right?  
Is everyone all right?

68
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:53,839
Let's meet at  
the airstrip in 20.

69
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,924
This is live, I  
repeat this is live.

70
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:38,216
Yeah, what's up?

71
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,301
Hotch, listen,

72
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:40,468
they're gonna be sending us

73
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:41,928
bomb fragments  
by this afternoon.

74
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,930
I'm the only one  
with an ATF background.

75
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,432
So if you'd like 
me to stay behind

76
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:47,225
and supervise the  
bomb profile, I'm on that.

77
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:48,602
Morgan, you  
wouldn't be afraid to

78
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:50,061
be out in the  
field with a bomber,

79
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:51,187
now, would you?

80
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:52,397
You know maybe it's not the

81
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,690
bomber that I'm worried about.

82
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:55,108
I thought we  
were past all that.

83
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,484
Hotch, Boston sent Gideon

84
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:57,819
into a posttraumatic tailspin.

85
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,487
How do we know  
that won't happen again?

86
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:00,530
Morgan, I tell you what.

87
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:02,574
Why don't we concentrate on
profiling the bomber,

88
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:04,117
and not Gideon?

89
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:05,618
Copy that.

90
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:10,290
Samuel Johnson wrote,

91
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:12,876
"almost all  
absurdity of conduct

92
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,712
arises from the imitation of

93
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:18,506
those whom we  
cannot resemble. "

94
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,466
Bombings occurred  
within 3 miles of each other.

95
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,344
First victim was a 
74-year-old widow, Barbara
Keller.

96
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:24,846
2 hours after that,

97
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:26,347
Clurman got hit 
in his driveway,

98
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,224
and 45 minutes later...

99
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:30,059
well, we all saw that.

100
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:31,144
Jill Swenson,

101
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,645
34-year-old  
housewife who lived

102
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:34,022
across the  
street from Clurman.

103
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:36,316
Of the 3, only  
Clurman survived.

104
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,192
Was there any connection
between the victims?

105
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:39,736
One. Clurman was a partner

106
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,446
in a $10-million 
condo development

107
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,030
deal in which  
Keller was an investor,

108
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:44,949
and a few weeks  
ago, the whole deal went bust.

109
00:04:45,032 --> 00:04:46,659
Went bust how?

110
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:48,828
Geologists discovered that
the land was on methane,

111
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:50,079
the condos never got

112
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:51,497
built, the land  
became worthless,

113
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:53,875
and Clurman lost a lot of
people and a lot of money.

114
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,084
So maybe one of them was mad

115
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:56,377
enough to take aim at Clurman.

116
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,170
No, let's not get  
ahead of ourselves.

117
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:00,756
It's a little too early  
to theorize about motive.

118
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,508
Then where do we start?

119
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:04,218
>From the beginning.

120
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:05,553
What do we know about bombers?

121
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:09,724
Mostly male,loners, history of
criminal activity.

122
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,517
About 50% of all bombings are

123
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,185
actually a  
product of vandalism.

124
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:14,270
And more often than not,

125
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:16,605
bombers end up accidentally
blowing themselves up,

126
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:17,690
so the first suspects you

127
00:05:17,773 --> 00:05:19,233
always look for  
in the bombing case

128
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:20,317
are the victims.

129
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:22,069
Clurman was the only male.

130
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:24,321
Losing a large  
business deal like

131
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:26,449
that could be a  
powerful stressor.

132
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:28,242
Well, then  
there's the crime scene.

133
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:30,035
Clurman was the only victim

134
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,745
who didn't get  
hit at his door.

135
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:32,997
Why?

136
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,790
What was  
different about this one?

137
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:36,584
Before Clurman passed out,

138
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,127
all he told cops  
at the time was that

139
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,587
he saw the package sitting on

140
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,130
the stoop  
outside his kitchen door.

141
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:43,424
Why didn't he take it in?

142
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:46,135
Why didn't it go off  
until he got to his car?

143
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:47,428
It's like 50 feet away.

144
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:49,638
Joe Reese, one of  
Clurman's investors,

145
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,098
was here before  
the bomb went off.

146
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,891
The cops have ruled  
him out as a s suspect,

147
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,309
but he said he saw Clurman

148
00:05:54,393 --> 00:05:55,728
get in the car  
with the package.

149
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:58,272
So maybe Clurman wasn't 
receiving a bomb at all.

150
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:00,357
Maybe he was on his  
way to delivering one.

151
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,984
But he drops it or tilts it,

152
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:03,527
and it goes off by accident.

153
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,987
I'd like to talk to Clurman.

154
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,613
In the meantime, let's get a

155
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:08,073
warrant to search his house.

156
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:21,336
You have a package.

157
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:23,171
Don't worry. Had a police

158
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:24,715
escort all the  
way from palm beach.

159
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:27,926
Ok, right on time

160
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:29,803
Thanks, man, I got this.

161
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:31,680
These are my bomb fragments.

162
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:33,807
We can start putting  
this bad boy together.

163
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:37,269
Why bother?  
Don't you just look

164
00:06:37,352 --> 00:06:39,104
at the pieces  
for prints and stuff?

165
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:42,482
Garcia, what are  
you doing in the FBI?

166
00:06:42,524 --> 00:06:44,276
I didn't get  
into medical school?

167
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:46,444
Why does that not surprise me?

168
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,613
Ouch. That's  
what my father said.

169
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:50,657
All right, I'm about  
to teach you something,

170
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,950
so pay attention.

171
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,201
Oh, it's like school.

172
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:54,828
Look, how these  
things are put together

173
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:56,288
can tell you how 
the unsub thinks.

174
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:57,789
You sound like Gideon.

175
00:06:57,872 --> 00:06:59,457
Ok, ouch.

176
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,918
You think it's bull? Ok...

177
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:03,837
All right.

178
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:07,090
You see that section of pipe?

179
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:08,216
Yeah

180
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:10,427
That right there used 
to be part of the cap.

181
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,637
It screwed onto  
these threads right here.

182
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:14,055
But, see, here's the thing-

183
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,307
it had to be  
done very carefully

184
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:18,309
because even if one 
tiny grain of powder

185
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:20,186
go onto those  
threads while he was working,

186
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,354
that little bit of friction

187
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:22,564
would have ignited the bomb.

188
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:24,566
Boom! Boom! Boom!

189
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:26,526
See you later, unsub.

190
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:28,903
Now, he didn't have to  
use a powder that fine.

191
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:30,822
He didn't have to 
use threaded caps,

192
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,699
and he didn't even  
have to use a steel pipe,

193
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,783
and it would have been a

194
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:35,034
whole lot safer if he hadn't.

195
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:37,287
But the bomb wouldn't  
have been nearly as deadly.

196
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,372
So what does that  
tell you about our unsub?

197
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:41,040
He's one sick puppy?

198
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:44,711
To say the least. One sick
puppy that aims to kill.

199
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:45,878
Not scare, not vandalize,

200
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,922
or make some kind  
of political statement.

201
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:49,340
Kill.

202
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,557
Where's your team right now?

203
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,641
Down in the garage.

204
00:07:58,724 --> 00:07:59,892
After they finish the garage,

205
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,269
make sure they  
check the attic.

206
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,311
Agent Hotchner?

207
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:03,396
Yes, sir?

208
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,106
Detective  
Morrison, Palm Beach P.D.

209
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:06,190
I'm lead on the case.

210
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:07,275
Nice to meet you.

211
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:08,526
This is Agent Greenaway.

212
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,361
Agents Reid and  
Gideon are at the hospital.

213
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:12,446
I think you met Agent  Jareau
at the station house.

214
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:14,156
Oh, yeah, she's  
taken over the place.

215
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,241
She does that.

216
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:17,076
ATF hasn't found  
any hard evidence yet,

217
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,619
just some kitchen timers, tape

218
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:20,121
recorders, and  
electrical switches.

219
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:21,163
Yeah

220
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,332
It is amazing how  
many household items

221
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,459
count as potential  
bomb-making materials.

222
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:26,752
Hello?

223
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:28,087
Excuse me!

224
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,380
Mrs. Clurman.

225
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:30,881
What's going on here?

226
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:32,007
Mrs. Clurman

227
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:33,467
my name is Special Agent

228
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:34,844
Aaron Hotchner with the FBI.

229
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:36,554
What are you  
doing in my house?

230
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:38,639
There's a copy of  
the warrant on the table.

231
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:40,182
I know that this  
is hard to believe,

232
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:42,017
but we just need to  
cover all of our bases.

233
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,602
We need to make sure that your

234
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:45,187
husband was not  
involved in any way.

235
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:46,397
Involved?

236
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,649
My husband's in the hospital
with his leg blown off.

237
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:50,109
What are you talking about?!

238
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:51,193
Mrs. Clurman,

239
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:52,695
there are some questions that

240
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:54,154
your husband needs to answer,

241
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:56,824
and the sooner that we  
talk to him and clear him,

242
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:59,493
then the sooner we can  find
whoever's responsible.

243
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:00,786
Agent Hotchner?

244
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:01,995
We've got something.

245
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:10,003
We found this buried  
on the back of that shelf.

246
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:15,425
Mrs. Clurman...

247
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:18,929
do you know  
anything about this?

248
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:31,608
What can you tell us about
the package, Mr. Clurman?

249
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:34,027
I thought I knew what it was.

250
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:37,614
Pot for an  
orchid. I collect them.

251
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:40,200
I ordered the  
pot through the mail.

252
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:42,035
Why didn't you take it inside?

253
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:43,745
It was for my office.

254
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:45,497
I was going there anyway.

255
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:47,207
Thought I'd take it with me.

256
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,918
That's the last  
thing I remember.

257
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:53,338
You had an  
argument with Joe Reese.

258
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:54,422
Do you remember that?

259
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:55,715
Joe was there?

260
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:56,716
He was angry,

261
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,802
he accused you  
of blowin' him off.

262
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:00,136
Uh...

263
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,222
Any reason he'd  
want to hurt you?

264
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:03,723
Joe? No.

265
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:06,226
I mean, he's a  
confrontational guy,

266
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:08,103
but if he wanted to kill me,

267
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:09,980
he'd just beat me to death.

268
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:13,191
A lot of people were angry

269
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:14,484
about that deal falling apart,

270
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,194
and they were angry at you.

271
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:19,739
How did that make you feel?

272
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:22,033
I felt awful.

273
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,786
I thought those  
condos would make

274
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:26,830
a lot of money  
for a lot of people,

275
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:28,873
myself included.

276
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:31,834
I thought that  
geologist was legit.

277
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:34,337
He didn't even take samples.

278
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:36,297
He scammed us.

279
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:39,300
All those investors  
who lost their money...

280
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:41,302
Barbara.

281
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:42,637
Barbara Keller?

282
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:43,930
The first victim.

283
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:46,099
What about her?

284
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,101
It's just such a shame.

285
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:50,186
Such a nice lady, you know?

286
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:52,230
It was such an easy sale.

287
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,110
Sometimes I felt like  
I took advantage of her

288
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,320
because she  
was old and lonely.

289
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,239
Now she's dead.

290
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:04,408
Well... I feel terrible.

291
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:07,870
What is it?

292
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:09,413
Ah, my foot!

293
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:12,416
Get you something.

294
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:28,432
Yeah?

295
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:29,517
This isn't our guy.

296
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,977
His answers were coherent
even while he was sedated.

297
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:34,105
He's got a sense of  
humor, displays empathy...

298
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:35,189
not to mention he has a

299
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:36,565
hobby  
unrelated to bomb-making.

300
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:39,068
This is nothing like a 
typical bomber profile.

301
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:40,569
What about the  
materials we found?

302
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:41,612
Well, we'll see if the

303
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,113
fragments match  
at the bomb scene,

304
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:44,198
but I doubt they will.

305
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:45,533
Ok.

306
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:46,617
Look at this.

307
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,369
This is their nephew in Texas.

308
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:50,037
And according to Mrs. Clurman,

309
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,789
he was staying with them for

310
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:53,415
a month and left last week.

311
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:55,125
Mercury switches are a little

312
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:56,794
sophisticated for 
a 12-year-old kid.

313
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:58,087
I'm not saying he's the unsub,

314
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,547
but boys his age  
like to blow stuff up.

315
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:02,091
I'll call Morrison.

316
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:03,842
He'll contact  
local P.D. in Texas

317
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:05,511
and pick up the  
kid and talk to him.

318
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:14,603
You know, a watched  
bomb never assembles.

319
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:17,523
I'm down to the last few

320
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:18,816
pieces, and for the life of me,

321
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,484
I can't figure  
out how they fit

322
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,110
together or  
if they fit together.

323
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,740
They might not even be  
part of the bomb at all.

324
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:28,659
What's the big deal?

325
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,910
You got most of it.

326
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:31,119
I'd give you a B-plus.

327
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,330
Thanks.

328
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,667
The big deal is it could  be
part of his signature.

329
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,876
Ooh, signature. Like a sign of

330
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:39,127
the Zodiac, that kind of thing?

331
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:41,129
Yeah. Yeah, just like that.

332
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:43,423
I was serious. I really
wanted to learn that time.

333
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:48,720
Signature's the  
thing that they get off on,

334
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:50,180
like a flourish

335
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:51,556
You know, a  
certain kind of pipe,

336
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:52,849
a certain mix of powders.

337
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:53,934
Like the Unabomber

338
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:56,228
he always used  
something wood in his bombs.

339
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:57,312
I mean, I don't know.

340
00:12:57,395 --> 00:12:59,439
These guys,they think they're
artists or something,

341
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:01,691
so they sign their work.

342
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,860
And you think by putting
these last pieces together,

343
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:05,779
you might find the signature?

344
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,072
Yeah.

345
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:09,741
See, sometimes the  
design itself is unique,

346
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:11,242
so once we do  
put it all together,

347
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:12,661
we can compare it to other

348
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:14,162
exemplars in our 
evidence database

349
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:15,538
and see if the  
bomb was built by

350
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,248
somebody we may  
have already come across.

351
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,291
What?

352
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,959
If there was  
another piece like this...

353
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,336
No, I tried  
that. It doesn't fit.

354
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:23,088
No, it could have  
been part of a longer rod

355
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:24,339
that fit through the top

356
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:25,590
and went all the way through.

357
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:27,717
Tetris.

358
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,012
Damn it.

359
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,222
What? Did I mess something up?

360
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:34,474
No. No, no, Garcia.

361
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:35,725
You nailed it.

362
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:38,811
I know who built this bomb.

363
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:41,940
The guy's doing  
life in federal prison.

364
00:13:55,912 --> 00:13:56,996
Morgan e-mailed these over.

365
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,123
The three on the left are the
bombs from yesterday.

366
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:00,291
The one on the right's from

367
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:01,584
the evidence room at quantico.

368
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:02,794
They are all identical.

369
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:04,962
They are made with  
steel reinforcement rods.

370
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:06,422
Adrian Bale.

371
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,007
Who?

372
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:10,343
He held our agents in a

373
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:12,011
standoff in Boston last year.

374
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:13,679
He took out 6 agents and a

375
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:15,306
hostage with one of his bombs.

376
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:17,934
So you're  
thinking he's behind this?

377
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:20,102
Possibly, but he's in prison.

378
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:21,687
He's got kind of a cult

379
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:23,189
following, almost like Manson.

380
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:24,398
It could just be a copycat.

381
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,566
There's one way to find out.

382
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,026
Let's put the  
screws to this guy.

383
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:28,944
No, no, no. Bale's too smart.

384
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:30,738
If we want  
information from him,

385
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:32,490
we have to  
handle him carefully.

386
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:33,908
Even then you have to assume

387
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:35,117
that road will lead nowhere.

388
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:36,243
You're saying the connection

389
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:37,620
to Bale  
doesn't help us at all?

390
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:39,872
No. I'm just  
saying let us handle Bale.

391
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,916
Look, we just heard  
from local Texas P.D.

392
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,709
You were right  
about Clurman's nephew.

393
00:14:43,793 --> 00:14:45,252
He admitted the  
bomb stuff was his,

394
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:46,962
which is great  
for the Clurmans,

395
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:48,839
but it leaves us  
with zero suspects.

396
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:50,674
So what do you  
suggest my men do now?

397
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:52,468
Proceed from the profile.

398
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:54,303
I didn't know  
we had a profile.

399
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,846
We're dealing with a bomber.

400
00:14:55,846 --> 00:14:57,306
We're talking about someone

401
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:58,807
who's non-confrontational.

402
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:02,436
If you bumped into him  
in a cafe, he'd apologize.

403
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:08,609
Even if it wasn't his fault.

404
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:11,820
We would classify this
bomber as highly organized,

405
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:14,114
based on the meticulous
design of his bombs.

406
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:16,116
It means above  
average intelligence.

407
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:18,160
He probably has a  
skilled job, a trade,

408
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:20,078
one that allows  
him to work alone.

409
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,205
That's how he was able to

410
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,372
make a sophisticated device

411
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,999
without raising suspicion.

412
00:15:24,082 --> 00:15:26,376
Furniture  
maker, jeweler, et cetera.

413
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,794
Background in explosives?

414
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:28,921
No, not necessarily.

415
00:15:29,004 --> 00:15:30,297
You're thinking about a type

416
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,590
who likes to blow things up.

417
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,719
Gives them an  
emotional or sexual release.

418
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:37,304
That's secondary.

419
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,014
Then what's this guy doing?

420
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:40,599
Murdering.

421
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,685
Bombs-just weapons.

422
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:47,814
And these  
attacks, they are not random.

423
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:49,357
Well, how do you know that?

424
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:50,776
The process of elimination.

425
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:51,902
We know bombers fall into a

426
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,153
discreet number of categories

427
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:54,446
according to motive.

428
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:56,782
There's the terrorist whose
aim is to spread fear.

429
00:15:56,865 --> 00:15:58,366
We'd expect him to strike in

430
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,910
a populous area like a subway.

431
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,661
There's the  
politically motivated bomber.

432
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:03,705
He makes a statement by
choosing a symbolic target

433
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:05,248
like an abortion clinic.

434
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,750
Then there's our unsub.

435
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,418
He made bombs designed to kill

436
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,544
and he chose his victims

437
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:12,631
specifically by placing the
bombs at their stoops.

438
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:14,633
That tells us he  
has a direct motive.

439
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,009
Statistically he bombs for

440
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:17,344
profit or to conceal a crime.

441
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:19,804
And it tells us how  
we're going to find him-

442
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:21,306
through the people he killed.

443
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,266
Somewhere among the three

444
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,101
victims there  
is a direct motive.

445
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:27,020
Keep digging.

446
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,564
Thanks. Any  
questions, we'll be around.

447
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:31,608
You'll be around. 
I'll be in prison.

448
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:33,818
Somebody's got  
to talk to Bale.

449
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:39,282
Detective  
Morrison, how's it going?

450
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:40,492
We're combing through all

451
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:41,868
the investors  
in the land deal,

452
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,786
got a couple of  
suspects who fit the profile.

453
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,996
We're going to talk to them.

454
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,998
Ok. Well, if you need  
anything, just let us know.

455
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,041
Right.

456
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,836
How we doing?

457
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:54,172
Frustrated.

458
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,882
I can't see why  
anyone would want to kill

459
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:58,843
a little old lady who  
collects cats and coins.

460
00:16:58,926 --> 00:17:00,303
Unless somebody  
wanted the coins.

461
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,846
I spent a good  
chunk of my childhood

462
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:04,432
looking for a 1944  
penny worth thousands.

463
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:06,809
Yes, I was a  
little bit of a nerd.

464
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:08,394
Is that so surprising?

465
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:10,229
Not to me.

466
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:14,442
Morgan?

467
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:16,319
Yeah. I just  
got the lab results

468
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,070
from the powder  
residues on the bombs.

469
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:20,072
Ammonia nitrate, potassium

470
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:22,033
chloride, and aluminum powder.

471
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:23,784
Nobody uses  
that mixture, Hotch.

472
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:24,869
Nobody but Bale.

473
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:25,953
That's right.

474
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:27,580
And the closer I  
look at these things,

475
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:28,664
the more they're the same.

476
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:29,915
Same weld pattern, same switch

477
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,125
assembly, same thread sizing.

478
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,627
It's weird, man.

479
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,670
This guy's not building 
bombs, he's forging them.

480
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,339
That's the other  
reason I'm calling you.

481
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,215
Bale wrote addresses on his

482
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,009
packages in block  
letters with blue ink.

483
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,635
I'm thinking our  
guy's doing the same.

484
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:43,054
Ok. I'll set up a press

485
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:44,680
conference, make  
sure the public knows.

486
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:45,723
Thanks, Morgan.

487
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:46,807
Excuse me.

488
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:52,605
Look, obviously Bale  
burned us pretty bad.

489
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,565
We just want to make  
sure if we're in a position

490
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,066
to make a deal with him that

491
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,526
you guys are willing to do it.

492
00:17:57,568 --> 00:17:58,777
Well, I think that's premature.

493
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,654
We're not even sure  
if Bale's involved yet.

494
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:01,739
What if he is?

495
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:03,449
You're sure you  
want to deal with

496
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:05,117
a guy who took  
out 6 of our agents?

497
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:08,037
Half of Florida is in a panic.

498
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:10,122
There might not  
be another choice.

499
00:18:10,706 --> 00:18:12,124
There has to be.

500
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,427
Bale, you have a visitor

501
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:25,929
You know why I'm here?

502
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,100
This guy in Palm Beach, right?

503
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,311
The Palm Beach Bomber.

504
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:34,730
Somebody's got to  
give him a better name.

505
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:41,612
He uses your  
bombs, your designs.

506
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:44,031
Well, he should be careful.

507
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:46,700
Those things are dangerous.

508
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,411
Adrian...

509
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:52,622
you can't fool me.

510
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,418
If you're involved in this in

511
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,503
any way and  
you do not help me,

512
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:02,132
I will make your life  
even worse than it is now.

513
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,469
Oh, but no, actually,

514
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,430
I can fool you  
because I fooled you before.

515
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:12,142
And now there's another me

516
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:15,604
out there, watching, waiting.

517
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:19,899
We have new information about
the Palm Beach Bomber.

518
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:21,484
In addition to placing the

519
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,028
bombs in plain brown packages,

520
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,488
we have reason to  
believe that the bomber

521
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,532
may hand write the delivery

522
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,534
addresses on a  
plain white label.

523
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:31,536
Mommy, when's  
daddy coming home?

524
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,455
He's got to get the beach

525
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:34,914
house ready for  
the next renters.

526
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:36,332
He'll be back tomorrow.

527
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:37,375
...Be examined carefully,

528
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:38,460
especially if you don't

529
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:39,711
recognize the return address.

530
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:41,671
Have you unpacked 
your suitcase yet?

531
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:43,089
No. I'll go do it right now.

532
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:45,049
With your  
help, we should be able

533
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,885
to prevent any  
further casualties.

534
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,636
Thank you for your vigilance.

535
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:57,312
You were more  
ruthless than I expected.

536
00:19:57,353 --> 00:19:59,105
If you hadn't  
pushed that button,

537
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:01,899
you might've had a  
chance at parole someday.

538
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,401
Yeah.

539
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:07,530
You know, I've  
thought a lot about that day,

540
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:10,908
and there's one thing  
I still can't understand.

541
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:13,828
You trusted me. Why?

542
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:15,621
I never trusted you.

543
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:16,956
You listened to me.

544
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:18,166
I made an error.

545
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,209
I calculated you  
wouldn't do it, and you did.

546
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:24,839
Whatever you think, I'm gonna
walk outta here,

547
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,340
and you never will.

548
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:28,509
Here's what I think.

549
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:33,014
Sending those  
agents into that warehouse,

550
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:34,640
it just doesn't make sense.

551
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,183
I mean, I've read your books.

552
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:38,060
I had all those  
things- what did you call it?

553
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:41,772
Um... a homicidal triad.

554
00:20:42,314 --> 00:20:46,193
I even came from a broken
family, classic sociopath,

555
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:48,571
so when I had the chance to

556
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:50,906
kill 6 agents plus a hostage,

557
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:53,576
I mean, just  
because I gave myself up

558
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:55,703
doesn't mean that I was
finished with those people.

559
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:58,122
I still had the remote. You...

560
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:00,624
you should've known that.

561
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:05,671
And the emotional release I

562
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:07,506
would feel by  
pressing that button...

563
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:10,676
well, that was just a little

564
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:13,137
too overwhelming to pass up.

565
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:16,682
Why didn't you search me

566
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:18,308
before sending  
those agents in?

567
00:21:19,101 --> 00:21:22,938
Why didn't you do  
your job, Agent Gideon?

568
00:21:31,822 --> 00:21:34,199
Mommy, there's a 
present for you.

569
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:35,534
Present?

570
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:37,077
What does it look like?

571
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,204
It's brown with blue letters.

572
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:41,206
Can I bring it to you?

573
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:49,214
No!

574
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:59,141
Keep holding on, baby.

575
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:02,853
Listen,the first 
thing we gotta do

576
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:04,354
is to is to get  
mother out of there

577
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:05,397
OKay

578
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,481
You gotta it!

579
00:22:06,565 --> 00:22:07,983
Just keep holding on, ok?

580
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,234
But it's heavy.

581
00:22:09,317 --> 00:22:10,443
Oh, I know, I know,

582
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:11,903
but you're  
doing such a good job.

583
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:13,822
Ok, everything's gonna be ok.

584
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:14,906
No, nobody over there.

585
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,575
I don't want to  
scare the little girl.

586
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:17,659
Just a few more minutes.

587
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:19,160
Hear that? We're almost there.

588
00:22:19,244 --> 00:22:20,579
It's heavy, I can't hold it.

589
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:22,414
Yes, you can.

590
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:23,790
You have to step back, ma'am.

591
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:25,125
I am not leaving my daughter.

592
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,751
You can trust me.

593
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:31,006
Ok, sweetie, don't move, ok?

594
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,841
Don't move, sweetie.

595
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:34,509
I'm gonna come up  
to meet you. Steady.

596
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:38,221
You're such a good  
girl. Just a few more seconds.

597
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:41,516
You're doing great ,sweetie.
Ok. It's slipping.

598
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:50,066
Go go go

599
00:22:50,108 --> 00:22:51,401
Come here, baby!

600
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,404
Get here Man

601
00:22:57,615 --> 00:22:59,909
Bale might be part of
this, but he's not in control.

602
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:02,203
If he were, he would've  
taunted me with specifics.

603
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:03,496
So what's our next move?

604
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:06,124
I let Bale know the  
unsub's using his designs.

605
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:07,166
Bait.

606
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,251
Yeah, exactly.

607
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:09,711
If Bale wasn't  
part of it before,

608
00:23:09,794 --> 00:23:11,295
he'll sure want  
to be part of it now.

609
00:23:11,337 --> 00:23:12,505
I'm gonna stay behind and

610
00:23:12,588 --> 00:23:13,923
monitor his  
mail, calls, visitors,

611
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:16,050
any contact that he  
has with the outside world.

612
00:23:16,134 --> 00:23:17,802
Good. Even if he  
doesn't know the unsub,

613
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:19,512
he may want to  
try to contact him.

614
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:20,763
I might have something.

615
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:22,348
Barbara Keller was having

616
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:24,016
trouble insuring  
some coins she bought.

617
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:26,060
The insurance company  
thought they might be fake.

618
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:27,395
So the insurance company's

619
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:28,688
blowing up annoying clients?

620
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:31,148
What if someone  
sold her the fake coins?

621
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:33,943
She's on to  
him, he shuts her up.

622
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:36,112
Were these coins  
valuable enough to kill over?

623
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:37,405
She told the insurance company

624
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:39,824
she thought they  
might be worth $12,000.

625
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:41,075
All right. Do you have any

626
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:42,285
idea who sold her the coins?

627
00:23:42,368 --> 00:23:44,495
No, but she had an appointment

628
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:46,580
with a coin dealer scheduled-

629
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:48,708
I'm guessing to challenge the

630
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,793
insurance company's appraisal.

631
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:52,128
A guy named David Walker.

632
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:53,462
So maybe he can help us

633
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:54,964
figure out who  
sold her the coins.

634
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:56,924
Office of supreme  
genius puzzle solver.

635
00:23:56,966 --> 00:23:58,092
Do you have a riddle for me?

636
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:00,136
I found out Bale has  
been accessing the internet

637
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:01,887
by getting around 
a fire wall that's

638
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:03,639
set up on a  
prison library computer.

639
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:05,474
The guy even has  
an e-mail address.

640
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:07,101
Wow. Sneaky bastard.

641
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:08,978
Yeah. He's headed for 
the library right now,

642
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:10,729
Maybe to contact the unsub.

643
00:24:10,813 --> 00:24:12,231
Is there a way  
to possibly monitor

644
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:13,691
his keystrokes  
while he's online?

645
00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:14,775
I can send him a virus,

646
00:24:14,858 --> 00:24:16,860
but he'll have to open  
the e-mail for it to work.

647
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:18,028
Let's do it.

648
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:19,822
What do you want  
in the subject line?

649
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:20,906
Let's think.

650
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,574
Something  
that'll make him open it.

651
00:24:22,658 --> 00:24:24,785
Yeah. He's impotent.

652
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:27,246
Something that'll  
make him feel in control.

653
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:28,706
I got something.

654
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,901
Now this guy's number.

655
00:24:57,985 --> 00:25:00,487
He's visited 6 porn  
sites in the past half hour.

656
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,571
Anything else?

657
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:02,656
Hold on

658
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:04,241
He's posting to 
a message board.

659
00:25:04,324 --> 00:25:06,159
"Naughtyhobbies.Net. "

660
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:09,579
Looks like some sort of  site
for bomb enthusiasts.

661
00:25:09,663 --> 00:25:11,706
"To all my friends out

662
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,792
there, beware.  
They are onto you. "

663
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,502
We need the names  
of everyone who's been

664
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:17,170
on that message  
board in the past month.

665
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:38,900
186 e-mails.

666
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,652
Through the ISPs, we  
were able to track down

667
00:25:40,694 --> 00:25:42,654
the names and  
some of the addresses,

668
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:44,656
but none of them  
were in Palm Beach.

669
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:45,949
How about occupations?

670
00:25:46,032 --> 00:25:47,117
It wasn't a required field,

671
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,160
so really,only  
about 1/3 filled it in.

672
00:25:49,244 --> 00:25:50,703
Well, the unsub takes pride in

673
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:52,163
his work. He would fill it in.

674
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:54,249
Right. Let's see. We have

675
00:25:54,332 --> 00:25:58,086
"trucker, physician, antiquities

676
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:01,881
dealer, store  
owner, orderly... "

677
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:02,966
wait.

678
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:04,676
Antiquities dealer?

679
00:26:04,717 --> 00:26:06,302
Yeah, why, what is it?

680
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:11,849
Personally, I  
couldn't think of anything

681
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:14,102
more boring than  
coins and old papers.

682
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:15,228
Are you single?

683
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:16,270
Yes.

684
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:17,814
I have a word of advice.

685
00:26:17,897 --> 00:26:20,775
Don't marry the  
first guy that proposes.

686
00:26:20,858 --> 00:26:22,276
I wanted a pool  
table back there,

687
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,863
but David insisted on  
making it his workshop.

688
00:26:25,947 --> 00:26:28,407
Hey, Reid. Ok, shoot.

689
00:26:29,617 --> 00:26:30,618
David...

690
00:26:35,831 --> 00:26:36,832
Elle.

691
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:38,501
I got to call you back.

692
00:26:39,418 --> 00:26:40,836
What's he up to now?

693
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:42,171
It sounds like a car.

694
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:44,382
I hope he's not  
committing suicide.

695
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:46,425
I won't be able to  
collect life insurance.

696
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:47,468
Yeah.

697
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:49,428
Elle, it's him. It's walker.

698
00:26:50,012 --> 00:26:51,514
Get out of the way!

699
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,578
You ok?

700
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,039
Yeah, I'm all  
right, but Mrs. Walker...

701
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,999
Yeah. Guy's a real peach.

702
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,919
Morrison's got a county-wide
search out for the car.

703
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,045
Uniforms are going to try to

704
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:24,338
find out where his haunts are.

705
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:26,256
An ATF should  
be here any minute.

706
00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:28,926
Sure you're all right?

707
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:31,261
Mrs. Walker said her husband

708
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:32,930
spent most of his  
time in the garage.

709
00:27:33,305 --> 00:27:34,306
Let's check it out.

710
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:47,820
Well, we got the  
organized part right.

711
00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:49,029
What's this?

712
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:53,325
I've seen these.  
It's for electroplating.

713
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:57,037
Look at the date on the coin.

714
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:58,580
It's half-gone.

715
00:27:58,622 --> 00:28:00,207
He was using this  
to build up the metal

716
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:01,959
so he could change  
the dates on the coins.

717
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,126
To increase the value.

718
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,211
Exactly.

719
00:28:04,294 --> 00:28:06,880
Like what he did with  
Barbara Keller's coins.

720
00:28:06,963 --> 00:28:08,965
Look over here. Check this out

721
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,723
"The best. "

722
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,935
This is why he chose 
to use Bale's design.

723
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:23,438
He was working on something.

724
00:28:29,736 --> 00:28:31,279
Make sure Morrison 
tells your officers

725
00:28:31,363 --> 00:28:33,615
that this guy  
is smart, dangerous,

726
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:35,867
and has  
absolutely nothing to lose.

727
00:28:50,215 --> 00:28:51,674
You ready to do some work?

728
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:53,635
Why not? I  
haven't slept this week.

729
00:28:53,635 --> 00:28:55,512
I might as well  
give up eating, too.

730
00:28:55,553 --> 00:28:57,096
Oh, poor baby.

731
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,306
Try not to let the tears hit

732
00:28:58,389 --> 00:28:59,682
the paper.  
Gets a little messy.

733
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:01,267
Hmm. Really.

734
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:02,852
These are emails  
from Bale's account.

735
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:04,229
Reid forwarded them to me.

736
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:05,522
What are we looking for?

737
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:07,232
Right now this guy  
Walker's in the wind,

738
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:08,942
so we gotta look at  
him from every angle,

739
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:10,652
see if we can  
figure out his next move.

740
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:11,861
Signature behavior.

741
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:13,613
If walker got  
bomb-making tips from Bale,

742
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:15,782
then maybe he got tips on
staying clear of the cops.

743
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:17,909
Ha! Somebody's  
been taking notes.

744
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:20,036
Medical  
school, schmedical school.

745
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,288
Don't hurt yourself, Garcia.

746
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:23,873
Now find me something.

747
00:29:29,003 --> 00:29:31,005
So far, nothing  
from the search.

748
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,008
What do we know about Walker?

749
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,302
He's a quiet career criminal.

750
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:37,595
Spent 4 years in prison

751
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:38,930
for a series of forged checks

752
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:41,974
when he was in his  
early 20s. He's now 46.

753
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,726
Past 18 years, he owned a

754
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:45,436
store which sold coins, maps,

755
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:46,479
and historical documents.

756
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,147
We raided the place as soon

757
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:49,857
as you gave us Walker's name.

758
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:51,275
Most of his  
inventory was fake,

759
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:52,693
forgeries  
valued in the millions.

760
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:54,570
But the walls had  
started to close in on him.

761
00:29:54,612 --> 00:29:55,988
We talked to  
some of his clients,

762
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,406
and he was in  
debt up to his ears

763
00:29:57,448 --> 00:29:59,450
and promising stuff he  
didn't have time to forge.

764
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:01,369
Then Barbara  
Keller found out that

765
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:03,245
the coins he had  
sold her were fake.

766
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:04,371
She threatened to out him.

767
00:30:04,455 --> 00:30:05,456
And if she had, all the

768
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:07,041
forgeries would  
have been discovered.

769
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,584
He would have done 20 years.

770
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,169
So he had to shut her up?

771
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:11,545
He planted all those bombs

772
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:13,005
just to kill  
one little old lady?

773
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:14,048
Yeah, and to throw us off,

774
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:16,217
he made it look like it was
much bigger than it was.

775
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,968
You hear me? I said stop now!

776
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:20,804
Please... help me.

777
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:23,933
Everyone back-now. We  
need bomb squad in here.

778
00:30:23,974 --> 00:30:25,768
Please... it's not me.

779
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:27,603
Don't come any closer.

780
00:30:27,603 --> 00:30:30,439
Put your hands up  
and walk slowly back out.

781
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:32,900
I can'T. He'll kill me.

782
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:34,234
Who will?

783
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:35,486
I don't know.

784
00:30:35,527 --> 00:30:37,404
He held a gun to me,

785
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:38,739
put this on me.

786
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:40,032
He said...

787
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:42,326
you'll know who he is.

788
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:44,036
What does he want?

789
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:46,914
A helicopter. And passport.

790
00:30:47,623 --> 00:30:49,124
He's watching.

791
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:52,002
Once he gets what he wants,

792
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:54,213
he's got instructions to
defuse the bomb.

793
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:56,423
Walker's close by.

794
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:58,425
Let's get snipers  
around the perimeter.

795
00:30:58,467 --> 00:30:59,468
Get snipers on the roof.

796
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:01,637
Ok, we understand.  
We're not gonna leave you.

797
00:31:01,803 --> 00:31:04,306
Please... take it off.

798
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:06,892
We need to figure out how

799
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:08,310
the bomb's put together first.

800
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:10,228
Tracy, you're in.

801
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,280
This is a really  
sophisticated device.

802
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:21,823
It looks like it was probably

803
00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:23,325
made by a master bomb maker,

804
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:24,826
which means tampering with

805
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,328
any part of it  
could set it off.

806
00:31:26,912 --> 00:31:28,330
Isn't there some way to just

807
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:29,706
cut the whole thing off him?

808
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,791
Not without  
cutting these wires.

809
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,919
See how they're threaded all
around the collar?

810
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,086
They could be booby trapped,

811
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,255
or there could be a  
hidden secondary trigger.

812
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:38,548
How do we find out?

813
00:31:38,632 --> 00:31:40,050
Without knowing how it's put

814
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,509
together, it's  
gonna take a while.

815
00:31:41,593 --> 00:31:42,594
I'll have to x-ray it,

816
00:31:42,677 --> 00:31:44,554
try to figure out  
which are the real triggers,

817
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:46,681
but... I don't  
think there's enough time.

818
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:48,016
What do you mean?

819
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:49,684
There's a timer.

820
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,519
We've only got  
about 3 hours left.

821
00:31:58,318 --> 00:31:59,319
What is it?

822
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:02,113
We need to go outside.

823
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:03,490
No!

824
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:05,408
He said he'd kill  
me if I went back out.

825
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,951
He made sure I told you that.

826
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:08,411
Then we need to isolate you.

827
00:32:08,453 --> 00:32:09,537
Why?

828
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:12,707
There's nothing you can do?

829
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:15,001
Is there anything?

830
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:45,698
I don't get it.

831
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,991
If this guy's a hostage,

832
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:49,702
then why hasn't Walker  tried
to negotiate with us?

833
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:53,289
Maybe he's scared or  
maybe he hasn't figured out

834
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,041
what his next move is yet.

835
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,084
We got a bead on Walker.

836
00:32:57,126 --> 00:32:58,919
Sniper spotted  
him in his scope.

837
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:00,129
He's sitting in an office

838
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,297
building across the street.

839
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,007
It looks like a storage room

840
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,592
with a small window facing us.

841
00:33:04,675 --> 00:33:05,843
We could surprise him.

842
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:07,386
Good idea. If he feels

843
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,888
cornered, he  
might give himself up.

844
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:09,930
Why do you say that?

845
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:11,891
Because bombers  
are generally cowards.

846
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:13,309
I'll take a  
team in and we'll go

847
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:14,852
in through the  
back of the building.

848
00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:15,978
This feels wrong to me.

849
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:18,189
Why would Walker let  
himself be found so easily?

850
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:19,273
He wants to be found.

851
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:20,357
Why? To negotiate.

852
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:22,109
But then we lose  
the element of surprise.

853
00:33:22,151 --> 00:33:23,527
Hopefully, we  
catch him off guard,

854
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:25,070
he may give  
himself up immediately.

855
00:33:25,112 --> 00:33:27,114
If not, we take a hard  
line and make him feel like

856
00:33:27,156 --> 00:33:28,198
he's got no way out.

857
00:33:28,282 --> 00:33:30,367
Remember, we have  
to take him alive.

858
00:33:30,451 --> 00:33:31,452
Walker's the only one who

859
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:32,703
can defuse the necklace bomb.

860
00:33:32,786 --> 00:33:34,580
Everybody ready?  
Yes, sir. Let's do it.

861
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:35,789
We're entering the building.

862
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:36,957
Be careful. At the very

863
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,208
least, we know he's got a gun.

864
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:39,293
Copy that.

865
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,216
We're  
approaching the door now.

866
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:49,428
Copy that.

867
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:52,514
So bombers are cowards,huh?

868
00:33:53,223 --> 00:33:55,100
Yeah. Every last one of them.

869
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,138
David Walker, federal agents.

870
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:36,516
Federal agents!

871
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,401
Walker, freeze!

872
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,154
Ok. Please don't shoot!

873
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:51,239
Show yourself!

874
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:53,908
I'll shoot up the whole room.

875
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,035
Ok...

876
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,537
All right,now put your hands
up where I can see them

877
00:34:58,038 --> 00:34:59,039
I can't do that.

878
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:00,123
Then I'll shoot.

879
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:01,833
My hand is on the remote.

880
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,501
I told you what I want.

881
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:07,464
The passport, the  
helicopter, the flight!

882
00:35:07,547 --> 00:35:08,590
Walker,listen to me.

883
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,675
You're at the top of  
the FBI's most wanted list.

884
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:12,302
I think you're  
smart enough to realize

885
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:13,928
there's no way  
we're letting you go.

886
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,638
Here's my counter offer:

887
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:17,140
A chance to get  
out of here alive.

888
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,475
All you have to do  
is give yourself up.

889
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,185
Just slide the gun across

890
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:22,854
the floor you  
have until 3, 1...

891
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:24,314
You wouldn't  
let the hostage die.

892
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:26,691
You wanna find out?  
Don't give yourself up. 2...

893
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,235
Ok! Ok.

894
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,700
I'm coming out. Don't shoot.

895
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:40,580
Gideon. It's me.

896
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,790
I just found an email Bale
sent Walker 2 weeks ago.

897
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:44,876
Listen to  
this, "my only regret is

898
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,919
giving myself  
up. "And for what?

899
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:48,838
To be stuck in a cage  
for the rest of my life.

900
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,381
"Don't make my mistake. If

901
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:51,841
they catch  
you, whatever you do,

902
00:35:51,924 --> 00:35:53,259
don't let them keep you. "

903
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:55,511
Now walk slowly towards me

904
00:35:58,014 --> 00:35:59,432
Let me see your hands, Walker!

905
00:36:08,524 --> 00:36:10,526
Walker's not a bomber.

906
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,028
He's a forger.

907
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,030
Get out of there now! Now!

908
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,324
Go, go, go, go! Everybody out!

909
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,882
We're fine. Everybody made

910
00:36:32,965 --> 00:36:34,216
it out. Everybody but Walker.

911
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,302
Is the hostage ok?

912
00:36:36,343 --> 00:36:37,803
He's fine. For now.

913
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,221
How much time do we have?

914
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,307
2 hours, 24 minutes.

915
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:44,727
With Walker  
dead, I'm all out of options.

916
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:52,234
I've got one.

917
00:36:52,317 --> 00:36:53,402
Bale.

918
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:03,078
We'll start with a transfer.

919
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,414
You're in a high  
security facility now.

920
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:07,249
We can get you medium.

921
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,001
No. I want out of prison.

922
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:10,586
A mental facility.

923
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:11,878
You're asking for something

924
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:13,255
we wouldn't  
give a bank robber.

925
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,756
There are  
minimum security prisons-

926
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:16,758
I don't care.

927
00:37:17,217 --> 00:37:18,719
I want to be able to talk to

928
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:20,220
people who aren't prisoners.

929
00:37:20,262 --> 00:37:22,931
I want to have access...

930
00:37:23,306 --> 00:37:26,059
to people, things, the world.

931
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:28,812
I want to connect again.

932
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,609
All right.

933
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:37,612
One more thing-

934
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:40,031
without which  
there is no deal.

935
00:37:40,323 --> 00:37:41,616
What is it?

936
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,827
I want you to confess.

937
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:47,289
I want you to  
admit that I beat

938
00:37:47,372 --> 00:37:49,207
you in Boston  
and I outsmarted you.

939
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:53,086
I want you to apologize

940
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:56,631
to the families of those 6
victims you got killed.

941
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:58,425
And I want it all in writing.

942
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:00,927
This's enough.

943
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,516
If I do this, you'll tell me
how to defuse the bomb?

944
00:38:06,558 --> 00:38:09,018
Only... if you do this.

945
00:38:10,311 --> 00:38:11,813
How do I know  
you won't lie to me?

946
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:13,481
It's all in  
writing, Agent Gideon.

947
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:15,483
If my client refuses to 
give you the information

948
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:17,360
or if he gives  
you information he

949
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:19,154
knows to be  
untruthful, the deal is void.

950
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,832
I wanna hear it.

951
00:38:35,336 --> 00:38:38,381
"It was a hostage situation-"

952
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:41,426
No. Don't read it. Say it.

953
00:38:47,223 --> 00:38:49,434
It was a hostage situation.

954
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:52,728
I negotiated with Bale.

955
00:38:54,438 --> 00:38:56,315
He agreed to give himself up.

956
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,735
He came out of the  
warehouse peacefully.

957
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:06,826
I gave the ok to  
send 6 of my agents in,

958
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:08,619
and they never came out.

959
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:12,123
It was a mistake.

960
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,419
It was my mistake. I was...

961
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,005
I was outfoxed by Mr. Bale.

962
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:24,802
By you.

963
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:29,140
I sincerely regret  
having made the decision

964
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,308
to send those  
agents in that day.

965
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:37,690
And I sincerely  
regret and apologize

966
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:40,901
to the families of all  
those who died that day.

967
00:39:43,404 --> 00:39:44,905
4 more minutes.

968
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:52,413
Ok. I've isolated the wires

969
00:39:52,496 --> 00:39:54,206
connected to  
the actual device.

970
00:39:54,248 --> 00:39:56,417
We've got one shot at  
this. It's either the...

971
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,335
blue wire or the red wire.

972
00:40:03,006 --> 00:40:04,508
Which do we cut, Bale?

973
00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:06,510
Red or blue?

974
00:40:08,303 --> 00:40:09,304
Red.

975
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,640
You know if you're lying,

976
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:13,600
this thing goes  
boom, you get nothing, right?

977
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:14,726
Yes.

978
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:17,020
If we cut the red, it's over.

979
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:22,401
You get to spend your  
time in a cushy asylum,

980
00:40:22,442 --> 00:40:25,529
bushes, trees, visits, nurses...

981
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:28,115
and we get this  
man out of here alive.

982
00:40:28,156 --> 00:40:30,200
I don't see how I  
could be any clearer.

983
00:40:30,242 --> 00:40:31,535
17 seconds.

984
00:40:32,035 --> 00:40:33,328
Red wire, right?

985
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,371
Yes.

986
00:40:35,705 --> 00:40:36,706
Cut the blue.

987
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:38,834
Are you sure?

988
00:40:39,334 --> 00:40:40,335
Do it.

989
00:40:45,715 --> 00:40:47,217
All right. Shouldn't take

990
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,718
long to cut  
this thing off now.

991
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,600
Thank you.

992
00:40:56,101 --> 00:40:57,602
Thank you.

993
00:40:58,311 --> 00:40:59,479
How'd you know?

994
00:40:59,521 --> 00:41:01,314
And the emotional release I

995
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:03,108
would feel by  
pressing that button...

996
00:41:04,317 --> 00:41:06,403
well,that was  
just a little too...

997
00:41:07,404 --> 00:41:09,114
overwhelming to pass up.

998
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:10,824
He told me.

999
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:13,535
He said given the

1000
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:15,078
opportunity of  
pressing that button,

1001
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:16,538
he'd have no choice.

1002
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:19,541
All I did was  
take his word for it.

1003
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:34,514
Despite the fact that you

1004
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:35,974
lied to us and  
your deal is void,

1005
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,267
I made sure to tell  
all your friends here

1006
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:40,186
how extremely  
willing you were to give

1007
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:42,105
up information on  
your fellow inmates.

1008
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:45,400
You're a rare bird, Adrian.

1009
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:47,402
I can't tell you how much

1010
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:48,569
pleasure I get just knowing

1011
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:50,738
I put you in this tiny cage.

1012
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,324
You might even call  
it an emotional release.
