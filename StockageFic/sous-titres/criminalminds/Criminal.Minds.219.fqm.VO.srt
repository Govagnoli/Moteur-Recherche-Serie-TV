00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,580
Mom,dad! Dad,we have to go!

3
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:49,180
What?

4
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,930
The house is on fire,we have to get out of here!

5
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,290
Come on,we have to go!

6
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,240
The phone's dead--go!Come on,we gotta go!

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,650
"The torture of a bad conscience is the hell of a living soul."

16
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,500
John calvin.

17
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,780
Two fires,two families in three weeks.

18
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,120
The first family,the jarvis',

19
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,610
all died.

20
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:35,370
Last night,the cutlers.

21
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,650
Only one survivor,charlotte cutler,

22
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:41,730
she's in critical condition with burns to over 60% of her bodY.

23
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:42,780
Well,it's no accident.

24
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,730
It's the same M.O. No fuses,kerosene,

25
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,550
multiple points of origin,

26
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:50,430
families targeted at home while they slept.

27
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,340
The bay area has a serial arsonist.

28
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,430
Statistically,94% of all serial arsonists are male,

29
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:58,030
75% are white,and few,

30
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,520
if any,are ever caught.

31
00:04:59,555 --> 00:05:00,520
Few?

32
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,800
You don't have a percentage?

33
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:02,850
About 16%,

34
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,930
and those 16% set 30-plus fires before they were ever apprehended.

35
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:07,630
I'm trying to be more conversational.

36
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,840
Oh.It's not working.

37
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,610
Most serial arsonists don't intend to inflict harm.

38
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,700
Injuries or death,those are accidental.

39
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,090
It's not about violence.

40
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,150
For this one it is.

41
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,360
It's also about power.

42
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,110
Seeing the destructive force of their fires.

43
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,660
Watching the chaos,

44
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,090
for them,fire's just a substitute for sexual release.

45
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,030
Oh,great,so if these guys don't get laid,they start fires?

46
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:33,530
Or in this case,burn entire families to death.

47
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,060
-No statistic?
-Nope.

48
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,510
They don't have statistics on this guy.

49
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,440
One of a kind.

50
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,850
Thank god.

51
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,390
Three weeks ago,this serial arsonist escalated into a serial killer whose weapon is fire.

52
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,580
Why?

53
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,090
Major event.

54
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,340
Possibly the breakup of his primary sexual outlet.

55
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,520
The separation,the loss.

56
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,140
all right What about the victims?

57
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,830
Sfpd can't connect the jarvis' and the cutlers,

58
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:05,880
but witnesses put an unidentified late model gold sedan near both fires.

59
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,670
Run the car.

60
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:08,340
Garcia,run the victims through the system,

61
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,910
if there's any connection we need to find it.

62
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:10,560
Yes,sir.

63
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:11,640
We need victimology.

64
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,980
I'll go see charlotte cutler.

65
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,940
You took the burn one last timE.

66
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,480
It's all right.I got it.

67
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,070
Has she said anything about the fires?

68
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,500
I'm giving her as much painkiller as I can.

69
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,540
She asked about her husband and son.

70
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,230
She passed out again before I had to answer.

71
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,520
So she doesn't know.

72
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,940
Whatever you tell her,

73
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:53,130
she won't live long enough to know different.

74
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,670
I'll be right back.

75
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,710
-Did she just tell us to lie to a material witness?
-No.

76
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,630
She told us that we could.

77
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,970
Welcome.Ricardo vega,sffdr.

78
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,670
Hi.Jason gideon,this is derek morgan.

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,980
Most likely the arson suspect is a first responder

80
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:27,060
who set both fires with premeditative intent to return to it within a professional capacity.

81
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:27,960
You read my paper.

82
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:29,270
"Profiles of a serial arsonist,"

83
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:30,810
I make everyone on my team read it.

84
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,680
I've run the first responders of both fires,

85
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:35,080
these are the pedigrees of everyone that was here that night.

86
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,800
No fire,police,or emt responded to both.

87
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,700
-No one
-except me,

88
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,670
which is why I've included copies of my department performance reviews,

89
00:07:42,705 --> 00:07:44,000
medical records,and psych-evals.

90
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:45,810
-It's unnecessary.
-No,it's not.

91
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,640
Your best suspect is a fireman who saw both fires burning.That's me.

92
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,120
I'm saving you time.

93
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,100
Come on,I'll walk you through it.

94
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,290
Mrs. Cutler?

95
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,910
I'm special agent aaron hotchner,

96
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,280
-this is special agent emily prentiss.
-Hello.

97
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,130
Where's paul?

98
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,770
Your son

99
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,580
was with you the night of the fire.

100
00:08:12,615 --> 00:08:13,720
That's why we're here.

101
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,900
I don't understand.

102
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,680
We're fbi agents.

103
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,710
We think that the fire may have been set intentionallY.

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm very tired.

105
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,360
I understand.

106
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,050
This is very important.

107
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:28,570
Do you think you could just give us a couple of minutes?

108
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,110
I want you to think back to that night.

109
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,450
Was there anything out of the ordinary?

110
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,840
Think about the things that you normally do.

111
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,250
Uh,get undressed,

112
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:45,330
wash your face

113
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,290
I couldn't brush my teeth.

114
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,040
Dennis?

115
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:50,610
The water's not working.

116
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
I'll check it out.

117
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,610
Dennis got the water back on.

118
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,720
Then

119
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,180
then you went to bed?

120
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,330
Do you remember what woke you up?

121
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,710
-Paul.
-Not the smoke alarms?

122
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,210
It was paul.

123
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,780
What else do you remember?

124
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,160
Dennis unlocked it and it wouldn't open.

125
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,430
He unlocked what?

126
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,910
The front door!

127
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,330
Somebody please help us,please!

128
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,510
What's wrong?!

129
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:38,780
I ca

130
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,720
Somebody!

131
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,560
Somebody,Please help us,please

132
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,170
And then I saw the fireman.

133
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,670
and****ok

134
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,680
Dennis?

135
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:09,140
Paul where's my baby?

136
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,280
Paul.Where are they?Are they ok?

137
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,050
They're fine.

138
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,420
They're just outside in the waiting room.

139
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:23,280
Ohh  oh,right.

140
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,340
I don't want them to see me like this.

141
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,920
No,I'm not ready.Could you--

142
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,990
please tell them to wait a minute,please?

143
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,470
I'm not ready.

144
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,740
Agent prentiss will tell them.

145
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,580
You call gideon and morgan?

146
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,840
I can stay with you until you're ready.

147
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,230
If you'd like.

148
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,630
I'd like that.

149
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,220
She told her husband there was no water.

150
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,110
Where's the shut-off?

151
00:11:24,145 --> 00:11:25,660
Runs up the sidewalk.

152
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,970
Ok,so I'm the unsub.

153
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,260
I need to get in the house.

154
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,900
So I turn the water off right here.

155
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,230
And then I wait.

156
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,190
I wait for him to come outside.

157
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,110
I wait for them to go to sleep

158
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,430
and then I carefully pour the fuel.

159
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,860
Cutting access to the back door.

160
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,570
I leave them only one way to get out.

161
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,840
S.F.F.D. Headquarters
SAN FRANCISCO,CA

162
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,900
This place is great!They have their own espresso machine.

163
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,620
Dr. Reid,this is detective castro,

164
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:39,760
she is with the sfpd liaison.

165
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:41,870
Burned my hand on that espresso machine.

166
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:42,840
Ooh!

167
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,930
A genius,you said?

168
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:44,540
Yeah,uh,

169
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,070
his coordination drops off when he's thinking.

170
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:47,620
Good.

171
00:13:47,655 --> 00:13:50,780
'Cause we need to figure out why this psycho chooses these families.

172
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,070
He's most likely targeting the men.

173
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,400
They're the only similar members of the two families.

174
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,900
C. Jarvis,29,worked full-time.

175
00:13:57,935 --> 00:14:00,270
Charlotte cutler,39,was a stay-at-home mom.

176
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:03,170
The jarvis' had two girls in public grade school,

177
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,040
cutler's had a son in private high school.

178
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:06,970
The jarvis' went to church,the cutlers didn'T.

179
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,080
Nothing holds.

180
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:08,870
Except with the men--

181
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:10,450
both in their late thirties,white,

182
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:12,790
approximately 6-feet tall,brown hair,

183
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:15,480
nice homes,nice families,good jobs,

184
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,790
that's the connection.

185
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,130
What connection?

186
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,220
Cutler was a lawyer,

187
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:20,470
jarvis an executive.

188
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:21,830
There's no evidence they ever met.

189
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:23,010
But they're of the same type.

190
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,340
We know that most serial arsonists are white males.

191
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,410
A complex M.O.Develops over time.

192
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,180
This guy is in his mid-thirties,

193
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:32,380
he sees the victims as successful versions of himself.

194
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:33,840
And he resents them for it.

195
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,570
I'll issue an A.P.B.

196
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,550
For a resentful 6-foot white guy.

197
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,080
Ok,great.I got it.Thanks.

198
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,740
Charlotte cutler died.

199
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,550
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:52,430
Next time I'll go.

201
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:53,850
What have we got on the vehicle?

202
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:57,250
Uh,it is a 1999 gold ford taurus.

203
00:14:57,285 --> 00:15:01,710
85% of that model color-combo were sold domestically as fleet vehicles.

204
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:02,660
Company cars,

205
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,180
rental fleets.

206
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,540
Did you check all agencies?

207
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,370
Yeah,none of them kept them for the past three weeks,

208
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:08,370
or rented during both fires,

209
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:09,460
so

210
00:15:09,495 --> 00:15:12,620
who keeps a rental car for three weeks?

211
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:13,490
Then it's not a rental.

212
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:14,930
It would have to be a company car.

213
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:17,500
This guy,he had to have time to stalk his victims.

214
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,520
And if his job involves driving--

215
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:22,550
there was a serial arsonist up in seattle,early nineties

216
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,130
-paul kenneth keller.
-Yeah.

217
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,920
He used to drive around all day selling

218
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,670
advertising for his dad's agency,

219
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,520
picking out places to burn.

220
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,690
Company car.Good work,J.J.

221
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
Let's do the profile.

222
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,370
The unsub we're looking for is a highly intelligent,

223
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,400
under-achieving,35 to 45-year-old white male

224
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:44,770
with a severe narcissistic character disorder.

225
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,200
Nothing in his life works for long.

226
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,690
If he was married,he's now divorced.

227
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,950
If employed,it won't last.

228
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,880
What he wants is admiration,

229
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,890
but he's got no respect for others--

230
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:58,370
not their feelings,and most certainly not their safety.

231
00:15:58,405 --> 00:15:59,710
He feels entitled.

232
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,530
He's like a petulant adolescent.

233
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:05,310
He both resents and he absolutely expects everyone to take care of him.

234
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:07,540
And given that a male relative wouldn't tolerate this behavior,

235
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,910
he most likely lives with a female relative

236
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:12,440
his mother,grandmother,aunt,whom he exploits.

237
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,090
His arson kit is expensive.

238
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,890
Fire suit,

239
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:16,960
oxygen mask.

240
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,470
This suggests that he may be employed,

241
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:22,550
but his personality will not allow him to work closely with others in an office setting.

242
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:25,700
This along with the information about his vehicle lead us to believe that

243
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,340
he's a traveling salesman of some sort,

244
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,770
who works for a company big enough not to notice that he's a sociopath.

245
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
Ok,this scumbag has issues,we all get it.

246
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,140
But why fire?

247
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:39,160
He's like a drug addict.

248
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:40,930
Only fire's his drug.

249
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:42,390
Each time an addict needs a fix,

250
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:44,210
they need more of the drug to get off.

251
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:46,480
So his crimes most likely get much worse.

252
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,760
It would be almost impossible for him to quit without help.

253
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,660
Thank you very much.

254
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,910
She shoots  she scores!

255
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,750
The crowd goes wild.

256
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,110
I just put the entire department on tac alert.

257
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,730
Garcia's on line one.

258
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,150
Brace yourselves.

259
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:14,160
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of lust.

260
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,750
-Did she say lust?
-Mm-hmm.

261
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,810
I cross-referenced every known fact on the victims,

262
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:21,600
and I just found a website that links both dennis cutler

263
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:26,540
and matthew jarvis' companies on a list of businesses guilty of L.U.S.T.

264
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:27,590
I'm missing something.

265
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,280
Leaking underground storage tanks.

266
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,850
The website belongs to a recently founded san francisco chapter of the earth defense front.

267
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:34,860
The edf?

268
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,460
The eco-terrorist group?

269
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:38,680
They aren't eco-terrorists,they're environmental activists.

270
00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:40,910
Dennis cutler and matthew jarvis may disagree with you.

271
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:45,660
I'm pretty sure some edf people were sent up for torching an suv dealership a while back in san diego.

272
00:17:45,695 --> 00:17:46,930
Nobody died in those fires.

273
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,340
Maybe they got lucky.

274
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,610
No,it's not luck.

275
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:51,570
This group's dedicated to protecting life.

276
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:54,310
What,do they wait until no one's home and then light the place up?

277
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:55,530
That's exactly what they do.

278
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,720
So tell me who we're playing again today.

279
00:17:57,755 --> 00:17:58,340
We play the jets.

280
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,680
The jets,right,ok.

281
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,680
I'll be-- in a second.

282
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,270
Katie!

283
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,220
Come on.We're not gonna be late twice in one week.

284
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,540
-Yeah?
-I'coming!

285
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,520
Come on,sweetie.

286
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,100
RighT.

287
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,240
No,I got that.

288
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,260
Yeah.

289
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:17,920
No,we're leavin'--

290
00:18:17,955 --> 00:18:19,220
we're leavin' right now.

291
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:20,320
Yeah.

292
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,840
All right,guys.

293
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,060
We ready?

294
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,990
Belt.

295
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,370
Oh,yeah.

296
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,940
-What's wrong?
-I don't know.

297
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,390
It's not opening.

298
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:36,420
Are you telling me that the fbi doesn't have

299
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,930
files on organizations like this?Lists and members?

300
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,040
Domestic groups like the edf aren't the bureau's top priority right now.

301
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:45,550
Besides,they're more of a movement than an organization.

302
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,350
There's a central ideology,

303
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,850
but-- chapters are independent,

304
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:51,350
they don't pay dues and they don't keep membership lists.

305
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,190
What if one of the chapters has broken ranks and has a new belief?

306
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,750
dad?

307
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
What are you doing?!

308
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,210
Hey!Get out,guys,

309
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:00,940
get out!Get out!

310
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,120
-get out!kids,Get out now!
-dad,It's not opening!

311
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:03,800
-Come on,It won't open,dad!
-Open the door!Get out!

312
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,670
Hurting people's never been part of it.

313
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:10,530
Doesn't track.

314
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,850
Doesn't fit the profile.

315
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,550
Garcia,can you identify how many members are in this particular edf chapter?

316
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:19,200
Uh,it looks like  a hundred to 150.

317
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:21,220
-What are you doing?!
-It's not opening!

318
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,550
-I'm scared,dad!I'm scared!
-Doors open--open!

319
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,390
Start the car!I'm trying-- it won't start.

320
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,430
Hurry!

321
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:30,580
I'm scared,dad,I'm scared!

322
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:32,090
Come on,get out!

323
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,480
Get out!Keep trying!Keep trying!

324
00:19:33,515 --> 00:19:36,460
Come on!Keep trying-- what are you doing?!

325
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,520
Thomas R. Dunleavy,dunbrook development group.

326
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,520
On the list.

327
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:11,170
Ok,I'm sending you a file on the edf leader.

328
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,710
Evan abby,41,5'11'',185 pounds.

329
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,960
Thanks,garcia.

330
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,610
Pardon me for asking,sir,but how do we even know he's involved?

331
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,040
We don'T.That's why we're interviewing abby at the crime scene.

332
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,710
If he is the leader of the edf,

333
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,690
his reaction to all this should tell us exactly what we need to know.

334
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,080
Where do you guys want it?

335
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,530
This is the spot.

336
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,490
When he arrives,

337
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,320
bring the fake bodies right past us

338
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,490
nice and slow.

339
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,470
I want him to get a good look.

340
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,820
Remind me to never play poker with you guys.

341
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,600
So what do we have on this guy?

342
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,780
-Hotch!
-What?

343
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,600
What do we have on the edf leader?

344
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:53,330
Evan abby,41,divorced,father of liam,14.

345
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,760
Environmental engineer,

346
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,450
does consults on real estate projects,

347
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:59,470
has worked with every company on the edf list.

348
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,400
Can't wait to meet him.

349
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,950
Mr. Abby,these are special agents jason gideon and aaron hotchner.

350
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:12,340
Thank you for coming.

351
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,570
Um,agent prentiss said you needed my help with a L.U.S.T.Related fire?

352
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:18,170
Yeah,it's pretty bad.

353
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,830
Tom,brad,katie dunleavy.

354
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,560
All burned to death.

355
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,310
Whew.

356
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,020
Uh so,um,where's the--

357
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:29,680
uh,where's the leaking storage tank?

358
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:30,780
Katie was only 12.

359
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,460
You've got a son about that age,don't you?

360
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,130
Did you know tom dunleavy?

361
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,620
What is this?

362
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:42,380
He worked for dunbrook development group.

363
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,260
Why are you asking me these questions?

364
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:45,880
You posted dunbrook on your website.

365
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,410
My website?

366
00:21:47,445 --> 00:21:49,430
Look,I came down here voluntarily

367
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:51,750
because I was told you needed help with a L.U.S.T.Related fire.

368
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:53,240
Three fires .

369
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,370
three families

370
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,380
three fathers

371
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,600
who worked for companies posted on your edf website.

372
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:01,630
All burned to death.

373
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,250
You worked for these companies-- every one on your list.

374
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,170
Are you accusing me of a crime?

375
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,910
What do you think?

376
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:10,140
Mr. Abby,I support your cause.

377
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,060
But I reject these methods.

378
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,690
I don't know what cause or methods you're referring to.

379
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:16,700
You created the site,

380
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,800
you posted the list,you're the leader of the edf.

381
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,000
Well,if you could prove that,we wouldn't be having this conversation,would we?

382
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,410
Mr. Abby,people are dying.

383
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,510
Children,mr. Abby.

384
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,920
We know edf's strategy has always supported violence.

385
00:22:29,955 --> 00:22:32,970
I'm asking you,has edf's strategy changed?

386
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,810
No.It hasn'T.

387
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,470
He could barely look at this.

388
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,140
A serial arsonist wouldn't be able to peel his eyes away.

389
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,580
He's hiding somethinG.

390
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:50,820
More than just his support for the edf.

391
00:22:50,855 --> 00:22:51,800
Hey,it occurred to me

392
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,760
if all I knew about the edf was that they went around burning down suv dealerships

393
00:22:56,795 --> 00:22:59,000
and housing developments

394
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:00,510
well,that's a common misconception.

395
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,000
That's my point.

396
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,200
What if our profile is right--

397
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:06,660
and the unsub held the same misconception?

398
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:07,620
He wants to fit in,

399
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,140
he wants people around him to appreciate what he does,

400
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,250
isn't it possible that the unsub joined the edf  thinking--

401
00:23:14,285 --> 00:23:15,850
it was an arsonist's club?

402
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:17,530
Sure.That's possible.

403
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,700
If we give abby our unsub's profile could he help us identify him?

404
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:22,950
We can't give abby the profile,

405
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,660
not until we find out what he's hiding.

406
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,680
Still,it seems abby's our best chance of finding the unsub.

407
00:23:28,715 --> 00:23:30,140
You want abby or the ex-wife?

408
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,500
Abby.

409
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,360
At berkeley 20 years ago,

410
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,670
evan was a different person.

411
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,900
In every way.

412
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,820
Warm,funny,honest.

413
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,820
Even naive.

414
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,810
What happened?

415
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,210
We had school loans,

416
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,270
I got pregnant

417
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,850
his job

418
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,490
evan was an environmental consultant.

419
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,600
Builder's hired him to help them
clean up their sites.

420
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,950
Make sure they were up to epa code.

421
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,810
Evan thought they hired him
to do the right thing.

422
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,650
- Did he?
- No.

423
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,850
Developers don't care about mercury
in the groundwater.

424
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,900
They just want to pass inspection as fast
and cheap as possible.

425
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,440
He had a budget,

426
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,490
it was never enough,

427
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,750
but they didn't care how he spent it,

428
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,290
as long as they passed inspection.

429
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,210
Well,how did evan deal with that?

430
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,840
He drank.

431
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,900
It got bad.

432
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,570
How bad?

433
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,700
I thought he might hurt himself.

434
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,720
I didn't know if he could live with it.

435
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,110
How's his relationship with your son liam?

436
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,780
He doesn't have one.

437
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,550
I had to threaten to take him to court
to get him to pay child support.

438
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,350
Must've either scared the hell out of him
or really pissed him off.

439
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,440
Why's that?

440
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,740
Because every sunday night
for the past 9 months

441
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,860
he tosses $2,000 cash
through the mail slot.

442
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,240
He left long before I threw him out.

443
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,660
I don't know.

444
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,440
I will.

445
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,400
But I promise
I'm going to give it to you.

446
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,250
Ok.

447
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,340
I love you,too.

448
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,250
Everything ok?

449
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,280
Yeah.

450
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,910
You know,
for a guy claiming to be innocent,

451
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,730
he's acting pretty guilty.

452
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,420
I never underestimate the effect being confronted
by the fbi will have on a suspect.

453
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,620
I don't think he's effected,

454
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,080
I think he's freaked out.

455
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,460
In the time we've been watching him,

456
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,080
he's packed his belongings into
cardboard boxes,

457
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,710
hit his attorney's office and 4 banks.

458
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,910
It does look like
he's getting ready to run.

459
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,570
The question is,what do we do?

460
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,570
For now,nothing.

461
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,410
We just watcH.

462
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,350
All those people?

463
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,080
No booze or music?

464
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,750
That's either a very lame
going away party or an edf meeting.

465
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,150
We need to set surveillance up.
Grab your camera.

466
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,250
Where should I set up?

467
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,300
Right here.

468
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,970
If he's hiding something,

469
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,850
we don't have a warrant,

470
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,250
we don't have supplies,

471
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,970
you want to intimidate him.

472
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,680
I want another chance to find out
what he's hiding.

473
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,470
Ok

474
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,380
smile,everybody.

475
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,480
it looks like intimidation worked.

476
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,470
So what is it with you?

477
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,900
Shoving a bunch of dead kids
in my face wasn't enough?

478
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,400
Thought I needed a little harassment,too?

479
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,100
It's over,all right?

480
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,330
I denounced the fires
and the people responsible for them,

481
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,230
and I just disbanded the edf.

482
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,940
If the edf had nothing to do with the fires,

483
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,250
why would you disband?

484
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,650
Do you have kids,agent hotchner?

485
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,920
I have a son like you.

486
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,040
Good.Then I'm gonna tell you this,

487
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,490
one father to another.

488
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,760
I started the edf for my son.

489
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,710
And yours.

490
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,670
Not to have some other guy's son
burn to death.

491
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,480
Hope your pictures come out.

492
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,830
Prentiss,does he look like
he weighs 185 to you?

493
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,580
165,maybe.

494
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,640
Why would he hold a meeting
when he knew we were watching?

495
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,030
He wanted us to see it.

496
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,470
He wanted to make sure that we saw him
trying to do the right thing.

497
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,080
You don't believe him?

498
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,510
I don't know.

499
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,820
He seemed pretty angry for a guy
who's trying to do the right thing.

500
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,260
That's why we need to
get those photos to garcia.

501
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,580
What do you mean?

502
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,370
Either he's angry because
he's guilty of a wrongdoing,

503
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,220
or he's angry because his attempts to do the
right thing with the edf have gotten people killed,

504
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,370
but either way  the arsonist was here tonight.

505
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,030
Yeah,I'll show you a sick,deranged coward,

506
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,150
you ignorant son of a bitch.

507
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,870
Deranged coward.

508
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,210
I'll show you a deranged coward.

509
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,750
The victim was a cpa.

510
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:01,000
Greg ballou,39,white,6-feet,handsome.

511
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,240
He was talking to his fiance
on his cell when it happened.

512
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,290
This kerosene is the same exact type
used in the other fires.

513
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,490
Well,hotch had abby under surveillance
at the time of the attack,

514
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,880
so we know abby's not the unsub.

515
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,200
Witnesses put the gold sedan here,

516
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,290
so we know this is our guy.

517
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,220
And given that the attack occurred
less than 30 minutes

518
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,410
after the edf meeting and abby's house
is less than a mile from here.

519
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,590
Chances are the unsub
was at abby's house.

520
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,930
He parked some distance away
and walked.

521
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,440
This victim wasn't even connected
to the edf list.

522
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,730
He was just a guy who looked like
he had a nice life like the others.

523
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,250
The unsub didn't go into a house,

524
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,350
he barely even got out of his car.

525
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,370
There was no planning whatsoever.
Why?

526
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,650
He's evolving.

527
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,790
He's doing it fast.

528
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,060
He's smarter than that.

529
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,030
This was random,impulsive,adolescent.

530
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,850
Like a tantrum.

531
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,760
He's got displaced aggression.

532
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,620
He listens to abby denounce him
and his work,

533
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,240
it enrages him,

534
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,250
and so that's the trigger.

535
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,400
Unsub lashes out immediately.

536
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,230
Well,if he was at abby's
we have him on camera.

537
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,800
It's just a matter of time
before garcia has a suspect list.

538
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,900
He's evolving too rapidly.

539
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,750
He's gonna attack again soon.

540
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,170
We're gonna have to trust
this abby guy with the profile.

541
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,130
Let's go.

542
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,710
He's leaving,
but not the way we thought.

543
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,480
What do you mean?

544
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,260
He's seeing his oncologist.

545
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,760
Ohh,god.

546
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,910
It makes sense.

547
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,590
The banks,

548
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,080
the attorney.

549
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,210
He's putting his affairs in order.

550
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,310
Yeah.

551
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,140
Which one is your son?

552
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,710
Catcher.

553
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,080
Does he know you're here?

554
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,550
I think so,
but we have an arrangement.

555
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,900
What's that?

556
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,190
We both pretend I'm not.

557
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,460
I'm sorry.

558
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,550
How long do you have?

559
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,260
6 months would be a miracle.

560
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,310
And you haven't told anyone?

561
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,460
No.

562
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,560
It's leukemia.

563
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,900
Lust can be lethal.

564
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,030
I started the edf right
after I was diagnosed.

565
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,440
How did you know?

566
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,790
My father,when I was in high school

567
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,500
everyone knew he had affairs

568
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,230
even my mother--
but nobody talked about it,

569
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,360
so i decided to confront him.

570
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,610
And I followed him--

571
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,370
the lawyer's,the doctor'S

572
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,290
the banks, the weight-loss,

573
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,560
and it all came back.

574
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,890
He had lung cancer.

575
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,700
Well,you know what benzene is?

576
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,810
I know it causes cancer.

577
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,620
Leukemia.

578
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,920
It's also highly flammable.

579
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,920
They kept it in underground tanks.

580
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,130
It's expensive to clean up--

581
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,350
cheaper to hide.

582
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,690
My specialty.

583
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:20,340
Most of the properties were zoned "cr",

584
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,750
commercial--
warehouses where nobody worked,

585
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,210
so what's the harm,right?

586
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:34,370
I just found out that one of those jobs
was sold and rezoned "es".

587
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,170
Elementary school.

588
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,470
And you didn't report it?

589
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,360
I report it,

590
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,030
they come after me

591
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,240
and I leave nothing for my son.

592
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,830
That's why I started the edf,

593
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,440
the L.U.S.T. List.

594
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,590
I was trying to do the right thing.

595
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,230
You still can.

596
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,520
I don't know who he is.

597
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,290
He was at your house last night

598
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,740
and he was angry.

599
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,660
Everybody was angry last night,

600
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,190
they were furious
that I shut it all down.

601
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,590
He was angry for a different reason.

602
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,430
What you said enraged him.

603
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,740
But he's a coward,
he wouldn't confront you.

604
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,190
He was probably the only one
who wasn't angry at the time.

605
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,470
He didn't express anything

606
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,320
until after he left.

607
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,640
Vincent stiles.

608
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:32,910
Thank you.

609
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,020
Vincent stiles.

610
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,660
Abby's leaving, keep a trail on him

611
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,650
until we have stiles just to be sure.

612
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,320
Copy that.I have abby.

613
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,800
Clear.

614
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Gideon,he's not here.

615
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,620
He got the company names
from the edf website,

616
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,140
then he watched the offices until
he found employees that suited his taste.

617
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,820
He just left.

618
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,960
A neighbor saw him leave.

619
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,640
He's a pharmaceutical sales rep,

620
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,600
he's been living here
since his divorce 6 weeks ago.

621
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,810
That's the stressor.

622
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,590
Yeah,talk to me.

623
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,720
Yeah,I'll let him know.

624
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,710
What?

625
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,930
Abby shook the tail we had on him.

626
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,050
Bet you were afraid I wasn't coming,huh?

627
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,500
Look.

628
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,810
Those things that I said about you

629
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,740
I'm sorry.

630
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,660
I had to say them.

631
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,030
I know  you're an artist.

632
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,420
A genius.

633
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,010
I appreciate your true value.

634
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,580
So what,
you just came here to apologize?

635
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,620
No  I came here
because I respect your talent.

636
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,630
And I want to take full advantage of it.

637
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,640
Garcia checked abby's phone records,

638
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,870
and he called stiles right
after I left him.

639
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,320
Well,you saw someone abby identified with.

640
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,010
I can't killers, I save lives, I'm a hero,

641
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,640
until my key hits my front door,

642
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,530
and then i'm just the father
and the husband who's never there.

643
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,950
I got that one.

644
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,530
Here's the thing.

645
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,180
When I'm home,

646
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,480
I'm in this silent panic

647
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,650
because I know that I have to be
as good as I can as fast as I can,

648
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,070
because any minute the phone
is gonna ring and my time is up,

649
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,700
and that panic is exactly
what I saw in abby.

650
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,700
Good. You're abby.

651
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,380
You're a dead man walking,
you gotta make this right.

652
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,260
You have no time left, how do you do it?

653
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,190
Come on,don't think about it,
you know the answer.What is it?

654
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,270
I'd stop him.

655
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,300
How?

656
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,690
I'd burn him.

657
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,820
The same way he killed them.

658
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,370
I'd do it where nobody could get hurt.

659
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,710
Which is why I would call it in first.

660
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,750
We got a 9-1-1 anonymous tip
for a fire in the harbor district.

661
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,490
Is it a warehouse?

662
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,380
Yeah.6000 san alameda.

663
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,500
- Can you call garcia?
- She's right here.

664
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,560
Hey,garcia, can you check the zoning code
on a warehouse at 6000 san alameda?

665
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,010
Yeah,I certainly can.

666
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,030
The sfpd chopper circled the harbor twice.

667
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,330
There's no sign of fire.

668
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,000
Ok,6000 san alameda
is a commercial storage facility.

669
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,710
But it looks like the property was just sold

670
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,570
and the lot was approved
for zone conversion.

671
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,540
"Cr" to "es".

672
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,390
Yeah,that's right.

673
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,140
"Cr",commercial,what's "es"?

674
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,520
Elementary school,and there's
a leaking benzene tank underneath it.

675
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,770
It's not a false alarm.

676
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,090
But there's no fire there.

677
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,380
There's about to be.

678
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,600
I started without you.

679
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,140
This is how you do it, right?

680
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,690
Well,fire's a fire.

681
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,980
Once it gets going,
it don't matter.

682
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,500
That's not--

683
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,970
that's not really true,though,is it?

684
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

685
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,980
There's something missing from this scenario,
don't you think?

686
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,850
I'm sorry, you lost me.

687
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,230
The innocent family.

688
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,240
You know, the victims.

689
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,570
That's what the suit's for, right?

690
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:16,920
So you can see the terror
on their faces as they burn?

691
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,030
But of course,then,
you're here to kill me,right?

692
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,620
You're dead right.

693
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,240
We can't put a benzene fire
out with water.

694
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,830
All water does is spread it around,

695
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,220
it burns too hot.

696
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,910
Contaminates the ground table.

697
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:43,970
So we'll let it burn.

698
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,780
We exhaust the fuel.

699
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,800
All we can do is cordon it off,
stop it from spreading,

700
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,140
and let the benzene burn out.

701
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,080
Do you understand?

702
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,110
Yeah,I got it.

703
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,530
Does hotchner?

704
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,090
Yeah,what's up?

705
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,560
Don't put me on speaker.

706
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,950
Just listen.

707
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:01,390
Well,you know,
you can go ahead and shoot me,

708
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,900
and then you set this place
off like a bomb.

709
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,030
No?

710
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,110
you know,this suit can handle
over 1,500 degrees.

711
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,980
Benzene burns so fast,

712
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,400
I won't go through half my air
before it goes out.

713
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,540
Oh,you won't even go through that much.

714
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,180
See,benzene burns at twice that.

715
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,010
What are you doing?

716
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,990
The right thing.

717
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,050
Why?

718
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,860
You didn't know any of those people.

719
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,070
Neither did you!

720
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,470
This fire will spread!

721
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,980
Fire department's on its way.

722
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,690
They can't fight a benzene fire.

723
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,880
They'll contain it.

724
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,020
Seriously,what--

725
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,110
how do you plan
on getting out of here?

726
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,200
I don'T.

727
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:12,100
**********6000 block of san alameda

728
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,550
Morgan,what are you doing?

729
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:24,370
Hotch,it's too late, man,
I'm sorry.

730
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,620
Hotch--stop!

731
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,050
Stop,stop!

732
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,160
He's burning to death
and we're just gonna stand here?

733
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,890
Look at it, man! It's over!

734
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,900
He wanted his death
to mean somethinG.

735
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,020
I found this in abby's car.

736
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,890
Gandhi said,
"live as if you were to die tomorrow.

737
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,790
Learn as if you were to live forever."

738
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,100
- Here he is.
- Thanks.

739
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,170
Mom,what's going on?

740
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,520
It's ok,liam.

741
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,430
Liam?

742
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,040
My name's aaron.

743
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,000
I was a friend of your dad'S.

744
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,800
I saw you with him at my practice.

745
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,030
That's right.

746
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,050
You weren't at his funeral.

747
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,610
I couldn't be there.

748
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,180
I had to be with my family.

749
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:07,430
But I was thinking of him  and you.

750
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,060
Your dad asked me to give you this.

751
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,640
Why you?

752
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:20,990
I don't know.

753
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,390
Maybe because I was young
when my dad died.

754
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,760
Anyway,you may have some questions
some day,

755
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:35,400
and,uh  please feel free to call me,

756
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,260
I'll do everything I can to answer them.
