1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,289
Previously on Criminal Minds...

2
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:05,972
Please, I don't want it.
I don't want it.

3
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:22,972
What is the matter with you ? 

4
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:25,260
What do you mean, what's
the matter with me ? 

5
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:28,442
Really ?  Oh, in the months
that you know me,

6
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,127
Hey, no offense, Emily, but...

7
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:33,314
You don't really know what
you're talking about, do you ? 

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,589
Earlier this morning katrina
crashed into the gulf coast,

9
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,066
As many houses are being destroyed.

10
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:50,718
Are you listening to me, pop ? 

11
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:53,600
The buses are filling up.

12
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:56,481
Dad.

13
00:00:57,677 --> 00:00:59,363
What the hell am I missing here ? 

14
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:04,338
The... Whole world's 
gonna be underwater.

15
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,529
I got another letter, Billy.

16
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,104
They're opening the superdome.

17
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,883
I'll be damned.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,070
... Please, I'm begging you, pop.

19
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,856
Pop ? 

20
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:58,031
Behavioral analysis unit

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,605
Who killed at least
3 men pre-Katrina.

22
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,880
Believed that the serial
killer died in the storm.

23
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:11,453
A fourth body was found in
the french quarter last night.

24
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:15,032
Throat slashed, eviscerated.

25
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:17,221
A year and a half ?  That's a
long cooling-Off period.

26
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:19,907
He claims to be.

27
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:23,386
The head detective on the case.

28
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:26,572
He died in Katrina.

29
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:29,454
His son is actually
leading the case now.

30
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,735
Well, we need to pour over the evidence

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,212
Katrina washed everything away.

32
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,085
Witness statements.

33
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:44,865
So, basically, all we have
to go on is the latest victim ? 

34
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:46,456
Yeah.

35
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:47,944
Until he kills again.

36
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,510
Criminal minds 218

37
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:23,742
Robert Kennedy once said,

38
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:29,610
Not a guide by which to live."

39
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:32,891
Hey, Reid.

40
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:34,880
What's goin' on up there ? 

41
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:38,659
From Las Vegas... Ethan.

42
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,044
I'm pretty sure he lives
in New Orleans now.

43
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,325
Grew up competing against each other

44
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,309
Spelling bees, science fairs.

45
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,678
First day at quantico he backed out.

46
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:54,966
He probably just couldn't take the heat.

47
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,550
It's not really for us
to judge, is it ? 

48
00:03:59,042 --> 00:03:59,837
Right.

49
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:01,625
My bad.

50
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,995
Dating back to early august 2005.

51
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:10,476
He killed 3 times,
he stopped for 18 months,

52
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,257
We should have garcia run a list

53
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,436
Anyone who spent the last year
and a half doing time.

54
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:23,403
What is the victimology
in killing a mechanic,

55
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:28,174
With ages ranging from 22 to 45 ? 

56
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:33,346
They just don't seem to have
very much in common.

57
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:38,316
Which is notorious for muggings
off the main drag.

58
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:43,585
A slaughter like this takes time.

59
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:47,962
And then torturing and mutilating them

60
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:51,043
The city's barely back to life.

61
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,431
Something like this could
cripple its psyche.

62
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:57,607
Well, with no case file there's
only one place we can start.

63
00:04:58,801 --> 00:04:59,795
At square one.

64
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,351
You must be B.A.U.

65
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,241
Bill Lamontagne.

66
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:13,318
Well, ok, then.

67
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:15,205
I pictured you different.

68
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,292
Uh, these are agents
Gideon and Morgan.

69
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,063
Appreciate you guys being here.

70
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,948
My daddy was too stubborn
to ever ask for any help.

71
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:31,114
I understand you received a letter.

72
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:34,796
My daddy received 2 letters.

73
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:38,180
They passed it on to me.

74
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,849
It's a detailed account
of what he did to the body.

75
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,126
4 layers of fatty tissue
sliced through like butter.

76
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:49,314
I only seen that 3 other times.

77
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:52,692
Nah. You don't forget victims like this.

78
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:54,384
It's like they were dissected.

79
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,269
This is New Orleans.

80
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:01,543
The victim has no defense wounds.

81
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:10,790
No hesitation marks or rapid thrusts.

82
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:13,474
Almost procedural.

83
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:18,149
So you think he might have
some medical training ? 

84
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:21,628
And leave each one intact ? 

85
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:25,208
Anyone we could speak with ? 

86
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:30,278
Left to collect dust in storage.

87
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:34,454
It's a wonder I still have room.

88
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:43,504
It'd be pretty easy to hide out
in one of these alcoves,

89
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,375
Yeah, all 4 murders occurred
within a 10-Block radius

90
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,753
On any given night, there'd
have to be thousands of people

91
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,931
Tens of thousands.

92
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:58,519
I worked the quarter.

93
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:02,794
Every sunday I'd get off
work around sunrise,

94
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:06,174
My daddy'd be waiting
for me at my house.

95
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:08,498
Make me drive him uptown to Frankie
and Johnny's for poorboys.

96
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,438
Called it communing with New Orleans.

97
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:14,426
Did your father tell you anything else
about this case that we should know ? 

98
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:16,814
He tried to.

99
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:19,299
But you guys should
see that for yourself.

100
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,261
This wall is still standing
where daddy carved the message

101
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:34,414
There's no doubt he's still
working from the grave.

102
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:39,782
"Jones." That name mean
anything to you ? 

103
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:41,476
No. I ran it through the database

104
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,252
And you can imagine
how many hits I got.

105
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,527
But in your dad's final moments,

106
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,292
Learned how to play
the drums in this house,

107
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:58,280
Grew up with 2 dogs in this house.

108
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:02,056
All it's gonna be now is the word
"jones" carved into that wall.

109
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:04,243
Detective, if he had
written the unsub's name,

110
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:07,725
Jones is the one
piece of the puzzle

111
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:11,102
He trusted you to figure out the rest.

112
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:14,189
But I've pored over
it a thousand times

113
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,553
I can't get it out of my head.

114
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:24,728
You ok ? 

115
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:26,816
Yeah.

116
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:29,301
I just don't want to disappoint him.

117
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,160
Is that the letter from the unsub ? 

118
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:38,351
I'm back with a vengeance.

119
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:42,129
The last guy made it easy,
being out so late,

120
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,107
I enjoyed slicing around his organs.

121
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:49,784
He was asking to be ripped,
don't you think, boss ? 

122
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,375
Hey.

123
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:54,657
Ok.

124
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:58,137
To say that the victims
were asking to be killed

125
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:01,319
Most sexual sadists rationalize
their own behavior

126
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:05,196
But there was no evidence
of sexual assault in the autopsy.

127
00:09:05,694 --> 00:09:07,883
He could be a homosexual male

128
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,951
Every kill he's acting
out a fantasy of revenge.

129
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:16,233
What if he's trying to act
out something else ?  Like what ? 

130
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:20,111
What are you talking about ? 

131
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:23,392
All 4 victims were found with
their throats slashed, eviscerated,

132
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:28,066
Investigators taunted with
the letters addressed to "boss."

133
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,051
The only difference is that
case was 100 years ago

134
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:34,628
Jack the ripper.

135
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:36,714
The unsub wants us to think

136
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:41,590
Please.Don't

137
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:01,676
So the 3 of you were out
together last night ? 

138
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:04,360
Mark had just paid his tab at one bar

139
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:06,942
You guys get in any trouble ? 

140
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:09,035
Drunken brawl ? 
Anyone get out of hand ? 

141
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,220
We were just out
to have fun, you know ? 

142
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:12,808
Minded our own business.

143
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:15,494
Maybe upset her boyfriend ? 

144
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:16,488
No, sir.

145
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:18,677
He struck out like we all did.

146
00:10:19,174 --> 00:10:20,169
Thanks, guys.

147
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:25,837
Getting hard to keep up
with this guy.

148
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:28,721
Well, if he's mimicking
Jack the ripper,

149
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,499
He terrorized london for months

150
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,877
I'd appreciate it
if you'd gather your men.

151
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:38,266
We'd like to give you a profile
of who you're up against.

152
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:41,350
The offender we're looking
for is friendly,

153
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,232
Agile, somewhere between 30 and 35.

154
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,021
He'll allure with charm

155
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,711
And kill with rage.

156
00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:49,500
We believe he's murdering men

157
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,379
This unsub suffers
from low self-Esteem,

158
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,459
He dresses impeccably
to feed the facade.

159
00:10:57,955 --> 00:10:58,949
Jack the ripper himself

160
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,416
Whereas this offender is organized,

161
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:05,909
Calculating.

162
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,094
He might even stalk
his victims for days

163
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:15,751
We believe this killer identifies
with Jack the ripper

164
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:20,626
Maybe through years
of child abuse...

165
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:23,510
Or some catastrophic event.

166
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:27,086
Because he overcompensates
to hide his insecurities,

167
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:32,158
And since we think he's had
medical training,

168
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:37,129
Please be careful.

169
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:38,125
For this unsub,

170
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,895
He's certainly already proven
he knows the terrain.

171
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:02,385
Jeez ! 

172
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:04,474
Reid, you scared me.

173
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:08,252
Yeah, whatever helps
you sleep at night.

174
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:11,535
I'm glad you called.
It's good to see you.

175
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,025
You, too.

176
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:15,015
Let's get a drink.

177
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:19,686
Prentiss.

178
00:12:20,683 --> 00:12:22,773
Jack the ripper took from
one of his victims ? 

179
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:24,956
Besides, well, you know, her life ? 

180
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:27,443
Mmm.

181
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,334
Tick tock...

182
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,319
Tick tock.

183
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:33,211
I don't know.

184
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:34,901
A kidney.

185
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:37,585
How horrify ingly
fantastic is that ? 

186
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:43,451
Just that I found an unsolved murder
that happened 4 months ago

187
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:46,136
With the same M.O.,

188
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,021
That very organ.

189
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,400
I amaze myself.

190
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:55,579
Great work.

191
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:57,274
What's that ? 

192
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:02,144
A lot of Katrina refugees
relocated there.

193
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:05,327
He removed the kidney
just like Jack the ripper.

194
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:06,520
Call Reid and Morgan.

195
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,708
I want the 3 of you on a plane
to Texas tonight.

196
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:20,043
So...

197
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,131
Are you gonna ask the question ? 

198
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:24,219
What question ? 

199
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:26,806
It's me here.

200
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,893
We haven't talked
to each other in years.

201
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:31,280
Ask the question.

202
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:35,654
Why did you quit after only
one day of fbi training ? 

203
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:38,641
Well...

204
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:43,210
I'm sure you've
considered the evidence,

205
00:13:44,503 --> 00:13:46,292
Analyzed the signs.

206
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,371
You were battling what's
your own demons.

207
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:54,644
Not bad. Not bad.

208
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:58,224
Those days, I did prefer
Jack Daniel's to Jeff Dahmer.

209
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,508
They both weigh on
your soul eventually.

210
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:04,490
Sorry

211
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:09,959
The bat phone.

212
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:13,937
Let me ask you this, Ethan.

213
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:16,024
Do you ever regret it ? 

214
00:14:17,913 --> 00:14:19,900
You know, I may not be
changing the world, but...

215
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,692
My music makes me happy.

216
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:25,370
It doesn't take a profiler
to see that you're not.

217
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,239
It's not easy. And it's not...

218
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:34,022
I... don't think you'd believe some of
the things that I've seen.

219
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,404
John Coltrane.

220
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:39,393
He was a genius, too.

221
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,567
But most people think
it was the booze and heroin

222
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,954
What are you tryingsay ? 

223
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,544
You look like hell.

224
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:50,327
I'm fine.

225
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,115
I'm a jazz musician
in New Orleans.

226
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:59,079
This may be the one time
I can tell you something

227
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:00,671
That you don't already know.

228
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:03,555
That might help you forget,

229
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:05,244
But it won't make it go away.

230
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:06,634
And if I can tell...

231
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:10,912
You're surrounded by some of
the best minds in the world,

232
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:13,398
And if you think they don't notice...

233
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,486
Well...

234
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,477
For a genius,

235
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,958
That's just dumb.

236
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,517
Hey. Hey.

237
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:31,891
Where's Reid ? 

238
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:34,575
I was hoping he was with you.

239
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,459
I did, 4 times. Nothing.

240
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:42,034
The victim's fiancee is expecting us.

241
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:43,522
What are we supposed to do ? 

242
00:15:47,107 --> 00:15:48,099
We got one option.

243
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:49,591
Wheels up.

244
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,456
Thank you.

245
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:56,947
It's not right.

246
00:15:57,545 --> 00:16:00,529
The french quarter's one of the only
parts of the city that dodged Katrina.

247
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,516
Now there's a serial killer loose.

248
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:03,812
It's a small area,

249
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:07,092
We'll find him.

250
00:16:10,274 --> 00:16:12,658
You always drink while
you're still on the clock ? 

251
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,350
This is New Orleans, honey.

252
00:16:14,846 --> 00:16:16,039
It's a cultural thing.

253
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:17,733
Where are you from ? 

254
00:16:19,323 --> 00:16:20,414
Pennsylvania.

255
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:22,602
I take it the folks

256
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,683
Are a little rigid about
the rules up that way.

257
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:29,764
Well, if it makes you feel better...

258
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:33,737
We'll play it
Pennsylvania style tonight.

259
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:39,108
I just hate that this guy
has a leg up on us, you know ? 

260
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:43,385
I promise, as soon as my team
knows anything, we'll hear.

261
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:48,157
Why aren't you married ? 

262
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:55,118
Uh, that involves this case how ? 

263
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:58,098
I'm just flirtin'.

264
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:01,381
It's unprofessional.

265
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,170
You don't have to answer that.

266
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,364
Excuse me.

267
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:06,552
Compliments of the woman
in the blue top.

268
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:14,508
Wow. That was... bold.

269
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:17,190
She might have thought
we were just working.

270
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,175
We are.

271
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:22,560
Are you jealous ? 

272
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,141
No. I just... I...

273
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:28,725
I'm surprised, that's all.

274
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:33,498
You haven't had much practice, huh ? 

275
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:36,483
It's a culture thing.

276
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:38,170
You see.

277
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:40,459
There you go.

278
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:42,748
Everybody kept sayg

279
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:48,909
You just never think
it's gonna happen to you.

280
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:52,093
The report said that your fiance

281
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:55,971
On the night he was killed.

282
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:59,450
We were supposed
to be married in october.

283
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:03,527
He was just out
celebrating that with friends.

284
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:06,015
Was there anyone at Leonard's
bachelor party

285
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:09,792
We all grew up together.

286
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,579
They're like family to me.

287
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:14,166
Whether they met
somebody out, you know,

288
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:18,142
They're a rowdy bunch.

289
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:20,830
And they'd party with anybody.

290
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,293
Each of the last 2 victims
was traveling in a group.

291
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,277
Both were drinking, both
in public arenas, bar-Hopping.

292
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,133
It like when a lion preys
upon an antelope.

293
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,022
You lost me.

294
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:42,606
That's because you,
Emily Prentiss,

295
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,582
Oh, scratch that.
You totally lost me.

296
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,255
The antelope travel in packs.

297
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,140
So the lion just sits and waits.

298
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,626
Waits for just one of the antelope

299
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:00,004
So when he's alone,

300
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:02,391
Vulnerable, and completely unprotected,

301
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:04,182
That's when the lion strikes.

302
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:07,361
Wait a minute. Her move ? 

303
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:09,950
That's gonna make a straight man

304
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,024
And it'll make him leave every time.

305
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:19,193
One of the victims was out
for his bachelor party.

306
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:21,982
Another one out with just the guys.

307
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:23,373
What's the only temptation

308
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:28,245
J.J.

309
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,823
Ok.

310
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:33,713
Yeah, he's right here with me.

311
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:36,796
Thanks.

312
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,082
What's going on ? 

313
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:52,804
Hey.

314
00:19:57,581 --> 00:20:00,070
We're not making a media
spectacle out of this.

315
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,061
People need to know that
this killer is a woman.

316
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:05,244
What ? 

317
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,035
Listen.

318
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,521
Tourists are just starting
to filter back here.

319
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:11,018
That's not the issue.

320
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,590
Besides, we'll be playing
right into her hands.

321
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,270
Look, um...

322
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:22,760
I'm trying not to go
above your head here.

323
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:25,048
Yeah.

324
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:27,534
I got that.

325
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:34,002
Hey, you guys are
back from Galveston ? 

326
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:35,798
First light this
morning. Where were you ? 

327
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:37,686
I was out with a friend.
I already told you.

328
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,478
I called you 4 times.

329
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:41,267
I didn't have any cell
phone reception,

330
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:44,949
Right.

331
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:46,541
What's going on ? 

332
00:20:48,236 --> 00:20:49,329
Our unsub's a woman.

333
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,110
We just found another
body in the quarter.

334
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,094
Throat's been cut.

335
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:57,985
He's been disemboweled, too.

336
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,465
Reeks of booze.

337
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:04,057
It's more than a pattern.

338
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:06,348
Only this time he cut
off the earlobe.

339
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:09,432
What do you mean ? 

340
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:11,323
In one letter
of correspondence,

341
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:14,407
Of his next victim.

342
00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:15,802
He did.

343
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:20,676
So she's gonna kill again
by the end of the day.

344
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,453
Basically, you have 2 types.

345
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,040
Cold, calculating.

346
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:29,434
Preys on men for money.

347
00:21:31,026 --> 00:21:32,020
It's more likely
we're dealing with

348
00:21:33,513 --> 00:21:35,105
Motivated by paranoia and fear,

349
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:38,888
Our unsub's organized.
She follows a routine.

350
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,952
And suggests that they consummate
the evening in an alley.

351
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:47,842
We need to be in those streets.

352
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:50,433
Office just brought me this.

353
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:53,318
Dear boss,

354
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:56,102
By now I have rid the
world of one more.

355
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,691
So many men, so little time.

356
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:00,779
I hope you don't mind the mess.

357
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,373
They make is so easy,

358
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,556
Yours truly.

359
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:14,815
So were looking for a woman
who will approach men,

360
00:22:15,908 --> 00:22:17,896
Comfortable being
the aggressor, no ? 

361
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,882
And I'm guessing she'd have
to be quite attractive

362
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:28,347
Most of the women are out in groups,

363
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,911
"So many men, so little time."

364
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:38,397
So she's on a quest...

365
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:40,388
To wipe out the race.

366
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,068
Or... the father
who molested her ? 

367
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:46,954
Some people think Jack
the ripper mutilated women

368
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:52,532
For someone so enraged...

369
00:22:53,722 --> 00:22:55,911
This unsub sounds oddly apologetic

370
00:22:59,098 --> 00:22:59,892
Why ? 

371
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:03,475
That might be what
Lamontagne figured out

372
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:08,645
You gotta admit, these guys
are making it pretty easy.

373
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,933
No matter how wasted I was.

374
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:15,317
Testosterone will follow
a woman to Thailand.

375
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:17,806
It's just a fact.

376
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:25,270
Did you give that newest
letter to Reid ? 

377
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,555
He knows that ripper case inside out.

378
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:31,139
He might see something I'm missing.

379
00:23:32,732 --> 00:23:33,527
What is it ? 

380
00:23:34,522 --> 00:23:35,420
Nothing.

381
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:37,208
Come on.

382
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:39,599
You think I'm not aware
something's going on with him ? 

383
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,558
You gonna tell me why you missed
that flight to Galveston ? 

384
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:49,351
I already told you.

385
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:53,032
Right.

386
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:55,619
What ? 

387
00:23:56,614 --> 00:23:58,007
With a better answer,
I'm standing right here.

388
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:03,880
Dark Curls, 3 o'clock.

389
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,875
I got it.

390
00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:10,448
She's eyeing those guys
outside that bar.

391
00:24:15,524 --> 00:24:16,319
Let's go.

392
00:24:23,186 --> 00:24:25,376
Oh !  Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

393
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,668
I hate it when that happens.

394
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:29,356
What can I do to say I'm sorry ? 

395
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:32,540
How about a drink ? 

396
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:35,624
Have a drink. That's cool.

397
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,009
Sure.

398
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,686
Yeah...

399
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:44,977
Yeah.

400
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:45,973
Danny.

401
00:24:46,372 --> 00:24:47,864
You fool.

402
00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:50,651
You dropped your wallet out there.

403
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:52,345
Thanks.

404
00:24:52,644 --> 00:24:53,837
Next drink is on me.

405
00:24:58,511 --> 00:24:59,307
So...

406
00:25:00,205 --> 00:25:01,698
Where are your friends tonight ? 

407
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:04,683
I didn't bring any.

408
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:06,872
They get in the way.

409
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:09,358
Now, see, I like that.

410
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:12,046
'Cause, uh, most girls,

411
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:14,135
They won't go nowhere alone.

412
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:20,506
I'm not most girls.

413
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:33,344
We got nothin'.

414
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:34,836
Well, the day's almost over,

415
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:46,279
Your hair's wet.

416
00:25:53,446 --> 00:25:55,135
Oh, my god !  Aah ! 

417
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:03,793
She's mocking us.

418
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:07,188
And she's true to her word.

419
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:11,578
Do you have any tweezers ? 

420
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,575
Thank you.

421
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:16,466
What is that ? 

422
00:26:22,153 --> 00:26:24,146
It's a note from the unsub,

423
00:26:24,446 --> 00:26:25,641
Addressed to your father.

424
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:29,335
Dear boss,

425
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:32,327
With that sharp tongue
and vulgar hand.

426
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:33,924
Thought you'd like to know

427
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,613
Yours truly.

428
00:26:37,814 --> 00:26:41,107
It's weird. Typically, offenders
write letters to be heard.

429
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:43,202
Jack the ripper bragged
about not being caught.

430
00:26:44,698 --> 00:26:46,191
To flaunt her latest kill,

431
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:51,181
It's possible she considers
herself a vigilante.

432
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:54,273
That the men she's killing
deserve to die.

433
00:26:54,373 --> 00:26:56,467
Or maybe she's contacting your father,

434
00:26:56,668 --> 00:26:58,463
Not because he was the lead detective

435
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,851
Because she believes he'd understand.

436
00:27:03,153 --> 00:27:04,646
You think he knew her somehow ? 

437
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:07,342
Can you think of a woman
in your dad's life

438
00:27:09,435 --> 00:27:11,233
Might be another police officer,

439
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:13,727
I don't know, a prostitute
he helped get off the street ? 

440
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:15,520
He hasn't dealt with prostitutes

441
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:20,908
The unsub wrote,
"he was asking to be ripped."

442
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:26,692
What if she's mirroring
the man who raped her ? 

443
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:29,983
Where are the files stored
from your sex crime division ? 

444
00:27:31,979 --> 00:27:33,278
Most of them were washed away.

445
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:34,977
Did your dad have a partner ? 

446
00:27:35,077 --> 00:27:36,471
Yeah. J.R. Smith.

447
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:38,564
Smitty, they called him.

448
00:27:38,764 --> 00:27:40,061
He might remember something.

449
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,259
Yeah, but they had a falling out.

450
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:43,255
What about ? 

451
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,131
Do you have a problem calling him ? 

452
00:27:52,832 --> 00:27:54,528
Not if it means breaking this case.

453
00:27:59,017 --> 00:28:00,911
May I borrow your hand for a minute ? 

454
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,186
I'll be damned.

455
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,584
The stamp on the victim's hand...

456
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:14,776
It's admittance into the mon cherie.

457
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:16,973
Oh, yeah ? 

458
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:20,861
9 years ago it was called Jones.

459
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:24,556
Bingo.

460
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,647
Get Garcia on the horn.

461
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:31,535
O captain, my captain.

462
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:33,931
Anything. Talk to me.

463
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:37,922
About a rape at a bar called Jones ? 

464
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:41,709
Zilch.

465
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,004
About 9 years ago.

466
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:45,602
Nada.

467
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,599
Ok. Uh...

468
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:51,184
With Jones bar.

469
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:54,381
Bull's-Eye.

470
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:56,474
Police blotter...
Answered a disturbance

471
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,664
February 19, 1998.

472
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,155
You are the best ever.

473
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:06,550
Ohh... and you're the
most perceptive.

474
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,639
Smitty.

475
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:13,634
How are you ? 

476
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,325
I hope you got a good reason

477
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:21,012
Well, I was hoping

478
00:29:21,313 --> 00:29:22,810
You might remember
being called here

479
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,607
Is that a joke ? 

480
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:26,999
No.

481
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,395
My name's Jason Gideon.

482
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,189
We're investigating
the series of murders

483
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,884
What's that got to do with me ? 

484
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:35,579
We need you to tell us
what happened

485
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,274
In this bar.

486
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:42,660
Am I missing something ? 

487
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,458
You really don't know, do you ? 

488
00:29:45,556 --> 00:29:47,452
After that night, your daddy

489
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,043
Why ? 

490
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:52,537
Some girl claimed she was raped.

491
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:55,330
I wasn't buying it.

492
00:29:58,023 --> 00:29:59,322
Brass backed me up.

493
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,617
They ended up transferring
your daddy out

494
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:03,414
What happened here ? 

495
00:30:04,112 --> 00:30:05,706
It almost cost me my career.

496
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:08,995
Do you mind telling us what happened ? 

497
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:11,290
My best recollection,

498
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,183
With 2 friends.

499
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:18,076
One of the boys asked her
if she wanted to play some pool.

500
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:23,564
Witnesses claim she was up
for anything.

501
00:30:29,446 --> 00:30:30,744
She followed him up here ? 

502
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:33,536
His friend not far behind.

503
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:36,730
She knew he was there.

504
00:30:47,704 --> 00:30:49,200
That girl was a tease.

505
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:54,596
Anyway, a couple of guys
were going along with that.

506
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:58,088
Did she yell for help ? 

507
00:30:58,589 --> 00:30:59,587
She said she did.

508
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:02,383
But not a single person
claimed that they heard her.

509
00:31:08,677 --> 00:31:11,170
That's what you registered
as a disturbance ? 

510
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,170
It was mardi gras.

511
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:15,565
Listen to me.

512
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:19,657
To jewel a small city.

513
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:23,056
Anyone exposes themselves
that much in one day

514
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:26,653
But she wanted to press charges.

515
00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:30,247
I knew one of the accused.

516
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:34,142
He didn't need the stink
of that accusation.

517
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:36,538
So you protected a rapist ? 

518
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:39,733
Well, that right there

519
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:43,630
As far as I was concerned,

520
00:31:45,726 --> 00:31:46,527
Are you gonna tell me

521
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,818
You know the serial killer

522
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:57,608
She was your victim.

523
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:02,606
We're trying to find a name.

524
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:05,899
You don't even remember her name ? 

525
00:32:07,296 --> 00:32:10,693
What about the name of the
"good kid" who raped her ? 

526
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,191
Smitty...

527
00:32:16,286 --> 00:32:19,282
You tell me right now or I'll file
a new sanction against you,

528
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:21,977
And I guarantee you,
this time it'll stick.

529
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:28,470
Mr. Tibideaux, we need you
to answer a few questions

530
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,262
I don't know what you're talking about.

531
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,055
It was mardi gras.

532
00:32:41,152 --> 00:32:43,252
Well, then,
I must have been drinking some,

533
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:46,144
'Cause I don't remember a thing.

534
00:32:46,245 --> 00:32:48,646
We just need to know the name...

535
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:52,738
The statute of limitations is up.

536
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:58,332
Someone accuses me of rape,

537
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,728
I'm going to remember her name.

538
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:05,423
I guess she didn't make
that good of an impression.

539
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:09,315
You know, I'm guessing if someone

540
00:33:12,815 --> 00:33:14,908
Then she was probably asking for it.

541
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:18,306
Maybe even liked it.

542
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:21,500
Guy's not giving up anything.

543
00:33:22,797 --> 00:33:23,896
Right after the double murder,

544
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,192
He mutilated and
dismembered Mary Kelly

545
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:31,686
It's believed to be his most
vicious kill of all.

546
00:33:33,582 --> 00:33:35,680
And time to torture his victim
before killing her.

547
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,678
Maybe we're not too late.

548
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:48,266
She murdered these men,

549
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:52,062
And I'm guessing it's only
a matter of time

550
00:33:53,758 --> 00:33:55,355
She really wants to kill.

551
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:57,950
She make an impression now ? 

552
00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:02,146
Work me.

553
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:08,646
1141 Sherman Avenue.

554
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:12,147
It looks like she was
a med student at tulane,

555
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:15,746
Let me guess... February 1998.

556
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:18,745
Yeah. Thanks.

557
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:20,347
We got her.

558
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:27,946
I'm John, by the way.

559
00:34:28,244 --> 00:34:29,044
John.

560
00:34:31,845 --> 00:34:33,342
Take off your clothes.

561
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,940
Sarah Danlin, F.B.I. ! 
Open the door.

562
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,622
The things I'm gonna do to you.

563
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:27,130
Me first.

564
00:35:27,747 --> 00:35:28,766
F.B.I. ! 

565
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:37,645
Clear. Clear.

566
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:39,991
She's not here.

567
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,236
Guys, there are some ripperologists

568
00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:44,989
Was actually killed in a flat

569
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:48,463
I'm going to have Garcia
check Sarah Danlin's

570
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:52,442
But maybe we can trace her room
back to her charge cards.

571
00:36:00,606 --> 00:36:01,627
Aah ! 

572
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:03,869
What the hell was that ? 

573
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:05,299
Shh.

574
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:11,833
You never did explain those
"things" you could do to me.

575
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:15,311
Souvenirs.

576
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:17,151
These are from bars
in the french quarter.

577
00:36:20,215 --> 00:36:22,670
She's trolling for victims
in the place where it all began.

578
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:25,241
The rape isn't the whole story.

579
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:28,520
That contributes to her rage as well.

580
00:36:30,676 --> 00:36:33,340
She was trying to kill
something within herself.

581
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:36,110
Yeah, mama, what do you got ? 

582
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:37,646
Sarah Danlin's visa was charged

583
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,544
Ah, baby girl, you never
disappoint. Thank you.

584
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,291
Royal Ruby Inn.

585
00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:45,850
Let's go

586
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,026
Please ! 

587
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:57,437
I have... I have children.

588
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:01,435
You asked...

589
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,975
FBI ! 

590
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:04,924
Drop the knife. Drop the weapon.

591
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:09,743
Put it down now.

592
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:15,689
What are you waiting for ? 

593
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:20,610
Be such a shame to waste this.

594
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:22,971
Do you want it, too ? 

595
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:27,070
Come on.

596
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:29,631
Don't fight it.

597
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:36,709
Men.

598
00:37:37,014 --> 00:37:40,502
Sarah, my name's
William Lamontagne JR.

599
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,193
You knew my daddy ? 

600
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:49,321
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:37:50,246 --> 00:37:53,318
You trusted him. So trust me.

602
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,419
Where is he ? 

603
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,882
The storm took him.

604
00:38:04,597 --> 00:38:06,136
Come on. It's over.

605
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:14,748
It's over.

606
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,975
Hey.

607
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:33,925
Hey there.

608
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:39,257
The medic says that her
victim's going to be ok.

609
00:38:42,742 --> 00:38:44,485
I heard what you did in there.

610
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,177
Your dad would be really proud.

611
00:38:50,637 --> 00:38:51,869
It's weird.

612
00:38:52,893 --> 00:38:56,174
I spent all this time focused
on closing this case for him...

613
00:38:57,817 --> 00:38:58,942
And now it's over.

614
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:00,686
Yeah.

615
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:04,891
I thought I'd feel happy,
but I just feel lost.

616
00:39:06,736 --> 00:39:08,168
Because you've...

617
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:11,043
And now you're leaving ? 

618
00:39:12,578 --> 00:39:15,861
How will I survive a woman
like you going so far away ? 

619
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:21,705
Well, despite what
you may have heard...

620
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:27,654
Cell phones can be very
good for your health.

621
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,062
See ya.

622
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,312
How'd you find me ? 

623
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,671
You're not all that hard to profile.

624
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:07,745
Your friend is good.

625
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:17,590
I missed that plane on purpose.

626
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:20,769
I know.

627
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:26,098
I'm struggling.

628
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:28,970
Well... anybody who's been through

629
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:32,969
Would.

630
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:34,713
This is all I was groomed for.

631
00:40:37,069 --> 00:40:38,914
I never even considered
another option.

632
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:40,455
Now you're questioning
whether or not

633
00:40:43,736 --> 00:40:44,558
Yeah.

634
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:47,528
I have been playing at this job

635
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:51,736
In one way or another
for almost 30 years.

636
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:54,605
I've felt lost.

637
00:40:56,145 --> 00:40:57,578
I've felt great.

638
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:01,372
I have felt scared,

639
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:03,421
Sick,

640
00:41:05,267 --> 00:41:06,396
And insane.

641
00:41:10,496 --> 00:41:11,626
I don't know.

642
00:41:14,395 --> 00:41:17,570
I guess the day this job stops
gnawing at your soul and...

643
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:24,957
Hands... your hands stop feeling cold...

644
00:41:29,262 --> 00:41:31,210
Maybe that's the time to leave.

645
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:36,440
I guess I just needed
to try to figure out

646
00:41:41,054 --> 00:41:41,873
And ? 

647
00:41:44,951 --> 00:41:46,795
I'll never miss another plane again.

648
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,879
